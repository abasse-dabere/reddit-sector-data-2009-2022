investing,FedEx $FDX - Reason behind weakness?,FedEx stock has been weak since early December (circa 20% weaker Vs highs).  Their last earnings didn't read too badly and they appear to be heavily involved in vaccine distribution. Do people think the weakness in the stock is linked to logistics / parcel delivery sector generally or something specific to FDX? I don't live in the US so have less anecdotal data to go by.

gaming,"I'd like to be able to buy free range, high welfare video games","TL:DR, I'm fed up hearing about awful video game companies and I want a sticker on games guaranteeing that the people who worked on it weren't treated like crap

I'd like to be know when I buy a game that everyone involved with the project has been treated fairly, with respect and paid appropriately

In fact, I wish there was some kind of industry standard which let me know games were made without anyone getting f*cked over so my money could go into a sleazy executive's christmas bonus

I wouldn't buy eggs that come from battery hens, make up tested on animals or clothes made by slaves so I'm not happy supporting companies that put executives and shareholders first and treat everyone else as disposable

I've heard so much in the last year about abusive crunch (cdpr, telltale, ea, rockstar etc etc), sexual abuse (ubisoft), horrible company practise that while still legal is hidiously immoral (EA especially but so many others)

I want a sticker on video games assuring me that the company that made it treated their staff with respect and that pay and working conditions were fair
 

 
Excuse the title, I don't mean to compare the beautiful people who work in the game industry to animals or insinuate that they are commodities


Edit: with respect, highlighting abuse and poor working conditions in other jobs doesn't validate or excuse abuse and poor working conditions in game development

investing,Markets Look Like They‚Äôre in a Bubble. What Do Investors Do Now?,"WSJ Article Below! What is everyone's thought on this?  Ever since the markets recovered from the crash in March, I find all stocks are overpriced but I don't know if this means that we're in bubble. Could just mean investors are optimistic? 

Article starts here:

Markets Look Like They‚Äôre in a Bubble. What Do Investors Do Now?

For once, everyone seems to agree: Much of the market looks like it‚Äôs in a bubble.

Shares of unprofitable companies like GameStop Corp. GME 67.87% and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC 53.65% are rising at a breakneck pace, propelled by a growing army of individual investors. Options activity is surging, bitcoin prices are near records and businesses are rushing to opportunistically sell stock through a flurry of initial public offerings, listings of blank-check companies and follow-on share sales.

To many, valuations look stretched as they hover at levels similar to the highflying days of 2000. That said, high valuations alone don‚Äôt necessarily mean the rally is near its end, investors say. History has shown that markets have often been able to climb far longer than thought possible, be it the dot-com boom in the late 1990s or the dizzying rise in Japanese stocks in the 1980s.

And recently, the broader stock market has been on the decline. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 3.3% last week, though it remains up 66% from its March low. The bubblelike behavior there has mostly been contained to a handful of individual stocks, not larger indexes.

Single-Stock Bubbles

Fast-moving stocks such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings and BlackBerry have raised concerns of excessive exuberance in pockets of the market, while the S&amp;P 500 largely remains unchanged.

An even bigger issue arguing against a marketwide bubble is simple math. With interest rates at rock bottom and further stimulus on the table, many investors are being handsomely rewarded by putting their money into riskier, higher-yielding assets. What‚Äôs more, in many cases earnings have held up or been robust, despite a global pandemic.

That combination of factors has helped push investor optimism. Bullishness on stocks among money managers is at a three-year high, according to a recent Bank of America survey of 194 money managers who oversee $561 billion in assets. Meanwhile, the average share of cash in portfolios‚Äîtypically a safeguard against market turmoil‚Äîis at the lowest level since May 2013.

Nonetheless, investors are trying to identify what could cause bubbles among individual stocks to pop and whether any of the bursts will spread to the wider market. Next week, investors will get a look at fresh data on the manufacturing sector, earnings from Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -0.97% and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG -1.47% and the January employment report.

‚ÄúYou know, this one has checked off all the boxes from a history book,‚Äù said Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of Boston money manager Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo &amp; Co., who predicted the market crashes of 2000 and 2008. Mr. Grantham has been calling the current market overheated since last year.

But even he concedes the timing of a market top is difficult.

‚ÄúWe know each bubble is a little bit different and, with the help of new trading platforms and the internet, it could set more records,‚Äù he said.

Mr. Grantham isn‚Äôt alone in his worries. Nearly 90% of some 627 market professionals think some financial markets are in a bubble, according to a recent Deutsche Bank survey. Meanwhile, Google searches for the term ‚Äústock market bubble‚Äù reached an all-time high in January.

Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust, says his company, concerned about stretched valuations in the U.S., has been gradually shifting more money into stocks elsewhere.

Lately, ‚Äúthe market has not been correlated to the macro picture,‚Äù he said.

New Year Anxieties

Google searches for 'stock market bubble' reached an all-time high in January.

While the moves of some stocks and assets have been jarring, analysts and investors say they aren‚Äôt surprised by the freewheeling, speculative activity in the financial markets.

A super-accommodative Federal Reserve, low interest rates and, more recently, optimism on the coronavirus vaccine and economy have underpinned much of the buying by investors during the past 11 months. Many Americans built up their savings during the pandemic‚Äîand stand to gain even more if Congress follows through on another stimulus package. And the prospect of low returns in most other assets has driven investors to buy stocks more aggressively.

Add to that, more individual investors are trading than ever before. Those investors threw their weight around last year by shocking Wall Street veterans with a rash of irrational stock picks, including Hertz Global Holdings Inc., HTZGQ 7.36% which spiked nearly 900% from its low to its high in the wake of filing for bankruptcy protection.

This year‚Äôs encores have been even more stunning. On Wednesday alone, 24.5 billion shares and 57.1 million options contracts changed hands, a record driven by individual investors, according to Rich Repetto, a managing director in Piper Sandler &amp; Co. GameStop shares more than doubled that day, briefly giving shares of the beleaguered videogame retailer a more than 1,700% gain since the year‚Äôs start.

‚ÄúThis is merely one example of what‚Äôs becoming dozens of dozens,‚Äù Mr. Grantham said. Other retail darlings include AMC, which jumped more than 300% Wednesday, and BlackBerry Ltd. , whose stock the same day notched its biggest gain in more than 17 years.

The Blank-Check Boom Poses Pitfalls for Investors

The Blank-Check Boom Poses Pitfalls for Investors

Private companies are flooding to special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, to bypass the traditional IPO process and gain a public listing. WSJ explains why some critics say investing in these so-called blank-check companies isn‚Äôt worth the risk. Illustration: Zo√´ Soriano/WSJ

Companies are rushing to get in on the action.

Companies have raised $13.4 billion through 24 IPOs so far this year, a 300% jump in listings from the same period last year, according to Renaissance Capital data. Blank-check companies continued to flood the market, with 91 gathering about $25 billion, nearly a third of the value raised throughout all of last year, according to SPACinsider.com. And there have been 111 offerings of additional shares by U.S.-listed companies, doubling the number from the same period a year earlier, Dealogic data show.

Usually, such frenzied activity would lead big money managers to pull back from stocks. But many argue that shares of GameStop, AMC and other highflying stocks represent their own bubbles‚Äîand don‚Äôt pose a threat to the entire financial ecosystem. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS -1.40% say the run-up in unprofitable stocks, which they say make up about 5% of the overall market, poses little risk of contagion.

‚ÄúThese stocks don‚Äôt make up the bulk of the stock market,‚Äù said Samantha McLemore, a portfolio manager at $3.5 billion money-manager Miller Value Partners. ‚ÄúThere are so many areas of the market that we‚Äôre finding attractively valued.‚Äù

At first glance, investors‚Äô go-to for measuring valuations, price-to-earnings ratios, suggests the market looks expensive.

The S&amp;P 500 currently trades at 22 times projected earnings during the next 12 months, not far off from the 25 times the index traded at in 2000, just before the dot-com crash, according to FactSet.

But that‚Äôs only part of the picture. That level looks less concerning once low interest rates and earnings, which are expected to grow, are factored in, several investors and analysts said.

One simple explanation for why investors haven‚Äôt pulled back more?

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen it in the past‚Äîif you think you have a bubble and sell too soon, that can be a very costly trade,‚Äù said Mr. Braakman of First American Trust.

stocks,TRXC - investment thesis,"Transenterix (TRXC)

This is a small medical device company that makes a robotic surgical system called the senhance system.  This is a system used for robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery allowing surgeons to perform surgery with small incisions, less tissue manipulation, increased control and less surgical variability.  

While robotics in surgery may seem like expensive toys, there are several reasons to consider their adoption amongst surgeons.  Firstly, surgery often involves long hours of standing and use of the surgeon‚Äôs hands which can cause fatigue, surgical robots would reduce this.  Secondly, surgical robots can largely replace surgical assistants thereby reducing surgical costs. Thirdly, surgeons during traditional laparoscopic instruments are allowed limited access by their instruments, robots are not limited in this way as articulations can be added to instruments to facilitate surgical access.  

The largest and best known company in this space is intuitive surgical (ISRG) who makes the DaVinci surgical robotic system.  This system has an installed base of approximately 5000 units as of 2020.  Which vastly outnumbers the number of senhance systems installed by transenterix, however there remains, in my opinion, significant room for growth as robotics in surgery has not yet been widely adopted in many regions.  However, progressive forward looking surgical training programs will likely start incorporating training with surgical robots thus bolstering demand amongst graduating surgeons.  These surgeons will likely request the same instruments they used as residents and having already trained with them they will feel comfortable sticking with what they learnt on. 

I have 2 main bull cases for this stock:

	1.	l see a large runway for robotic surgery in general.  As new surgeons are trained they will be looking to robotic assisted surgery to improve patient care.  I believe transenterix could be positioned to capitalize on this.

	2.	With a market capitalization of $364 million, while not the screaming deal it was even 3 months ago, may represent a reasonable value.  This company has a fully functioning robotics system which has been approved for use in the USA, and has just received clearance for use throughout the Russian federation and in Japan. 

The bear case:

	1.	Transenterix is a relatively small company which is competing with companies with much higher market capitalizations and much more money at their disposal such as intuitive surgical and Medtronic.  Once surgeons learn to use one device it may be hard for them to switch.

	2.	It has become somewhat of a hot stock recently resulting in a significant run up in price.  I often get concerned when prices run up this quickly that they often drop again to a more reasonable level.  Furthermore the company is not yet profitable. 

In summary, TRXC is an interesting company in a very interesting space.  They have fully functional surgical robots with reusable components, unlike most of their competitors which may make them more attractive.  The price was a definite bargain only a few months ago but the recent price run up makes it less so, although at this share price the company has issued more shares to give further liquidity for further operations.  

I am long And this is not financial advice 


TLDR: Robotic assisted surgery is in its infancy.  I see a long runway for this domain.  Just as ultrasound was once new tech and price prohibited wide spread adoption but eventually became standard of care in many specialties I see robotics taking the same path in surgery.",finance
dogecoin,Dogecoin not only will rise again but eventually outlast the usa goverment,"Dogecoin may be taken as a meme, Rihanna grande and elon Musk have told you to buy dogecoin because why not the rich can only win by being richer lol but let me tell you even if we pretend we live on a society that has things like civilization thats just a fake illusion of the real truth of the world which is the survival of the fiftest, many other alt coins have died along the way to give you an example [just in the period of 3 years (2017-2019) more than 1500 alt coins died](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=how+many+cryptos+died+in+2019&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8) for being scams, too much inflation or just weren¬¥t traded anymore like bitnet, but the dead of those coins was a good thing as most of them were simply scams or too similar to projects that already exist and if we want the better future then all the alt coins that were a waste of space shouldn¬¥t exist but dogecoin is a special space and i will tell you why.

Well everyone knows what dogecoin already is but a small resume would be, it has about 127 billion coins, it has inflation (but capped at 10,000 per new block), it was born as a meme thanks to dog meme and its really popular from elon musk to tik tok stars, its used sometimes as a crowfunding way [crowfunding way for the people that needed the most](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2tkv4p/ghana_medical_helps_cryptocurrency_endowment_fund/) for example and other things, even if this meme coin was born as meme it actually has the potential to not only outlast but get higher than the usa dollar.

I was making calculations and after the hard cap when dogecoin reached 100 billion coins and the hard cap was put in late 2014 the last 5 years 27 billions have been print so basically the inflation rate has been 5.4 billion new coins per year, now wanna see what the us printing machine of the feds has done the last years let alone 2020, last year alone [the usa printing machine went from 3 trillions printed from january to june 2020, to finally 9 trillion dollars printed at the end of the year](https://www.somagnews.com/9-trillion-story-22-of-us-dollars-printed-in-2020/) basically the last year the fed not only printed more but were doing it at faster rate than ever before causing that 22% of the entire dollars just being printed the last year alone, and if you think this year it will be diferent [biden doesn¬¥t plan the same](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/business/economy/biden-economy.html) as he also wants to keep the printing press running wild.

If you see [this image you can see you are hurting yourself in the short term if you stay in usa dollars](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F3%2F34%2FUS_Consumer_Price_Index_Graph.svg%2F460px-US_Consumer_Price_Index_Graph.svg.png&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUnited_States_dollar&amp;tbnid=usf8CKlWSyCluM&amp;vet=12ahUKEwiR9p3m_b_uAhVWdzABHYCfAaMQMygHegUIARCsAQ..i&amp;docid=Z9AK-tlbUdnkqM&amp;w=460&amp;h=274&amp;q=Us%20dollars%20printed&amp;client=opera&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR9p3m_b_uAhVWdzABHYCfAaMQMygHegUIARCsAQ) and not taking into account that [meme power actually means real power](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi96K_Y_7_uAhWKVN8KHSXsAfYQFjAtegQIDxAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fwallstreetbets-fever-hits-dogecoin-price-soars-142-after-twitter-mention&amp;usg=AOvVaw1o0kOIYJZKkdzEeeXnwY1s) so dogecoin actually has long term value because as at the end the value of a coin is determined by the people willing to trade it and because memes never cease to exist as long as we arent hit by a solar flare the chad dogecoin will be forever to stay while the virgin usa dollar will cease to exist.

CryptoCurrency,Freedom is free(with some exchange fees),"Not only in the US, but the entire world. 

The curtain is pulled back on the NYSE this week as the long stocks begin to crash from hedges selling to cover their loses on GME, AMC, NOK, etc. 

Silver suppliers (online and in-store) are now halting new orders for the next few days due to extremely high demands.

The federal reserve adding more printing presses to the line as the US Monopoly dollar inflates the bubble held up by the first world Demi-overlords. 

Within the last month there has been a decoupling from the US dollar - and absolute chaos in the machine. 

You see, the apes over at WSB cut the legs of the Goliath. Actually, it‚Äôs a Mexican standoff. 

Sure, they KNEW they have the ability to destroy the stock market behemoths by HOLDING. And they may even understand the massive companies that own the world are feeling the pain. The longer WSB hold, the more the share price of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc drop. 

And... 
the 
more PHYSICAL Silver being bought and ordered, the more this drives the price up and pulls back the curtain on the massive metal manipulation preformed by the big banks like JPM. Sending it from $25/oz to $xxx/oz

*What many of them do not understand is the correlation of these two markets: who would you think buys the most silver?* 

Not jewelry companies. It‚Äôs the monster companies that make technology that buy and use silver in their batteries, computers, solar panels, etc etc. Companies like APPLE, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, AMAZON. Even the US military. 

They buy a whole lot of damn silver. And here‚Äôs the kicker...

To make products, these companies have to purchase silver. (Just like the hedges have to buy up shares of GME, even though they shorted it). This also drives the price up 

So if their shares continue to crash, and they are not cash heavy.... how can they afford to keep buying silver? They can‚Äôt! The house of cards will fall in on itself 

I want to make this clear: With the disruption in supply chain in 2020 - there does not have to be a huge change in market prices for this whole fiasco to dismantle consumer confidence. And when people are confident, they don‚Äôt buy. 

So who helps the large companies, the banks, and hedges? That‚Äôs right, the federal reserve. 

What is freedom from banks and the federal reserve? 

Cryptocurrency is freedom. 


Blockchain is the safe haven of freedom for the people who choose to educate themselves.

stocks,Telos (TLS) cybersecurity company,"With Telos options finally coming available about 2 weeks ago I decided I should make this post to see what everyone thinks. 

Some background info:
Telos is a cybersecurity company that recently completed its IPO on November 19, 2020. The IPO price was $17.00 but it opened around $20. 

**What do they do**: Telos is an information technology company focused on designing and providing customers with secure solutions that leverage mobile communication, cloud technology, and collaboration. Its customer base consists primarily of military, intelligence and civilian agencies of the federal government and NATO allies around the world. 

So basically cybersecurity using the cloud for HUGE companies/military/government. You can see their list of clients on the website but it includes: 

DOD, Department of State ,AWS, Microsoft Azure, Department of Homeland Security, FedEx, Verizon, Citi 

Not thinking they're going to 0 any time soon with that customer base.

**Valuation**

Now let's compare their numbers to one of the top MEME stonks of the year: PLTR.

**TLS : $219M (2019)** 

**PLTR: $739M (2019)** 

Yes, Palantir has 3X more, but look at valuation: 

**TLS : $2.2B**

**PLTR: $66B** 

Palantir has 3X the revenue but 33X the market cap. Definitely room for growth. Revenue also increased 20% YOY for the first 9 Months of 2020. They have 350+ customers and 85% of revenue is recurring.

They both had similar earnings last quarter with Telos at -0.01/share and PLTR +0.05. Analyst estimates are slowly increasing with 2021 earnings expected to be positive ($0.26/Share). While analysts are steadily downgrading Palantir to Hold/Underperform/Sell, Telos recommendations are Buy or Strong Buy across the board. 

**Market for Cybersecurity**: The total addressable market in 2019 was $156.5B in 2019, with a 10% Compound Annual Growth Rate. This means it should approximately double by 2027. I believe this is underestimating the growth. Since the pandemic, people have been forced to work from home, and many functions that could be done at the office are now being done remotely. This means a lot more security risk since almost everything is being done online, and it is harder to secure everyones personal computers than to secure a controlled work site. 

**Price:** It hovered around $20 but has been steadily growing over the last month or so, it hit $41.84/share but is currently sitting around 35. A lot of price targets are for $45/share. I believe it can go much higher than that based on the numbers provided, and the increase in cybersecurity requirements. It has almost no hype since IPO but slow steady price growth. Just look at all the threads on PLTR here, plus PLTR has 87k watchers on twits. TLS is relatively unknown with 1200 watchers. I feel like as soon as people realize what this company is doing, it will take off to the moon. Plus the implied volatility is 81% vs 129% for PLTR, so when you can buy long dated options cheaper.

Forex,U.S. Dollar Is Still Under Pressure,"The German economy saw a moderate rise in growth for the fourth quarter, gaining 0.1% for the three months ending December. The rise still highlights that Europe‚Äôs largest economy is still some way off its pre-pandemic pace of growth. Some optimism can be taken from the fact that growth remained despite another implementation of movement restrictions at the end of the year. The year 2021 has also started well for Germany, with 41,000 workers moving out of unemployment in January. This is considerably more than the 6,000 that was forecast for the period. Labour market statistics from the UK highlighted how difficult a year it was for British workers. Since the start of the pandemic, 828,000 workers left the labour market with peak redundancies taking place in September. 

Demand for ‚ÄòMade in the U.S.A‚Äô goods appear to be healthy. Core Durable Goods orders rose for the eighth consecutive month to 0.7% in December. A more tempered rate of economic growth was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020, which saw a 4% rise in output, compared with a 33.5% rebound in the third quarter. Output is now estimated to be only 2.5% off the rate of growth seen before the Covid-19 outbreak. The labour market also looks to be showing improvement with 847,000 jobless claims for the week ending 24th January; 33,000 less than forecast. Unsurprisingly, there were no changes to monetary policy from the Federal Reserve at the January committee meeting. 

Growth in China remains steady according to PMI surveys although the pace of output has slowed in anticipation of the Chinese New Year holidays. Both manufacturing and services surveys reached 51.3% and 52.4% respectively. Exports remain healthy and domestic demand has picked up, with the construction sector leading the rise in output. Economic recovery in Japan appears to be slowing, as industrial output in December registered another month contraction.

WKHS currently sits at a **4.1 Billion** market cap, now it's true there's a good amount of the contract priced in already, but not the short interest squeeze that could happen as a result of the news. When WKHS gets awarded the contract, were looking at at least **8.1 Billion** Market Cap, which, correlating that into the share price sets a **Price Target of around** **\~$80 - $90** a share. And that's not even adding in the recent Price Motors Co. order of over 6,000 vehicles.

I am graduating from college and ending my lease on my current place this May. Im planning on staying in the Cincinnati area and getting a job that will pay roughly 45K. I have no student debt thanks to some scholarships and side hustles which include my small business of laser cutting wooden board games. I have made roughly 32K before taxes in 2020 thanks to that business and I am now looking for a home loan so I can move in right after I graduate. 

I have $20,000 for a down payment and looking to buy a house that's less than $100,000.

The problem I'm running into is that I only have this current year of freelance taxes to show to the loan agency, when most of them want two years of tax returns. I also wont start my 9 to 5  job until May 15th so I wont have the 30 days worth of pay stubs they want.   

Does anyone know if I can get a loan with my current predicament? And if I can get a loan for only one years worth of freelance do the interest rates increase? 

Any help is greatly appreciated!",finance

dogecoin,How to keep the DOGE alive!!!!!!!!!!!,"\*\*\*Not a financial advisor or an economist, all of the following is my personal opinion and should not be mistaken for financial advice\*\*\*

So we have a massive interest in the DOGE right now. But, what is it all for? DOGE is not going to be the next Bitcoin. Fundamentally it is different, and that is perfectly OK. DOGE was never meant to be a digital asset, it is a digital currency. DOGE is meant to be traded and used, not for the entire supply to be bought and held. Currently, DOGE is worth 3X a Japanese Yen, and multiple times the value of the Korean Won. The threshold of a viable currency value has already been passed. Now is the time to start building the infrastructure to maintain that value, by providing avenues to transfer that value.

DOGE needs to start out as a DONATION based currency. Using DOGE as a currency for purchasing goods and services is still a ways off, I believe. However, with the rise in crowd funding sites and donation based entertainment, we are primed for DOGE to become the GO-TO donation currency. Just like how Twitch can charge $1.00 for 100 bits, eventually, services will arise that sell and buy DOGE to ensure steady access to the tipping currency for people who want to tip, as well as a steady source of income for people who receive the tip. Thus stabilizing the cost and value of the currency.

Step 1: Preparation

Crypto wallets need to become an every day thing. There are many out there, some support most crypto currencies, others support other currencies. Either way, wallets NEED to become more common. Crypto needs to be stored on these wallets, and used. Many things are going to be changing in the coming years, and just how credit cards and debit cards have overtaken checks, Crypto may be the payment method that replaces debit cards.

Research and download a wallet. Either on your phone or on your PC (Both is better) have multiple wallets to separate your expense crypto, from your Hodling crypto.

Use this time to get an exchange account, and a wallet (or two or three wallets). Do not get caught off guard again. IF YOU DON'T CONTROL THE KEY, YOU DO NOT CONTROL THE COINS!

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Adoption

\-Reddit: Reddit already has a way to transfer DOGE between users, ([https://sodogetip.xyz/](https://sodogetip.xyz/)). It is a good place to start, though it does require you to transfer DOGE to the wallet that is set up, before you can tip.

\-Gumroad: Digital marketplaces like Gumroad have a built-in option for sellers to offer selections of their portfolio for free, allowing people to donate if they want. Perhaps contacting these types of sites to see if they would allow the seller to include a DOGE address as a form of donation.

\-Twitch: Twitch currently has a micro payment system known as ""Bits."" So, the idea of tipping streamers a small amount of money for small rewards like having your comment read aloud, is already a part of the system. The tipping of DOGE to streamers would cut out the 50% fee that sites like Twitch take, while still supporting streamers.

\-1upCoin: This is a site that allows streamers to connect their Coinbase accounts with Twitch/Youtube, and a select number of streaming programs ( aka Streamlabs) in order for the streamer to display public alerts when crypto is donated. Currently, the service does not include DOGE. The creator of the service has stated that DOGE support is in the works, but perhaps it should be moved to the front of the que.

\-Person to Person: Start tipping your friends and family with DOGE, for small things. They helped you move and your fed them pizza? Give them 100 Doge. Keep the circulating volume up up UP! Normalize DOGE.

Step 3: Future Expansion.

\-Shopify: Shopify is currently working on allowing crypto to be used as a form of payment. This will be the ecommerce site to watch in the coming months/years. Their recent partnership with Walmart puts them in the best position to combine local sellers and national brands while testing the feasibility of using crypto as a stable form of payment, for both small value purchases and bulk ordering. DOGE could be one of the first widely accepted currencies on Shopify, IF and ONLY IF, it has a proven user base.

Step 4: BE SAFE!

Do not. I repeat, DO NOT spend more on DOGE than you can afford. DOGE is meant to help the community, not be a siphon for your savings. **Yes, To The Moon! But, you can't help DOGE if you burn up on re-entry.**",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Transcript of Elon Musk's remarks on Bitcoin/cypto from his Sunday night interview on Clubhouse,"Elon just made these comments in an interview on the Clubhouse platform (the interview mentioned on his Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1355983231988862978?s=20)).

As of now the interview is still ongoing.  You can listen in live [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cba53J1jyPM).  He made the comments about an hour or so into the interview.

Full transcript of this question from the interview:

\----------

**Question from the interviewer:**

Elon, this is something you joked about, but I'm kind of curious to get your serious answer to this, which is: All things cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. You famously just changed your Twitter bio to just the Bitcoin logo and the word Bitcoin this week.  What do you think of cryptocurrency, what do you think of Bitcoin, what do you think of other cryptocurrencies - love to get your take on the entire thing.""

**Elon's Response:**

(Laugh) Well, gotta watch what I say here, because some of these things can really move the markets.

So, first of all I should say that many friends of mine have tried to convince me to get involved in Bitcoin for a long time like, when it first just popped out there.

(unintelligible) he actually had Bitcoin, like a Bitcoin ""cake,"" a cake that had a Bitcoin symbol on it, and he fed me a slice of Bitcoin cake in 2013.

So, clearly I should have bought some Bitcoin 8 years ago. (laugh) Like, what more do people?  Jesus.  Talk about being late to the party.

So I was a little slow on the uptake there.  My apologies.  But I - as I think about it a fair bit, I do at this point this Bitcoin is a good thing, and - so, I am a supporter of Bitcoin.  Like I said, I'm late to the party but I'm a supporter of Bitcoin.  And I think that Bitcoin is really on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people

So... I don't have a strong opinion on other cryptocurrencies.  Occasionally I make jokes about Dogecoin, but they are really just meant to be jokes.

Dogecoin was made as a joke, to make fun of cryptocurrencies, obviously.  But fate loves irony.  And often, as (unintelligible) the most ironic, or most entertaining outcome is often most likely, and - arguably - the most entertaining outcome - the most ironic outcome - would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth in the future.

(laughter)

CryptoCurrency,Serious question: is $CEL a shit coin?,"Guys, I know most investors have drunk the koolaid and we're all simping for the company. But I need some objective or at least well thought feedback.

$cel is basically a financial service. They give out cheap loans as low was 1%apr if you have 1:4 debt:asset ratio and provide high interests on your crypto, I believe 10% ON USDC and 6% on BTC. This seems like a pretty legit business, give out cheap loans to people with high collaterals and pay holders higher interest rate.

But then they have their own $cel token which they will give higher interest rate on if you want you payments paid out in $cel.

My only confusion is why is the $cel token even necessary. Seems like they are encouraging people to hold it to boost interest rates but really I don't see any other use for it

But the business is legit and the founder Alex Mashinsky apparently created voip back in the day. Wikipedia confirms this but who knows?

Anyway, in your honest opinion are they shit or a legit investment?

https://preview.redd.it/mocxsyy4tue61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9d8f573388e1bc893dd43c1edc57e8b6632ce50

The  Russian-German pipeline Nord Stream 2 is 95% ready and its construction  can be fully completed at any time. Of course, in connection with the  sanctions imposed by the United States against the companies involved in  the construction of the gas pipeline, there are still problems with  insurance and NS2 certification (without which the beginning of its work  is impossible). However, the attention of all players is drawn today  not so much to the American sanctions, but to the position of official  Berlin, which believes that the scandalous gas pipeline, in any case,  should be launched.

Six months  ago, Germany‚Äôs position was categorical and uncontested, and Washington  was accused by Berlin of gross interference in the internal affairs of  the European Union. In recent months, the statements of the Federal  Chancellor and other politicians have become more cautious and  conciliatory neutral. Briefly summarizing, A. Merkel insists that  Germany is neither a political ally nor an economic lobbyist for Russia,  and NS2 is a purely rational project that meets the goals of  diversification of energy supplies for the EU in general and Germany in  particular.

Of  course, no one expected such a blatant lie from the leading politician  of the Old Continent, who, since 2012, has been convincing the leaders  of the EU member states of the need of unconditional acceptance for  social maintenance the thousands of refugees from Africa and the Middle  East. At the same time, A. Merkel used such categories as humanitarian  values, protection of democratic foundations, respect for human rights  and freedoms. It is noteworthy that the most harsh dialogue on the EU  migration policy arose between Germany and the countries of Central and  Eastern Europe (CEE), which refused to accept refugees, justifying their  decision with their own financial and economic problems. Then German  politicians tried to shame their colleagues from CEE, claiming that EU  membership means not only careful spending of budget funds, but also the  protection of universal human values and democratic freedoms.

Nevertheless,  when a discussion arose about the political inexpediency of NS2  pipeline construction, the German government ‚Äúsuddenly forgot‚Äù about  democracy and its values. In response to calls from Poland, Slovakia,  the Baltic States and Ukraine (an associate member of the EU) not to  start the NS2 construction due to a number of serious reasons, German  politicians tried to convince everyone that they were guided exclusively  by purely economic categories and asked not to go deep during a  substantive conversation around the pipeline into such lofty and  abstract matters as the values of Western (Euro-Atlantic) civilization  and the rebuff to Russian authoritarianism.

In  their opposition to NS2, the countries of CEE, the Baltic States and  Ukraine (which the United States later joined) provided the following  arguments:

‚Äì  the project is incompatible with the general policy of diversification  of energy sources for the EU, since already now a third of natural gas  supplies to the EU come from Russia. Naturally, after the launch of NS2,  Russia‚Äôs share in the EU gas market will increase even more;

‚Äì  the project is incompatible with the policy of demonopolization. Thus,  NS2 violates EU legislation, namely ‚Äî the Third Energy Package (directed  against any monopolies and requiring for the third parties access to  the operation of pipelines, gas distribution networks and underground  gas storage facilities);

‚Äì the project will lead to a tangible increase in the lobbying capabilities of the Gazprom in the EU;

‚Äì  the project will lead to a significant increase in the profit of the  Gazprom. At the same time, it should be borne in mind that in an  authoritarian country, Gazprom is not a classic joint stock company, but  a ‚Äúwallet company‚Äù for the President of the Russian Federation and his  clique. Accordingly, the growth of Gazprom‚Äôs profits will not lead to  the gasification of remote regions of Russia (the Urals, Siberia, the  Far East), but to the strengthening of V. Putin‚Äôs personalist regime and  the financing of his aggressive foreign policy;

‚Äì  based on the previous paragraph, the launch of NS2 strengthens Russia  and automatically increases tensions in a number of post-Soviet states:  the Baltic countries, Belarus, Ukraine (Crimea, Donbass), Moldova  (Transnistria), Azerbaijan (Nagorno-Karabakh), Georgia (Abkhazia, South  Ossetia), Kazakhstan (northern areas);

‚Äì  Ukraine must be considered separately. First, the cumulative use of the  NS1 and NS2 pipelines (could pump 110 billion cubic meters per year)  will allow the Russian Federation to completely abandon the services of  the Ukrainian gas transportation system. In this case, Kyiv will lose $ 2  billion in revenues annually from the transit of Russian gas, which, of  course, is extremely unpleasant for the weak Ukrainian economy. In  addition, Kyiv will stop maintaining its GTS in proper technical  condition. But the latter is extremely disadvantageous for the entire  EU, since the situation may change, for example, due to the growth of  industry or the decommissioning of a number of nuclear power plants  within the framework of the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù policy. If the needs of the EU  countries in gas increase, the capacity of the existing pipelines will  not be enough and then the (non-working) Ukrainian GTS will be urgently  needed.

Secondly,  in Kyiv, there are not unfounded fears that if Ukraine ceases to be an  important transit country for the Russian gas, the Russian Armed Forces  will cease to be limited to the East and South of Ukraine, and will  begin a full-scale attack on their former colony, which is desperately  trying to escape from the ‚Äúiron embrace‚Äù of yesterday metropolis. In  this situation, Washington states that it will strongly support Ukraine  as its ally ‚Äî in particular, it will oppose the implementation of NS2  project. But Germany, being a member of the international negotiation  format ‚ÄúNormandy Four‚Äù (designed to resolve the conflict between the  Russian Federation and Ukraine), stubbornly ignores the current reality;

‚Äì  in general, NS2, being a project of an aggressive neo-imperialist  Russian Federation, poses a threat to EU foreign policy, as well as to  the security policy of NATO and the European Union. Against this  background, the former head of Polish diplomacy, Radoslaw Sikorski,  quite correctly called the agreement between Moscow and Berlin on NS2  ‚Äúthe modern Molotov-Ribbentrop pact‚Äù.

Responsing  to the argument about the hypothetical shortage of gas for the internal  needs of Germany, current Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki  proposed to the German government to use gas from the capacities (both  existing and potential) in Poland. Firstly, we are talking about the  already operating gasification terminal for liquefied natural gas (LNG)  in the Baltic port of ≈öwinouj≈õcie. Today it provides 5 billion cubic  meters per year, and it will soon be expanded to 8.3 billion cubic  meters, and, if necessary, its regasification capacity can be increased  to 10 billion cubic meters annually. This terminal has been successfully  receiving gas from Norway, Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago, Nigeria and the  USA for several years.

Secondly, now Poland is building another gas terminal in the bay of the port of Gdansk (the so-called FSRU ‚Äî *Floating* Storage *Regasification Unit*) with a capacity of up to 2 billion cubic meters.

Thirdly,  Warsaw and Copenhagen keep laying the Baltic Pipe on the bottom of the  Baltic Sea, which will deliver gas from fields on the Norwegian shelf to  Denmark and Poland. The technical launch of the gas pipeline is  scheduled for October 1, 2022, and the start of commercial supplies ‚Äî  for January 1, 2023. The annual capacity of the pipeline will be 10  billion cubic meters, and all excess gas can be exported to Germany or  to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Ukraine. At the same time, the  European Commission officially recognized that the creation of this gas  pipeline is in line with the goals of the EU energy policy (increased  competition, integration of gas markets, increased reliability of  supply, low emissions) and allocated ‚Ç¨ 266.8 million for the Baltic Pipe  project.

Obviously,  Poland is unlikely to have too much gas surplus, but, as a kind of  safety for German consumers, gas from Poland can undoubtedly be used. In  addition, there are also LNG terminals in the vicinity of Germany ‚Äî in  Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Klaipeda (Lithuania). In the end, A. Merkel  gave the green light for the construction of own LNG terminal in the  port of Hamburg. Therefore, it is not a secret for anyone that the  possibilities available to Germany are quite sufficient to satisfy  domestic consumers, however, Germany would like not only to consume, but  also to resell natural gas and receive huge dividends on the re-export.

The  above arguments are loudly heard on international platforms, but German  politicians carelessly ignore them and repeat, like mantras, phrases  about ‚Äúeconomic expediency‚Äù, ‚Äúenergy security‚Äù and ‚Äúsovereign right to  conduct domestic policy‚Äù with a straight face. The reasons for this  behavior of representatives of German establishment are quite clear ‚Äî  they want to be even richer and even more influential. Not very loudly  (but whispering on the sidelines) at international meetings they say  that the launch of NS2 will lead to the following consequences:

‚Äì  the gas price inside Germany will significantly decrease, and, in  addition, Germany will be able to dispose of a large amount of surplus  gas;

‚Äì  Germany will get rid of such gas transit countries as Ukraine and  Belarus (and the need to pay them for pumping gas), and will become the  main transit country for other EU states. Instead of the Russia ‚Äî  Ukraine/Belarus ‚Äî Central-Eastern Europe transit route another Russia ‚Äî  Germany ‚Äî CEE route will appear;

‚Äì  thanks to their extensive gas transmission systems and underground gas  storage facilities that are under construction, Germany and Austria will  turn into a central gas hub of the European Union with all the ensuing  consequences: the ability to directly regulate gas prices within the EU,  an increase in economic and political influence, and the receipt of  super profits;

‚Äì  after the launch of NS2, German gas companies will sooner or later oust  their Dutch, Polish and Slovak competitors from the EU market;

‚Äì  with a gradual increase in the energy dependence of the EU countries on  gas supplies through Germany, there will be an inevitable increase in  the strategic importance of Germany as the largest economy and a  powerful political center on the entire Old Continent.

Thus,  in truth, German politicians bow down to the altar of economic benefit  and sacrifice the goals and values of the EU and NATO thereon, and also  question the strength and effectiveness of the transatlantic ties  between Europe and North America.

&gt;  ***""Endgame: The Unraveling"".***

https://medium.com/@fatherdoctorbitcoiner/endgame-the-unraveling-ccbbb5cd567b

The piece is mind-blowing in many ways, describes the situation that lead to this moment and the few possible scenarios, and have this clear: Any final scenario will be historic.

Bitcoin addressed here:

&gt; To prop up the market and prevent the entire financial system from melting down, the Fed will have no choice but to do QE infinity and continue to prop up asset prices and now with Janet Yellen in the Treasury, the debt will be directly monetized in the form of direct payments. This will finally cause the inflation, even hyperinflation that Lacy Hunt has warned about if the Fed were to directly monetize the treasury‚Äôs debt. Once inflation starts, like a horse out of a barn, it will be nearly impossible to rein it in without turning into Scenario #1. It will spiral out of control and cause incredible amount of pain to EVERYONE, globally, as every Central Bank will have to do the same if the US Fed monetizes the national debt. Once this happens, **people will end up owning bitcoin not out of any moral justification or idealism that maximalists espouse, but because it will be the only thing that people will accept for payment for goods and services as the USD is destroyed as a store of value.** This is Scenario #2. It will make Scenario #1 look like the Garden of Eden.

Also, regarding Bitcoin, one of the many ways this is relevant to Bitcoin users is this one:

Robbing Hood is going down, one way or another, next week or next month. There are hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of users holding what they may believe is ""Bitcoin"" there, it is not, but just an IOU. You can't even withdraw or transfer Bitcoin from there, you have to ""sell"" it for fiat first.

If you have ""Bitcoin"" there: DO SO NOW, get out whatever you have in Robbing Hood, in any way, before it blows up. You can continue holding and  supporting GME, AMC, etc. on more trusted platforms and  Hodling Bitcoin on your own hard wallet (""Not your keys, not your coins"") or on decentralized exchanges:

Feel free to post this on r/WSB, I was banned a way back for mentioning the word 'Bitcoin' there, I hope that with this mess they start warming up to this decentralized option.

From another comment:

&gt; A couple of interesting bits from that interview:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) The Microstrategy conference ""Bitcoin for corporations"" already has ""thousands of officers, executives, and directors"" going to show up.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) They are going to publish their ""playbook"": ""all our accounting guidance, legal guidance, all the work we did over the course of months [...] we're going to open-source it"".

# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Check your percentages!**  There are two different challenges this month depending on your position in the [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) list of steps.

1. **If you're on steps 0 through 3, do the first challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Building an emergency fund
  - Paying down expensive debt (interest rate over 10%)

2. **If you're on steps 4 through 6, do the second challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Saving for retirement
  - Investing for other long-term goals

3. **If you're not sure which challenge applies best to you (e.g., not saving for retirement yet, but don't have credit card debt), feel free to pick and choose from either challenge.**

4. **Bonus points: do both challenges!**

# First challenge

Your challenge is to pursue improving your interest rates.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 2 or more of the following things:

* If you have debts, compile information on each debt including the type of debt, the amount owed, and the interest rate. Also [find out your credit score and review your credit report.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%2830-day+challenge+get+on+top+of+your+credit%29&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=year#res-hide-options)
* If you have credit card debt that you are carrying from month-to-month, [call up your credit card company and make a request to lower your interest rate](https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/how-to-lower-credit-card-interest-rate/).
* If you have enough money in your checking account to cover *at least* one month of expenses, start building a second tier to your emergency fund by opening a high interest savings account that pays at least 1% interest rate and deposit $50 or more into it.
* If you already have a savings account, [research your options](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/rates/) and consider moving your savings account to a bank paying a higher rate.  (The wiki has some [common recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions).)

# Second challenge

Your challenge is to audit your investment expenses and emergency fund.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 3 or more of the following things:

* Request a fee schedule/statement from your financial advisor (if you have one).
* Request a fee schedule/statement from the administrator of your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan (or find out your fees by logging into your plan account).
* Look through recent statements to see if there are any charges you don't recognize.
* Calculate your [blended expense ratio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios#Blended_expense_ratio).
* Evaluate your emergency fund and adjust it accordingly if your expenses and/or risk tolerance have changed. If you raised it, make a plan to meet your new e-fund goal sometime in the future.

The idea here is that you might uncover some expenses you didn't know you were paying, which in turn might give you a reason to make a change for the better. The impact of [costs on investments can be depressing](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost). If you find a clean slate, sleep well knowing that your money is working for you first and your investment company second. Another way to sleep well is to ensure you have enough set aside for emergencies. You may have set up your emergency fund goal and met it a number of years ago and perhaps times have changed for you. It's a great time to ensure you have an appropriate amount set aside for your expenses and risk tolerance.

More information on investment expenses:

* General advice on investing be found in our [Investing wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing).
* Specific advice for employer-sponsored plans is in our [401(k) fund selection guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds).

dogecoin,True! Fed agent banks at CFTC can NAKED short sell paper spot. So people DONT buy silver..,,cryptocurrency
dogecoin,Doge coin.,"Doge coin stock market !!! Whoa! Umm, this is a coin. Yes, it is a coin. That one, I said. No wait, buy the coin. Well, I think I did. So here's my theory. We already know that the US Dollar has lost about 8% since September, and about 18% since December, 2013. But who's right? Well, it's actually the No.11 that is on the DNY exchange, or g.d.com (which in and of course, remains free to do so). Now here's what I think. (For the record, i'm a not-so-comfortable person, and i'm not knocking Larry Probst over the head with me ... but seriously ... there my ""conservative"" friend, do you think?) Larry Hauerwas (still one of the wealthiest businessmen in the world, a fact that I never claimed - no matter how accurate) Larry Hauerwas was born in Chicago, Illinois exactly 50 years ago. So here's the picture: The... Dr. Larry Larry is the richest man in America. Forbes says ""Larry has a net worth of over $104 billion, with his investments in companies such as Second Life, Second Life Offices (including 6.6 million in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), Everest Fund, and DirecTVNow Holdings. Larry is the eighth richest man in North America and ranks No. 1 on Forbes list of richest Americans. This is probably the eighth-most expensive man in Western world history."" But here's the deal ... Larry is now ranked eighth in North America (just above Kuwait). So clearly if you invested in New York City you'd be OK with that. Let's go back to where we started ... New York City is an economic center of the world, a center of innovation in the field ... New York is one of the fastest growing sports and entertainment markets in the entire United States. The city is also home to some of the world's best universities, most of which are located in New York City. The city is home to the Center for Integrated Lifestyle Medicine (formerly referred to as the Manhattan Institute) that is the world's largest human-sized technological facility ... It's also home to the world's leading Virtual Panoramic Camera. The Panoramic is the culmination of the University of Pennsylvania's new initiative to digitize the Panoramic network connecting New York City and Boston ... It's the brainchild of the Boston Globe (then known as the Boston Globe) and the National Association of Virtual Panoramic Surfaces. It's a network that was established in 2002, and was expanded to include the University of Pennsylvania in 2006. It's also the brainchild of the Boston Globe -- formerly called the NAGLE Network -- that's been working with the goal to connect the rest of the United States with the University of Pennsylvania... If you're a member of the NAGLE Network, you should also follow the latest news on the new Panoramic network here. That's right you should be able to see the latest news about the New York City area. (It's still just one of the 50 largest public institutions in the United States.) Now let's take this as a good example ... the University of Pennsylvania's own financial institution, the Penn Secrecy Centre (CCSC). While it claims to be a worldwide network of around 60 universities and 10 media departments, a total of 1.7 billion people are collectively ""secure in secrecy,"" which is quite remarkable considering that the nation's most notorious financial watchdog, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, has a staff of 1.1 million. As of June 9, 2016, the CCSC was ranked 17rd in its ranking of the top 11 ""secret"" financial institutions in the world. This is the brainchild of the American Academy of Humanities, the most notorious financial regulatory body that was set up in 1764 by Arthur Scholes to protect human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The CCSC is the world's first financial watchdog dedicated to a global view of human rights and freedom ... and so is the first institution funded by the United States. The US government seems to be in the dark about what is going on ‚Äî and that's a good thing because even the best-intentioned officials on Capitol Hill are openly expressing their dismay at what their institution's president has proposed ... and are now actively looking to quash. But at the very least, we have a president who has been so eager to defend and protect Americans ... and that, by itself, is a terrible thing. It's kind of sad that he made it in a way that makes me cringe to still be a part of this... But this is a government institution that I would be proud to hold. As I noted in an April 27 report I wrote a few weeks back ‚Äî it.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Tax Preparation Advice,"I'm sure I'm not going to be the only person making this kind of a post so maybe this will help people. In the past my dad did my taxes and then last year I paid someone to do it but this year I'm looking at using a tax prep program. I know about TurboTax because that's what my dad uses. I know it's free if all I have to do is file federal. I live in Florida with no state taxes so that should be all I need. The catch is that I have other income streams. I have a mortgage so the interest there matters. I started investing this past year and while I haven't sold anything yet I've made dividends. Very very small amounts of dividends open (less than $100) But it's still something to file. I also have a savings account that I've made interest on again with a very low interest rate because of the economy right now but it's again something else to file.

Overall I still expect that the standard deduction will be what I'll be taking based on my limited knowledge of tax law and the fact that my biggest deduction is mortgage interest and the standard deduction is still much more than that.

Anyway I'm just wondering what edition of TurboTax I need or if there is a better recommended program for someone preparing their own taxes for the very first time. Thank you",finance

As I understand, in the new staking paradigm blocks get justified and then get finalized, two actions that have well-defined latencies to them, e.g finality requires at minimum two epochs (12.8 minutes) to occur.

Yesterday, I went to the Burger King drive-through and I offered to pay with ETH. The cashier scoffed and said, ""no can do, friend - we're not gonna sit here for a quarter of an hour waiting for you to pay for your Whopper Jr.""

personalfinance,"I might get fired today, should I ask for a raise?","I was told Friday I may be fired. My boss was not nice. About 10 minutes before the end of my shift they stopped me to correct some minor thing and then goes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to worry over the weekend, it‚Äôs still serious but I don‚Äôt want you to worry.‚Äù They planned to talk to their manager today about what to do with me and my employment. 


I work for a Fortune 500 company doing high level customer service and my team is already short two people. We‚Äôre drowning in work to the point we‚Äôre having to give the ‚Äúeasy stuff‚Äù to other departments. It takes about a year for someone to be fully trained in my job. And it takes dedicated time from my leadership to train them. 


So when I was told I may be fired, as I have relatively low performance these last couple months, and my boss asked why I‚Äôm not giving 100% but rather am more so just ‚Äúshowing up.‚Äù I told them I am not paid enough, and I really don‚Äôt feel I am for the level of responsibility my job requires. 


So I‚Äôm thinking of asking for a raise. I make $18/hour now. But that‚Äôs as a ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù and the people below me make about 50 cents less. I didn‚Äôt get a raise at the end of the year due to my low performance. So the pay that was too low stayed the same. When I told my boss that they said to think about that over the weekend and we‚Äôll talk Monday. They have to talk to their manager and then we‚Äôre gonna talk about ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt firing you but can you commit to being 100% better?‚Äù


All I could think of over the weekend was the idea that I want more money for the work. I‚Äôll give it my all, if it‚Äôs worth giving it my all. Because as of now it‚Äôs high stress and a break-even amount of pay. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong about this. But give me some feedback please. From $18/hour, I‚Äôm thinking to ask for $25 an hour. A $7 raise. If they go for it at all they‚Äôll try to cut it back, the company despite being so vastly wealthy and profitable hates to give raises and the average raise is under 3%.

So is this a legitimate play?


TL;DR My boss said I may be fired, but I don‚Äôt think I will get fired because we‚Äôre so short staffed and buried in work. So I‚Äôm thinking to flip the script and say ‚Äúsure I can do better, but pay me more‚Äù

Edit:
Thank you for your replies. It seems the most logical way forward for me is to look for other work. Should I keep my employment I should say sorry and tell them I‚Äôll be better. I shouldn‚Äôt ask for more pay and frankly I don‚Äôt think it would happen anyway.

Edit 2:
I didn‚Äôt ask for a raise. I shared candidly that I have low job satisfaction and I don‚Äôt agree with the pay but with the guidance of your comments I saw that it‚Äôs not my place to hold my job performance hostage. I should buckle up and do the work or find another job. So I told my boss that I don‚Äôt know what my long term plan is, but that while I figure that out I will commit to meeting the standards expected of me. I gave the timeline of this week to get back into shape and the boss gave me a written warning that if I slip again I‚Äôm fired.",finance

dogecoin,"The Future of DOGE Is What We Make It, Together!","Let me just say you guys are awesome and the backbone of this ride to the moon! Great job keeping the community and trend alive. I'm here to help in this endeavor any way I can and to spread knowledge!

There are a lot of misconceptions circulating the forums, so I'll address some of them:

&amp;#x200B;

1. There's an infinite supply of Dogecoin so it can never be valuable.

 Copied text:

""It has 5 billion minted per year, infinite. The elephant in the room. Why everyone says it's worthless. Why I originally thought it's not worth $1, and ***why I was totally WRONG***.It's ***entirely based on the rate of adoption***, the number of transactions/expansion and usage. **We don't WANT a cap.** There are 5bln new doges minted every year but the US prints/mints 7.2bln every year. All fiat currency is infinite. There are approx $1.5trln physical notes in circulation and as of right now there are **ONLY** 128bln doges in circulation. *Achieving mass adoption* ***means it's worth is MORE than $1*** *because there isn't a 1 to 1 ratio, not also accounting for LOST doges. :( \[poor lost doges... they had a home once\]*

It has a linear inflation model, which deflates over time. The inflationary model of *5bln per year is deflationary because it's* ***LINEAR***. The 5bln is fixed. It will always be the same every year, but every year there will be MORE coins, which means that 5% this year, isn't 5% next year.If you have 100 coins and you make 5% more you have 105. If you make 5% more next year, you have 5% of 105, **which is less than the prior year because we're minting 5bln FIXED**. So it's value increases.""

\------

Here the original post with more useful information from u/shibetoshi_hodler

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/la1205/why\_doge\_doesnt\_need\_a\_cap\_supply\_linear/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/la1205/why_doge_doesnt_need_a_cap_supply_linear/)

\------

And this is in contrast to any fiat currencies, as they also have infinite supply after taking the dollar of the gold standard. The main difference of fiat and Dogecoin is that the fed and other central banks can print the currencies at will, but dogecoin can not be inflated in such a way. This is why getting dogecoin to be an accepted currency would lessen the control of central banks on the world. Remember: they are responsible for the market crashes and they have never been held liable. They have only been bailed out by governments, which in turn mean that all of the tax payers carry the burden, while they get more rich. 

2. This is a pump and dump, and it's over - get out while you still can.

It's true that a pump and dump occurred. That's why DOGE went from 0.06‚Ç¨ to 0.02‚Ç¨, but that means that all of the dumpers are gone. The reason it didn't tank to below 0.006‚Ç¨, where it started from, is the community who believes in the cause and holds steadfast. Now we are seeing interest rise as the price is rising. It is imperative to hold as they did with GME so the price could keep rising.

&amp;#x200B;

3. This is all hype and the cryptocurrency that started as a joke can't be successful.

The hype around Dogecoin is actually the reason why it could be much more successful than other cryptocurrencies. It's the belief in something that makes or breaks literally anything's success. Think about it this way: the only thing keeping the fiat currencies alive is the belief in it, as it not backed by anything other than belief in the system after they took it off the gold standard, so if enough people believe in Dogecoin and more people start buying it, it too could become a widespread currency.

As Elon Musk said: ""The most entertaining/ironic outcome is the most likely, and the most entertaining outcome would be that $DOGE coin become the currency of the future"". If you think about it, massive amounts of people would support a meme dog cryptocurrency being mainstream just because it would be funny. How many people in the world care about a cryptocurrency which has a lot of different real world uses vs a cryptocurrency which only real world application would be being a currency like dollars, but it has doggos and endless memes on the internet? This would surely correlate to the Pareto Principle 80%/20%, because there are a lot more people out there who care about memes in everyday life than useful applications in technology or science.

&amp;#x200B;

4. This is not a stock like GME so there is no use in holding it, it doesn't work the same way.

Cryptocurrencies and stock are different things, but the principal is similar. The more people buy and hold, the more the price will rise. The difference is inflation and I covered that earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

5. This is not a stock, it can't be shorted.

There are markets that allow for cryptocurrencies to be sold short, so this is just useless noise.

&amp;#x200B;

6) Dogecoin was started as a joke.

Elon Musk: ""I started The Boring Company as a joke. Now it's digging real tunnels!"".

&amp;#x200B;

It's clear that there are a lot of shills and smart-asses here fear mongering and also the fall was coordinated by outside forces, but all of you, who held steadfast are the reason it's not tanking. Just to keep it balanced on 0.02-0.03‚Ç¨ is a huge milestone and will be the reason DOGE will take off again! The same happened to GME: it fell a lot after the market manipulation by RobinHood and others (as they are attempting with DOGE also), but the people who believed in the cause didn't falter and carried on. DOGE is not YET such a big movement as the GME and a lot of people got scared with the price falling, but thanks to this awesome community and your belief in it, the price is stabilizing much higher from where it started from. This will make more people trust in the movement and make it bigger as time goes by!

Whatever the shills or the fainthearted say about the differences in a stock of an established company and a cryptocurrency that was started as a joke, remember this: it's the belief in something that makes or breaks literally anything's success.

Don't forget: This movement is also for a cause. Getting a decentralized cryptocurrency to take off by regular joes and become mainstream will hurt the elite and  just as much as the hemorrhaging from GME. GME movement took a while before it grew to such a big movement and also BTC took years to get where it is today. Dogecoin has a huge advantage over BTC and that is it's already so popular.

The best thing to do is share information about DOGE on all social media platforms, keep it trending and explain the cause to others. Another extremely important thing is to follow all of the DOGE social media accounts and like/share/comment their content to get them trending (Remember: The guys and gals making the accounts and content are the main champions of this ride, so let's give them all the support we can). This will get more people to rally behind us and help get everyone to the moon, leaving the elite in the swamp they belong!

Please post any DOGE social media platforms you know in the comments, so we can get more traffic to them!

&amp;#x200B;

\*UPDATE\*

The cause is for a decentralized currency, that is already popular among the masses, to become a mainstream currency. This would be in contrast to the banking system that rules the world and get bailed out by the governments, which in turn means that the tax payers are the ones who suffer. The average joe doesn't care about the useful real world application of a cryptocurrency, but they do care about memes and whatever is funny. There are a lot more average joes than there are people who think about the useful applications of cryptocurrencies in technology/science/etc. If the average joes unite and use the same tactics as the super-rich use, to get a cryptocurrency to take off and be a widely accepted form of payment, then it's the same cause as the GME movement is about. Sticking it to the man. The masses don't have millions and billions to play around with, but the masses are in the billions, so if millions or billions of people unite behind a single cause, they can do the same thing as the super-rich can.

personalfinance,Roth IRA the Next Financial Step,"I am contributing more than my company‚Äôs 401k match and have set up monthly payments to pay off my student and car loans.

The next step of my financial journey is to set up a Roth IRA. I know advice on this page tells me to payoff all of my debt first, but the S&amp;P 500 averages 10% yearly gains, which is much more than my interest rate and with comping interest an IRA is something to start earlier rather than later. I will be putting a monthly amount towards it and I have some questions regarding how they work.

Roth IRA vs IRA:

Through prior research I feel Roth is the better option because of tax and the freedom to take out my initial investment.

Where to to put the money:

ETF/Index/Mutual Fund - I understand how ETFs work and really like VOO/VOOG/VOOV where I can diversify my money with both growth and value. These ETFs have great historical gains, but are Index/Mutual Funds better? Even with the higher expense ratios?

I invest through Fidelity so is there an advantage to invest in their funds? If so do they have a ETF/Index fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500 similarly to VOO?

When to sell?

personalfinance,"Idaho Income Tax, PERSI Pensions, and Non-Residents","Background: To make a long story short from 2016-2017 I worked as a public employee in the State of Idaho. As a public employee, I was eligible and required to contribute to the Public Employees Retirement System of Idaho (PERSI) Pension fund. I also had a 401(k) with the PERSI system as well. I was never vested in these systems. I let the money I paid into these accounts sit until this year and as I was no longer a public employee in Idaho I was ineligible to make additional contributions. I sold my shares and cashed out.  I did not roll over these funds into another retirement account or investment account. I took the funds as a straight cash payout. As a requirement of selling my shares and taking the funds in cash 10% of both accounts was held for federal taxes. No funds were withheld for Idaho state income tax.  


My question is whether or not I am required to pay Idaho State income tax on those funds? While I was working for the State of Idaho, I was not an Idaho resident. I lived in a boarder town and was a Washington resident during the time I worked for Idaho. I was still required to pay Idaho income tax, but at a lower rate than residents. However, at the time of the payment, I was living in Nevada (no state income tax), again though as a Washington resident. We are a military family and have maintained Washington as our state of residence. As I prepare my tax returns for this year I am confused as to whether or not I am required to file in the State of Idaho and whether or not I am required to pay Idaho State Income tax. I am not looking for a way out of paying any tax I owe, I just am genuinely confuses whether or not I am required to do either.",finance

stocks,FOR EVERYONE NEW TO INVESTING: A COMPREHENSIVE BREAKDOWN OF TRADING AND MANIPULATION STRATEGIES!,"**Current Conditions of the Market:**

Let me be clear: this is not the typical conditions of the market where stocks fluctuate double and triple digit percentages per day. There‚Äôs a place for that - the casino. In recent weeks, herds of new traders are pouring into the trading scene hoping to get a piece of the volatile market that has turned the rags to riches, or the other way around. The stock market as a whole, under normal conditions, moves gradually in both directions, guided by trends, innovation, speculation, earnings report, and financial changes. What we are in right now is a hysteria-filled environment that is risky for both veteran traders and novices. Any uninformed, reckless decision can produce different results - by chance. Be wise and do not let chance underlie your success or bankruptcy stories. Please do your research first before investing into anything and whatever you do, do not make the mistake of over-extending yourself with margin (brokerage-provided capital) that you cannot repay should things go south. People have and continue to make this fundamental mistake that will ruin them financially for years. Stock investments should be about long-term growth, stability, and supplemental to your income. Investments should give you access to the opportunity of financial freedom, but should not be your primary source for income. Do not listen to stock gurus and paid-only discord groups - they don‚Äôt make money from stocks, they make money from you. Lastly, this atypical market condition is the perfect storm for spontaneous ‚Äúpump and dumps‚Äù where stocks become inflated, and based on fool‚Äôs theory or musical chairs (whichever you prefer), the last one that gets out gets burned. Be smart, be patient, do the research.¬†

**Basic Stock Jargons &amp; Short/Long Positions:**

*Long* \- you‚Äôre buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value.

*Short* \- you‚Äôre borrowing shares from a lender (brokerage, investment firm, individual investors), selling it to someone, and hoping to buy it back at a lower price. Your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price. I‚Äôll provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex:

* Person A is a share lender. They want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation.
* Person B asks Person A to lend him that share temporarily. Person B does not pay anything upfront, but he promises to pay Person A in the form of interest over time.
* Person B finds a buyer Person C. Person C wants to buy a stock so it can go up. Person C is ‚Äúlong‚Äù on this stock. Person B, however, is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down.
* Person C pays Person B $10 for the stock. Now, Person C has spent $10, and Person B has gained $10.¬†
* Two hypothetical situation happens now:
   * Scenario 1: Stock value increases to $15. Person C is now up $5 and he sells because he‚Äôs making nice gains. Person B needs to buy back that share at $15, but he only gained $10 profit initially. Now he needs to fork up $5 to buy back the share, and then return the share back to the lender + any interest accrued. In this scenario, the ‚Äúshort‚Äù lost money, the ‚Äúlong‚Äù gained money, and the ‚Äúlender‚Äù made interest money.¬†
   * Scenario 2: Stock value decreases to $5. Person C is now down $5 and he sells to cut losses. Person B needs to buy back that share at $5, but he already has $10 in profit initially. Now he pays $5 for the share, leaving him still with $5 profit, and returns the share back to the lender + any interested accrued. In this scenario, the ‚Äúshort‚Äù made money, the ‚Äúlong‚Äù lost money, and the ‚Äúlender‚Äù made interest money.¬†
* The above scenarios help to show why ‚Äúshorts‚Äù (typically hedge funds or experienced traders) might want to manipulate the stock price to go down. Hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market, which I will explain in a bit, and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves. Shorts, therefore, have the opposite intention of longs. They want share prices to go down, and in the process, can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat. In other words, when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value, the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt, grow the business, develop new products, pay for expenses, etc.¬†

**Market Manipulation:**

Market manipulation is not new to the scene. Investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics, and every day, we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks, specific categories or industries of stocks, or the entire market. Market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator. In this case, these are the wealthy ‚Äúwhales‚Äù or hedge funds, both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds. Keep in mind, not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are ‚Äúshorts‚Äù. Some are ‚Äúneutral‚Äù and act as lenders to make money, some are ‚Äúgrowth-based‚Äù and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices, and others are ‚Äúshort‚Äù which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch. Below, I will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales.

**Manipulation Tactics on a Spectrum:**

Market manipulation can happen in certain stock, sectors, or the entire market. There are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know, but I will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it.

*Scenario 1:*

Let‚Äôs say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. Hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value, so they can ‚Äúhedge‚Äù or protect themselves, by selling put options. When they sell puts, they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge, which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration, but on the contrary, they will be collecting the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put. At the same time, this hedge fund will slowly ‚Äúcover‚Äù, or buy shares of Stock X, so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money. The manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock, both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover. If they want to add another level of manipulation to this, they can also purchase call options, which will result in profit if the stock price goes up. In this scenario, hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy.

*Scenario 2:*

Let‚Äôs say a hedge fund just opened a short position on Stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. This hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position (by buying shares, selling put options, or buying call options), so they try a different route. Keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets, meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops. Take for example, if Apple and Google began to hurl downwards, this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss. This in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly. Conveniently enough, hedge funds own a lot of these big name ‚ÄúFANG‚Äù stocks.

¬†If I am a moderately sadistic hedge fund, I can sell off a large holding of shares (in the scale of multi millions or billions) that are in the same sector as Stock X, which would incite fear across the sector, creating panic sell offs. The price will drop sharply across the board, including Stock X, and the short position will produce big profits. Because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price, they can now cover their short position (essentially getting rid of it), and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier, only this time at a much cheaper price. The hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position, but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again. This can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades, publicizing ‚Äúnewly‚Äù purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it, etc.¬†

*Scenario 3:*

This one involves technology: algorithm trading (commonly referred to as algo trading). This one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around. Algorithm trading is the process of using high-speed super-computers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise. In this case, the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market, which makes this 100% legal. How this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made. For you general investors, we have mobile apps and web-based trading platforms to trade. When we like a stock, we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol, the amount of shares, the price we are willing to pay, hit submit, and confirm the trade. For hedge funds using algorithm trading, all this is done autonomously, which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker. When an order is submitted, it goes through a brokerage (Fidelity, Webull, ETrade, TDA, RH, etc.) and the data is rerouted to a clearing house (intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade). Clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled, but they take it on a first come first serve basis. So if a stock is moving quickly, hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster.¬†

Algorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios, which is why they can almost guarantee profit. Algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability, and it acts on various factors such as volatility, volume, interest activity, news, etc. In some cases, these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things. I‚Äôll start by talking about ‚Äúmarket orders‚Äù vs ‚Äúlimit orders‚Äù. Before you make a trade on your brokerage, you will notice an option that says ‚Äúmarket order‚Äù or ‚Äúlimit order‚Äù. Market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time. There is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time, there may not be anyone selling at a good price, and instead, some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices. For example, some people set a sell limit at $1000 for GME. If you did a market order, and you get really unlucky, you might end up snagging a share for $1000 each, when the actual share value might be $300. However, when you set a ‚Äúlimit order‚Äù, you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated.¬†

In the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company, the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit. Remember, when they buy or sell, it‚Äôs processed significantly faster at the clearing houses, so if you‚Äôre that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock, you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves. Moral of the story: DO NOT PURCHASE AS MARKET ORDER - ALWAYS PURCHASE AT LIMIT ORDER.¬†

dogecoin,Reasoning of Doge Coin to $1,"I wanted to make a post of some reasoning as to why doge coin will go to at least $1 in the near term future.  

* Before the most recent break out in popularity, doge coin was performing relatively well.  The largest part of it's popularity is around the branding of it.  Since doge has been a famous meme template for the majority of the modern internet, younger investors will be more likely to be drawn to it as an investment.  Your time horizon is long when you're young, so why not buy this highly volatile yet promising currency.
* While right now the majority of focus is on GME, AMC, BB, etc, doge coin is gaining in popularity just as fast.  The entrance of crypto currency into the market is wild because of how quickly it takes off.  After the war that is happening on wall street subsides, there will more than likely be many sellers with excess capital, a long time horizon, and high risk tolerance.  These investors may see doge coin as a speculative investment.
* The entrance of using doge coin to make micro transactions/small online purchases will evolve into being just as acceptable as paying with bitcoin, lite coin, lucky coin, etc.  Doge coin is currently accepted at few online sites.  The more it increases in value, the more online sites will move to accept it as a form of payment.  
* Since it is not tied to most currency's way of supply and demand where a central bank can implement quantitative easing, doge coin and other crypto currency's use a block chain to allow a fixed number of coin be implemented to the market.  This ensures stable inflation rates, supply, and a sufficient market cap for global investment.  It will have prominence in the future as technology grows at exponential rates, and many central banks will struggle to pay off debts when interest rates are raised over the next five years.  

I have been thinking about what may happen for doge for a couple of months now, and I am open to hear some other perspectives or thoughts on what is in store for doge coin.",cryptocurrency
stocks,The case for Rocket Mortgage $RKT,"Here is a brief DD on Rocket Mortgage (RKT)

**Mortgage market is hot**

Seems like after the scare of COVID in Spring, the real-estate market has been hot, and consequently  new mortgage loans have been sky high in 2020. Low rates, bored people, hot real-estate market has made people think of buying a new house or second home due to COVID-working from home. Try and buy a condo in a popular vacation spot, or places like Miami. In few areas that I am thinking of investing in real-estate the condos are gone within a week of listing, sometimes within a day. Which made me think about companies that profit with this hot real-estate market. 

In addition, mortgage rate is 3%, which makes owning a real-estate a great hedge against inflation. If inflation kicks in then the $300k condo today will be $400k in few years. And your house payment will be much lower in today‚Äôs money versus in 5 years.

**Mortgage numbers in 2020 gave been best ever**

December mortgage numbers 26% higher than year ago (Refi up 102% from last year)

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html)

January mortgage numbers 16% higher than year ago

For the year, Load Origination on volume grew 71% annually, but the data is even better, because if you consider the refi‚Äôs which do not add to the volume, there was a 158% growth in refinancing YOY.

 [https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/)  

If rates start to increase we may see even more refi efforts in 2021 to capture the low interest rates.

**Alright, so why Rocket Mortgage?**

Well it is often in the **top 3 best rated mortgage companies**. In addition, the company‚Äôs its primary focus is mortgages unlike Chase of BoA. So if mortgage numbers are good, then their numbers will be really good because their revenues is heavily depended on mortgages. 

Brand recognition \- It‚Äôs probably one of the most recognizable names for mortgages. Their website gets over 110 million visits per year.

They are innovative, they have developed a directory for all of the local mortgage brokers. Now this is interesting. They are listing the brokers and do not charge any fees for the leads to the brokers whether they work with Rocket Mortgage or not for the load. That‚Äôs lost revenue right? Well, I think that they are building a good relationship with the local brokers, so that the brokers can get the origination fee and then send them business back to get the loan via Rocket Mortgage.

**Share ownership** 

They IPOd around $21.50, then went as high as $30m, and then dropped to $20 levels. Short interest in Rocket Mortgage is 30%. But the leadership team owns 95% of the entire Rocket Companies parent company. So this shows huge insider holding of this company, which clearly indicates their strong belief in this company. Check out their CEO‚Äôs message to the shorts [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html)

There will be a buzz for rocket mortgage. They will have two superbowl ads this year to stay current and in people‚Äôs minds.

stocks,The Green American Dream (MSOS DD),"TLDR: I think American Cannabis could be the next hypetrain after short squeeze euphoria. (Which is the sequal to EV euphoria). Buy MSOS. If you want concentration, check out MSOS holdings. I personnally like Cresco. 

Do you guys like the color green? Well I do, because it's the color of money, and it's the color of what can potentially make us all ALOT of money. Cannabis. Not just any Cannabis. United States Multi-state Operators [MSO's]. I'm sure all of you have heard of the CGC's, the TLRY's, and the ACB's. Well I'll tell you right now, those are all dogshit in comparison to the US MSO's. None of the Canadian cannabis names are cashflow positive and they reek of overvaluation. In this post, I will focus on the big dog CGC, which is somehow trading at a 20x Enterprise value to Sales multiple. That's higher than the software industry, which is on average ~15x.

I'm sure a lot of growth in the US is priced into the Canadian names, but they barely have ANY sales in the US. It's ridiculous. Even the Canadian Chiefs and Top Dogs realize the money is in the US, as they are using their extreme overvaluation to bully and try to acquire some of the US names. CGC, specifically, is targeting Terrascend, who has a large New Jersey market share. (Side note, New Jersey just legalized recreational Cannabis). The reason the Canadians are trying to add exposure in the US market is very simple. Total Addressable Market [TAM]. The Canadian TAM is 25 Billion. The US TAM is double that, 50 Billion. WITHOUT FEDERAL LEGALIZATION! If it were to be legalized federally, TAM should go parabolic. The Canadians know where the real money is to be made.

That leads me into my next point, TAM and valuation. CGC, specifically, has increased revenue 50% from last year, but their operating income is at double the LOSS from last year, while the expenses have also increased 50%. The US MSO names are growing operating profits exponentially. Cresco is one name that has picked up steam. They own the Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania markets, essentially, but they also have a market share in NV, AZ, MA, CA and NY. (NY recently mentioned potentially legalizing recreation cannabis). They recently expanded into Florida through the acquisition of Bluma Wellness. Most of these US MSO's are looking at doubling their operating profits from last year, and they are even hindered because their share offerings must be done in Canada, which puts them at a huge disadvantage when raising equity. Additionally, these MSO's are currently trading at a 5x EV/Sales ratio, which is a huge discount compared to the Canadians. If it were valued similar to CGC, it could multiply by 15 from it's current price. MSOS is an ETF that includes the big US MSO's and some others. As the ETF gains value, the shares gain value and vice versa; they are symbiotic.

My opinion is that this is free, but you need to be patient. The US MSO's will eventually find similar value (x15) to the Canadians while the Canadians take a shit in stock price. (It's just a matter of when.) The main catalysts that I am on the lookout for are the passing of either MORE or SAFE. With the US Senate flipping blue with Kamala being the tie breaker, it's VERY likely that one of those will be passed this year. Democrats skew towards the legalization of Cannabis, but currently, covid is taking priority over other legistature. MORE and SAFE have both passed the house, now it's just up to when the Senate decides to put it up for a vote. If MORE or SAFE are passed, then the US MSO's can list on US Exchanges (like NYSE), and you guessed it, that will cause an exponential and euphoric increase in the share prices. A lot of institutes and funds cannot buy the MSO's right now, which may have caused them to take position in either MSOS or Canadian names. Once these the US MSO's can list on the US exchanges, the institutes and funds will crowd into big four names, which will cause MSOS to explode, which will also endorse more buying in US MSO names. It'll be a snowball effect. (Not to mention how options will also be available for them, which also can help that ""snowball"" keep rolling.)

Now I realize there's a lot of hype in meme stocks. After the hype for those have died down, remember this post. Save it even. This will be the next hype train. My prediction, is that MORE/SAFE is passed within 3-6 months, probably after more covid vaccines rollout and we get closer to herd immunity. Then from there, by Dec, US MSO's will nearly x4.",finance

I tend to put 500/mo toward the credit cards (three: 2500 utilized out of 3000, 7700 utilized out of 11,000, and 0/3000 on the third. The first two both have high interest rates, which is of course the problem). Credit score is now good (\~715 and  steadily climbing). The rest goes to groceries, gas, etc. I supplement my income with a side-hustle, which usually brings around 300-400/mo, but inconsistently. When I have something leftover it goes in the savings, which is now at 3250$. Half of that came from the 2020 stimulus checks. I live fairly frugally, although I'm not on the beans-and-rice diet. I don't eat out or do takeout, haven't been on vacation in years, and my hobbies are pretty cheap.   

My car is 20 years old, still running well, but it is near time to move on. I'm not looking for anything fancy but I want another long-lived vehicle, and on paper I think I can swing a 300/mo payment (it's hard to imagine though; I feel like I live hand-to-mouth). I was planning to hold out until something goes wrong with my current car, which could be tomorrow, could be next year, and in the meantime supplement the savings as much as I can and keep whittling away at the credit debt. When I realized I could entirely zero out the first credit card, that seems like I have to do it - and bonus, my rating should go up a little which will be important when that car loan rolls around. But it will deplete the savings to about 700. My 2020 tax return should be 450$, and if we get the 1400 stimulus payment from the government, that will bring me back up to a decent down-payment on a vehicle. But we have no guarantees yet on that stimulus check and I'm a little terrified of having little-to-no money in savings.  I'll redirect what I was paying into that card into the other one, of course. 

Am I right to pay off one card now, if it risks me having less to put down on a financed vehicle at some random point in the probably-near-future?",finance

1. Line 3 appears to be about dependents and asks me to add the results from the two previous questions.  My answer to both of the questions is ""0.""  Do I still enter $1,372 on line 3?

stocks,The REAL Silver Misinformation Campaign - IMPORTANT,"I present to you silver stocks, physical, miners, and the entire picture. How to play this and why it‚Äôs a HUGE opportunity despite what some misinformed people believe. I am a millennial in my late twenties. This post could be a lot longer but I attempted to shorten it for time‚Äôs sake.

Silver is the most undervalued and heavily manipulated asset in the world. To understand why, you need to understand the fiat banking system. The Federal Reserve, other central banks, and ultimately the International Monetary Fund are all PRIVATELY owned. They profit from printing money out of thin air and loaning it to the government (aka we the people) at interest. The problem is that the amount owed is always greater then the amount borrowed (thanks to interest) and we have to keep borrowing more and more money to pay off an always growing debt. 

The school system teaches you that this is called ‚Äúinflation‚Äù and it is a ‚Äúpowerful tool to keep the economy growing‚Äù. I call it a clever system to steal your wealth. What if I told you that the revolutionary war was fought to free ourselves from the Bank of England. Once we won the war, the US printed and issued its own currency. The money was backed by precious metals and each year the budget sheet was balanced at zero.

Did you know Abe Lincoln released the greenbacks which were printed by the government (aka we the people). And JFK issued executive order 11110 which was going to have the government print and issue money backed by silver.

Insert Thomas Jefferson quote..
""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered. I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.‚Äù

Now what does this have to do with silver. Silver is real money. And the banks have been suppressing and manipulating the price because they want people to put their faith in their fiat currency that they print out of thin air and is backed by NOTHING.

‚ñ∫ For every one ounce of silver, there are 300 paper claims to it. Talk about a short squeeze if everyone requested delivery on the Comex!

‚ñ∫ The gold to silver ratio has always been 15:1 for most of history, right now it‚Äôs around 66:1. It‚Äôs even been 2:1 at certain times.

‚ñ∫ Wait there is more! Go to usdebtclock.org and look at the dollar to silver ratio in 1913 vs today.. this might give you an idea how far this can really run.

‚ñ∫ Going ALL THE WAY BACK to Rome in the first century, most reserve currencies have lasted about 100 years on average. The US started in 1920 and guess what year it is.. I wonder if that‚Äôs why the economic forum keeps saying ‚Äúthe great reset‚Äù..

‚ñ∫ There is no example in all of history of a fiat currency that has survived and retained its value.

‚ñ∫ Silver at this very moment should be worth at least $200. If the paper contracts weren‚Äôt manipulating the price is would easily be $2000 or more.

THIS IS THE WAR OF ALL WARS. $GME showed we can stand together, but why does that matter when the hedge funds and banks will be bailed out in the end. Just like the crash in 08 it‚Äôs the people who suffer the most. This cycle will always continue until we stand together. BUY PHYSICAL SILVER. You don‚Äôt need a corrupt brokerage either SO THEY CAN‚ÄôT STOP THIS.

Now since this is r/stocks I want to address the stock market play..

1) buying physical is the most important, there are some stocks that attempt to hold reserves and mirror the growth of the price of silver such as $SLV. People claim Citadel owns calls in this -which is true- but they also own puts. Citadel own shares in Tesla. Should we stop investing in that? Citadel plays both sides of the game -the only way to take them down is to break the system. I still wouldn‚Äôt buy $SLV. If you want a stock that holds physical reserves, I would go with $PSLV instead.

2) silver miners. Again, the primary battle is owning physical, but during a bull market owning some of the miners can help you earn massive returns as the price of silver appreciates. Some of my favorites are $AG, $PAAS, $MAG, $CDE, $HL, $FSM, $USAS, $GLGDF, $AAGFF, $ASM, $BCEKF, $AUMN, and $HCHDF. A lot of DD goes into picking these, including location and potential size of the operation but that‚Äôs another post for a different time. Consider this a starting point. I aim to have a healthy mix of explorers, mid tier, and top tier.

Henry Ford ‚ÄúIt is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.‚Äù

TLDR: buy physical silver, 200 price target, $1000 if the paper market breaks. Add in some silver miner stocks to ice the cake. It‚Äôs not about the money, it‚Äôs about changing the world! If everyone in the US bought 3 or 4 ounces the game is over. You should own a little anyways! We need to buy 150M ounces to create the short squeeze of all time.",finance

Hi all! I believe the marijuana industry presents unique growth opportunity through legislative change. Here‚Äôs why I am long the sector and eyeing options..

Last week, Chuck Schumer accounced that Marijuana Reform Bills are being merged as Congress moves to legalize.

This is massive news, in fact, Stifel is calling this a Goldilocks Scenario for companies like Tilray.

&gt;2021 should be a year of ongoing regulatory movement; expecting 2022 to mark the biggest wave the reform movement has seen so far

The marijuana industry is a beaten down industry with banking restrictions &amp;amp; short interest through the roof. 

US Legalization is just around the corner and no one is talking about it. 

I strongly encourage everyone to research some companies and potentially get in before the media gets ahold of this story.

Here are a list of cannabis related companies you can look into with options:

Aphria, Tilray, Canopy Growth, Organigram, Aurora, HEXO

(Many MSOs still trade on the OTC, but will be pushing to uplist in the near future. Keep an eye on Curaleaf, Trulieve, Cresco Labs &amp; Green Thumb)

There are also ETFs available with US exposure such as $MSOS

Also, it is important to deepdive the management in this industry, as it is with any other. A good management with tegrity goes a long way. I won‚Äôt go into detail, but, we‚Äôve seen behind some curtains(walls) and it wasn‚Äôt pretty.

stocks,Long Thesis on Hostess Brands (TWNK) (Owner of Twinkies),"# TL;DR

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is an iconic brand, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

[https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue](https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue)

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won‚Äôt see a squeeze of GME‚Äôs magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call ‚Äúasymmetric upside‚Äù (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I‚Äôll describe below.

**So what‚Äôs the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can‚Äôt make this up)‚Ä¶

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public in 2016. The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there‚Äôs no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the their IPO (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So what‚Äôs the thesis?** We think there‚Äôs an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** ‚Äì Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we‚Äôre aware of (can‚Äôt really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** ‚Äì Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the retail pool of capital. If you‚Äôre looking for a bit of diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** ‚Äì There‚Äôs actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing ‚Äì and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells cr√®me wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the ‚Äúbetter-for-you‚Äù snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess‚Äô existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company‚Äôs primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Company‚Äôs largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don‚Äôt think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If you‚Äôre looking for a little diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals.

stocks,Not only evil hedge funds can engage in manipulation,"Allow me please to address this witch hunt that is going on against silver gang. I started posting about precious metals around spring 2020, because I thought that this is a great play as a hedge against inflation. Later, in the summer silver gang became briefly one of the dominant plays on wsb and other subs. And now we somehow found ourselves to become shills for hedge funds. As the quote goes ‚Äì you either die a hero‚Ä¶Recently it started with a post by RocketBoomGo about squeezing silver market on Thursday, that became viral. Few similar posts followed. I responded with a critique addressing that, although I support the effort, I strongly believe that SLV is a wrong instrument for this cause, since it will be sending cash to the exact banks which you want to take down. On the weekend it all evolved in hysteria that silver play is somehow designed to take away attention from GME. As an argument, it was stated that Citadel has a stake in SLV. Sunday evening, wsb mods banned most users who had popular posts about silver, including me, who advocated against SLV. I‚Äôve spent a day trying to figure out how I violated any rules. The truth revealed only after I contacted people in subs dedicated to silver. Most of those people did not violate any rules of the sub and got banned too.

Now this feud against silver gang spilled all over financial reddit. Let me address some of the arguments, that are made against silver gang and give you a perspective from the other side.

**1) Those are new users or users who were not active before, therefore they are shills**

That is partially true, many users promoting silver are new or inactive. That is because precious metals are mostly a play popular among boomers. Early previous weeks I started spotting on YahooFinance (ultimate boomer source, which I use for some screeners) in conversation rooms that boomers are discussing how can they participate in this reddit thing, since they were impressed by the squeeze and wanted to do the same against banks, who shorted silver. Now, allow me to explain: for decades now boomers are highly convinced (not without a reason) that silver market is rigged by the big banks. If you do not believe me, please look into videos and articles by Kitco NEWS or Butler Research. Seeing what we did to meme stocks, they finally got courage to try and do something similar in the field they know ‚Äì silver. They were truly inspired. But with this amount of hate, they are sure in for a rude awakening.

I get that new users look suspicious. You can walk pass, or downvote. But tell me, all of you new users, who joined after you‚Äôve heard about GME story on the news, how would you like it if OG silver gang members would crowd against you on the days you‚Äôve joined reddit and called you shills of Ryan Cohen? See how tables could turn?

**2) The media picked silver story very quickly**

That is a popular now narrative, that media is somehow supporting this silver rush to help hedge funds. First of all, please ask yourself ‚Äì were media really silent about GME? Were they silent about AMC and BB? No, absolutely not. This story is on every imaginable channel now, on every language, in every corner of the world. And before that? Did they really ignore crpto or tech stocks? No, they always jump on board, because they are chasing clout. Once silver got traction, media immediately followed through hoping to catch next sensation. The funniest thing is that precious metals community is convinced that media was always against them JUST AS MUCH AS YOU ARE convinced that media is against you. Just listen to Peter Schiff ranting about how CNBC is always shilling for big tech/crpto/fed or whatever, instead of giving fair coverage to precious metals.

**3) Please ask yourself ‚Äì** **Cui bono? Who stands to profit?**

Just like any other fella, I love stories about underdogs. Bunch of small guys taking on hedge funds. How can that not be cool? Reality is always not as black or white. Melvin Capital by the ranks of WallStreet is really a tiny fund. But they are portrayed as if they single handedly caused ‚Äò08 financial crisis. And it‚Äôs not like on the long side of GME are only small guys. Have you seen institutional owners of GME? BlackRock - 12.3%, Vanguard Group - 7.58%, Morgan Stanley - 2.86%. And so on. Yes, I get it, big chunks of that are brokers or ETFs. Yet still those companies profit from this action. Silver gang was convinced just as much that hedge funds are against us ‚Äì I was told that RH suspended trading SLV at some points and removed PSLV entirely.

Now, you have definitely asked yourself ‚Äì how are those silver pumpers motivated? They clearly are, it‚Äôs not charity, by the end of the day. But have you asked ‚Äì how are motivated the people who started the witch hunt on silver gang? How are motivated wsb mods, who delete any plays that could steal the highlight? Maybe those people are just as interested financially in keeping all your focus on one single play?

I honestly think, that people should openly suggest different plays and strategies and discuss them freely. We should pick our plays according to our strategies, not some rule of mob. Me having long positions in silver miners didn‚Äôt prevent me from praising GME play to my friends when it was still at $20. And I personally was on board with AMC (entered around 3.45, exited last Friday). Am I saying that there is no incentive to promote silver? Of course it is! I am absolutely convinced that financial institutions might even have efforts in this promotion too. But absolutely the same can be said about every massive play that has ever been on reddit, including the ones that seem to be a story of a financial Rocky Balboa.

I urge all of you to be civil yet critical to every side of each story. Always follow what is the best for you, not for the mob.",finance

Bitcoin,"Debunking Bitcoin criticism and why cryptocurrency is important. WSB, GME, Inflation, Corruption, Crash, Bailouts, etc. (For the newbies)","This is a longer post but I thought I would put my thoughts onto paper. When I tell friends about cryptocurrency they always have lame no research criticism. They also do not understand why it is important so I will tackle my view.  

1. They say it has no value. Bitcoin and crypto is the only competition to central banks, government currencies, the stock market, and the established Ponzi scheme that is our everyday money. They print money with no end and distribute it into housing, stocks, etc. The rich have more of these things then the average person so the money printing continues to increase the inequality wealth gap. The money printing needs to keep increasing or there is a crash. Interest rates need to be set just right or there is a crash. If there is a crash the rich establishments get bailed out and the everyday investor loses their money. The years following a crash the everyday investor also pays more in taxes to pay for the bailouts. Wealthy companies somehow weasel out of taxes with overseas tax laws. With all this going on why bother. Why not just use an alternative now that we have it.

My point is that bitcoin is the only competition to this scam that affects everyone. Lets imagine google created a currency not tied to any government. It is also the most secure database the world has ever seen. It is also global, borderless and permission less. Anyone can opt in without permission. No transactions can be censored. It cannot be shut down. It runs completely independent of google or any other central authority because a central authority over money will always be incentivized to print more of it helping themselves and debasing the rest of the supply. OH and it already has millions of users. HOW DOES THAT HAVE NO VALUE! THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SUPER IMPORTANT INVENTION DOES IT NOT!

2. They say it is used for illegal purposes.... Dude why would you use an immutable database that shows all your transactions. Law enforcement can sudoku their way back to you. If you wanna do something illegal use cash, or a gold bar. Something that can not be easily tracked back to you.

3. They say you can not buy anything with it. One friend even compared it to apple pay... ""How is that any better than apple pay?"" This is also a joke. Gold is not used to buy anything. You do not walk into a store with a gold bar/pick axe and chop a piece off to pay for something. Gold does not have value because you can buy things with it. Gold has value because people believe you can use it for jewelry/electronics and it is rare. Bitcoin can be used to buy things it is just not widely used as it is better to keep this asset that is finite. It has the technological advantage over gold so it will be better integrated in the future as well. Bitcoin has a greater use case and is much more scarce. As for the apple pay argument these two things are not in competition at all. Apple pay uses a government currency like USD to buy something. It is not an investment. It is not a competitor the central banks. It is not anything like bitcoin.

4. They say you can create an infinite amount of different cryptocurrencies therefore bitcoin is not scarce. You can create another bitcoin but you can not copy its network. All the people keeping the network secure makes bitcoin the most secure cryptocurrency. You can create another internet. Congratulations you created internet2. You and your mom can connect to it and share a video from one computer to another. When you want to return to the real world you go back to the one and only real internet.

5. How does it help the WallStreetBets situation? Well if you haven't noticed the wealthy established have scam after scam on their side. Even when they lose to the average retail investor they weasel their way out of it. Brokers block buying but not selling.... WHAT! How is that legal. Guess we should use the alternative that is decentralized exchanges. If companies used cryptocurrency for shares instead of the stock market all buying and selling can not be censored/blocked.

6. They say its a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is when new investors join and their money goes to old investors. The new investors do not make their money back until they get money from even newer investors. If you buy bitcoin you are taking bitcoin from the previous owner. Therefore you take their spot in the bitcoin ecosystem. Instead of being under them giving them your money you are replacing them. Instead of losing your money and waiting for it to come back you are holding bitcoin. You are holding an asset that has a limited supply. Saying this is a Ponzi scheme is like calling buying and selling land a Ponzi scheme.

Anyways just wanted to get this written down. I know my writing kinda sucks so if you want to show your friends feel free to edit this to sound a bit better and more profound.  If you guys have more criticism of bitcoin to discuss I would love to hear it and maybe I can debunk it as well.",cryptocurrency

I dont know anything about private wallets. AND I AM NOT AN EXPERT, DONT LISTENT TO ME FOR ANY FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!

Voyager App.

Due to the MASSIVE influx of new members after the RH debacle (over 250k in just one day), the app went through a lengthy maintenance period on Friday night and again on most of Saturday. Due to that, I think new members might be waitlisted. But aside from that:

Its free. Super easy to use. Once its downloaded you can be up and trading in MINUTES (assuming you aren't waitlisted).

EDIT: can now confirm. due to the mass exodus of RH users, new users ARE being waitlisted.

Funds transferred from your bank are IMEADIATELY available for use (but beware, it will take a few days for the transaction to clear your bank. If it doesn't, you will end up with a negative USD balance).

Has over 55 currencies listed (XRP is one, but cant be bought atm due to the SEC lawsuit) including Doge.

Offers monthly interest on ADA, ATOM, BAT, BCH, BSV, BTC, DASH, DOT, EOS, ETH, KNC, LINK, LTC, OMG, OXT, USDC, VGX (Voyagers own cryptocurrency, which is performing EXTREMELY well), XTZ, ZEC, and ZRX.

Interest rates are gained by holding at or above a set monthly average (different for each one), and rates range from 1%, to 3%, to as high as 8.5% in the case of USDC, requiring as little as $100 average or more per month.

Soon will be releasing a rewards program allowing members who hold 5k or 10k of VGX to gain benefits, including increased interest rates.

Has a desktop version in development/beta testing.

I started investing in crypto only a little over a month ago, with just $3.5k. I now have just over $8k, and most of the heavy lifting was done by VGX (over %10500 increase in the last year, %1629 in the last month.) I also invested in Voyager's stock, VYGVF, started at $7k, is now worth over $16k (went up $3.5K today alone).

I DO NOT work for Voyager, but I admit I might be a little biased. Haven't used any other exchanges. But this works really well for me.

Check it out. see for yourself. Take it or leave it.

50,421 DogeCoin purchased this morning for $2k and HODLing.

EDIT: Note, Voyager is EXCLUSIVELY a crypto exchange. You cant get stocks through this app.

PS: If you look Voyager up and like what you see, AND feel like throwing a good dog a bone, use my friend code when you enroll, (THOA1B) and ill get $25 in BTC. Or not.

CryptoCurrency,Analysis of Ripple's Affirmative Defenses,"Disclaimer: not a securities lawyer, just a litigator who is into crypto.  Doing this for fun (and perhaps to gauge interest in betting XLM on various outcomes in this case).  TL/DR - XRP is likely a security and Ripple had fair notice of this possibility.

In its Answer to the SEC, Ripple asserted seven affirmative defenses.  For the most part, they're trash. It's important to remember that the SEC bears the burden of proof in the case at large.  Ripple doesn't have to prove anything.  But when a defendant asserts an affirmative defense, the burden of proof may shift.  This means the court might ask Ripple to prove by a preponderance of the evidence (&gt;50%) that XRP isn't a security, that its exempt from registration, or something similar.  But regardless who has burden of proof, Ripple is in for a rough ride.

Here are the seven affirmative defenses:

**1. Failure to state a claim.**

Ain't nothin' here.  If you take everything in the SEC Complaint as true, there is definitely an argument that Ripple offered an unregistered security.   Likely, this was just boilerplate language.

**2. XRP is not a security or investment contract.**

This is the crux of the whole case.  The definition of ""security"" is intentionally vague in order to protect people from all types of fraudulent schemes.  Here's the most widely-accepted definition:  ""An investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party, it being immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise.""

Ripple is the single entity controlling the XRP ledger and the software that allows XRP to be used as a digital currency.  It sold XRP to raise money to develop the software to sue XRP.  Ripple could argue that, hey, we sold a product and used that money to expand our business; people who bought XRP didn't rely on us to increase its value.  I don't think that will work.  If a baker sells a bunch of bread and uses the money to open more bakeries, the customers still get to eat the bread.  They bought the bread to eat, not in reliance on any further action by the baker.  But what if a baker sold a bunch of bread and then said, ""You can't eat the bread until I open my special bread-eating cafeteria, which I'm funding with the profits from all the bread you bought""?  The bread wouldn't have any value until the cafeteria opened.  You'd only buy the bread in reliance on further action by the baker.  The bread's value would increase based solely on the baker's actions.

Bitcoin isn't like this.  No central entity.  Value increases based on increased adoption and use.  There is no one person or third party anyone is relying on to drive up the value.  (And as a practical concern, who would the SEC sue for offering Bitcoin as an registered security? Satoshi?)

Ethereum is even less like this.  Ethereum grows wheat, and lets you build your own ovens and develop recipes for your own bread.

This is my simple analogy.  If you want more details, the SEC spent a gigantic chunk of their [Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2020/comp-pr2020-338.pdf) talking about why XRP was a common enterprise and why XRP buyers relied on Ripple to create value.

**3. No likelihood of future violations.**

Here, Ripple is asserting that the court can't permanently enjoin the sale of XRP because there is no proof that, even if XRP is a security, that Ripple will continue to make unregistered offerings.  They may be right.  Permanent injunctions are extreme remedies.  If the court rules that XRP is a security, it would be much simpler to require registration before Ripple sells any more XRP in the US.  This is also the more likely remedy because it will punish Ripple and Co., not your average XRP holder.

It's possible that the court may enjoin certain people from being involved in the sale of XRP after its registered, especially if there's evidence of shady conduct.  But I'm pretty sure FINRA is the agency that decides who gets to trade securities.  A court isn't likely to issue a permanent injunction on behavior regulated by another branch of the government, but I have no special knowledge of the administrative procedures that would be at issue.  Maybe there is an appropriate judicial remedy here.

**4. Lack of Due Process and fair notice.**

I initially thought this defense had some teeth, but no more.  The [FINCen settlement](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/file/765721/download) states expressly that it is not binding on other federal agencies.  This means Ripple can't defend the SEC claim with the earlier determination that XRP was a virtual currency.  Maybe this sounds  a bit unfair, but the plain language of the settlement shows that Ripple was on notice that another federal agency could make a contrary determination about XRP.

Ripple also says it reasonably relied on an SEC official's public statement that the agency was looking at the ""present state"" of Ethereum, rather than its fundraising.  First, you're not Ethereum, my guys.  Dude wasn't talking about you.  Second, what you do is nothing like what Ethereum does.  Third, maybe you shouldn't take as Gospel what a govt official says on a Yahoo Finance panel.  Not exactly formal guidance.

I read the first paragraph of this defense as implying that Ripple didn't have fair notice because there's basically zero guidance on crypto regulation.  That's a fair point.  But Ripple's internal communications and legal advice from outside counsel show that  the company was aware of the possibility that XRP could be classified as a security.  Normal people go to jail for way less knowledge.

**5. Exemption from registration.**

I didn't feel like going down a statutory rabbit hole to figure out what exceptions XRP might fall under.  But if anyone wants to do that research, please do!

**6. Lack of extraterritorial authority.**

There are circumstances where U.S. federal courts have jurisdiction over things that happen outside of the country.  But these determinations are very fact-dependent and we simply don't have the facts to make an educated guess.

**7. Statute of limitations.**

The general statute of limitations on SEC enforcement actions is five years.  But on December 8, 2020, Congress passed a [bill](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/congress-gives-sec-game-changing-10-91769/) extending that to ten years.  The SEC filed its complaint on December 22, 2020.  But the complaint does mention tolling agreements with Ripple going back to April 2019.   Depending on the nature of those agreements, Ripple might be off the hook for any damages that accrued before April 2014.  This will come down to when the court determines the enforcement action officially began.

Style note: The SEC Complaint was much better written than Ripple's Answer.  I expected more from DVB &amp; P.

personalfinance,Is it smarter to put 5% or 20% down on a house?,"I'm moving soon for work and preparing to sell my house here and eventually purchase a new house in a new city. I'm going to make a good amount of money on my house sell, so I will have plenty of money to put 20% or even 25% down on a new house.

I was talking to a mortgage broker friend, and he was telling me that at these interest rates/PMI rates, it is smarter to put 5% down and bank/invest the rest. Some of his reasoning:

* You can easily make more in safe investments than you're paying in PMI and interest.
* You have plenty of money liquid for emergencies/unforeseen life changes
* If the housing market does crash again (he doesn't think it will), you'd have less risk of losing all of your equity--but he did mention that it would probably be accompanied by a stock crash, so the ""safe investment"" would also probably cost some money, but not ALL of the equity like a 2008 housing crash would
* If the market continues to rise, you gain the same amount of equity either way.
* If the market continues to rise and interest rates stay low, you could refinance when your equity hits 20% and get out of the PMI, and still have the original cash/investment money

I will have about $95k in savings by the time I'd close, and that would leave me about $15k in savings after closing.

I calculated my taxes yesterday, and I will owe about $10k this year since I am self employed and didn't pay quarterly estimates. If I pay the $10k in taxes now, I will only have about $5k in reserves after closing on house, which I am uncomfortable with. 

My two options are:

‚Ä¢ Pay the $10k taxes in April when I file, and do a %17 down payment. Pay down the extra 3% in October and pay PMI until then. 

OR

‚Ä¢ File a tax extension, pay $0 taxes in April, and do the 20% down payment. I would be paying the $10k in taxes later in October. According to tax penalty calculators, I would pay about a $500 penalty if I paid in October instead of April.

It seems to me like a no-brainer to just eat the tax penalty and do 20% down on the mortgage. My PMI would be \~$200/mo, and I'd have a lower interest rate if I did 20% down.

I split these 50% Roth / 50% Traditional, using most of my annual bonus + first few paychecks of the year. My net income from regular paychecks after the 401k is maximized is \~$3,300 per biweekly check.

&amp;#x200B;

If I place 20% down and purchase the condo for $950k, I estimate my monthly payment would be \~$4,500 - $5,000 after accounting for $750 HOA and property tax. Traditional ""how much can I afford"" calculators would say this seems reasonable on $200k income, but my fear is that I shouldn't get myself into a commitment with such a large reliance on my equity income. (Eg, I couldn't easily take a job at a private company with illiquid equity.) On the other hand, I don't want to put more than 20% down with interest rates so low (approved at 2.9% APY).

Questions for the community:

* As objective observers with no relationship to me nor emotion in this, what would you gauge as my maximum affordability in terms of price of property &amp; monthly payment?
* To what extent should I factor-in my RSU income into a home purchasing decision?
* What other questions should I be asking?",finance
dogecoin,"Forget memes, it is time to talk about the real deal","Newcomers have been fed with wrong information. It is the we talked with more serious tone about the doge. This talk will feed right info and help doge get to its deserved valuation.

Why do you think doge is going to be currency of the future?

Why no cap on doge is good? Why limited number of bitcoins creates artificial scarcity and inflated valuation.

Why redditors asking to increase the value of doge is not pump and dump? We are here to pump but not dump.

What can we do to increase acceptance of doge?

How can we get more positive press coverage?

investing,Potential Liquidity Fueled Bubble,"Hello All,

So i'm going to say upfront that I really hope that my analysis here is wrong. The fact that literally, NO ONE I've seen is talking about this indicates to me that I have to be wrong. But every way I look at it I come to the same conclusion. I'm really new to the investing game, but I have known about how financial markets and how the systems around them work since I was a kid though as my father is a trader for an oil company. So I'm not a complete idiot at least. A lot of this is parroted from other sources, some of which are even from reddit, though I have lost the posts I pulled from so I can't cite them. But I'm not INTENTIONALLY plagiarizing at least. I've posted about this in the wallstreetbets community but they are both idiots and so focused on the GME yolo train that they don't seem interested in anything else. I really hope that someone here can look at my analysis and point out where I'm wrong. So by reading and commenting you are doing me a huge favor so I appreciate it. I'm going to drop the TL;DR at the top and my evidence below.

TL;DR The behavior of the Federal Reserve (the Fed) of the last 20 years has created a market bubble with the value of the US Dollar. Their policies are based around constant and accelerating growth of GDP that is not a realistic goal from a practical perspective as even if there was the possibility of this there is always forces outside the market that affect GDP growth. (Such as a pandemic) As a result, the value of money in the economy is far far greater than the value of the actual dollars that exist. This has created a massive, if yet unseen, bubble that is bound to burst eventually with no real way for the Fed or the government to do anything about it. My expectation is that when this GME rocket goes off in the mother of all short squeezes we will see MASSIVE de-grossing and as a result a steep fall in the value of the stock market over all. Which will in turn cause a run on the banks just like what happened in the depression. When that happens the system will come completely unglued as since not only is there not enough cash on hand to give everyone, the debt backed by that money will no longer be collateralized so everyone is going to come knocking for their money. This sudden evaporation of ""money"" in the economy that's generated by debt will cascade and drive the value of the dollar to at or near 0. Triggering a global economic collapse.

The behavior of the Fed in the last 20ish years has been to progressively reduce the interest rate that they will loan money to banks to cover their minimum cash on hand amounts by law. This functionally increases the liquidity and availability of money in the form of debt as it allows the banks to make increasingly large amounts of loans for a profit. There's more going on under the hood than just the interest rate but it's historically the primary way that the Fed manages inflation and money supply. 

The Fed can't make large changes to the interest rate because to do so would not only shake confidence in the system but trigger amplification of the inflation/deflation effects on GDP, which in turn can further reduce the GDP due to decreased confidence by those with money to invest. You also don‚Äôt want to suddenly massively increase your money supply because this will amplify any effects increased money velocity has on inflation. Increased inflation will also lead to less savings and more people spending money as soon as they receive it. So gradually over time the Fed has decreased the interest rates to the point whereas of March last year they were effectively 0.

There is massive wealth inequality in the united states. This is not any new information to anyone. But why this matters is that a wealthy individual is far more likely to invest any money they get either through legitimate gains or through increased money supply by the fed than a ""regular"" person would be. This in turn makes it to where rather than circulating back into the economy as regular purchases of conventional goods like bread, milk, cheese, gas. etc. this money goes into investments such as the stock market. This is where the velocity of money comes into play. In short, the ""velocity"" of money is the rate at which it changes hands, usually due to the purchase and sale of real goods. Over the last 20 years the velocity of money has gone down dramatically as the wealth gap gets bigger and bigger.

The decreased interest rate has added more and more money into the economy through loans/debt. The new money supply, through loans, would be mostly issued for consumption, like a mortgage to buy a new house or a new car loan to buy a car. This will have the added benefit of increasing the velocity of money because this new money supply is recycled into the economy. After 2008, the Fed had to find a new mechanism, with interest rates being permanently too close to zero to have any meaningful impact on the money supply to actually help anything, especially since most Fed board members think that negative interest rates are a bad idea. With quantitative easing, direct purchases of treasuries artificially lowers the yields of treasuries and makes bonds and equities relatively more attractive when looking at risk / reward, inflating prices of those securities. We‚Äôve effectively reached 0% yield on the risk-free-rate during the last crisis, so the next logical step for the Fed was to buy other securities, like commercial paper and now bonds. Except the biggest holders of treasuries and bonds were actually corporations and high-net-worth individuals, who compared to regular people have a much lower propensity to consume, and would not at all address the lowering velocity of money. It also leads towards higher wealth inequality, as it inflates prices of those securities, and all other financial assets which are concentrated at the top corporations and individuals, which tends to be bad for velocity of money. In simplified terms, the increase in money supply goes towards the people who already held a lot of wealth. This is probably why we‚Äôre seeing a steep drop-off of money velocity after 2008, even after the economy has recovered.

Then you throw a pandemic into this. Suddenly all the variables are changing rapidly with the economic shock of the effects of the disease. This causes a dramatic drop in the velocity of money. At the same time we're having the biggest sudden drop in GDP in history, at the scale of the Great Depression. The positive feedback loops mean that if the Fed is not able to expand the supply of money enough, we‚Äôll quickly see a deflationary spiral. If they do too much, we quickly get into hyperinflation. The Fed has pretty much maxed out on everything they could have possibly done to keep inflation at 2% by increasing the money supply using tools they‚Äôre allowed to use. Interest rates and the risk free rate have been near 0% since 2008, and bond yields are already at unrealistic levels for the amount of risk they have, resulting in a skyrocketing increase in equities. Since none of these actually address the velocity of money issue, which has sharply decreased since March, we‚Äôre probably going to head towards a deflationary spiral.

This has lead to a situation where the true ""value"" of the money in the banks is way different than the value of the debt loaned out to the various parties buying assets in an effort to get greater returns on their investment than they would if they took a ""risk free"" stance. Hence the bubble. To put it another way, for every 1 ""real"" dollar in the banks there are many more dollars circulating in the economy/stock market due to collective debt and risk management.

The ""risk free"" investment of treasury bond's rate of return has reached effectively 0. So everyone is dumping their bonds, some of which aren‚Äôt even getting any bids when being sold, even briefly going into negative territory. Add on the fact that a substantial amount of non-US debt is denominated in US dollars, meaning governments and corporations around the world are trying to get their hands on USD to cover their debt payments with reduced revenue. The skyrocketing corporate bond yields make it virtually impossible for companies, even the ones with strong balance sheets, to raise their much-needed cash to survive through bond issuance.

How much longer can this last? Fed funds rates are already effectively stuck near zero; even in the ‚Äúbooming‚Äù economy that we‚Äôve had the past decade the Fed was barely able to raise the repo rate past 2% before the stock market started crashing in late 2018 and was never able to meaningfully unwind their balance sheet from all the quantitative easing they did in the Great Recession. Now they‚Äôve put their liquidity injection program on steroids with infinite QE. They‚Äôve reduced the risk of corporate bonds by saying they will be the bag holder if things go bad.

The key takeaway here is that increased liquidity from the Fed causes inflation of asset prices. And at the moment we are at or near maximum liquidity in the economy due to the gradually changing economic policies by the Fed. In an effort to maintain constant ""growth"" of the economy during the financial recessions of 2008 and now 2020 the Fed has made the bar for banks ability to loan money (that they don't actually have mind you as they are using debt to do so) so low that with the effective 0% interest rate they can loan out as much as they want since they can just buy the reserve cash they are required to by law for a rate FAR lower than they can get the buyer of the loan to pay.

All of this has made the value of the single dollar in the bank is far less than the value it produces in the economy. Remember the bubble part from earlier? Well this is that but on a massive unprecedented scale. Now this could continue for a while and inflation will continue, but the velocity of money will continue to go down and the wealth gap will continue to increase. This increased gap in wealth has made it to where a greater and greater percentage of wealth is in the hands of investment groups like hedge funds which themselves operate off of taking both long and short positions to ""hedge"" their risk, which is thereby rewarded by increased ability to buy due to the confidence the banks/investors have in the hedge funds. So if you as a hedge fund have 1 dollar and your creditor gives you access to 10 dollars for your long positions as long as you promise to take a 10 dollar short position as well. This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk, but in reality your 1 dollar is exposed to 20 dollars worth of risk.

Then comes along wallstreetbets. They notice the massive overshorting of GME stock. They take this opportunity to trigger the mother of all short squeezes to spike the price of the GME stock and sell at the top for huge gains. In other words, as the meme stocks like GME go up the highly leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. This is called grossing / de-grossing and as a result of this massive sell off of other assets, be it stocks, bonds, commodities, what have you. Cause the price to drop. You can see this in the effect the GME thing has had on the overall stock market just last week. What makes this worse is that since the price of the GME stock has risen the financial market sees the short position as increasingly lucrative as once the squeeze is over if they can bear through it they will see great returns. This causes a feedback loop as the GME buyers buy more and more of the shorted stock the price rises, which causes the price of other assets in the stock market to fall. And since the GME stock is so over shorted there is theoretically no limit on how far this could go.

So when the short squeeze on GME begins there is going to be an unfathomably large amount of de-grossing causing the value of all other assets to hit the floor. Much of the stock market‚Äôs value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so if GME (and other common shorts) skyrockets the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis.

This would be very bad obviously. But to make it even worse, when the GME bubble does burst all the wealth that's been put into it basically disappears. If it were just major firms that were getting the gains from this they could conceivably reinvest in the now catastrophically low valued stocks. But as a practical matter this is unfeasible as the time between the GME rocket and the reinvestment the run on the banks will have already happened. Additionally, so many of these shareholders are now low net worth individuals and they are far more likely to ""consume"" such as paying off debt or charitable giving such as we've seen on the WSB subreddit already. The sudden decrease in net value of the stock market will trigger a panic and just like in the great depression a run on the banks. Which the bank obviously can't cover because they have loaned out so much of their money that they don't have even a fraction of the ability to return actual dollar bills to their customers. Making this EVEN WORSE the fact that the debt accrued by the banks is so overvalued when the stock market crashes all their loans become basically worthless so not only do they not have no cash on hand from the run on the bank, they don't have any means to recoup the losses from the loans.

All this to say, the monetary policy of the Fed for the last 20 years has artificially increased the supply of money without actually printing more money. As a result, the value of the stock market is several times greater than the companies that make it up are actually worth. This is going to see an economic crash not just on the scale of the great depression, but several times greater than that. Plus the ""bubble"" here is not tulips, or mortgage-backed securities, but of the dollar itself. So when this collapse happens the value of the dollar will become basically nothing. As the world's reserve currency this will trigger a worldwide collapse, which will trigger an international run on the banks, which will have their own problems respective to their economies financial policies.

I have NO idea how to stop this. If it weren't GME now, it'd be something else in the future, we're just seeing it now due to the massive acceleration of interest in the GME stock due to wallstreetbets and it's subsequent exposure to the main stream media. There aren't any tools left in the Feds toolbelt to get this under control. Even if the SEC froze all purchase/sales of the GME stock (which would be incredibly unpopular anyway) that would only be a temporary solution as eventually some other stock will see this problem and we'll have to go through it all over again.

This isn't just bad, this is apocalyptically bad. And that's not hyperbole. It could realistically cause the complete collapse of the global economy. There won't just be bread lines, there will be no bread for ANYONE to have.

My earlier mentioned trader father believes this will cause essentially what happened in the great depression. But this isn't a great depression. This is potentially the collapse of the entire system. During the depression, the stock market didn't hit zero. Not even close. Additionally, there is no ""gold standard"" to get off of like there was in the depression. ALL of our money is fiat currency and is only backed by our collective faith in the government to continue to exist. But that goes out the window now, no one will believe the government can pull us out of this.

If you've made it this far and think I'm missing something or have too few brain wrinkles then downvote the shit out of me. But I don't think my analysis here is flawed. I really, truly, and sincerely hope I'm wrong. If what I proposed here goes down it will be unspeakably bad. So seriously, if you have an alternative viewpoint or idea to help solve the problem. I'd LOVE to hear it.

Even if every member of WSB became a millionaire because of sick gains from GME, if that triggers the run on the banks and subsequent devaluation of the USD those millions of dollars might not even buy you more than a handful of tendies.

defi,Vaults vs Lending,"Recently I dipped my toes in the water of actually using DEFI (besides DEX's) by putting my DAI in Yearn's V2 vault, earning about 15% APR. However, I just saw that Yearn's V1 Dai Lending vault is getting 32%. So, 2 questions:

1. Isn't the point of a vault to kinda pick and choose yield farming strategies for me? If so, why doesn't it just lend out my DAI as part of the strategy, since that's earning more than whatever it's currently doing?
2. Is there any other advantage gained by using the vaults instead of lending that maybe isn't accounted for in interest rate alone? Maybe the lending rates fluctuate a lot more?

I also understand there are other platforms out there but I figured this would be a good starter question to get me going on researching those.

personalfinance,Question about credit score and student loans,"So i had about 57K in student loan debt. I graduated in may 2018. my first payment wasn't due until January-ish of 2019. I made like one $200 payment and then i found i out i could pause the loan for up to 3 years total. anyway, i deferred the loans because i wanted to get settled and start making money at my new job without having to have that burden just yet. My deferment ended in February of 2020 and i ended up making a $300 payment. Then COVID happened and everybody had their loans put on hold during the pandemic. However, during that time i was rated 100% P&amp;T with the VA which qualified me for a total disbursement of my student loan debt. I just looked at the FedLoan website and sure enough it says everything has been paid in full. So my question is this...i have a 580 credit score. My loans have technically never been late or in collection of any sort despite me only making 2 payments towards it over the last ~2.5 years. Ive heard of credit scores going down once people finish paying off revolving loans. Do you think that my credit score will go up, down, or stay the same now that my loans are discharged and my debt to income ratio is low between my engineering job and monthly VA money.",finance

CryptoCurrency,How to earn passive income on your crypto holdings,"Now that the bull run has started and we all (hopefully) see the value of our crypto holdings go up, I have put some thought into how we can earn passive income on our holdings. In this post I will cover interest account-like services and not staking. This is a list of services I use and my thoughts about them.

**BlockFi**

[Blockfi.com](http://blockfi.com/)

Great way to earn passive income on your crypto. Up to 6% APY on Bitcoin and up to 8.6% on stablecoins. Interest payments are paid out monthly.

*Pros* \- very good UI, credible - backed by Gemini, no native token needed for higher rates, no lock-up period, available as mobile app and web interface, interest payments can be set to another currency (for example interest on USDC can be paid in BTC).

*Cons* \- Bitcoin higher rates ‚Äúonly‚Äù for up to 2.5 Bitcoin. Interest rates can be slightly lower than on other platforms, trading fees are high, expensive credit card.

Thoughts

I have been using BlockFi since November and it has been great. I especially like the clean UI and the fact that you can move your crypto at anytime. You have one free withdrawal per month so it‚Äôs a platform where you park your holdings and don‚Äôt move them around. 

**Crypto.com**

[crypto.com](https://crypto.com)

Crypto.com offers a range of products including an interest account feature called 'earn' with great rates if you are prepared to lock up your crypto. Interest is paid out weekly. You get better rates from 'earn' if you stake the native token CRO, this also gives you access to the debit cards with up to 8% cash back. 

*Pros* \- Highest interest rates in the business if you are prepared to lock up your crypto for three months, great debit cards with free Netflix and Spotify that pay for themselves within 1-2 years, a wide range of crypto available to trade, there‚Äôs a mobile app and an exchange.

*Cons* \- a history of changing staking requirements for cards on a whim, card delivery can be very slow, exchange not available for US users, native token needed for better rates (fixed sum), CRO has not performed well against BTC or USD the last couple of months.

Thoughts

Crypto.com has a bad reputation, some of it is deserved. Having said that, I never had any problems with them. I have locked up crypto in earn and always received my weekly payments. I have their VISA card that gives 3% cash back and it has made me $600 in cash back since July.

Another thing to note is that the cash back is paid in the native token CRO. The cash back is instant and can be converted to fiat or crypto at any moment.

**Nexo**

[Nexo.io](http://nexo.io/)

Nexo offers interest accounts and loans with some of the best rates in the business. They also offer their own debit card.

Pros - High interest rates, interest on fiat like EUR (which is great since their is no EUR stablecoin), modern app and UI, mobile app and web interface.

Cons - native token needed for higher rates (the amount scales up to 10% of holdings), to access the highest rates you have to accept payment in the native token. 

Thoughts

I have just started using Nexo. So far so good but I‚Äôm not a fan of holding a large amount of a native token, to access the highest rates you need 10% of your holdings in the native token. It‚Äôs great to be able to stake EUR with high interest, even at the base rate of 8% it beats every standard bank account.

**Honorable mention - Celsius**

Celsius offers similar services as the companies above. Unfortunately it is not available in my country.

**Diversify your risk**

Please be aware that this is not financial advice. These services are not insured like a traditional bank. If they get hacked or go bankrupt there is a risk that your crypto is lost. Always consider ‚Äònot your keys, not your coins‚Äô and diversify your risk.

‚ÄúFunko‚Äù google trends search traffic was up 20-30% in Q4 2020 (vs. Q4 2019)

Searches for ‚ÄúFunko‚Äù were up 2x in December vs the beginning of November 2020

After falling in December, ‚ÄúFunko‚Äù searches are trending back up to all-time-high levels

**FUNKO‚ÄôS DIRECT SALES INITIATIVES DRIVING HIGHER REVENUE &amp; MARGIN**

Funko Direct Sales (B2C) grew significantly in Q3 and likely to continue into Q4

¬∑ B2C business as a percentage of sales increased to 8% in Q3 2020 from 4% during the prior year.

¬∑ Funko‚Äôs e-commerce site grew over 150% vs. the prior year in Q3 2020

¬∑ The number of SKU‚Äôs on Funko‚Äôs e-commerce site rose tenfold since June 2020

*‚ÄúWe went from only 200 of our own products \[on our website\] as late as June this year, to now well over 2,000 products available on our website.‚Äù ‚Äì Funko CEO, Brian Mariotti*

Funko‚Äôs first ever Selena Pop! sold out online in just 40 minutes.

Funko‚Äôs Q3 2020 Gross Profit % and Operating Margin % were near all-time-highs for the company

¬∑ Funko‚Äôs Q3 Gross Profit Percentage of 38.6% was its second highest ever (behind only Q1 2020)

¬∑ Funko‚Äôs Q3 Operating Profit Percentage of 10.8% was its second highest ever (behind only Q4 2018)

¬∑ As Funko continues to grow it‚Äôs B2C e-commerce sales in Q4 and beyond, it is possible that gross profit and operating profit percentages could rise as well

Retail customers were able to shift their Brick &amp; Mortar inventory to their e-commerce channels to Funko unit sales

¬∑ Funko resellers who didn‚Äôt sell online were severely impacted by Brick &amp; Mortar closures during COVID stay-at-home orders. As 2020 progressed, some of these retailers were able to create online stores (e.g.- Shopify, Amazon, eBay, etc.) through which they could sell their Funko inventory.

¬∑ Larger retailers that already had an omni-channel presence were able to shift their sales inventory from their Brick &amp; Mortar stores to online fulfilment.

Funko has also created a mini-Pop! factory at its headquarters where customers can make their own custom Funko at a price of $25 each

¬∑ According to Funko, you can customize your Pop! using thousands of combinations. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúThink Build-A-Bear meets Funko Pop!‚Äù according to CEO Brian Mariotti.

¬∑ With a $25 price point, the margins are likely higher than the average Pop! figure that retails for between $10 to $15

**PARENTS BUYING MORE GIFTS FOR THEIR KIDS DUE TO COVID**

Parents likely splurged on their kids out of guilt of having shelter at home because of restrictions and to keep them occupied while they had to work at home.

¬∑ ‚ÄúFaced with rising transmission of the virus, state restrictions on retailers and heightened political and economic uncertainty, consumers chose to spend on gifts that lifted the spirits of their families and friends and provided a sense of normalcy given the challenging year. We believe President-elect Biden‚Äôs stimulus proposal, with direct payments to families and individuals, and further aid for small businesses and tools to keep businesses open, will keep the economy growing.‚Äù NRF President Matthew Shay

¬∑ ‚Äú2020 was an unprecedented year for the U.S. toy industry. The growth we‚Äôve seen in the toy industry speaks to the fact that parents are willing to put their children‚Äôs happiness above all else. The industry‚Äôs resiliency is very much underpinned by the reality that, in times of hardship, families look to toys to help keep their children engaged, active, and delighted. Put simply, toys are a big part of the happiness equation.‚Äù Juli Lennett - VP, U.S. Toys at NPD

Toy sales were strong in 2020 as US retail sales of toys was up 16% vs 2019; driven by pandemic spending

¬∑ According to NPD, ‚ÄúMuch of the growth in 2020 was directly correlated to the COVID-19 pandemic and the changing consumer behavior associated with widespread lockdowns and school closures, the disposable income diverted from other types of entertainment to toys, as well as the onset of federal stimulus checks.‚Äù

Consumer spending on toys increased measurably due to lockdowns; with strong performance continuing through the holidays

¬∑ Per NPD, ‚ÄúWhile toy sales through mid-March 2020 were flat vs. 2019, widespread lockdown measures led to an abrupt increase in sales. This was further amplified by the distribution of stimulus checks beginning in April, resulting in the strongest month of growth for the year in May (+38%). Toy industry growth peaked again in October with an increase of 33% when the holiday season kicked off with Amazon Prime Day along with other retailer deals the same week.‚Äù

Key retail sources reporting significant sales growth during Q4 2020 suggest Funko sales performance was strong

¬∑ Target Q4 sales were fantastic showing signs of retail strength with a consumer that overlaps well with the Funko

\&gt; Overall comparable sales were up 17.2%

\&gt; Comparable digital sales were up over 100%

\&gt; Store-originated comparable sales were up 4.2%

\&gt; Store traffic was up 4.3%

\&gt; Average ticket size was up 12.3%

¬∑ GameStop Q4 sales were solid; showing additional potential for Funko sales

\&gt; Same store sales were up 4.8% in Q4 2020

\&gt; Online sales increased 309% in Q4 2020

¬∑ According to the NRF, 2020 Holiday Retail Sales were up 8.3% compared to the prior year despite the pandemic

\&gt; A surge in online shopping drove the increase (rising 32% vs. 2019)

\&gt; The increase of 8.3% was over double the average increase of 3.5% that the industry had seen over the last five years.

**MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME TO SPEND AT HOME BY NOT GOING OUT**

The National Retail Federation (NRF) says that strong retail performance has been driven by consumers with stimulus checks and extra savings from not going out or traveling

¬∑ ‚ÄúThere was a massive boost to consumer wallets this season. Consumers were able to splurge on holiday gifts because of increased money in their bank accounts from the stimulus payments they received earlier in the year and the money they saved by not traveling, dining out, or attending entertainment events‚Äù ‚Äì NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz.

Spending on ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù fell significantly in 2020

¬∑ The US Travel Association forecasts that spending on travel fell $500 billion in 2020 from $1.1 trillion in 2019

\&gt; The industry has lost about 40% of its direct travel jobs (about 3.5 million jobs) in 2020; driven by a reduction in business travel

\&gt; Foreign visitors to the US fell about 75% in 2020; driving a $119 billion reduction in travel spending

¬∑ Concert spending is down dramatically

\&gt; Live Nation reported a 98% decline in concert revenue in Q2 2020 and a 95% decline in concert revenue in Q3 2020

\&gt; About 5.2 million tickets were refunded in Q3 2020 and 23.3 million tickets had been refunded so far in 2020 (as of the end of Q3)

¬∑ Movie theater attendance is down substantially

\&gt; AMC theaters saw a 97% decline in attendance and a 91% decline in revenue in Q3 2020

\&gt; Cinemark saw a 96% decline in revenue

\&gt; Marcus Corporation (which also owns hotels and restaurants) saw a 84% decline in revenue

\&gt; Studio Movie Grill filed for bankruptcy

¬∑ Other anecdotal information points to more stay-at-home activity decreasing recreational spending

\&gt; Chuck E Cheese‚Äôs declared bankruptcy

\&gt; Dave &amp; Busters is considering bankruptcy and plans layoffs of +1,000

\&gt; CiCi‚Äôs Pizza declares bankruptcy

\&gt; Starbucks saw fewer customers, reduced store hours, increased store closures, and a 5% decline in revenues in Q4 2020. This has led them to plan a shift to more ‚Äúto-go‚Äù formats

\&gt; Many Las Vegas Hotels and Casinos have decided to close ‚Äúpart-time‚Äù during the week due to lower attendance and travel.

These include Encore, Rio, Linq, Planet Hollywood, Mandalay Bay, Park MGM, and Mirage

The majority of food buffets at the major hotels and casinos have been shuttered for the time being

Stimulus checks and other government programs to support consumer spending provide tailwinds for retail activity

¬∑ The US government authorized more than $10,000 per person in stimulus spending in 2020 over the course of five relief bills totaling $3.5 trillion

¬∑ More stimulus spending is expected; including a potential $1.9 trillion package that could include an additional $1,400 in stimulus checks

**MORE SKUS / LICENSES ARE GROWING AND EXPECTED TO CONINUE STRONG**

Active properties continue to rise and are expected to grow well into the future

¬∑ The number of active properties in Q3 2020 grew 15% over 2019

¬∑ Active properties grew from 644 in Q2 to 715 in Q3 2020

¬∑ The potential universe for Funko Pops! is limitless as new films, tv shows, musicians, anime characters, sports stars, and other media properties are created every year.

Some of the hot properties for this year and beyond

¬∑ Star Wars: Baby Yoda, Mandalorian, Rey, Valentine‚Äôs Day, etc.

¬∑ Marvel: WandaVision, Deadpool, Lucha Libre, Spiderman, Venom

¬∑ Anime: Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Bakugan, My Hero Academia

¬∑ Films: Harry Potter, The Goonies, The Mummy, Fast &amp; Furious

¬∑ TV: The Office, Umbrella Academy, The Queen‚Äôs Gambit, The Simpsons

¬∑ Sports: NFL, NBA, MLB, WWE

¬∑ Others: Disney, Pokemon, etc.

Retail exclusives can grow the potential universe of licenses and increase retailer buy-in

¬∑ For example: A retailer like GameStop could lobby Funko to make a GameStop exclusive of the WallStreetBets Kid like this person suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/l8wdqd/request_a_wallstreetbets_kid_funko_pop_i_think_if/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). (The exclusive Pop! would be made into a limited edition and sold only to GameStop to sell at their stores)

**COLLECTIBLE INVESTMENTS ARE GROWING IN VALUE &amp; POPULARITY**

¬∑ Funko: The average Pops! Figure has a retail price from between $10 and $15 which allows most people an affordable entry point into collecting. Over time some Pops! Figures increase substantially in price; from $50 to $100 to even several thousand dollars. While some collectors buy Pops! as primarily an investment, many more buy them as a way to show their fandom. Whether they are avid Star Wars, Harry Potter, Pokemon, Sports, or Anime fans; collectors build large collections and show them off to friends.

¬∑ Sports Cards: To those paying attention, sports cards have been on a massive run with some cards worth more than your parent‚Äôs house and your sister‚Äôs car. Since the pandemic started, the demand for sports collectibles from basketball to football to soccer (and many others) has skyrocketed. Countless videos of box-breaks and pack openings have become the norm on social media. Some of these boxes are being purchased for tens of thousands with ‚Äúhits‚Äù ranging from several hundred to hundreds of thousands.

¬∑ Collector‚Äôs Universe: This company that grades sports cards and other collectibles has tripled in value since June 2020. The number of sports collectors grading cards has exploded as demand rises. The popularity of grading sports cards is expected to maintain as prices continue to rise and the hobby becomes more mainstream.

**ANALYST COMMENTARY AND FINANCIALS ARE A POSTIVE FOR THE STOCK**

Piper Sandler: Upgraded Funko from ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù to ‚ÄúOverweight‚Äù (raising their price target from $6 to $12).

¬∑ Analyst Erin Murphy sees evidence of ‚Äúsubsequent revenue pillars‚Äù with their recent launch of Snapsies at 800 Target stores; along with an expansion into board games and its digital efforts, which include a newly launched website in six European countries.

Valuation Comparison: Market Cap / Revenue (TTM)

¬∑ Funko: MC - $604 million / Rev - $640 million (0.9x sales)

¬∑ Mattel: MC - $6.27 billion / Rev - $4.43 billion (1.4x sales)

¬∑ Hasbro: MC - $13.13 billion / Rev - $5.17 billion (2.5x sales)

Key Financial Trends For Funko

¬∑ Q3 2020 EPS (Adjusted) = $0.31

\&gt; Third highest ever (only Q4 2018 &amp; Q3 2019 were higher)

¬∑ Q3 2020 Revenue = $191 million

\&gt; Fourth highest ever (only Q4 2018, Q3 2019, and Q4 2019 were higher)

¬∑ Q3 2020 Revenue increase vs prior quarter of 94%

\&gt; Q1 and Q2 2020 saw significant declines due to COVID

\&gt; Q3 2020 only down 14% vs Q3 2019 despite Q2 2020 being down 49%

\&gt; Q3 2020 strength driven by Funko adapting quickly to online in the US market. (Q4 2020 revenue growth could be aided substantially by Funko‚Äôs development of their e-commerce shop in Europe.)

¬∑ Q3 2020 SG&amp;A was reduced 20% vs. the prior year as Funko rationalizes costs and adjusts to focus more on D2C e-commerce

**TL;DR**

After a tough summer, Funko sales have rocketed back in Q3 to near where they were pre-pandemic; setting up a potentially historic earnings for Q4 2020. Google search activity suggests that Funko is as popular as ever and is set up well for a strong year in 2021. People are spending less on ‚Äúgoing out;‚Äù instead buying things to use at home and presents for their kids. As time passes, Funko‚Äôs status as a popular collectible only continues to gain momentum.

Their direct sales initiative allows Funko to capture additional margin by sidestepping traditional brick and mortar retail to reach their customers. Investments in collectible products like Pops! and sports cards continue to increase in popularity and price. And the company continues to release even more products beyond Pops!; including games and apparel. While some Wall Street Analysts have already begun to take notice, a strong Q4 earnings announcement can drive even more attention to the stock.

personalfinance,Expected Return of a Nest Egg and Best Use of it?,"I'm trying to determine what a realistic return over 18 year of a nest egg I have and how best to utilize it. 
After getting in our dream house with a 2.25% mortgage we put no down payment down and do not pay PMI due to VA Loan (Funding fee exempt).  
Combine that with other savings and we $290K in cash.  
Retirement is on track and we have no other big purchases coming up. Kids college is on track.  

I feel the best strategy is to invest this money and then use it to increase our consumption/quality of life in 15 years when the kids are older.  When the kids are older they might appreciate the traveling better, better things etc.
  
Using a compound interest calculator, 8% over 15 years I would have $920K.  Now do I need to adjust that for inflation?  Or how should I think of that $920k? With that I could drawdown the fund at least $50K a year and not run out of money assuming a 8% interest rate.",finance
stocks,PSA: Don't forget about Capital Gains taxes!,"I hope everyone is keeping safe from Corona and having fun while you make your trades. I just wanted folks to be aware of something important, CAPITAL GAINS TAXES. If you‚Äôre super lucky and get that $1 million trade, awesome, you deserve it. But Uncle Sam (or whatever he‚Äôs called in your home country) will take his cut, and you have to keep that money separate from your other investing, or you‚Äôll be sorry later.

In the U.S. LONG-TERM capital gains taxes are super low, to encourage and reward investment. Long-term investing rates are 0% if your income is under $40k, 15% if it‚Äôs between $40k and $441,450, and 20% if $441k or more. Piece of cake.

But this is trading, so you‚Äôll be paying SHORT-TERM capital gains, which in the U.S. is counted just like income. The income brackets are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%. This means if you‚Äôre a young dude trading in between your Uber jobs, you will pay a reasonable amount of taxes on your realized gains. But if you‚Äôre a high earner, paying 37% Federal and up to 13.3% if you live in California, you need SAVE half of those gains, because they‚Äôre entered when the gain is realized. The WORST thing you can do is realize $1 million (or whatever) in actual gains, then go on to piss away those profits in other stupid moves afterwards, because the government will still want their cut.

Happily, ~~your income tax bracket is determined by your actual income (1099‚Äôed wages, income from rents), and not by the actual gains themselves~~. (Seems this is not correct, see comments for discussion.) 

(While I‚Äôm here I‚Äôll ask anyone not up on this stuff to learn how marginal or maximum tax rates work. You basically pay $0 on anything between $0 and $9875, 10% on $9875 to $40,125, 22% from $40,125 thru $85,525, and so on, meaning your actual tax rate is a blend of all of these tax rates. I meet so many people who think that earning $1 more makes their entire annual income suddenly taxed at a higher rate, I swear...)

TL;DR, if you make any short-term money from all of this, talk to a smart professional who will tell you how much tax you will owe. Put that money in a separate bank account because you‚Äôve already spent it. Oh, and ‚Äúforget‚Äù to tell any family and friends about your windfall.

Best of luck to all of you!",finance

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-2-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow looks for back-to-back gains after last week‚Äôs decline

&gt; * The Dow is set to rise over 200 points at Tuesday‚Äôs open, looking for a second day of gains after last week‚Äôs nearly 3.3% decline. The 30-stock average Monday clawed back 229 points of Friday‚Äôs 620 point drop as Wall Street appeared to shake off concerns about the speculative retail trading mania that largely drove the market‚Äôs worst weekly sell-off since October.
With gains Monday, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were once again positive for 2021, joining the Nasdaq. However, the three stock benchmarks remained below last month‚Äôs record closing highs, with the Dow over 3% away and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq each about 2% away. Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon are set to report quarterly earnings after Tuesday‚Äôs closing bell.

*****

&gt; # 2. GameStop‚Äôs decline accelerates as Robinhood raises more money

&gt; * GameStop continued to lose ground in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket trading, with shares of the volatile retail investor-favorite sliding 40% to around $133. The tumble follows a more than 30% drop during the regular market session Monday after last week‚Äôs 400% gain, which saw shares as high as $483 each. Before Tuesday‚Äôs open, the stock had gained more than 1,000% in 2021 as users on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum talked up the videogame retailer and crushed short-sellers betting against the stock.
Robinhood said it raised another $2.4 billion from investors to weather the extreme market swings due to the trading frenzy in GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks. The overall $3.4 billion the online brokerage has mobilized since Thursday exceeds its total funding amount since its founding in 2013.

*****

&gt; # 3. Pfizer raised full-year guidance after mixed quarter

&gt; * Pfizer expects to sell about $15 billion in coronavirus vaccine doses this year, the U.S. drug giant said Tuesday as it reported mixed quarterly results. Adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents per share fell 6 cents short of expectations. Revenue in Q4 rose 12% to $11.68 billion, exceeding estimates. Pfizer also raised full-year guidance. Shares were flat in the premarket. Pfizer has said it expects to deliver 200 million doses of its two-shot vaccine to the U.S. by the end of July.

*****

&gt; # 4. Democrats move to go it alone on Biden‚Äôs Covid relief package

&gt; * Democratic congressional leaders took the first step toward passing a sweeping coronavirus relief bill without GOP support, as President Joe Biden on Monday heard out a much smaller plan from Republicans. The Republican lawmakers on Sunday put forward a $618 billion counteroffer to Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion rescue package. The GOP proposal would send a smaller $1,000 direct payment to many Americans, and extend a smaller $300 per week federal unemployment benefits boost and only until June 30. Biden left the door open to passing a bill without Republicans if he cannot reach a deal with GOP lawmakers.

*****

&gt; # 5. CDC requires face masks on airlines, public transportation

&gt; * Travelers on planes and public transportation, like buses and subways, are required to wear face masks, staring Tuesday. To curb the spread of Covid-19, the CDC issued the mask-wearing rule late Friday that builds on executive action announced by Biden on Jan. 21. The enforcement, which could include fines, will be handled by the TSA and other federal, state and local authorities. The order extends to waiting areas such as airports, train platforms and subway stations. Airlines already require masks and have banned more than 2,000 passengers for refusing to wear one.

&gt; **United Parcel Service (UPS)** ‚Äì UPS reported quarterly earnings of $2.66 per share, beating a consensus estimate of $2.14 a share. The revenue also came in above estimates for the holiday quarter.

personalfinance,Keep three loans or apply for one new one,Hi Y‚Äôall - I am planning on buying a house later this year and have a question regarding what would look better to a mortgage underwriter. Right now I have three outstanding personal loans for ~10k each paying 10-11% interest. I just saw that I was qualified for 30k loan at 7% interest. So obviously from a financial perspective it would be better to consolidate at the lower interest rate but my question is - Would applying for a new loan in the year I apply for a mortgage hurt my application more than just having the three existing loans on there with perfect payment history?,finance
personalfinance,How do I file an out of pocket 2019 HSA contribution made in 2020?,"In 2019, my employer contributed $500 to my HSA, but I contributed nothing. In 2020, I decided to contribute the remaining $3,000 with out of pocket, post-tax dollars, to hit the 2019 limit of $3,500, before the July 15, 2020 deadline. This was after I filed my 2019 taxes. My understanding is out of pocket HSA contributions are tax-deductible ‚Äì how do I file this? Do I need to submit form 1040-X for both federal and state (NJ)? Is there anything else I need to file, such as a revised form 8889, or does 1040-X cover that?

economy,Abolition of Interest on Outstanding and Future Federal Student Loans,"Student loan debt, as currently structured, is killing the financial lives (not to mention the mental and emotional health) of nearly 45 million Americans. Borrowers are losing sleep at night over payment of their loans due to negative amortization at standing rates of 5-7%, depending on the year issued (the current moratorium not withstanding). It is also killing every major industry and market, including housing and car loans. College graduates are not contributing to these sectors because of the interest on their student loan debt. 

Student loan debt cancellation is laden with political and social controversy, so that is off the table. However, inaction would be much worse as the bubble of outstanding student debt continues to inflate. Therefore, the most moderate and sensible solution is the abolition of all interest and fees for which federal student loans incur. Borrowers are still on the hook for repaying what they borrowed, but only what they actually borrowed. The only penalty for non-repayment is damaged credit and possible collection notice. 

This is not just a political issue, but an economic one. The damage to the economy by the compound interest on federal student loans is staggering. The voluntary nature of the contract is inarguable, but the economic damage of the compound interest is nationally evident. It is time to change this for the better.",finance

I had already set it to tax the full amount of taxes out before being deposited into my account. When I put in the info from the 1099g though, It lowers the expected federal return by about $1000.

investing,Vy Global Growth (VYGG) - Reddit Merger,"Vy Global Growth/Reddit

**Linking everything together**

* Reddit last valued privately at 3B.
* Generally SPACs can do a merger with a company up to 10x the capital pool.
* VYGG raised 575M. This would likely give Reddit an IPO valuation of 6-8B.
* Alexander Tamas (AT) is an expert on social media/internet businesses.
* AT previously invested in FB, Twitter, Reddit, and Mail.ru. His VC fund, Vy Capital, owns some percentage of Reddit. Specific ownership stats not disclosed.
* Steve Huffman, Reddits Co-founder and CEO, is on the Vy Global Growth Board of Directors. He is not affiliated with any other SPAC.
* The VYGG prospectus specifically allows the Sponsors including Vy Capital to ‚Äúself-deal‚Äù which allows them to bring one of the companies they have previously invested in public.
* AT has over 140M of his own dollars invested in VYGG common shares. This incentivizes him to only partner with a strong business that can truly grow over an extended period of time.
* Reddit is a founder-led social media technology company with 52M daily active users and 440M monthly active users. Exactly the kind of business laid out in the VYGG prospectus.
* If Reddit can successfully monetize that audience it could be worth hundreds of Billions someday.
* Steve Huffman‚Äôs goal is to offer every person an opportunity to join communities that they align with. He dislikes instagram/facebook and wants to enable people to interact with each other ‚Äúauthentically‚Äù.
* Reddit has recently posted job openings for roles to lead an IPO of the company.
* This means Reddit is ready to go public and now, because of VYGG, has an easy and fast way to get into the public market.
* It usually takes between 30 and 90 days from the SPACs letter of intent to the actual merger date, so this could happen over the next six months.

**What happens if I‚Äôm right and Reddit merges with VYGG?**

* Companies with similar user statistics have valuations in the tens of billions. Twitter - 41B, Pinterest - 43B, Snapchat - 83B.
* If reddit goes public for 6-8B then shareholders of VYGG could see a rapid revaluation up to 30-80B. That is between a 3 and 13x.
* Reddit has multiple communities of stock and options traders. Most notably [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) (WSB) which has grown from 1.8M members at the start of January 2021 to 8M today.
* WSB has a mentality of doing crazy YOLOs using OTM call options. Recently some in the community have been taking out student loans, leveraging them, and putting the cash into weekly expiry 100%+ OTM call options on companies.
* I am bringing this up not because it's a good approach too investing, but to illustrate the mentality that goes along with these trading communities. Those 8M members represent billions of investable dollars that could be used to bid-up the price of their favorite social media platform, Reddit.
* This means there will likely be a ‚Äúmania‚Äù if/when Reddit goes public.

**How each Member of the BOD fits into helping Reddit Grow**

* Alexander Tamas: VYGG Chairman - Social media and internet business expert.
* John Hering - VYGG CEO - Cyber security expert. Lots of experience scaling online platforms to millions of users. Strong aversion to the misuse of data. Fits with Reddits values.
* Hugo Barra - VYGG Board Member - Experience with expanding technology companies userbase internationally (Xiaomi). VP of VR at Facebook. Fits with social media narrative.
* Justin Kan - VYGG Board Member - Founder of Twitch.tv. Social media expert. Would be a useful Board Member for Reddit.

**Investment Case**

1. Worst case: I‚Äôm wrong and VYGG doesn‚Äôt merge with Reddit. They fail to find a decent business combination and the cash in the trust is returned to the shareholders. Currently it is expected that around $9.2 of cash is in the trust per common share so at my $10.20 cost basis I lose a dollar per share.
2. Medium case: I‚Äôm wrong and VYGG doesn‚Äôt merge with Reddit. They find a different business combination and the common shares trade up to between $12 and $20 per share where I sell pocketing a 17-90% return in under two years.
3. Best case: I‚Äôm right and VYGG merges with Reddit. The market is still very expensive due to mass hysteria and low interest rates. VYGG/Reddit becomes a meme stock and millions of Reddit users buy in significantly punching up its price. Reddit combines the hype-ability of being a technology and social media business and the stock goes parabolic. In this scenario the price range will be dependent on the original IPO price. If it IPOs at 6-8B I could see VYGG shareholders making multiples of their original investment in a *very* short period of time (less than two-three months).

Disclosure: I hold no position in VYGG or VYGG/WS.

personalfinance,Best options for short term investments (6-12 months),"In the current low interest rate environment, what are the best options for short to mid-term investments?

My wife and I have successfully built a solid 6 month emergency fund of $20,000 and are currently keeping that money in a high yield savings account through AMEX Savings. It yields 0.50% APY currently which is decent for a savings account right now. She has around $30,000 in student loans that are now in forbearance through the end of the year. Instead of making payments yet, I'd like to save as much money as possible until the interest is about to kick back in (and hopefully some level of forgiveness but we will see) then make a large payment. It makes the most sense to me to earn at least a little something on these savings rather than pay down the principal that is not accruing interest.

Right now we've got \~$10,000 saved in addition to the emergency fund. What are some solid options for investing that money plus an additional $1,500 per month over the next 9 months or so? Most CD rates over that kind of term aren't even as high as the savings account rate that we're getting. Any recommendations? We have no real need to keep this investment liquid given we're both lucky enough to continue working and have a solid emergency fund.

I get the intention of WSB - the financial system is completely and utterly broken, and fighting it is *good*. Hedge funds are tiny little fish though, and the Bitcoin community had spent years fighting a war so much bigger than that. The war against Central Banking.

The scale is completely and utterly different. **All** the Hedge Funds in *the entire world* managed just over 3 trillion dollar's worth of assets in 2019 - accumulated over many decades, in many countries.[1]

The United State's Federal Reserve *created* more than 3.4 trillion USD in 2020 alone.

Yes, one central bank printed in one year more money than is managed by all the hedge funds in the whole world.

*This* is what Bitcoin is up against. This is the scale of this war. **And this is the war we're here to win.**

personalfinance,Refinance Auto Loan,"Hello all,

I want to explore refinancing my vehicle to save money.

Current: Financing since mid-2020
Vehicle - 2017 Vehicle, original loan amount of $10,000 at 7% APR with loan term of 7 years.
Current balance: $6,000

Desired: Financing that ultimately reduces the total amount of interest I am expected to pay.
I want a refi-auto loan that give me an actual competitive rate. My credit score was 710ish when I applied for my original loan from the dealership, and I feel like that was absolutely bs because of my credit score. I calculated a total amount of about $2250-2500 interest being paid for the car throughout the life of the original loan. So far, I've paid $270 in interest and it's been half of a year. I understand it's amortized meaning that aim mostly paying the amortized interest in the front end of the loan, but I want this to be better.

What do I need to know when I am refinancing my auto loan? What target interest rate should I be getting with 740ish credit that is worth it to refinance. I do not know if double-paying front end amortization interest is a possible thing, but I want to save where I can.

Is it feasible to aim for a new 3% APR for $6,000 refinance maybe for a shorter loan term? 24, 48 months? On a longer relative loan term with the same principle and the same APR, am I charged more for interest immediately as it is amortized to fit the longer life of the loan? 

Please share any knowledge I can benefit from, thank you. This is my highest interest debt and this needs to go.",finance

personalfinance,How do I explain inconsistent work history during my interview in a way that doesn't get me immediately excluded?,"Hi! SO I have an interview Friday and I have a question.


My work history is kinda jagged. I had a lot of trouble holding a job from 2012 (entered the workforce) til 2016 (finally gave up and got on disability) for more than about 6 weeks due to mental health issues. Since that time I have made massive strides, including coming off of all of my psych meds. I do see a therapist once every two weeks. 

Honestly, I have never felt better. In September I decided to try going back to work and honestly I found a job fairly quickly as a hostess at a local chain restaurant. I was looking for a serving position, I had an offer for a serving position at a different restaurant, but I was told that I would be able to move into a server position soon and so I opted for the hostess position because it was a chain restaurant (my husband is military and I thought working for a chain would make it easier when we have to move, like I wouldn't be as likely to have to start from scratch with a new company) and they promised to move me up to a server position as soon as one opened up. They also insinuated that the tip-out that hosts receive is pretty hefty and that was why they paid us minimum wage. 

Well, a few weeks into employment I found out that 3 other hostesses who had been hired before me had all been given that promise, and that they already didn't have enough hours for the servers they had. Okay, COVID, I get it. I think its worth mentioning here that they were also understaffed on hosts. Decided to stick it out. Over the next few months, I saw 4 different hosts come and go as well as several kitchen staff. They moved one of the hosts up to server about a month after I started. Okay, we're making progress. Around the new year they had 2 servers quit and moved another server up to management. So one of the other hostesses who was promised a server position and I asked if they had a timeline for when we might get to cross-train, even just to be able to pick up shifts or be called in if someone doesn't show up, and we were basically told it wasn't going to happen, that they had no plans to add any servers any time soon. We were frustrated, but we generally liked our coworkers and needed the money so we said ok. 

Well, around mid-January I had a family emergency and had to go to FL at the last minute. They were very understanding (very much a family first philosophy there which was great) and told me that they couldn't promise to hold my position until I got back (I wasn't sure how long I'd be gone) but they'd hold it as long as they could. Great. Well, while I was in FL I got a call from one of the newer hosts asking if I could cover her shift, I told her I was still in FL and I couldn't. She informed me that she was the only host left after the rest of them quit almost a week prior and she was just burnt out, and that she was going to put in her notice as well. 

I want to point out that on a Friday and Saturday night we run our butts off with 3 hosts and a busser (they have not had a dedicated busser since I started but generally a host will work that position, which has a higher hourly rate but doesn't get tipout). I have worked 2-4 peoples jobs on my own probably at least 60% of the shifts, including busy shifts where we did $2000+ worth of sales in an hour. I did the math and including tip out, I've averaged $10-$12/hour including the shifts were I worked the higher paying busser position - Target pays $15 for cashiers here (much less physically demanding). And I've wound up with shin splints several times after 4 hour shifts. Anyway, I made the decision (after consulting with my husband and therapist) to turn in my two weeks' notice after I learned that I would be doing the job 100% alone. 

So that job lasted from the end of September until mid January. I know that doesn't look great on an application/resume. What's the best way to explain why I left the position after such a short time? I worry that, coupled with my work history from 2011-2016, it looks REALLY bad and nobody will want to hire me. I believe honesty is the best policy and I don't feel like people hold it against me that I struggled with mental health issues back then, but I worry that this makes it look like they aren't truly in the past. Historically I do really, really well in interviews, and I have NEVER had a complaint about my work. Even back in 2011-2016, I worked myself to the point of burnout and that's why I couldn't maintain employment.

tl;dr: Due to health issues, work history shows several jobs held for 6 weeks or less from 2011-2016, then nothing til Sep 2020, when I rejoined the workforce. Unfortunately the job I got turned out to be awful, underpaid and overworked plus false promises made during hiring, so I stopped working there mid Jan 2021. Now looking for a new position and worried how to make a good impression and explain work history to maximize chances of being hired.",finance
personalfinance,How to Account for Parents Taking Whole Life Insurance Policy Out on Me,"Hello,

I lurk this sub but decided to create a burner to solicit advice on my situation and how to best position myself financially. If you think this post fits better in a different sub please let me know.

I describe my situation immediately below and added additional information that may or not be helpful at the bottom.

My parents have been estate planning and recently told me that they wanted to start transferring some of their estate to me. Specifically, they are going to purchase me a whole life insurance plan worth a couple million dollars. My parents see it as a way to give a gift that could last a lifetime and find the cash value aspect attractive. My parents have said they could see me using the cash value to purchase a familial house, to borrow against in general, or dwindle down in retirement. Additionally they like that we will be able manage the investing of that that cash value. At the moment this is the only transferring of their estate that is planned/I have been informed about.

The specifics of which plan will ultimately be selected is still being worked out with financial advisors but a rough estimate would be that the cash value of the plan would increase \~13K every year (+ any gains the investment of that cash value produces). Their contribution would happen every year for 20 years or so until it is paid-up permanently. I am very grateful for their generosity and forward thinking.

I try to be as responsible as possible with my finances while trying to enjoy life (a few more concrete details below). I am not sure how, if at all, I should change how I am operating. Should I contribute a little less to retirement? How should I treat the cash value of the plan? Should I be more aggressive in my investing knowing I will have money being invested automatically (for lack of better phrasing)? Perhaps I should consider things I am not currently doing? Anything I should know regarding Whole Life Insurance and the cash value that people generally don‚Äôt know or misunderstand? I have obviously been educating myself but as plan options have not yet been sourced/finalized I am left to generalities.

My parents are very set on this gift, and as it is their money, I believe they can and should do with it what they want. **Advice concerning my parents' decision would not be particularly useful. It would be most helpful for advice to be focused on how I can best structure and plan my W2 income and non-life insurance investments/how to approach the insurance plan and its cash value.**

*Additional Contextual details:*

¬∑ I am in my late 20s

¬∑ Stable job with sub six-figure salary

¬∑ Live in a HCOL area

¬∑ Save 20% of my salary towards retirement including match (75K+ saved between 401k and Roth IRA).

¬∑ Vested in a Federal pension

¬∑ 15K invested outside of retirement mostly invested in S&amp;P ETFs

¬∑ No debt besides a mortgage on my apartment

¬∑ Would like to find an investment property in the next two years

¬∑ Would like to move to a larger personal residence in the next 5-10 years (possibly sooner) if it makes sense

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

TLDR: My parents are taking out an insurance policy with cash value on me for my benefit. How should I structure my own finances in light of what will be a significant impact on my financial situation but is mostly out of my control.

stocks,Frequency Therapeutics - Phase 2 Results Day Approaches,"Wanted to bounce some thoughts off of you all about Frequency Therapeutics. The company has been a star in my portfolio since September, and with phase 2 results coming it's an exciting time. 

**Company Basics** 

Frequency (FREQ) is a clinical stage biotechnology company headquartered in Woburn, Mass. The company has been developing an approach to battling degenerative diseases based around activating [progenitor cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell#:~:text=A%20progenitor%20cell%20is%20a,into%20its%20%22target%22%20cell.), with its main clinical candidate right now, FX-322 aiming to regenerate hearing through creating cell turnover in the ears. Essentially, the drug aims to regrow hearing cells that are lost when damage occurs -- up to this point, when you lose those cells, they are gone for life. That's why hearing loss generally sets in over time and exposure and is degenerative. Other animals have this capability to regrow lost hearing cells, but humans do not. Admittedly, it sounds a little far fetched. But [phase one results](https://investors.frequencytx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/frequency-therapeutics-presents-results-demonstrating-sustained), released last September, showed long term improvements in hearing. Through testing word recognition, the drug showed promise in reversing the effects of hearing damage. [Phase 2](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04120116) results, done with increased dosages and a larger sample of participants, are expected by the end of Q2 this year. The stated aim, per the trial, is to combat Stable Sensorineural Hearing Loss, which makes up the vast majority of hearing loss cases.

[Here is the phase one data, graphed.
](https://imgur.com/a/16h3250)  


**The Market**

As someone who suffers from tinnitus, admittedly this companies work hits close to home. Although tinnitus specifically was not looked in the phase one trial, there is hope within the community that by mending the underlying cause of most tinnitus, hearing loss, ringing will be mitigated. Beyond that however, there is a huge market for hearing loss medications currently not being served. 

Currently, if you go to an audiologist and are assessed with hearing loss treatment is done through hearing aids. While these may help one live a normal life, they merely cover up the problem, rather than actually treating it. Hearing loss is one of the most common problems that the Veterans Affairs office deals with. [Urban living](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/hearing-loss-may-be-caused-by-cities-noises-and-music-thats-played-too-loud/2013/04/08/3b0bdd50-93c8-11e2-a31e-14700e2724e4_story.html) has also been linked to hearing loss, and as cities continue to grow and populations urbanize this could continue to be a growing market. I think FX-322 has the possibility to really change how hearing loss is dealt with medically. According to market research, [the hearing aid industry alone was valued at USD 8.39 Billion in 2018 and is anticipated to reach USD 14.45 Billion by the end of 2026](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/09/2122531/0/en/Hearing-Aids-Market-to-Grow-Exponentially-and-Hit-USD-14-45-Billion-by-2020-Derive-Gains-from-Innovations-in-Hearing-Aid-Devices-says-Fortune-Business-Insights.html#:~:text=09%2C%202020%20\(GLOBE%20NEWSWIRE\),by%20the%20end%20of%202026.). If Frequency can disrupt this industry not only could quality of living be improved but a lot of money could be made. At present, there are no approved therapeutic options for sensorineural hearing loss.

Worldwide, 466 million people have disabling hearing loss. About 2% of adults aged 45 to 54 have disabling hearing loss, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. That jumps to nearly 25% for people in the 65-to-74 range and 50% for those aged 75 and older. Details on this, and a number of players, including Frequency, can be found in [this fantastic article.
](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cures-for-hearing-loss-may-be-found-in-new-drugs-11568599440)

The World Health Organization estimates the global cost of untreated hearing loss is $750 billion annually in terms of the negative impacts on productivity, healthcare, education and society.

**Financials and Distribution Agreements**

The companies financial position seems solid to me.

[The largest institution investors in the company include Wasatch Advisors, Perceptive Advisors Llc, Rtw Investments, Lp, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc, and Federated Hermes, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/freq#:~:text=Lucchino%20David%20L.&amp;text=Ownership%20and%20Shareholders-,Frequency%20Therapeutics%2C%20Inc.,a%20total%20of%2027%2C594%2C671%20shares.) Approximately 81% of owned shares are owned by institutions. Blackrock, for example, owns 7.6% of the company. 

In 2019, Frequency entered into a distribution agreement with Astellas Pharma, a large Japanese pharma company. Details of the agreement can be [found here.](https://www.astellas.com/en/news/14841) [Frequency received an upfront payment of $80 million and may also receive up to an additional $545 million based on development and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on any future product sales in the licensed territory.
](https://hearinghealthmatters.org/hearingnewswatch/2019/astellas-frequency-therapeutics-agreement-fx-322/)
The agreement gives Astellas the responsibility to commercialize FX-322 outside of the U.S., with Frequency keeping (for now anyways) the U.S. distribution rights. I'm no expert, but it seems positive to me they were able to enter into such an agreement and have a large partners to help with perhaps the hardest part for any biotech, commercialization. 

As far as the stock is concerned, the company has a market cap of 1.6B. The current consensus 1 year price target is 53.67, with the stock closing today at 47.46. I think these price targets miss the biggest thing though -- the release of phase 2 data. If the data is good and further confirmation of word recognition provided, this stock seems to be at a crossroads where it is going to move greatly, either one way or another. I could easily see that price target being annihilated with good data.

[On Jan 19 2021, the company also appointed a Chief Manufacturing Officer](https://investors.frequencytx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/frequency-therapeutics-appoints-quentin-mccubbin-phd-chief). This suggests, to me at least, they are increasingly confident the drug will make it to market.  

[Details on debt and free cash flow](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/freq/financials/cash-flow) can be found here. The numbers don't cause me any concern debt wise, but you may know better than I or be more experienced in the sector.

**Competitors** 

Despite there being no treatments for hearing loss right now, Frequency is not the only company that is working on finding one. Other companies in the sector to look at if you are interested and wish to do your own DD include [Otonomy](https://www.otonomy.com/pipeline/), Decibel Therapeutics, and Audion Therapeutics. More info about the players is in the same article I linked [earlier from the WSJ.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cures-for-hearing-loss-may-be-found-in-new-drugs-11568599440)

**Future Applications**

Beyond just FX-322 for hearing loss, what really excites me about the potential of FREQ is the applicability of the approach they are using to other degenerative diseases. If this progenitor cell approach works, as phase one seemed to suggest, it could be applied to other diseases like arthritis. Essentially anywhere humans have cells that refuse to divide. More testing is also needed to see if it helps with tinnitus. 

Please do your own DD. I'm not trying to push the stock on anyone, but I think it has the power to be a really impactful development in the world of hearing loss, and that makes me excited. If anything was unclear or you have any questions let me know, I've spent a lot of time reading about the company and think from an investment perspective phase 2 offers a huge opportunity to push the company further into the global consciousness and create a return, while also potentially upheaving the hearing aid industry along the way.

personalfinance,"Looking for student loan friendly mortgage lenders, especially credit unions","Hi /r/personalfinance!

I have $110K in student loan debt (expensive private university), a salary of $63K (public school teacher), and live in a city where entry-level homes are about $510K and up.

I have no debts other than my large student loan balance, all credit cards fully paid off.  FICO 760.

I expect my student loan balance to be completely forgiven in about 5 years (PSLF), and if it weren't for the pandemic, my student loan servicer would be asking me to pay $360 per month (IDR).

However, many mortgage lenders (cough Bank of America, cough Better.com cough) will only look at the gross student loan balance of $110K in my case, multiply it by 1% and conclude that my student loan payment is $1,100 a month.

On a $5250 monthly pre-tax income x 43% DTI limit = $2257 - $1100 = it looks like I can only afford a $1157 mortgage payment (about $270K max. loan).

I've tried to tell them that I am only required to pay $360/month on my student loans (IDR), but they say that their system is automated based on a review of my credit reports and they can't/are unwilling to override any of the automatically generated numbers.

I'm trying to find the best deal that I can on a mortgage, lowest interest rate possible, and as much buying power as I can. Homes in my city are selling sometimes within hours of hitting the market and above asking price.

It seems like it's hard to get a definitive answer on which lenders out there are student loan friendly, without calling each one-by-one, or ""applying and seeing what happens"" (R.I.P. hard pull, hard pull, hard pull).

I'm intrigued that some credit unions such as Navy Federal supposedly offer mortgages as low as 2.25% on a 30-year fixed, other CUs like DCU advertise 2.50%, which looks as it may be superior to many banks and mortgage brokers -- but that's even more overhead, apply to be a member, open a savings/checking, with this CU, that CU to be unceremoniously turned down as Bank of America did.

(Technically: not ""turned down"" by Bank of America, but $270K is too low to buy anything within 50 miles of me)

Anyone have any tips/experiences to share on getting a mortgage with a high-student loan balance?",finance

defi,DeFi trends,"Golff is a One-Stop Services Encrypted Bank, and its products are mainly DeFi aggregator platforms, to Create a Light, Open and Free Financial World. Since the project on the exchange, it has aroused much discussion and attention from users. 

According to the latest news disclosed by the Golff team, Golff will focus on developing three sectors: Aggregate Lending, Vault2.0 and the Gas Tokens.

Golff's one-click aggregated lending service will continue to aggregate current mainstream DeFi lending platforms, such as MakerDAO, Compound, AAVE, dYdX, etc. This will greatly expand the underlying assets that can be used for lending, enhance the user's asset liquidity, and also optimize the best interest rate, reducing the user's borrowing cost. It is expected to be officially launched in mid-February.

Golff will use the Gas Tokens chain fee replacement to solve the Ethereum's high-rate issue, significantly reducing fees and lowering the barriers to user participation. This model is very beneficial to chain arbitrageurs and bulk traders who originally had excessive gas costs.  

Golff Vault 2.0 supports multi-currency participation and supports more strategies for Golff Vault V2 to switch.  As long as users deposit assets with one click, they can obtain the optimal returns. This means that the Vault has enhanced the ""strike range"" and supports the aggregation of more DeFi products. 

Golff community volunteers initiated a vote on the improved version of the Vault to supported the products on the Huobi public chain Heco, and diversified the ecosystem. It is expected that Golff will support both Ethereum and Huobi Heco at the same time. In this way, the huge user base of Huobi can be a diversion for Golff.

The most important thing for any project is the value of its tokens and the potential for future growth. GOF is a native functional token of Golff. GOF holders have the right to participate in governance while also sharing platform profits. In addition, holding GOF can also participate in liquidity mining in the Golff system. From the perspective of GOF itself, whether you want to dig GDAO to participate in governance or Vault revenue, GOF is the core.

 
In the second outbreak of DeFi recently, the DeFi currency continues to pump new highs. So users can keep paying attention to YFI and GOF, especially compared to the YFI that has skyrocketed, GOF has more potential to rise.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Help with Stupid Tax Question,"Good evening. 

I feel embarrassed having to ask this, but I couldn‚Äôt find a direct answer after looking online. 

My wife and I went from living paycheck to paycheck to making a very respectable salary of $100k between us, and we don‚Äôt have a good grasp of how our taxes have changed. 

Our first year after our income increase, we owed about $3000 dollars in taxes, about half from state and half federal. We realized this was because we had filled out the w-4s for married filing jointly in such a way that did not account for 2 incomes. 

We fixed that for 2020 by calculating exact withholding using the new w4. If I remember correctly, I think we even added a little extra withholding to account for any errors. 

This year I was discouraged to find we owed $2500, but this time it was entirely owed to state. 

What did we do wrong? And if I‚Äôve already adjusted our w-4s, what‚Äôs the best way to fix it?

stocks,Hedge Fund Misconceptions,"Look, I know you're about to downvote.  Its like being on team Nestle or team Agit Pai in here.  Hedge Funds are definitely no angels by any means.  That being said, as much as I get a little schadenfreude watching them get kicked around a little bit, I'd argue that some of the anger is a little unfounded (or a little exaggerated) . Figured I'd try posting it in r/stocks since you might take an extra second to glance through. 

And before I'm called a shill, yes, I did work in the sector for a few years (not at a fund, but a company that works directly with them). I've since moved on to a new career and am less stressed and happier.  I just ask you take a moment and flip through before you call me names (although maybe thats a wsb thing)..

**Naked Short Selling has played a major role in manipulating GME's prices**
Wasn't sure where to start but this one is everywhere.  The main cause of this seems to be that short interest was 120% of the shares outstanding and how can you short more than all the shares? When you create a new short position you are effectively creating a new long as well. If you own a company with 1 share and I borrow it from you to sell short, the person I sold it to now has 1 share. If someone shorts his share, there's now 2 shares short. Short interest is now 200%.

**There's a massive coverup going on due to their being more shares traded than there actually are**
Glad this one is going away but it seems like the confusion stemmed from the 'synthetic' long created by the short. If this was an issue anytime a company got acquired for stock they'd be a giant controversy. 


**This picture of a bunch of 100s in a row is evidence of a giant illegal short ladder strategy**
Shares are typically sold in lots of 100. If you are trading an amount smaller (an odd lot) you are grouped in with other odd lots to make a lot of 100. Given that there are millions of retail traders sending odd lots, this is most likely a row of retail orders selling.

**Hedge Funds conspired with the app-that-must not-be-named to halt trading to save their asses**
Now this one will be impossible to sway some people without a smoking gun but those clearinghouse capital requirements are real &amp; are federal law. It also lines up with what WeBull said (who doesnt have Citadel connections) and it makes sense that once it was announced they had received billions in funding, they opened it back up.
Theres a better explanation from Matt Levine at Bloomberg. 

This does not forgive them for being a complete mess through most of this.

**Hedge Funds are only for rich people**
There's a lot of rich people in the industry. Filthy rich people. But their clients necessarily aren't. I've worked with funds with unions, public pensions, school endowments, and charities as clients.

**Hedge Funds and Short Sellers control the market and are the only ones allowed make money**
I find this funny because pre-pandemic, the narrative was that no one should be giving money to hedge funds simply because their returns sucked. The hedge fund index has been awful compared to the rest of the market. Anyone who threw money in an index performed better. Everyone has made money the last decade but hedge funds. And in regards to shorts, the market is at an all time high and short interest was at a 12 year low. They stink in particular.

Anyway that's basically it, with the markets becoming more and more accessible, HFs and their high fees are part of a fading business model. I'm sure most would short their industry if they could.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time. This doesn't absolve them of many things but if you're going to get mad, get mad at the right reasons. Also if you disagree with any points, just tell me what!",finance

stocks,Delta Air Lines DD,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. I have no position in Delta currently but will likely add over the coming months. As a side note, this is my first real DD, so any feedback or suggestions for how I could improve it are welcome

**Valuation and Competitors:**

On 2/2/2021, DAL closed at $38.80 with a market cap of 24.7B. In comparison, AAL and UAL have a market cap of 10.3B and 12.7B respectively. Delta shares outperformed both competitors over the last year, at around -31%, much better than the -39% for American and -45.5% for United. DAL also has less than 2% of its float shorted, which is one of the smallest in the travel industry and the smallest among US airlines. This is an indication of a bullish sentiment for Delta in the coming months. Before the pandemic, Delta was trading in the upper $50 range. I think it still has some room to grow, although maybe not all the way up to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon. It's worth noting that United has recently told their employees to expect furloughs and layoffs, which is something Delta hasn't had to do.

**Business Outlook:**

As would be expected, DAL saw a massive drop in passenger revenue, which was slightly offset by a 6% increase in cargo revenue. The pandemic resulted in premature fleet retirement for the airline. They retired 227 aircraft in 2020, shrinking the number of fleet families from 13 to 11. It is likely they will continue this into 2025 on a smaller scale, planning to have 400 cumulative retirements and shrinking to 9 fleet families. They've also reduced orderbook purchase commitments by 2B last year and 5B through '25. Admittedly, this doesn't sound great for their projected passenger levels over the next few years, but the changes are understandable, given that current projections don't have air travel levels returning to normal until 2024. They had a passenger load factor of 55% for the year, which isn't great, but it definitely could have been worse for DAL. Since most of their revenue comes from their passenger sector, a return of consumer confidence will be essential for them to become profitable again. Since January 20, federal law has mandated masks to be worn on passenger flights in the US. The support of the federal government makes it easier for airlines to enforce their mask policies and will hopefully lead to more passengers. The new administration has also signaled interest in helping to restore the health of the travel and tourism industry, although we haven't heard much about it yet. Increased vaccine rollout, the waning pandemic, and their commitment to blocking middle seats through March 30 should all serve to increase consumer confidence and get people back on DAL planes.

**Fundamentals:**

Cash burn was a huge problem for airlines last year. During Q4, DAL had their cash burn at 12 million per day, which was down 90% from levels in March. For the coming quarter, they are expecting to have a daily cash burn anywhere from 10 to 15 million. Currently, they have enormous debt to the tune of 27.4B. However, they made solid progress on paying it off in Q4, removing 6.2B of it. Year over year, DAL saw a roughly 20-25% increase in pension and postretirement benefits, but this can be easily explained by the amount of early retirement packages they offered to employees this year. This helped them to avoid larger-scale mass layoffs and furloughs. After a rough 2020 of negative EPS, this year is expected to be better. By Q3, they are projected to once again have a positive EPS, which is projected to be $0.25.

**Risks:**

It's still an airline stock. The industry is and always has been competitive, so that is certainly a factor. Beyond that, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the presence of new COVID variants and some agencies have warned that another surge could happen by March. That would be a huge setback to the process of getting COVID under control. However, if the vaccine rollout continues to go well, airline stocks could enjoy a nice ride over the next year or so.

**Conclusion:**

As far as holding period goes, I am thinking of holding until at least the beginning of fall to see how summer travel goes and if it becomes profitable for both DAL and the industry as a whole. Out of all the airline stocks, I think DAL is the best of the bunch and has potential for a huge boost when international travel restriction are eventually lifted. All of this is just my personal opinion, and I'm welcome to feedback or other airline suggestions to look at.",finance
personalfinance,Help understanding my first paycheck (tax and witholding rates) - I am being taxed highet than my effective tax rare!,"Hello Reddit community,

I‚Äôve been trying to understand my first paycheck, and with no luck finding the answers I need from the internet or my HR department, I come to you.

I started work on January 11th. Due to bad luck there was a delay in getting me into the HR system, so I did not have access to my benefits nor W-4 form until yesterday.

HR expedited a check for my first 3 weeks of work last Friday, and I got it on Saturday. So, my yearly salary is $64,000 and I work in Connecticut. Before starting work, I calculated my effective tax rate here: https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes#C1hfKDZCQQ

The calculator on that website says that my effective tax rate is of 23.61%. It states that for the gross $64,000 I make a year, I should get taxed $7142 (11.16% effective tax rate).

I was expecting a net pay of almost $49000 yearly, but then my paycheck arrives. For 3 weeks of work, I was paid a gross of $3,878 (which dived by 3 and multiplied times 52 is a yearly slaary of around $67,000 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). I then was taxed $642 federal taxes (16.55%, 5.4% more than what I saw I was responsible for), $240 for CT taxes (7%, 2.2% more than what the website said I was responsible fo) and $297 for FICA (which is 7.65%, which is exactly the flat rate I should be paying so that is ok).

All together, I got a net pay of $2,649, which is 31.2% less from my gross pay. I am being taxed a total of 31.2% when my effective tax rate is supposedly 23.61%. How???

Now I have not filled the W-4 form, I have not accounted for possible deductions, and HR told me since I have not filled my W-4, I am being as a single and 0 dependent defaults which is what I am anyways. So I do not understand why I am being taxed and my money withheld almost 10% more than what it‚Äôs supposed to be. Is my tax witholding default way higher? Why? Why would the withold that my company estimates much be much higher than my effective tax rate? Shouldn‚Äôt it be easy to calculate how NOT to overtax me? Does it even out throughout the year? If so, why is it not consistent for each week I work?

Can someone explain to me why this high tax rate on me? How can I bring it down (I know about deductions in the W-4)? I want to be taxed no more and no less than what I should, but I did not know it could be as much as almost 10% of a difference as default.

Please, let me understand what the heck is going on cause I have an unhelpful HR, no tax advisor, and a check with tax rates I have no understanding of.

Thank you.",finance

Monetary collapse is the fate that America and the other nations who look to the dollar as their reserve currency are increasingly certain to face. Furthermore, with modern economies highly financialised, the message that a currency breakdown is due will spread considerably more rapidly than in examples from the past. It is therefore possible fiat currencies will not survive to see 2021 out; they may not even survive to mid-year if, as seems highly likely, a global banking crisis occurs in the near future.

Analysis is firmly pointing to a combined collapse of financial assets and currencies, likely to be unexpectedly sudden and would certainly be devastating. 

If, for a moment, we assume a total fiat currency collapse occurs, then all existing financial contracts, being denominated in fiat currencies, will become worthless. The accumulation of OTC derivatives, totalling some $606 trillion nominal, will become redundant, along with a further $30 trillion of exchange traded derivatives, because one side is always a fiat currency or a fiat currency's interest rate.  Global bond markets at a further $128 trillion would also be wiped out. Equities would lose most or all of their value until they can be priced in the successor to fiat money. And being a financial asset designated in fiat, we can kiss goodbye to bank credit in its fiat form. Goodbye to pensions and insurance funds as well.

personalfinance,Help with choosing a refinance rate/cost,"I'm looking to refinance my home. I feel I should based on the current mortgage rates to save money. I think realistically I would keep my home for at least 2 years, but honestly I can't plan past that.  I am looking at 15 year loans. 

About me. Travel nurse - Income - 90K-140K depending on the year.  It really varies widely. Right now my income is exceptionally high but not really gonna exist once covid is done. 

About my home.  I just refinanced it January 2020 to a 3.75% on $240,000 loan for 30 years.  The Principal and Interest is 1111/month.

Current situation. I owe $215,583 on that loan. These are the loans that I qualify for - 

Loan Amount	$215,583

Chicken Tendie: fair question, that merits a fair answer.

1. Doge has a mining rate of 5 Billion coins per year, on top of the in 2020 125 billion coins. The rate in inflation matches the inflation rate of the USD it's no different than the fed reserve printing more just decentralized. And now the world has access to crypto... the world.

There's a convenient little slider below the results which you can adjust to the amount of money you would like back when you file your return next year.

Forex,New Here- Tired of FF- Hoping I can find some useful traders. Below is my full trading plan.,"This is a trading plan based on years of experience. Trial, error, gains made, money lost, shock and realization that anything can happen in this market. Understanding when I am in sync and understanding when I have no pulse on the market. Some may call it an art, others an instinct, I just call it being true to myself. I can‚Äôt explain every detail to participants as that would be relative to explaining quantum physics to a three year old, or me for that matter as I know nothing of quantum physics. I pride myself on Knowing that I don‚Äôt even know what I don‚Äôt know. This is my plan, and I do call it my plan because you cannot see what I see, think what I think, act as I act, nor could I do those things as you. I offer it to participants for two reasons; First, the universal law of attraction: whatever you release, speak, and think, the universe will create a unique vibration, positive or negative and that vibration will return to us in kind. I have had for over a decade above all a desire to be a full time Forex Trader. If I can help enough other people reach their goal through trading then maybe I too can reach mine. Second, to help others overcome what I have discovered, that is the solitude of this profession. I am not just speaking of the hours of screen time all alone, looking at charts with nobody to bounce ideas off. But also the end of the day or end of the trade where your best friend, spouse, significant other, children; have zero idea what you are talking about. For those reasons I share with you my trading guide.  
***Fibonacci*** **Pivot Strategy**  
The *Fibonacci* pivot Strategy is trading strategy that combines the use of both the popular *Fibonacci* sequence and pivot point to trade forex. They are decisive points on charts where the price action may witness strong support or resistance and indicate a market reversal or if knocked out of order it can signify strong moves.  
I combine it with a secondary set of support and resistance indicators called Murrey Math based on Gann Principles. WD Gann, was a finance trader who developed several technical analysis methods. Gann market forecasting methods are based on geometry, astronomy and astrology, and ancient mathematics. Don‚Äôt stress, as long as your indicators are right you don‚Äôt need to understand the entire education behind it, just as a baker doesn‚Äôt need to understand microbiology to make bread or a brewer to make beer (which I do know something about).  
Finally I add in fundamental analysis into my strategy to have a true big picture of what markets are likely to do.  
**Murrey Math** is a complex set of support and resistance levels that act more or less the same as pivot points but also they provide some insights whether the current trend should continue or it should reverse.  
**Fundamental analysis** is a way of looking at the forex market by analyzing economic, social, and political forces that may affect the supply and demand of an asset.  
**How to trade Fibonacci Pivots**  
**Fibonacci Pivot Strategy &amp; Price Action Trading**  
Price action occurs as a result of the operation of the top players in the financial market like the central banks and commercial banks together with the very large speculators. These top players in the financial marketing rely on levels. The key players in the financial markets may use different strategies, indicators, fundamental analysis and much more, but at the start of the day to day trading or the trading period theyconcentrate on, they basically watch out for one particular thing on their chart which is the price levels. They watch the levels at which they have firm price that is likely to react, and levels at which they have decided to enter or exit the market. The top players in the market concentrate mainly on authentic **price levels,** instead of on the indicators or financial systems. A more detailed description of these levels:  


**Periodic Highs and Lows**  
This indicates the highs and lows attained in the preceding period. For instance, you may plot the preceding week‚Äôs highest and lowest price point attained, looking forward to a reaction at these farthest levels.  
**Support and Resistance Levels**  
This can be planned in the future, depending on where price previously establish either support or resistance with candle formations for confirmation.  
**Round Numbers**  
These means larger price levels culminating in zero, for instance 1.5150 and so on. Very influential levels at which to anticipate a reaction, and once more, we can plan them across FUTURE price levels, contrary to a few form of lagging indicator.  
**Pivot Points**  
The pivots are not commonly utilized by retail traders and this is a tragedy. It is very beneficial if you know how to use them especially for the higher timeframe. Pivot points help to divide the present period into levels based on the preceding period‚Äôs price extremes. It is related to Periodic Highs and Lows, but plots the different intermediary points where price can be anticipated to react.  


**I am not trying to lose you here, just make you understand there are depths to price action. Follow these guidelines to start.**  
Zones 61-100 are often areas where swings fail and you can counter trade or trade with the trend. Pivot trading works in either direction, I suggest for beginners to determine the trend based on a minimum of a daily chart, and trade in the direction of the trend. There are other advanced methods of choosing direction based on swap costs etc‚Ä¶ but that is not for today.  
Weekly Pivots are equilibrium, creating for me a road map of support and resistance. The best trades are at S/R 61-100 levels, however trades can be made above or below WP, again with experience. I like to enter the market with stop and limit orders but I will enter market orders if timing and price action are right.  
The market rarely moves strait up or strait down and so this strategy works a majority of the time. A kin to driving down a road and following the signs, however the market frequently decides to divert from the path and we need a larger view to see where those areas might be, since we are entering in the opposite direction of a break out. Draw down will happen with this strategy but with Murrey Math levels we may be able to mitigate some.  


**Murrey Math** is a complex set of support and resistance levels that act more or less the same as pivot points but also they provide some insights whether the current trend should continue or it should reverse. I consult these areas of support and resistance to confirm a trade or determine if a break out has actually occurred and if so where the next area of support and resistance may be. Below are a quick and dirty set of guidelines I use.  
**Murrey Math Guidelines**  
**8/8 th's and 0/8 th's Lines (Ultimate Resistance)**  
These lines are the hardest to penetrate on the way up, and give the greatest support on the way down. (Prices may never make it thru these lines).  
**7/8 th's Line (Weak, Stall and Reverse)**  
This line is weak. If prices run up too far too fast, and if they stall at this line they will reverse down fast. If prices do not stall at this line they will move up to the 8/8 th's line.  
**6/8 th's and 2/8 th's Lines (Pivot, Reverse)**  
These two lines are second only to the 4/8 th's line in their ability to force prices to reverse. This is true whether prices are moving up or down.  
**5/8 th's Line (Top of Trading Range)**  
The prices of all entities will spend 40% of the time moving between the 5/8 th's and 3/8 th's lines. If prices move above the 5/8 th's line and stay above it for 10 to 12 days, the entity is said to be selling at a premium to what one wants to pay for it and prices will tend to stay above this line in the ""premium area"". If, however, prices fall below the 5/8 th's line then they will tend to fall further looking for support at a lower level.  
**4/8 th's Line (Major Support/Resistance)**  
This line provides the greatest amount of support and resistance. This line has the greatest support when prices are above it and the greatest resistance when prices are below it. This price level is the best level to sell and buy against.  
**3/8 th's Line (Bottom of Trading Range)**  
If prices are below this line and moving upwards, this line is difficult to penetrate. If prices penetrate above this line and stay above this line for 10 to 12 days then prices will stay above this line and spend 40% of the time moving between this line and the 5/8 th's line.  
**1/8 th Line (Weak, Stall and Reverse)**  
This line is weak. If prices run down too far too fast, and if they stall at this line they will reverse up fast. If prices do not stall at this line they will move down to the 0/8 th's line.  
The ***Fibonacci*** pivot Strategy is trading strategy that combines the use of both the popular ***Fibonacci*** sequence and pivot point to trade forex. They are decisive points on charts where the price action may witness strong support or resistance and indicate a market reversal or if knocked out of order it can signify strong moves.  
**Fundamental Analysis**  
Fundamental analysis is a way of looking at the forex market by analyzing economic, social, and political forces that may affect the supply and demand of an asset. It‚Äôs Economics 101, it is supply and demand that determines price, or in our case, the currency exchange rate. The hard part is analyzing all of the factors that affect supply and demand. You have to understand the reasons of why and how certain events like an increase in the unemployment rate affects a country‚Äôs economy and monetary policy which ultimately, affects the level of demand for its currency. The idea behind this type of analysis is that if a country‚Äôs current or future economic outlook is good, their currency should strengthen. Fundamental analysis combined with pivots can give us a strong edge on the direction a pair will move.  
**Psychology of Trading**  
Everything I have talked about so far is minutia; it can be learned on a demo account over time with guidance and online resources. Please, if you are new to this UNDERSTAND this, Psychology of trading, discipline, thinking with a clear head when your account is up, and staying calm when your account is down, when to react to surprises and when to sit on your hands, it CANNOT be taught. I repeat IT CANNOT BE TAUGHT only learned. It‚Äôs typically several expensive lessons, and you will pay for the education. It‚Äôs also a lesson that never ends, you can be a master at this and still have your head dig you a hole that was unnecessary to dig. Read all the books you can dig up, watch all the videos you can find, they will help, but you will only truly learn through experience at this. Good luck and god speed, may the force be with you, and may the wind be always at your back and the sun upon your face. This is the single most important realm of trading.  
**Money Management**  
This is the second most important realm of trading. Also not something I am going to dive into too deep because this is also highly personal. I use only catastrophic stop losses if I set them at all. I have a number in my head based on my account balance and that is the place that I will take a loss if support and resistance, fundamentals and price action says so. What I won‚Äôt do is enter a trade 10X to be stopped out after a 20pip hiccup 10X only to have my target hit several hours later. That is not how the market guides me. I will tell you it takes a might of psychological fortitude to do what I do the way I do it. I will give you this guideline, if you are going to trade this path, be prepared to give a 80-100pip stop loss and manage your position size accordingly. I enter the market in areas, which means not all at once. Small portions of my maximum position size at different prices in my area of interest.  
Example: Max Position= 1 Lot.  
.10X10 scattered over an area of Support or Resistance= 1 lot. First entry and last entry could be 30-50pips apart.  
I should also cover risk reward ratio here. Many will shake their heads at me. I am willing to risk 10% of my account on one trade IF necessary, meaning if fundamentals, price action and pivots indicate a hold. My reward is as much as the market will give, which is based on pivots, fundamentals and price action. Entries and targets are both determined in the same way; Areas of Support and Resistance, Fundamentals and Price Action.  
**GOALS**  
What I can recommend here: Do not set daily goals, it creates too much pressure. My goal is 10% of my original account balance per month until my account balance grows to 100%. Then I withdraw a quarter of my account balance. The 75% return is now my account balance and becomes my new base for monthly 10% growth goal.     *""Not all those who wander are lost."" - Tolken*",finance

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow looks to extend gains to a three-session rally

&gt; * Dow futures pointed to a relatively flat open Wednesday, one day after the DJIA saw its best single-session advance of more than 475 points or 1.58% and its best two-session rally since November.

&gt; * The back-to-back increase in the broader stock market coincided with a sharp two-day reversal in soaring GameStop, which saw modest gains lose steam in Wednesday‚Äôs premarket. The Reddit-fueled short-squeezed stock plunged 72% since Friday‚Äôs close of $325. In last week‚Äôs 400% surge, Gamestop touched an intraday all-time high of $483 per share.

&gt; * Nasdaq futures were stronger Wednesday as Alphabet shares soared over 7% in premarket trading after the Google-parent reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue.

&gt; * Ahead of Friday‚Äôs release of the government‚Äôs monthly employment report, ADP released its January look at job trends at U.S. companies Wednesday morning. ADP said 174,000 private sector positions were added last month. That was more than triple expectations. December‚Äôs tally was upwardly revised to a decline of 78,000.

*****

&gt; # 2. Jeff Bezos to step down as CEO; Amazon delivers record revenue

&gt; * Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he plans to step down as CEO and transition to executive chairman, an announcement that coincided with the company‚Äôs earnings report that showed record quarterly revenue. Amazon cloud chief Andy Jassy will take over for Bezos as CEO in the third quarter. Bezos, 57, said he will stay engaged in important Amazon projects but will also have more time to focus on the Bezos Earth Fund, his Blue Origin spaceship company, The Washington Post and the Amazon Day 1 Fund.

&gt; * Shares of Amazon were little changed in the premarket on the Bezos news and the company exceeding $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever. In fact, fourth-quarter revenue soared to a better-than-expected $125.56 billion. Per-share earnings of $14.09 nearly doubled expectations. Amazon‚Äôs cloud-computing unit, which Jassy leads, saw its revenue climb 28% to $12.7 billion, though that was lower than forecasts.

*****

&gt; # 3. Alphabet beats quarterly results, reports Google cloud loss

&gt; * A strong return to growth in its core advertising business pushed Alphabet‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings and revenue above Wall Street expectations. The company made $22.30 per share on revenue of $56.90 billion. Alphabet disclosed operating results from Google‚Äôs cloud business for the first time, showing the unit lost $1.24 billion during Q4 and $5.61 billion for the full year. By contrast, Amazon‚Äôs cloud business earned an operating Q4 profit of $3.56 billion and $13.53 billion for last year.

*****

&gt; # 4. Yellen calls meeting on market volatility, GameStop frenzy

&gt; * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is calling a meeting of key financial regulators this week, possibly as early as Wednesday, to discuss market volatility driven by retail trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks. Yellen sought permission from ethics lawyers to do so, according to document seen by Reuters.

&gt; # 5. Biden, Yellen say GOP offer on Covid stimulus is too small

&gt; * Yellen and President Joe Biden joined Democratic senators for a private virtual meeting Tuesday, and they declared a GOP offer of $618 billion in Covid stimulus as too small. They urged big, fast action to stem the pandemic and the resulting economic fallout. As the White House still tries to reach a bipartisan relief bill, Democrats marshaled their slim Senate majority to start a lengthy process for approving Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion proposal with or without Republican support.

personalfinance,Beat way to pay debt?,"Hi community, I currently have 1 car loan with 40k at 3% interest rate, 1 HVAC loan with 6k 0 interest, 1 retirement loan 8k with interest that goes back into my account. I could pay off everything right now but that would come close to wiping my accessible savings and with a family that is pretty dicey. So I‚Äôm hoping by mid year or end of the year latest I could pay off after having more money in savings. However, having that money sit in my bank is accruing almost 0%. What would you recommend?",finance
personalfinance,Another ‚ÄúHow much house‚Ä¶‚Äù post (constructing custom home &amp; with numbers),"My partner and I are currently in the process of putting together an offer for land where we plan to build our ‚Äúforever‚Äù home. We‚Äôre late 20s/early 30s, no kids (or plan to), and living in a small but HCOL area. It‚Äôs a large (seasonal) tourist destination, meaning real estate and building costs are proportionally higher than other expenses.

Disclaimer: Throwaway because reasons. We recognize we're very privileged to be in the position we're in, but it's still a huge, stressful decision.

# The numbers

**Debt**

* \~$65k student loan debt (all federal, so 0% interest and no payments until September)

**Assets**

* \~6mo emergency fund (would likely need to increase based on the mortgage)
* \~$30k to put toward loans (could be put toward the house, but obviously not ideal)
* $65k-85k land equity depending on how it appraises
* Car is paid off and has at least 5 years of life left
* Small-ish retirement accounts (but moving in the right direction)

**Income and expenses**

* Pre-tax income - $190k/yr
* Income after taxes and both maxing out 401k - $8500/mo
* Regular expenses - $2500/mo (not including housing, loan payments, or any saving/investing)

# The plan

The current plan is to pay cash for the land and use that equity as the down payment on a construction loan. We'd make up any difference with what we have currently allocated toward student loans and/or what we save between now and kicking off construction. It sounds like we can get a construction mortgage with 10% down, but want to be at 20% to avoid PMI. We don‚Äôt want something huge, but we do want it to be multi-functional in the sense that it has a home office, space for guests, and space for indoor &amp; outdoor hobbies‚Ä¶ probably \~2000 sq ft.

We‚Äôre also looking to build a small, &lt;600 sq ft short-term rental. From talking to folks that have something similar, I‚Äôd be very surprised if it wasn‚Äôt near 100% occupancy for at least 20 weeks of the year. How should we think about the rental income as part of the calculation? My intuition is that we shouldn‚Äôt think about it at all because it‚Äôs not guaranteed, but it also seems reasonable to stretch the budget if the cash flow will likely cover more than the mortgage increase.

According to different calculations, we should land somewhere between \~$300k (Dave Ramsey‚Äôs 25% of takehome) to \~$900k (what we‚Äôve been prequalified for w/o shopping around), but that‚Äôs a huuuuge range.

**My thinking**

I know 3x income or 25% of after-tax income are numbers I see thrown around here the most, but it seems like we can go quite a bit over that without feeling overextended. For example, even with a $700k 30 year mortgage (35% after-tax income), we‚Äôd still be able to put $3000/mo toward savings, loans, travel, etc.

I have no idea how to account for the rental portion of this. It makes the math a lot messier since this project will be a combination of consumption and investment.

stocks,An In-Depth Look Into Aphria (APHA.TO) And Why This Stock Should Be A 4x Bagger At Least,"**The play: Long stocks and ATM leap calls**

Summary: Aphria is trading at a hefty discount when comparing price multiples to its largest viable competitor Canopy Growth Corp (WEED.TO). As of the release of the company‚Äôs recent Q2 2021 financial statement, Aphria now has more revenue and a much lower net loss than Canopy Growth; however, despite all that, Canopy still has a market cap that is 4 times larger than Aphria. This I believe is a major pricing inefficiency created by the market because both companies are showing significant growth in their revenue while capturing additional market share in a growing industry while only Aphria has shown investors that is the only dominant marijuana company that can cut down costs and increases profit margins. Because of this, the premium in Canopy‚Äôs market cap is not justifiable and Aphria should be valued at least as much or even more than Canopy Growth. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Industry Background Info**

Ever since the Canadian government legalized the recreational use of marijuana in 2018, Canadian weed companies have risen to become the dominant players on the global stage. As of right now, the four largest weed companies by market cap are Canopy Growth (WEED.TO), Cronos (CRON.TO), Aphria (APHA.TO), and Aurora (ACB.TO). 

Of this grouping, only Aphria has consistently shown investors that it can grow its business from both the top and bottom lines all the while making mergers and acquisitions that will allow it to capitalize on the growing recreational market in the U.S. Here let me show you why Aphria has the strongest fundamentals. 

üì∑

If you pull up Canopy‚Äôs recent quarterly report and look at their income statement, you will find that even though cost of goods sold (COGS) has a slightly decreased ratio to revenue from 76% for the first 3 quarters in 2019 (145,162 / 189,012) to 78% in 2020 (213,107 / 269,916), its total operating expenses excluding COGS, is still **LARGER** than its revenue (operating expenses are 489,216 for 2021). What‚Äôs more is that over half of this comes from SGA (Selling, General, and Admin). What this shows is that even though the company is growing, it is not becoming more efficient, rather it is becoming more inefficient. 

[https://www.canopygrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CGC-Q2-FY21-FS.pdf](https://www.canopygrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CGC-Q2-FY21-FS.pdf)

As for the other two companies Cronos and Aurora, their fundamentals are even more atrocious than Canopy‚Äôs. Cronos has revenue roughly 29million for first three quarters of 2020 which is peanuts compared to Aphria and Canopy. What‚Äôs more is that the company is showing earnings that are HIGHER than their total revenue. I suspect this is a result of their revaluation of their marijuana inventory which is complete bullshit because it assumes company can sell it all at the current fair market price and no auditor can accurately assess the true value of a living and growing agricultural product (trust me my background is in accounting). Why this company is worth over 5bil is beyond me. Aurora is similar with tiny amounts of revenue while operating at massive losses. The company didn‚Äôt even sell anything in 20q2 so I‚Äôm not going to go into great depth with either of them. 

**Tl;Dr:** The only viable competitor with Aphria is Canopy and right now Canopy is making less money than Aphria both in the top and bottom lines. The other two companies are essentially the weird kid in the class sitting in a corner eating chalk. Bless their hearts. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Aphria Fundamentals**

Alright let‚Äôs get to the good stuff. Here is a pic of part of their income statement for you to follow:

[https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aphria-Q2-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aphria-Q2-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf)

üì∑

Right now, COGS ratio for Aphria is comparable with Canopy. By Nov 2020, ratio is 71% (219,136 / 306,221) and 74% (188,670 / 246,712) in 2019. But if you go down the statement you will find out that in the breakdown of their operating expenses, the company actually manages to keep expenses relatively stable as revenue grows. The only line that really stands out for me is the transaction cost expense of 25.6m which relates to business acquisitions. I think most of the 25.6m is related to their Tilray acquisition that I will discuss later on. Other than that, the company manages to stabilize its expenses and its total operating cost is far less than their revenue, which is something Canopy cannot say.

Tl;dr: Aphria is a lean machine while Canopy is like a toddler that took one too many steroids and suddenly grew to the size of a NFL linebacker all the while having an IQ of 4. What this means is that Canopy‚Äôs growth is by no means sustainable and the only way for the company to continue operations is if it manages to grow revenue fast enough it outpaces expenses, but right now that is not the case.

**Tilray Merger Implications**

Recently in 2020 Aphria announced an all-stock merger (meaning Aphria will exchange a certain amount of their shares for Tilray shares). This is something I feel like retail investors need to look at more closely. The reason why is that the merger will give Aphria a strategic advantage of breaking into the US and EU markets. 

[https://www.livemint.com/news/world/tilray-and-aphria-announce-merger-to-create-the-largest-global-cannabis-company-11608361067376.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/tilray-and-aphria-announce-merger-to-create-the-largest-global-cannabis-company-11608361067376.html)

The advantage comes from the fact that even though Tilray is headquartered in Canada, it is registered as a US firm. What‚Äôs more is that Tilray also has agreements with EU countries that allow it to expand its position in the EU cannabis market. Tilray has announced it has been selected by the French national Agency for the Safety of medicines and Health Products to supply Good Manufacturing Processes certified medical cannabis products in France. In addition, the company also has agreements with other EU nations like Portugal that you can examine at your own free time. 

Tl;Dr: Aphria buy Tilray. Tilray in U.S and deal with E.U. This let Aphria go to U.S and E.U. This let Aphria bring in big mooneee.

**U.S Marijuana Legalization**

The Democrats taking control of the White House, Senate, and Congress is the equivalent of the second coming of Christ for the marijuana industry, and no this is not an understatement. Right now, marijuana is legal for either medical or recreational uses in 15 states but is still illegal on the federal level. What this means is that companies need to wait for states to legalize individually and even when they do so, there are still significant red tapes abound that will greatly hinder industry growth. One of the most prevalent examples of red tape is the fact that marijuana dispensaries do not have access to proper banking so they operate exclusively as a cash-based business. This is because if a bank provides services to a weed dispensary, it can be charged on the federal level for money laundering.  

That is all about to change because the Dems in the Senate announced that one of their main goals with their majority is to end the federal criminalization of marijuana use. In addition, Chuck Schumer already announced that a draft of the bill will be introduced in the first half of 2021. 

[https://www.9news.com/article/news/nation-world/federal-marijuana-legalization-senate/507-4de652b8-5f81-4ed4-94a2-502e5c1bef41](https://www.9news.com/article/news/nation-world/federal-marijuana-legalization-senate/507-4de652b8-5f81-4ed4-94a2-502e5c1bef41)

What‚Äôs more is that when weed is legalized on the federal level, it is actually legalized on the state level as well. This is because of something called the Supremacy Clause in the constitution that established that federal law controls when state and federal law are in conflict. 

*‚Äúbut* u/gushingranny1*, if that‚Äôs the case, how come I can smoke pot in California huuuuh?‚Äù*

Well listen here you little shit, granny going to explain to ya. 

You see the constitution, though the Tenth Amendment delegates police powers to the states. This means that even though states cannot prevent federal prosecution of their citizens, they can still eliminate state prosecutions.

**Tl;Dr**: Once weed is legalized on federal level, floodgates will open. You think marijuana stocks got crazy in 2017? Just wait for this one.

personalfinance,Debt advice needed,"Good Morning,

I am hoping to get some advice in regards to my financial situation. I'll provide some brief background. 


I am 33 and on SSDI due to a neurological disorder. I recieve income for myself and an income benefit for my child. So in total I recieve about 1700 a month total. My mortgage is 760.00. My home loan is about 95k with an interest rate of 4.75. The market is insane where I live and right now my home is worth 350k. I bought in 2012 for 109k. 


I have about 10k in medical debt from when I was diagnosed with my condition in 2016. I was in and out of the hospital more times than I can count. I had multiple brain surgeries and procedures. So even though I had insurance through work at the time it didn't cover everything. Of that 10k of debt is about 2800 in a care credit card that got lost in the mix. 


I spent this last year working with a financial guidance counselor to get my financial situation on track so all of my current expenses are current and up to date. Next I want to tackle my debt. 


Should I look into a home equity loan or line of credit? Should I attempt to refinance to access the equity in my home? I want to fix this. But I don't want to make things worse. I have bad credit because of the medical delinquencies. I am not eligible for bankruptcy because of the value of my home, I would lose my home. What is the smartest course of action?

Here is an interesting idea for someone who knows how to develop addictive games.

Make a game, which have ingame assets. The ingame assets can produce interest. Then the players need to hodl BCH stake and the bigger their held BCH stake is the more ingame assets they can get. 

The money for running the game could be produced by interest rate the BCH produces for the developers - for instance co-operation with Celsius Network could be the interest payer or some other way that is considered legitimate. 

In doing this, we can drag BCH from the markets, people can have fun time and the developers will get paid according to the popularity of the game (the more popular the game is the larger the stake pool is).

And of course, anyone can leave the game at any time and get their stake back once leaving.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Questions about bonuses and how they affect tax brackets,"My understanding of bonus payments it that they are federally taxed a flat 22% rate, regardless of your marginal tax bracket, for all bonus amounts under $1 million. Bonuses over $1 million are taxed at 37%. I just have a few questions to check my understanding.

1. Not that this applies to me (I wish!) - if you receive two bonuses of $600,000 each in one year, are they both taxed at 22%? Or is the first million taxed at 22%, and the remaining $200,000 taxed at 37%? I assume the latter.

2. Is overtime pay taxed like bonuses? Unlike performance bonuses (which are typically paid in their own check), overtime pay is often lumped in with your normal biweekly paycheck. If the employer identifies overtime as its own line-item on your pay stub, is this pay taxed at 22% or aggregated to your total income? If the latter, I presume you would receive the difference back in your tax refund.

3. For bonuses under $1 million, they are taxed at 22% regardless of your marginal tax bracket. So if your salary is $300,000, your marginal tax rate is 35%, making any bonus you receive more tax-efficient than receiving the same compensation in the form of a raise. Correct?

4. Does your bonus count toward taxable income when calculating tax brackets? For example, let's say you earn $163,000 base which is at the very top of the 24% bracket. You earn a $10,000 bonus, which is taxed at 22% because it's a bonus. Your total income is $173,000, which pushes your marginal tax rate to 32%. But do you actually pay 32% on any of the money you earned (wages or bonus)?",finance

$APHA was already showing good growth through 2020 despite the cannabis market being a 'wild west'.

I'm 33, I bought a condo in 2018. I bought it at 138k, 5% interest rate. Ive been paying extra each month. My mortgage monthly is $1,050 (including escrow and everything). My outstanding loan is 109k. Right now, comparable units are going for 165-170k in my neighborhood, and selling fast. 

My fiance and I are making moves to live together. He also owns his home, and his home is the way better choice for us to live together. I'd be moving in and paying him rent ($500/month).

My goal in buying was to rent it out eventually, but my association has since instituted a rental cap. I've been trying to get on the waitlist for 3 months now, but they are so disorganized, I haven't gotten a solid answer on how long the wait is expected to be, or if I'm even on the list. The association at this place has been horrible to deal with in general. If I could rent it out, I expect to be able to get $1300/month. Minus association dues and the bills I would still cover (water and waste), id be netting $1100 in rent a month. 

The way I see it, I have 3 options:

- Sell my current place, buy a new condo with intent to rent (maybe right away, maybe in a few years when its a better buyers market)
- Keep my current place, keep fighting with association to be able to rent it out maybe a few years down the line. 
- Sell my current place, and try to find a means of passive income that isn't renting.

Basically, being irresponsible in my early 20s after college led to me racking up about 15,000 in credit card debt (at about 22% APR). Over the last 2 years, I've thankfully learned my lesson and managed to stop the debt from growing, but with the high interest rate and low graduate student salary, am having a very difficult time making any sort of dent in this amount.

Is this worth it? I am hesitant to take out a personal loan, as it is something I have never done before, and growing up in a poor family I've never had much in the way of solid financial advice.

personalfinance,Problems with Sallie Mae,"So I applied for a student loan with Sallie Mae about a month ago and got it. A few days later, I needed additional funds to be dispersed to the college. I *thought* this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue since during the application process they ask if you want to increase the funds up to $5,000 more what you were initially approved for. So I contacted them and they told me that I couldn‚Äôt do that and that I *had* to take out a completely new loan. So now I have two loans, and the second one has a higher interest rate. (I should note that it also is significantly less than $5,000.) Then yesterday, I get an email saying that I was approved an additional $5,000 with my loan. I didn‚Äôt want two loans, especially one with a higher interest rate. Naturally, Sallie Mae customer service is useless in trying to get any help or explanation. Oh, and they also refuse to put anything in writing, insisting that they call me (and they refuse to put anything said on the call into writing). Why would I apply for a separate loan with a higher interest rate when I already had the amount needed available with the original loan? It makes no sense.

What is my recourse here? Ideally, the solution I want is the second loan to be completely erased and just have all my funds on one loan with the originally agreed upon interest rate.

One separate thought I have is to request the additional amount on the original loan, then take those funds that the school will refund to me (because my account is already zero) and just pay back the second loan in full. This would still put me out any fees I paid and a month (maybe two) of interest. Plus, I don‚Äôt know how this would affect my credit score (positively? negatively?) because I would technically be closing out an account.",finance

personalfinance,"No Investing Experience, Looking for Guidance and a Plan","Been wanting to post for a while now, and was inspired by another post about starting late. I don't want to put investing off anymore, and looking for any and all advice.

Background: 34yo, recently finished grad school with advanced degree in nursing. Graduated late 2019 with ~$226k in federal student loans, and approx $80k in savings (left over loans and savings). Held off on refinancing and am enjoying the $0/0% from Uncle Sam thru 09/2021 (as of now). Began working middle of 2020 and earned ~$165K in 6mos. I expect that to remain fairly consistent unless I decide to relocate. I currently rent (relocated to a new state last May) and own my vehicle outright. Outside of a Fidelity account I had thru an old employer (403b started in 2014 with ~$83k that I ignore with a targeted retirement date of 2050 I believe), I don't have any investments or retirement accounts.

Current Plan: In my mind, my goals are to 1) set aside ~6mos expenses into a designated emergency fund (already have these funds), 2) start a Roth IRA (I think) or some other retirement account and contribute funds for 2020. I'll admit, I'm a bit torn on how much to keep saved up and on standby wrt the current federal student loans situation. I have enough to pay them off now (not considering until there's a clear end in sight to the $0/0%), but am wondering if buying a house makes sense in the meantime while continuing to save up to throw a lump sum at my loans likely towards the end of the year.

Main questions:

1) Which type of retirement account do you recommend I contribute toward for 2020? My understanding is that Fidelity and Vanguard are both solid options. What specific IRAs should I consider? I read through the wiki .. and cannot decide which type of retirement account to contribute to. I earn high income (and expect to going forward), I'm 1099 and do not have a workplace account, I do not know which state I will end up in, and do expect to move to a new state eventually, etc. Too many undecided variables to know for sure.

2) How would you handle the federal student loans situation if you were in my shoes? Just keep banking money for the next 6 mos with the possibility of them becoming ""active"" again this Fall, so I could just pay them off right away? Or use a portion of my savings (likely $60-80k for a 20% downpayment in my area) and then bank money to throw at the loans?

Side notes: I'm currently paying more in rent than I could be with a realistic (ie. desirable house) mortgage in my town, however I am not sold on staying here long-term, and would consider moving in the next 1-2yrs if I find a lifestyle job in a more desirable region of the US that piques my interest. I would likely keep the house as a rental if I did move unless I absolutely felt the need to sell.

personalfinance,Initial Deposit Rules around the globe?,"Hello everyone

With this post i want to get the attention of property owners from different countries to tell me about how the situation is in their country concerning the rules on mortgages. 

Ill start off myself:

In switzerland it‚Äôs mandatory that you pay the very least 20% out of your own pocket. If you don‚Äôt have that, you cannot get a mortgage BY LAW, thats not a bank rule or whatsoever, just to make sure everyone gets that its a federal law. Now we do have the possibility to use some of our retirement plan for it. for example you buy a house for 1Mio u need 200k u can have ‚Äúonly‚Äù 100k out of your own pocket (savings on bank acc) and take 100k out of your retirement plan. That retirement plan is also mandatory for everyone who works and is paid by employer and employee starting of your 25th anniversary so needless to say that if you‚Äôre in your early 30‚Äôs its very unlikely that u have that amount alrdy.

Then u can take a loan for the remaining 80 or less. Some banks may request an higher initial deposit if they calculate the risk to be higher or the value of the house beeing less but that depends on the bank institute and is negotiable

Interests:

Now for the interests that depends on what kind of system u chose. If u chose a fixed plan the interest charged is higher the longer u chose your plan to be. But from what i saw, it‚Äôs much cheaper than in the us ( maybe exactly because they require more security) since i signed a 5years loan with 0.91% interest some tears ago and i think today u can get it even cheaper. Now for the amortisation its separate this depends on your age also ,since if your young you have more time to work and pay back your debts. In my case i only pay about 1% of the debt annually. Meaning it would take me 100y to pay it off but thats the point its very unlikely that someone fully owns a house in Switzerland for tax reasons why most people stop paying their debts once they own 60-70-80% of the house alrdy. 

Short term loans

So like in my case (5year loan) after those 5y i can chose to sign a new contract with my bank or completly change the financial institut if i gst a better offer which would then pay back the debt to my initial bank and then charge me for the contract i sign with them. So you never really pay back the full amount of your house since you only pay a very small amount back every year ( like i said in my case about 1% of the total loan).

Now i know in some countries if u sign a contract for lets say 20 years, youre gonna pay probably 1.5-4% interest plus pay off ur debt back. Meaning that after those 20years you have no debt anymore and fully own the house. But that also means you have to pay much much more monthly than with my example.

I would like to know about other systems concerning the initial deposit mainly. I do know about the flexible interest rate options shich are valid for some months like with what we call in europe the euribor or libor and would like to know what other type of systems are there in south/north america, africa asia australia and other euroleab countries :)",finance
personalfinance,Recently refinanced our home. Our mortgage has already been sold twice. Now it's owned by a horrible company.

And then maybe another month passed before the new company sold it to ANOTHER company called ""Mr. Cooper."" (AKA, Nationstar Mortgage)

I've been trying to set up our auto-payments with Mr. Cooper and I have been totally creeped out by the company.  First of all, the first recording I hear says, ""Press 1 if you are declaring bankruptcy.""  Not a very good first impression.  These guys already seem like vultures.

I have to wait about 5 hours for somebody to call me back and it's an answering service.  Somebody in India who barely speaks English is asking me to give her my social security number.  Ummm, no thank you.  I give her my loan number, my name, and the last 4 digits of my SS number and then, suddenly, she says we've been disconnected and the line goes dead.  She has not called me back.

So I try to call the company back.  Apparently she entered in my information because now the recording knows my number and knows that Mr. Cooper has acquired our mortgage.  It tells us to set up auto-payments on the Mr. Cooper website.  The website looks like a generic SquareSpace website.  They ask for my social security again.  I don't feel comfortable giving it to them.  I feel uncomfortable that I gave them my name, loan #, and last four of my social security # in the first place.  I'm already nervous about that.

I look up reviews for the Mr. Cooper company and all of them are negative.  These people are apparently sharks.  Looking to charge late fees as often as possible, trying to harvest as much money from debt as possible, and apparently they are not shy about reporting you to credit agencies to damage your credit. 

This is outrageous.  We refinanced with Ally bank, not this shady debt collector.

What should we do?  I'm not giving these people my social security number.  I want to get away from them as quickly as possible.

Is refinancing again the only option?  Can we sue Ally bank for selling away our mortgage immediately upon our refinance?

I'm asking for help here.  Any legal recourse or information you could give me would be appreciated.",finance

With current interest rates I could keep my current payment the same and get a decent payout, but it will add another 6 years to my mortgage of this house.",finance

personalfinance,"Trying to take financial control of my life, but don't know how to start","**\*\*\*Throwaway account for anonymity; will be slow in responses\*\*\***

**About me:** 

 I'm a single 25 y/o who was wildly irresponsible with my money following graduating from college and making real money at a full-time job. My debt accumulation has dropped my Equifax score to 619 according to CreditKarma. 

I am in sales for a very large/stable company and have worked very hard since I've started summer '18 and on November 1st I received a large promotion + an increase in pay for my efforts. I now have an annual On Target Earnings (OTE =  salary + commission if I reach 100%) of $110k that has a 60/40 split. 60% is salary ($66k) and the other 40% ($44k) is how much I will earn per year in commission if I hit goal. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Debt:** 

Credit Cards - I managed to accumulate \~$10k of CC debt between multiple cards, with a majority of the debt on an AmEx with a massive interest rate of 29.24%. Over the past year, I've managed to knock it down to \~$6k of debt that is only on the AmEx.

Luckily, I do not have any student loans due to scholarships and my car is completely paid off. I currently rent an apartment so there is no current mortgage loan, nor any other loans.

**Essential** **Monthly Expenses:**

* Rent + Utilities = \~$800
* Car insurance = $70
* Groceries = $350
* Prescriptions = $70
* Pet = $75

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals in Order of Priority:** 

1.) **Get out of Credit Card Debt/Improve Credit Score** \- I racked this up when I was irresponsible w/ my money (spending more than I made) and naive of the repercussions. It has been a massive reality check and I've gotten very serious about this over the last year.

2.) **Build an Emergency Fund** \- I aiming to build a 3mos emergency fund which would be \~$3k.

3.) **Buy a car** \- I currently drive a 2012 Hyundai Sonata that has been a catastrophe. I bought it off my father a few years ago @ 70k miles, and I have dumped $3k+ on maintenance since. It currently has 130k miles and gets the job done, but it won't have much value. Because of that, I've decided to forego leveraging the trade-in value and drive it into the ground and save for a replacement. I'm hoping to buy a 1-2 year-old used VW Tiguan with less than 20k miles (lease return/demo) over the next year. My target price is $25k and I would be putting down $7,500 in cash. I estimated the remaining $18k to be a $400-$450 a month loan over 48 mos as I estimate a 10% APR based on my credit score.

4.) **Down payment on a house** \- I don't have a timeline for buying a house as I don't need one in the near future, but I'd like to get a plan together to save for a house payment. The ideal target is $50k, but not sure when I'll need it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Where I'm at and what I'm doing:**

**Debt** \- Paying at least the minimum per month on my AmEx or as much as I can with left over spending money. Going forward, 100% of my commission checks will be used to pay off debt + build an emergency fund.

**Income** \- I receive my salary paycheck every other week and my variable commission checks on the last Friday of every month. After my deductions for health insurance + other benefits, 10% to my employee stock program, and 10% contribution to my 401k, I get $1458 direct deposited bi-weekly for my salary. I have the direct deposits routed into three different accounts:

* 50% Reserve - This is for my monthly fixed expenses + short term savings
* 25% Checking - Spending money for the month
* 25% Savings - Standard savings account with a low-interest rate. This is where I plan to build up an emergency fund, then eventually start using my family's financial advisor to manage my savings in low-risk investments (Blue chip ETFs/stocks/mutual funds) as a long-term savings bucket with a higher return

**Budgeting** \- This is something I really struggle with. I recently signed up for YNAB to budget and track spending. I budget only taking into account income from my salary. All of my commission from now on will be used to get out of debt + build an emergency fund then eventually will all be saved.

**Spending** \- I choose to use a low limit ($500) credit card for my checking accounts monthly spending. I pay this off in full every month and do this so I get something out of spending my money that I wouldn't with debit/cash. I treat it as a debit card in the sense that I never allow the balance to go above the amount in my checking account.

**Current Balances:**

* **Bank Accounts**:
   * Checking - \~$450
   * Reserve - \~$345 (Just paid $800 for rent)
   * Savings - \~$270
* **Debt:**
   * AmEx - \~$5800
   * Spending CC - \~$285
* **Investments:**
   * ESPP - $0 --&gt; I have been selling my shares on the buy-in date every 6mos to help pay off my debts. My next purchase date is June 1st and should have \~$6k worth of stock available.
   * Individual Brokerage - \~$1k --&gt; Free money I invested a few months ago. I can liquidate this easily to help pay off my CC debt. Once I'm out of CC debt/build my emergency fund, I plan on giving 80% of savings to my financial advisor and manage my own investments for the other 20% here.
   * 401k - \~$25k

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for the length, but I wanted to make sure I outline everything as I do not check this out very much. I'm looking for advice on how I can tweak my current plan to efficiently reach my goals. If you have any advice on what I can do immediately (liquidate brokerage for CC debt, change direct deposit routing, look into debt consolidation, etc.) please let me know. Please be patient in replies to questions but I will try my best to stay on top of this post to get back to you quickly.

stocks,Old fart advice for young investors,"There seems to be a lot of interest in stocks from young investors. I imagine that many will make their way from WSB to this sub because WSB is a bunch of monkeys flinging poo. You may have lost some money and now you want to explore stocks from less of a Meme and emotional perspective. 

There is nothing wrong with Meme stocks. Meme stocks can be fun. I have had fun with it. I am also a 42-year-old man with rental properties, commercial properties, and a few small businesses. BB, NOK, AMC, and even GME are all fine. The DD is fine behind all of them. The issue is that if I lose $1,000 then I can write myself a check from one of my businesses for $10,000 to make myself feel better. That is not a brag...it is simply sharing that people come from different places in life. 

You are just starting off life and probably have far fewer resources and every dollar matters more. 

I challenge anyone to CMV but I am not a big proponent of stocks as a core investment strategy. Here are my reasons why.

1. Information has a time-decay of value. Meaning that information becomes less valuable over time. Data is what is mined to often produce new Information. You are at a disadvantage when it comes to both data and information. The information that you get on a retail level has already lost much of its value. This is where the saying ""if you read it in the news you are already too late""
2. You have no power. You simply cannot compete with whales and whales don't become whales by letting people glean the crumbs that are leftover. They have the power to move markets, you don't.
3. You have no control over outcomes. You have no control over the success of a company. You have no control over other investors. You have no control over anything.
4. The odds on options are not that great. Even compared to blackjack our betting the outside of a roulette table they are just not that good. 
5. Many people that are far more intelligent than you are, lose money at stock investing.
6. Your emotions and FOMO will be a hindrance and problematic. 
7. Most stock investors are too young to understand the market cycles

I like stocks as a small part of an overall investment strategy for young people for the following reasons.

1. Time is valuable and you have the most time
2. Compound interest is the ""force"" behind all investing and compound interest compliments the stock market very well
3. Certain strategies can complement long-term wealth building

Building wealth through stocks is like trying to build a house one brick at a time...just you, and you are gathering the straw, digging the mud, and pressing each brick by hand. When it rains many of your bricks will wash away. If the sun shines for enough days then you will make good progress. 

The problem is that all markets cycle. The housing market cycles. Petroleum and natural gas cycles. The stock market cycles. I believe that a full market cycle is around 18 years with around 7-12 years in an up cycle and 6-11 in a down cycle. In the stock market, they call these bull and bear markets. We are currently in one of the longest bull markets on record due to interest rates and the feds printing money. No one has a crystal ball but sooner or later the market will peak. When this happens Boomers will be the first to pull money out and put it into bonds or CDs. Boomers are as big of a whale as retail can get. Anyone and I mean anyone could have made money in the current market. If ten years ago you had asked a five-year-old to pick five of their favorite things and invested in their choices you would have made money. That could be Barbies, YouTube, Pizza, Sprite, and their Dog. They would have made money on any stocks you picked around those five things. 

There will come a day sooner or later when Boomers and GenX will see trends in the market that they don't like. Boomers own multiple houses and are deep into retirement. GenX is a small but powerful generation that is now on the back Nine Holes of life. Gen X will largely inherit the wealth of the Boomers. There will come a shift towards mitigating losses and that shift is not far away. When they move their money from markets so goes the market.

Is it fair to say that one of the longest bull cycles on record could transition to one of the longest bear cycles?

Let's look at Millenials...a generation that is struggling to just buy a home. Boomers own a few. GenX may own a couple and Millenials that are now entering into their forties struggle with one. Millenials are a massively sized generation that I believe is now bigger than both GenX and Boomers combined because Boomers are dying at a rapid pace. Millenials are the generation that were adults starting life and careers in 2008 and full-blown families with Covid-19. Maybe one of the unluckiest generations. 

GenZ is this very talented and intelligent generation. Y'all are creating disruptions in culture, in politics, and in Wall Street. You are savvy and demanding. Giving billionaires the finger while pissing on the front door of their mansions. 

But you need to be careful.

Stocks are not the key to your success. They are just a single tool in your toolbox. A better tool may be early homeownership or owning a small business. Life is about options...and I am not talking about the gambling options of Wall Street. I am talking about the options of having equity in a home to adapt to economic swings. I am, talking about the options of owning a small business where your day to day decisions make you smarter and more valuable. Where you own assets that make you money. Most importantly you have control over your own destiny.

I am not telling you not to invest in stocks. I am just telling you that it should be a limited part of your overall strategy in life. Unless someone has been through two complete cycles of the stock markets then I would take their advice with a grain of salt. 

General advice:

1. Don't sell stocks that you have taken a loss on
2. Buy when everyone is selling and sell when everyone is buying
3. Invest in stocks with a strategy based on your knowledge and experience
4. Invest only what you can afford to lose
5. Stocks work best with time. Leave them alone
6. Be a value investor
7. Invest with a purpose

Number seven is important. For example, I like Robotics, AI, and Automation. I like these is two specific areas....transportation and mining. I operate in the Transportation industry. I know that very soon human drivers will be eliminated and self-driving trucks will take over. Trucks will be loaded, driven, and unloaded without a single human being doing any of that work. With that will come an entire supporting industry. Tow trucks will need to be automatically dispatched when trucks break down or in accidents. AI will need to be involved in decision making. I will see these changes before I am dead and I am 42.

I like underwater mining. Our oceans are the next frontier and the next gold rush. We have areas of sea bottom that has very little life but is rich in gasses, minerals, and thermal energy. Automation, AI, and robotics will play a huge role in underwater mining. I will see this transition start in my lifetime and I am 42.

Beyond that, once we have machines that are capable of underwater mining then we have the basics for machines that can mine inner-system planetary objects. From nearby asteroids to the moon, to thermal energy collection closer to the sun, to Mars and beyond. The wealthiest person in existence will be the person that is able to start the first off-planet mining operation. Where there is no EPA, no taxes on land, where we are not building sub-divisions next to mines. Where we don't have to worry about the ecosystem. Where gasses and pollutants are not pollutants because there is nothing of consequence to pollute. The largest land-owners in existence will be the owner of off-world mining operations. That may not happen in my lifetime...but it may in yours.

I like investing in Meme stocks because they are fun. But I also invest in Robotics, AI, and automation with one-single question....is this company taking humanity one-step close to automated transportation or underwater mining? I invest with a purpose. 

Sure I will grab up some value stocks every now and then. People are going to be flying more than ever in a few years. People are going to be more social than ever in a few years. Shoot Condom manufacturers are a buy right now because people will be..........you get the idea.

The whole reason that I wrote this excessively long post is to maybe get you into thinking about your strategy....what is it? And to caution you on being ""all-in"" on stocks.

We pay with euros ,dollars whatever your country choose to use and the stuff we buy gets more expensive every year. While our netto gets lower and lower (we don\`t realise it). 

I made a account by a bank to save money and all i got from that was a  interest rate of 2\~3 cents in a year :D i mean wtf !! The fees for the account where bigger. 

If you are not one of the few people who actually had parents with money or a big idea you are nothing. Billions on Dollar / Euros ,ect... are wasted by people playing with it. 

But the solution could be dogecoin. Not influenced by the banks or an economy ,but just by what people think about it. The idea of a doge = a doge is awesome and you should hold and buy ! Whatever it takes to make this great.

personalfinance,Tax trouble with the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts,"Let us rewind to about 6 years ago (2015). While home from college for the summer (home is in Massachusetts and school was in Rochester, NY), I got a summer job working as a software developer for a company in Boston (lets call them Company A). I returned to Rochester for the fall semester, but kept working remotely and part-time to pay for rent, gas, and food.

Day after New Years of 2016, I dropped out of school and moved to Colorado Springs where I got a full-time job as a software developer at a company there (lets call them Company B). I worked there until the end of August at which point I decided to re-enroll in school, and so I moved back to Rochester, NY and have been living there ever since. Throughout the entirety of 2016 I continued to work remotely and part-time for Company A, both when I lived in Colorado \*and\* when I lived in Rochester. Near the end of 2016 I ended my employment with Company A

In early 2017, I received two W2s, one for Company A, and one for Company B. The W2 for Company B, as expected, had my Colorado street address and the withholdings information for Colorado. The W2 for Company A, however, had my mom's home address in Massachusetts listed on it since I never changed my address in my employers payroll system, and also had the withholdings information for Massachusetts. I filed my federal tax return using H&amp;R Block and reported both my incomes. I also filed a Colorado tax return as a part-year resident (and filled out part-year resident tax calculation form) but I was only taxed on the income I made for Company B. I never filed a Massachusetts tax return, nor a NYS tax return. No one claimed me as a dependent for the 2016 tax year, and so box 6a was checked off on the 2016 1040A that got sent to the IRS.

Fast forward to around today, and I have begun receiving letters from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue claiming that I owe them about twice the amount of tax than what was withheld as reported on the W2 from Company A (along with all of the interest and penalties from not paying and not filing a return). In total, they are claiming I owe them around $2500.

What do I do? Do I hire a lawyer, or a CPA? Do I just cough up the money and pay the DOR?

Edit: Before people come saying that they're fraudulent letters, I have verified that they indeed came from the Mass DOR by logging into their TaxConnect system at their [mass.gov](https://mass.gov) address, and I was able to see electronic versions of the letters they are sending me.",finance
stocks,USPS Contract for replacement to the LLV,"Just want to bounce a suspicion I‚Äôve got off the collective mind of the sub. 

It looks like the replacement to the Grumman LLV used by USPS will come down to either the Oshkosh or the Lordstown motors bid. Given that Biden is saying Federal vehicles will have to be EVs. 

Either would be a smart choice, but my suspicion is that Ohio‚Äôs swing state and 18 electoral votes vs Wisconsin‚Äôs 10 (typically non battleground) electoral votes will lead Lordstown to land the $6B bid. 

Granted $RIDE is up (a little too up for me at the moment) I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôll dip on Earnings 2/15 and would be a smart buy. I‚Äôm basing this purely on the USPS contract which ‚Äúshould‚Äù be announced in March, and I‚Äôm not considering their 100,000 non binding truck preorders whatsoever.

Local governments are playing open and close with this so it's hard to know how long you'll have a job if you try to get employed.

Only issue is they DON'T PAY. I went an entire month without being paid. Many people have never been paid or are paid on and off or are disqualified. The system is a fucking mess. And now, because our government can't do shit right we've got loans with interest rates in the fucking hundreds. You dont even need to have a job now. And they send you messages.  I think I got desperate at one point (even though I was working) and looked at taking out a loan just to pay back the bills I racked up from the few months my husband didn't work while I did. 

Now I'm not working and the calls from bill collectors are getting more aggressive and the calls and texts from people offering loans are getting more frequent.  This would break any weak willed person. This is completely fucking wrong and I want the world to fucking know how vile and sick and predatory the financial system is.

investing,Drone Delivery Canada * $TAKOF * DD [10X UPSIDE],"Drone Delivery Canada Corp. is a drone technology company focused on the design, development, and implementation of its proprietary logistics software platform, using drones. The Company‚Äôs platform will be used as a Software as a Service (SaaS) model for government and corporate organizations globally

&amp;#x200B;

Drone tech is really hot sector right now and I feel this is immensely under valued. I am not going to make this post a long one, rather I will just list things good about this company.

&amp;#x200B;

* As I mentioned earlier drone industry is hot atm, look at UAVS, ALPP or BANT
* As part of the Company's technology roadmap, it plans to integrate various aspects of AI into its solution, including the use of AI in leveraging.
* Relaxed regulations for drone parcel delivery to take effect in March!
* The Company has created one of the healthiest balance sheets I've seen in a long time
* Included in 'OTC Markets Group Announces the 2021 OTCQX Best 50' awards.
* Currently trading around $1.1
* Todays volume has been a record.
* $0 DEBT!
* $20 million dollars in the bank.
* WSS has a price target of $6.5
* Undervalued 77%!

&amp;#x200B;

The list really goes on and on I will list all the refs for relevant info for you to look at, but one of the major news recently is that:

* **The Company is in discussions with various Federal and Provincial Government agencies and Canadian logistics providers and is hopeful to commercially participate with its advanced, patented drone delivery as the vaccine distribution plans start to roll out across Canada, and potentially internationally.**

I personally think this is HUGE!

&amp;#x200B;

CONS:

* Earnings have declined by 39.6% per year over past 5 years.
* Makes less than USD$1m in revenue (CA$63K).

&amp;#x200B;

'Whilst it's great to see that Drone Delivery Canada has already begun generating revenue from operations, last year it only produced CA$63k, so we don't think it is generating significant revenue, at this point. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on how the cash burn is tracking. While it hardly paints a picture of imminent growth, the fact that it has reduced its cash burn by 40% over the last year suggests some degree of prudence. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward.  As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Drone Delivery Canada's cash burn. In particular, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap stands out as evidence that the company is well on top of its spending'

personalfinance,"Car is broken, can't fix and I owe so much","I'm embarrassed to be admitting this but I've gotten myself into a crappy financial situation. I'll try to be as clear as possible. After a divorce and unavoidable bankruptcy, my vehicle (which was reliable and almost paid off) was repo-ed because my ex didn't ask to leave it out of his bankruptcy case like he was supposed to and confirmed he had done. It was a total surprise to me. So I went and financed a reasonably priced used car with a horrific interest rate because I'm a single mom who needs a car. My plan was to repair my credit as best as I could and refinance after a year or 18 months. Then covid happened. There were a couple of months over the summer that I had to take advantage of my loan holders covid relief option and skipped payments and I wasn't able to improve my credit as much as I'd hoped due to loss of income and heavier reliance on credit cards. So at the beginning of this year I had a car that had been well maintained that was upside-down by 4k at least and a still horrific interest rate. I was hoping to pay off the difference with covid stimulus money and trade it in for another used car at a better interest rate this spring.

 When I took it in a couple weeks ago to have a leak looked at, I was told the power steering is out and there's at least 3k worth of damage to repair. So now I can't trade it in, I can't drive it without causing more damage, I don't have the cash to fix it and can't get approved for a payment plan. I still have a 9k loan on the vehicle that I am responsible for. I'm at a loss. Should I scrounge up the money to fix my clunker, try all over again to fix my credit, pay off the difference and trade in the car? It's going to cost me at least 8k and at least a year if I'm lucky. My other options seem to be having the car voluntarily repo-ed and trying to negotiate a settlement price on the balance of the loan. But that will set me back even further credit wise which is the opposite of my ultimate goal. I guess, I'm trying to decide which is the best option so I don't make anymore mistakes and dig my hole deeper. Are there any options I'm missing? My credit is not even 600 right now. I can't get approved for anything.",finance

investing,This metric suggests there's an economic boom ahead ‚Äî and possibly inflation,"From the article: As Washington squabbles over stimulus, the bond market is already counting on lots of fiscal spending and an economic bounce back. In an extreme case, inflation might be a risk.

The metric the bond market is watching is the Treasury yield curve, or the difference between rates on various maturities, now at its steepest level since May 2017.

A steepening curve is typically viewed as a positive sign for the economy, the stock market and corporate earnings, while a flattening one is a warning for economic weakness.

The widely watched yield curve shows the difference between short- and long-term interest rates.

In this case, looking at the 2-year yield, now at 0.11% and the 10-year yield at 1.12%, the spread is 1.01 and edging higher with the rising 10-year yield. Rates move opposite ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs being driven by the fact that policy, fiscal and monetary, is allowing there to be stronger economic growth for longer, without the Fed getting in the way, and that basically is allowing the economic cycle to extend further into the future,‚Äù said Jim Caron, head of global macro strategies on the global fixed income team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

There are expectations of rising inflation, and this is being priced into the market, he said.

economy,Question About Minimum Wage,"Over the years, a $15 federal minimum wage has been suggested. Places like Seattle (I think) have already adopted it.

My question is, how will a $15 minimum wage be feasible nationwide?

Let‚Äôs consider LA. In LA, things are more expensive. It‚Äôs on the wealthier side. Housing is less affordable and whatnot so businesses in the area willingly already operate above-minimum wage. Would a $15 minimum wage really do much to wealthier areas? So it wouldn‚Äôt be helping those areas.

The argument here is that inflation has happened and minimum wage has not been linear.

The problem I see is that with less wealthy areas, where the housing is cheaper and whatnot‚Äî small towns‚Äî, they obviously will operate closer to the minimum wage because they just cannot afford high pay. Again, the area has cheaper housing so it balances out to a livable wage. If the federal minimum wage is raised to $15, how can these less wealthy areas manage to abide by it?

1. I estimate for myself that I am going to hit the max bracket for capital gains for state(\~6%) and federal (37%) and I store 43% of my gains in a secure asset like cd's or bonds or something. I dont know much about either...will research more; I hope you get the point. I'm talking about some kind of asset type that cannot be withdrawn upon and maybe has a flexible maturation date, so that I can liquidate prior to tax season?  ...as I type this out it seems like I have some more study to do about what asset type to use. Asset type isn't important to the strategy question. **-The con for this scenario is that I can't use the gains to reinvest and create exponential growth. The pros for this scenario is that 56% of my gains are still re-investable, and that I can't take a loss that would eat into my taxes.**
2. I continue to trade away and not withdraw from the account. To be honest, I will maybe get a lunch if I forget to bring it from home, or something small and occasional. When tax season comes, I liquidate what I need in order to pay taxes. **-The con here is that I have money that will be owed in tax placed in a higher risk position. The pro is that I can continue my strategy and try to create exponential gains.**

[Monorepo architecture pic](https://i.imgur.com/oqSXz6M.png)  
  
This layout is what I've come up with from reading through tons of articles and being convinced that Nx suits many of our needs where I work. The layout works fine for a company of this size because we need opinionated architecture to keep things running smoothly.  

## Goal  
  
I want to achieve **isolated development, testing, and deployment** while using a monorepo.
  
I have a few concerns with common workflows that I'm not sure how to approach just yet.  
  
## Questions  
  
**Case 1:** I want to work only on homepage, how can I avoid having to have the entire mono repo locally? 
 
   - I read about [how Microsoft solved for this](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/bharry/scaling-git-and-some-back-story/), but we don't have access to Azure DevOps at the moment and I wonder if this isn't solvable in some other way. Also, [the open source tool](https://github.com/microsoft/VFSForGit) they built requires a platform compatible with it, such as Azure DevOps.  
   - Are Git subtrees a solve for this? Would my monorepo look like a collection of child repos (subtrees) that, in reality, live in their own repos, and are just declared here for build/deploy reasons? This seems to ruin all the benefits of having a mono repo in the first place.

**Case 2**: I want to deploy changes I made to the homepage app without having to build &amp; deploy every app in the monorepo. How?
   - Is Jenkins able to use Webpack to solve for this and build &amp; deploy only specified apps or changed apps? Even if all of it is in a single repo?  
  
This may be a simple case of not knowing what to search for, but federated modules and monorepos are also relatively new.",technology

personalfinance,Appropriate time to pull trigger on down payment for used car?,"Here today with the all so familiar car loan advice post. Thank you in advance for taking the time to help! 

**""New""** **Car Info:** 2018 Subaru Crosstrek 2.0i ($19k) - 30k miles - Clean carfax - one previous owner - certified pre-owned from dealership (there have been a lot of similar deals to this that I've been keeping my eye on the last 6 months - in other words, if this car gets sold, no big deal)

**Me Info:** Credit Score - 740 range - paid off student loans - no credit card debt - steady full time job (pre-tax income range 40-50k). without unnecessarily getting into monthly expenses I'll just add that the information below is based on living comfortably without serious budgeting.

**Loan Info:** Target loan plan = aiming for 7-8k down payment -&gt; 48 month loan hopefully with low interest (2% - 5%) from personal credit union. Minimal payment being \~$250 for security, but overpaying as I can afford $350 - $400/month on car payment  (I'm aware that some loans have penalties for paying off early - I am assuming I can obtain a loan that allows me to finish early)

**Current Car Info:** 1998 Camry - 180k miles - lots of maintenance still needed (timing belt, catalytic converter, annoying alignment issue that re-occurs, driver's seatbelt issue, etc). Not expecting to get much (&lt;$500) for it in exchange and not willing to spend over $1,500 on repairs to try and sell it privately for $1,200 (best value possible for my car).

**Justification:** I have been putting a lot of money on repairs/replacements into this car over the last 2 years while keeping up with regular maintenance and I believe I am at the point where I am wasting money. Obviously all cars are going to depreciate and you will always be ""losing"" money, however I want to move on to a more reliable car that is safer to drive, more fuel efficient, and matches my life style (using a 1998 Camry with no roof rack to lug my 10.4ft + 60lbs  kayak has gotten old).

**Question:** Essentially, how much should I put into a down payment for this car (or a crosstrek of similar value)? I know that there are a lot of ways of strategizing car loans and I would love to hear feedback on my plan. My only reservation about putting 7-8k down is that I would leave my savings a little thin and in these times of uncertainty (global pandemic) I know it would prudent to not reduce my savings by more than 50%. Also, I've read several posts on similar topics and have seen a lot of opinions stating that you shouldn't even be applying for a loan if you do not have the money to cover it. Obviously, waiting and saving more is the best plan - perfect scenario for me is to have a comfortable amount (equal to the down payment) saved prior to pulling the trigger.

My biggest rationale for paying a high down payment is to have the least total interest paid by the end of the loan, since the interest rates I will probably be approved for will be 2 - 5% (let's say 4%).

Ex. $19,553 with 4% interest and no down payment will actually be $22,681.48 with a monthly payment   
of $472.52 for a 48 month term.                                 &lt;OR&gt;                                                                                 
$19,553 - $8,000 down payment will leave me with a loan of only $13,401.42 with the 4% interest   
and a monthly payment of $279.19 for the same term.

The best reasons I have for following through on my plan is to ultimately pay less interest ($1,800 vs $3,200) and it gives me a more flexible loan payment plan for the future.

Thanks again for reading - please rip apart this plan if it sucks since this will be my first time making a decision of this caliber and I know I still have a lot to learn and consider before making my decision.",finance

personalfinance,"My cousin tanked his credit score (to the 400s), please help me give him the best advice","My cousin has asked me for help to raise his credit score, and I knew right away to come to you guys. I've already given him some advice I've read here but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything. 

The Situation:

My cousin is in his 3rd year of being an RN and around April 2020 had a bout of depression and general ennui. He works in a hospital and of course was working a lot thanks to Covid, plus he is the primary caretaker for an older relative with MS and mild dementia. He has a mortgage with Wells Fargo that is paid biweekly. He didn't have the energy or motivation to schedule those biweekly payments for several months. He's doing better now, and has been paying the bills again but had about 4 months of non payment (which means 8 late/non payments).

The financials:
He makes more than enough monthly to cover all his bills, and I've been teaching him about Finances/investing. His car is paid off. He has 0 credit cards, no student loans. The only real debt is the mortgage, and he has enough money to pay off the past due in one fell swoop.  (Which I told him to do ASAP).

His mortgage was inherited from his parents about 10 years ago (who did NOT make great financial decisions). It was a refinance done in 2006, with a variable interest rate  currently at 4.2% and a balance of 130K.  It has 15 years left on it. The house is old and small, but sits in what is now a very, very expensive area, and the land is where the value lies. If he sold today he would get about 400K. (He will not sell, fyi).

So, money wise he is okay. But his credit score is in the 420-470 range. And so begins the action plan to increase it.

He said the bank never started a foreclosure process,  which I believe might be because of the covid legislation. Would covid forbearance be able to be applied retroactively? Would he even qualify as his Covid related struggle was mental and not financial?

If on time payments help his credit score go back up, should he keep the biweekly payment schedule or ask to change to a monthly plan? (I've already advised him to set up auto-pay for the future).

He's very worried about his credit score now, because he had wanted to refinance the mortgage as he hates the variable rate and bi-weekly schedule, plus he thought he would need to pull cash out for a new roof. I priced a new roof and it falls between 8k-12k, much lower than he thought, and advised him to just save up for it. So the refinance would really just be for a lower rate/better pay schedule. 

He is also applying for a secured credit card, which I told him to setup a recurring charge/autopay cycle for something like his monthly cell phone bill. He is looking into the Experian Boost thing, too. I told him once he can qualify for a normal card (and suggested he look into his work's credit union), to apply for that too and continue the small charge/payoff in full cycle. 

He has one other derogatory mark which is a 1000$ amount in collections from who knows what.  He can pay this off in full, but which would be better for the score, an in full payment or a settlement with the debt collector for less?

I explained to him that credit score impacts access to jobs, housing, and credit. His needs in these areas are met, and the only other area I can think of is insurance. Am I missing any other area of life such a low score could harm him?

Would his car insurance rate go up once the policy renews due to the really low credit score? We live in south Florida where our rates are criminally high even for perfect records. 


Is there anything else he can do to pull the score up? How long would it take to at least get to the low 600s?  How high would it need to be to even get a decent, fixed rate refi for whatever time is left? (I've already told him not to refinance another 30 years, that was the bullcrap his parents did everytime they got broke and tapped into the rising equity).

Would you suggest not even refinancing at that point, since he could afford to just save money and invest it, or pay off the mortgage earlier? He is currently 40, so he's getting into the retirement savings game late, now that he is on a more high paid career path. He currently isn't sure if he would ever move, as it is his childhood home and he likes the area. 

Thank you so much! I hope I didn't forget any details. Edited to add that he is now seeing a therapist and has really enjoyed the process.",finance

defi,DeFi on the Rise Again. A Bubble Carnival or A Value Discovery?,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ttcktq7vrff61.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26a1ef874d527e6629416eb41e5a794279d6d323

1. Driven by U.S. stocks and giants, DEX has seen an upsurge

The past 2020 was full of turmoil and chaos, and for the blockchain industry, it is also a year full of ups and downs and a year heralding a bright future after painful reflections on the development direction. In 2020, some turned blind to risks and suffered heavy losses, while some broadened their horizons and saw their pockets swell. In any case, the market has been invigorated in the end. The most eye-catching in the bull market is, apart from BTC and ETH, the decentralized finance, or DeFi, as you may hear of it more or less. 

Not long after January 2021, BTC has entered an adjustment period, and ETH is poised for take-off. Instead of flooding into the stagnating mainstream coins, the hot money in the market has once again rushed into the DeFi sector. At the same time, in the raging GME incident in the US stock market, RobinHood directly forced the sale of retail stocks, which undoubtedly promoted the DEX in DeFi. Many of the world giants have stood by Bitcoin, and even praised DeFi. In this context, UNI, SUSHI and INCH have skyrocketed, and the leader UNI is about to enter the top 10 of CMC.

&amp;#x200B;

2. How to look at DeFi? Is it a bubble carnival or a value discovery?

So, for those who cleared UNI airdrops, sold Sushi when it hit the bottom, and hesitated to invest in DeFi yet eventually suffered losses from it, how to look at DeFi?

To answer that question, we must be clear about a simple truth: everyone in the market cannot earn money beyond their knowledge. To be specific, if you have more knowledge than others in BTC and ETH, you are more likely to buy tokens at the bottom and earn money. In that case, you profit from your knowledge. On the contrary, how can an uninformed investor be benefited from DeFi? So, a bubble or a value discovery, the answer depends on your knowledge about it.

&amp;#x200B;

3. What‚Äôs the origin of DeFi and where lies its future?

Origin:

Many believe that BTC, which was born in 2009, is the earliest DeFi. BTC was originally designed as a decentralized Internet native asset, a hedge against inflation, and a means of payment, though nowadays BTC is increasingly recognized as digital gold.

Development:

However, for stability and security, BTC only allows limited programming. As a last resort, ETH was split from BTC in 2015, providing new possibilities for the crypto world to move toward decentralized finance through smart contracts.

Evolution:

In 2017, thanks to the infrastructure provided by ETH and the impact of the BTC halving cycle, the crypto world witnessed bubble bursts: all kinds of exaggerated concepts involving e-commerce, SNS, medicine, big data, and artificial intelligence + blockchain kept emerging and falling into decay. Shitcoins could never survive the test of time. Only a few projects represented by Maker, KNC, and ZRX have finally survived and maintained business growth. Why? Because they are the first DeFi projects that keep exploring the stablecoin and DEX along the right track of the crypto world.

In 2018, people felt excited about yield farming before the bear market, but few knew the initial version of Uniswap, which follows the concept of the liquidity pool, had been set up and iterated, a potential hit amid the DeFi boom in the summer of 2020. 

In 2019, Havven, which was originally a stablecoin, finally found a new world of synthetic derivatives after struggling on the original track. Possibly inspired by the prosperity of the public chain Staking in 2019, the team modified the economic model, so that users can gain incentives for staking the native token SNX. That was the earliest DeFi yield farming, and also contributed its share to the DeFi boom that summer. 

In 2020, the quiet accumulation period was over, and as everything was ready, and it was time for DeFi to emerge and evolve rapidly:

At the beginning of 2020, Ethlend in the segment of lending transformed into AAVE and applied the loan pool concept to reform its business model. It also promoted DyDx's lightning loan function and thus gained market attention.

In April and May 2020, UMA made its debut on Uniswap. It has drawn widespread attention for a sixfold increase in a short period of time. After that, the huge increase in long-tail tokens such as HEX, XIO, ESH, and XOR has brought about the Fomo effect. That was when Uniswap was officially unveiled and achieved a cold start without issuing tokens. Liquidity pools under the X\*Y=K algorithm became famous overnight. However, at that time, these long-tail assets were not large in scale and did not have greater influence, which was nicknamed ‚Äúthe gathering place of small projects‚Äù. 

June 2020 witnessed a milestone event that officially brought DeFi to the center of the stage: COMP started loan mining, and users can obtain COMP governance tokens by borrowing on Compound. COMP rose tenfold on Uniswap, and later launched Coinbase, which surprised those victims from the March 12 incident. At the time, few realized that the seeds planted in 2018 or 2019 had finally germinated, and the era of DeFi yield farming had just begun.

In July 2020, YFI helped people automatically switch assets on the AAVE and COMP lending platforms based on interest rates to obtain higher returns. It distributed all tokens fairly through a liquidity pool. Without tokens for investors or those reserved for the team, it has created a new fair distribution model similar to POW, which has brought considerable returns to participants based on innovative products. Many people accustomed to mining, withdrawing, and selling at COMP later felt a pang of regret.

At the same time, the market price of AMPL, in the Rebase concept, soared to hundreds of millions of dollars amid the DeFi boom, claiming to make all investors, both informed and uninformed, rake a lot of money. Many became rich within only one month. 

In August 2020, Curve, Uniswap's improved stablecoin exchange platform, officially issued coins. Driven by its extremely high daily token output and market enthusiasm, Curve has become a hot destination of mining. Stablecoins with an annualized income of nearly 100% can be seen everywhere, which was a miracle for the traditional financial industry. Then YFI cooperated with Curve to create smart mining, a model to capture CRV output. With this innovative function, YFI has sent its price skyrocketing from several thousand dollars to above $40,000, even more expensive than BTC then. Its developer AC has been pushed to the shrine, and the concept of financial aggregator has been deeply rooted in the public. Copycat projects starting with the letter Y emerged one after another. 

The reason why AMPL is mentioned here is that, stimulated by the great success of YFI, there was a market trend to distribute tokens fairly by the community. AMPL, which boasts an eye-catching team and investors, also achieved great success last month, but a large part of its tokens was distributed as a result. Therefore, a project called YAM was initiated by the community, aiming to replicate its success by forking AMPL in a fair distribution method by the community. But at present, it seems that YAM‚Äôs biggest contribution is to create Pool 1 and Pool 2 for DeFi yield farming. Pool 1 is a staking pool for lossless mining and fair distribution, while Pool 2 needs to mortgage tokens in Pool 1 to provide liquidity for LP Tokens in DEX, which is riskier but more rewarding; however, DeFi undoubtedly comes with huge risks. The Rebase Bug almost ruined YAM. Despite its effort to struggle and develop, such a big mistake was really regrettable at that time.

As YAM fell, another DeFi named Sushi rose. Thanks to the exquisite front-end developed by the Yam team and the contract provided by Comp, ambitious Sushi quickly iterated to replace Uniswap that was in its heyday at that time, continuing YAM‚Äôs aspiration to squeeze out AMPL. The story of Sushi seems like a big drama, and it succeeds for two reasons: first, it attracted liquidity providers from Uniswap as the latter did not issue tokens, thus gaining influence; second, after a rally, it vigorously reached cooperation on building the ecosystem and updated its product to gain market share. 

In September 2020, Uniswap issued UNI as an urgent response to Sushi, and, as everyone knows, it airdropped 400 UNI to every wallet that has any operation. That symbolized the start of the fiercest competition in DeFi. Following DeFi miners and Three Arrows Capital, retail investors, who once ignored and were confused about and indifferent to DeFi, now all rush to buy Sushi, Pearl, and tokens whose name start with Y. The potential bull has gone, and everyone comes to one side of the boat, making it capsize.

In October 2020, DeFi entered a bear market, and numerous investors suffered 70% or even 80% losses. 

However, contrary to the general belief, DeFi did not go down like the model currency in 2019. During the short bear market, there were many interesting and innovative events in segments such as insurance, options, fixed income, algorithmic stablecoins, and leveraged mining. As you know, DeFi soon resumed from the bear market in November, and adjusted itself in fluctuations the next month. After BTC and ETH completed their trends, DeFi has once again embraced a bull market and seen a surge this January, accompanied by the GME incident in the US stock market and the recognition from giants. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. How to look at DeFi? 

After reviewing the history of DeFi, we may have such a scene in our mind:

The blockchain world used to be a nihilistic Utopia where a group of geeks and geniuses, who hated traditional finance, invented BTC, hoping to trade (say, a pizza with BTC) and live in this BTC-driven wonderland.

As the world outside is getting chaotic, more and more people have come here. Later, a genius boy was attracted. He brought a more interesting toy, Ethereum.

Indeed, Ethereum is fun, but just when everyone didn‚Äôt know how to make better use of it, outsiders flooded in with various purposes and set up their stalls to peddle their gadgets. They claimed Ethereum was capable of this or that, and some even said they had something better than Ethereum. All they wanted was nothing but BTC and ETH. 

Overnight, this Utopia was filled with peddling and speculation. After the bubbles burst, the peddlers took away BTC and ETH, leaving a depression here.

It was till then that people realized Ethereum should function in this way. To calm the fluctuations in BTC, they staked ETH in a maker mechanism and created a stablecoin DAI, and then turned to Compound and AAVE to facilitate mortgage lending. People outside the Utopia are interested in Ethereum, and thus bring USDT and USDC for long trade of BTC and short trade of USDT. What‚Äôs more, they apply YFI to financial management, and make it possible to automatically switch to the platform with the highest return, Curve to large exchanges of stable assets, Uniswap to speculation and investment, NXM to insuring their assets... In one word, the Utopia has everything they have outside, and makes the impossible things outside possible and even better.

To me, it‚Äôs an interesting and valuable kingdom. Though with some bubbles, what kind of assets do not have bubbles? The outside world is full of bubbles. After all, even the giants in the outside world recognize DeFi.

dogecoin,Why Dogecoin isn't a JOKE!,"The world has already started to make efforts to normalize the use of crypto, and it'll gain absolute adoption way faster than most people end up believing. 

""But Why Doge, it's just a joke right? ""
- NO!

When crypto becomes the global standard of economical dealings and transactions, Bitcoin will turn into a premium Gold-like asset (limited and valuable). Doge on the other end has all the best aspects of Bitcoin and some excellent ones of its own. It provides faster transactions. It is way less intimidating, which will be the most prominent cause for global adoption by the masses. People need things to be convenient, you won't choose to transact tiny fractions of one BTC to purchase things on a daily basis, you'd rather use something more convenient ""Doge"". It's price won't peak and make it a premium asset due to the production and availability of new coins to the market. 
You might have the question then ""But don't we already have all of these features in our fiat currency?""

- Some but not all,  we've no way to know what goes on beneath the hoods in the Feds, plus a Central authority not just has the potential to track every single purchase to you, but can also restrict some if it deems fit. A decentralized system hands down the control to the normal people thereby providing transparency and control.
Dogecoin in particular is gaining fast adoption due to the community that stands behind it, and it's not just on Reddit, it's ""everywhere"". And who knows perhaps, you or your child could pay for your first coffee on Mars using ""Doge"". Dont panic due the volatility. Think Long Term, if you can't seem to imagine a future where Doge has any usage, Downvote this post and forget about whatever I just said!

economy,Questions on EU Monetary Policy (and beyond?),"Forgive the ignorance - I‚Äôm not exactly an economist.

I‚Äôm looking for clarification on two things which irk me in the ECB‚Äôs role and policy:

1) Why has the ECB kept rates at below zero for so long? Doesn‚Äôt this limit its ability to effectively combat deflation? Isn‚Äôt it a cause of stagnation in the banking sector? Isn‚Äôt it generally a poor idea? The EU economy has been pretty stagnant for some decades now. Could this be a cause?

2) How does rate manipulation even work out? I‚Äôve heard Eurosceptics often cite the example of Germany and Greece. Their economies are largely uncorrelated - where one does well, the other might do poorly. However, monetary policy is effected centrally. For example, if Greece experiences deflation whilst Germany is hitting its target inflation rate, the ECB will lower rates to stabilise Greece, and likely drive Germany into excessive inflation. This argument makes sense, but surely it‚Äôs not the whole story? What‚Äôs the rationale in favour of this system?

Thanks!

P.S: The reason I ask is because I‚Äôve been pondering both sides of Brexit lately and I‚Äôm trying to reach a conclusion on who is objectively more ‚Äòright‚Äô on the issue. Is the EU a stagnant econo-political bloc which is destined to fall behind the US/China/India/ME? Or is it the only way to manifest the cumulative resources of the EU nations so as to be taken seriously on the world stage, despite the costs to economic growth and individuality?

dogecoin,Why I‚Äôm holding but you probably aren‚Äôt ( even if you think you are),"Okay for all you people that are new to dogecoin here I‚Äôm going to explain this since you probably don‚Äôt even know what a cpytocoin is or why it‚Äôs worth money. The short answer is it‚Äôs not worth money. It is money a new kind of money and it‚Äôs not controlled by the government that can print more or raise interest rates so it seems like there is less. It‚Äôs money free of that influince and controlled by the people. So this is a risky thing and you need to make decisions for your self and I‚Äôm recommending that you do or don‚Äôt do anything but try to study this and make your own choices. Especially because of all the newly termed paper hands it‚Äôs likely to be a loser for some if not a most people.  I am still holding because as the governments of the world print more money during this pandemic the paper money if the world should devalue and crypto not reliant on it should rise. (Just an opinion not a fact) So out of all the cryptos Why dogecoin I think right now it is the  3rd most popular coin so a market cap of 50 billion isn‚Äôt unimaginable in the next couple weeks or months making it worth 50cents. After that it might even be popular enough to overtake ethereum (which is also not capped for you naysayers) and then it could  hit 1-5$ by years end or 2022s years end. So how do we do this. We treat it like money not a pump and dump that we all sell as soon as it hits 10 cents or 50cents or even 1$ we keep it. Then say you need to pay a bill you take out the bill amount even better you find a store that accepts dogecoin and support them. You treat it like it‚Äôs money and use it to buy things you can afford (don‚Äôt spend it all on that Ferrari down payment) If we do this Dogecoin will be past the moon. This is what it means to hold not just keeping it until you think it‚Äôs time to bail( that‚Äôs just pumping and dumping). Anyway I am not telling anyone what to do but I a, actually holding. This is not advice and because of people don‚Äôt understand this please read more about it and try to understand the risk. Anyway good luck.",cryptocurrency

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500 look to extend their rallies to four straight days

&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 looked to add to their three-session winning streaks. The Nasdaq on Wednesday dipped after two straight days of strong advances. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 eked gains Wednesday following rallies Monday and Tuesday as the Reddit-fueled retail trading frenzy dissipated.

&gt; * GameStop was once again volatile, finishing up nearly 2.7% at $92.41 per share Wednesday but still down 71% from Friday‚Äôs close of $325. In last week‚Äôs 400% surge, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $483 each. GameStop rose modestly in Thursday‚Äôs premarket.

&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 830,000 filings for initial unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 30. That would be down from the prior week‚Äôs 847,000. The government reports its January employment report Friday. ADP said Wednesday 174,000 jobs were added last month at U.S. companies, more than triple expectations.

*****

&gt; # 2. Ken Frazier to retire as Merck CEO at end of June

&gt; * Merck Chairman and CEO Ken Frazier will retire effective June 30. He‚Äôll be replaced as CEO by company CFO Robert Davis. Frazier, 66, will become executive chairman for what the drugmaker described as a ‚Äútransition period to be determined by the board.‚Äù Frazier, one of the few Black corporate leaders in the United States, has served as Merck‚Äôs chief executive since January 2011.

&gt; * Frazier‚Äôs retirement was announced Thursday morning shortly before Merck reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of estimates. Per-share profit was $1.32 on $12.5 billion in revenue. Merck forecast full-year 2021 earnings between $6.48 to $6.68 per share, which were higher than analyst expectations. Dow stock Merck was little changed in the premarket.

*****

&gt; # 3. Apple and Hyundai-Kia pushing toward deal on Apple Car

&gt; * Apple shares rose nearly 2% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket, the morning after CNBC reported, according to multiple sources, the tech giant is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. The so-called ‚ÄúApple Car,‚Äù which is being developed by a team at Apple, is tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, though people familiar with the talks said the eventual rollout could be pushed back.

&gt; # 4. Klobuchar unveils antitrust reform that would impact Big Tech

&gt; * Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company. House antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms that would impact Big Tech.

*****

&gt; # 5. Biden signals flexibility on Covid stimulus

&gt; * President Joe Biden encouraged Democratic lawmakers to ‚Äúact fast‚Äù on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan but also signaled flexibility. Changes he indicated he would consider include limiting proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans with lower income levels, which directionally could draw support from Republicans who want a much smaller package. Biden told lawmakers in private comments Wednesday he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot married‚Äù to an absolute number for the overall bill but wants them to ‚Äúgo big‚Äù on pandemic relief and ‚Äúrestore the soul of the country.‚Äù

investing,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&amp;P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&amp;P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&amp;P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability &amp; Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&amp;P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH &amp; TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&amp;P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

investing,Buy US MSOs not Canadian Cannabis Companies,"Federal prohibition prevents MSOs from:

1) Using banks (or taking credit cards).
     They literally sit on piles of cash. 

2) Listing on major exchanges

3) Moving product across state lines

4) Taking any tax breaks

The Canadian companies are running right now based on name recognition and the US based MSOs are lagging despite them having stronger financials and already being in the US which means less regulatory hurdles when federal prohibition ends. Not only are the financials currently more attractive but the end of the above regulatory issues will all lead to gains in efficiency. I also believe Canadian is outperforming MSOs due to robinhood not allowing OTC trading. If you want to get in on Robinhood buy the ETF $MSOS. If you want to dive deeper check out it's top holdings.

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment - High Paying Private vs. Government Job,"I have roughly $600k of federal student loan debt mostly made up of GradPLUS loans (no judgement needed, I judge myself harshly enough for all of us). I currently have an opportunity to accept a high paying private sector job with a salary of approximately $175k with bonus potential of an additional $50k (taking total compensation up to $225k) or a government job with a salary of $120k. I will begin student loan repayment within the next two years. I'm attempting to weigh the positives and negatives of each option.

The biggest pro of the government job is the ability to utilize Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which will allow me to make income-driven payments for ten years with the balance of the debt forgiven. Additionally, current tax law does not tax the forgiven debt because it was forgiven under the PSLF regime.

The biggest pro of the private sector job is the additional income, which in good bonus years could be north of $100k more annually. In years where there is no bonus, the delta would still be approximately $55k.

If I go the private route, I estimate that (without utilizing any tax planning strategies), I will pay approximately $800k on the student loan debt (around $400k in PAYE income-driven payments over the next 20 years and just shy of $400k in taxes on the forgiven student loan balance at the end of the 20 years). 

If I go the public route, I will pay roughly $100k over 10 years using the PAYE income-driven repayment method and have no tax due on the remainder of the debt that is forgiven after 10 years.

Thus, without taking the time value of money into account, I will pay roughly $700k more in costs related to student loan debt by going the private route. Again, that $700k is not adjusted for the time value of money (such calculation yielded a roughly $350k present value using a 5% rate). 

On the other hand, the earning potential over the next ten years is also substantial. Without taking into account pay increases and assuming that I only received a bonus every other year, the increased amount salary is $800k with a present value of approximately $617,000.

I guess the crux of my question is whether I am correct when I compare the PV of the savings by going government ($350k in today's dollars) vs. the PV of the increased earnings by going private ($617k in today's dollars). 

Certain factors such as quality of life (such as work life balance) are roughly equal between the two jobs. I am strictly focused on the financial benefit of each. Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,can I take out a student loan on past-due tuition,"Hello all. So long story short, I worked at a university and took advantage of my university's tuition remission program. In my last semester, I left employment with the university the day after my final exam. I specifically called HR to see if i'd keep the benefit if I were to quit the day after my final, I was given wrong information (they said I had nothing to worry about), and now im being told I need to repay the benefit since I left before the ""official semester end date.""

&amp;#x200B;

In short, can I take out a federal student loan or something for this past-due tuition. Do I have any other options? I could pay it off if necessary but id much rather get a low interest student loan if possible since the money i'd use to pay it off would have to come from investments that are getting me a nice rate of return.

breakingnews,"BREAKING: U.S. unemployment claims fall to 779,000, but job cuts grind on","WASHINGTON ‚Äî The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits declined to 779,000 last week, a still-historically high total that shows that a sizable number of people keep losing jobs to the viral pandemic.

Last week‚Äôs total dropped from 812,000 the previous week, the Labor Department¬†[said Thursday,](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf)¬†and is the lowest in two months. Still, before the virus erupted in the United States in March, weekly applications for jobless aid had never topped 700,000, even during the Great Recession.

Thursday‚Äôs report reflects a U.S. job market that is still suffering from the pandemic, with hiring having weakened for six straight months. It is a key reason President Joe Biden is pushing Congress to enact a $1.9 trillion economic rescue program, on top of a $900 billion federal aid package that was approved late last year.

All told, 17.8 million people were receiving unemployment benefits in the week that ended Jan. 16, the latest period for which data are available. That‚Äôs down from 18.3 million from the week before.

I no longer work for the company that I had the 401(K) with so I felt like it was useless.  I rolled over the 401k to a newly opened Roth IRA with the same broker but I was under the impression that untaxed funds could not be rolled over into a Roth IRA so I requested that 20 percent tax be withheld from my transfer ( I thought this was normal ).  I now have my 1099-R forms in front of me and while doing my taxes, it seems as though the 20 percent in taxes that I had withheld is counting as an early withdrawal.  I received 2 separate 1099-R forms, one which was the full amount of funds directly rolled over and one that states it was an early withdrawal (the entirety of which had federal income tax withheld).  

I now have 2 problems:

1. I'm paying an early withdrawal penalty on what I thought was going to be taxes withheld to transfer to the Roth IRA 

2. It seems as though this transaction is counting as taxable income which I was under the impression that it was not.

personalfinance,Hard pulls when applying for new credit and a car loan?,"I'd like some advice on applying for several lines of credit in a short period of time. I am one of the fortunate new grads to have finally found employment beginning in April, and at the moment, I only have one credit line (Discover It card) with a limit of $2,350 (1.5 years old), but I want to increase this as soon as I'm earning income in April. I also would like to apply for 1-2 more cards to further expand my total credit, lower my utilization, and add more lines to build my score up for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

While my job will be starting remotely, we are expected back at the office no sooner than July, possibly August/September (contingent on COVID developments and vaccines). This means I would need a car, and would most likely get a car loan for this (unless I buy cash through Craigslist, which I'm iffy about). I'm worried that the hard pulls for Discover + 1-2 other cards (and a lower avg. age due to the latter) will ding my score for a while, and cause me to get a less-favorable interest rate on an auto loan. My credit is currently in good standing at ‚âà 725. 

&amp;#x200B;

What would be the best course of action here? Should I only apply for one of either the increase or a new card?

investing,Some actual GameStop DD (Not positive),"Disclaimer: Not financial advice, just my opinion on the current drama. I lost about $300 on GME trying to catch the knife, but made a ton on AMC. (Bought at 4.5, sold at 14.) I still own 137 AMC Shares and no GME.

Here‚Äôs some actual DD on GameStop: These are the point I personally used to make the decision not to go all in on GameStop. (The price is currently sitting at 2x what it was when I made this list, but I stand by my decision.)

You think they‚Äôre going to pivot into being some massive online retailer? They‚Äôre not.

**Remember ThinkGeek?** It used to be an amazing place to buy cool, niche nerd stuff. They designed and sold their own products, along side some licensed products. I still have a bunch of awesome stuff I purchased in its heyday. It was the place to go for anything not mainstream.

Gamestop purchased ThinkGeek in 2015. The first thing they did was sell out to Disney. The store became a crap-fest of Star Wars and Minecraft merch.

After purchasing ThinkGeek, GameStop opened some ThinkGeek-branded retail stores. Again, the company you think is going to pivot to online turned a successful website into a failing junk shop in the mall.

ThinkGeek shut down in 2019. The only remnant of ThinkGeek are those racks in GameStop stuffed with shitty Minecraft plushes and water bottles.

Two takeaways: -GameStop isn‚Äôt able to competently assess what consumers want. -GameStop doesn‚Äôt know how to have an online presence. -GameStop can't even keep a profitable business running even if it's handed to them.

**GameStop Revenue:**

40% of GameStop‚Äôs revenue comes from screwing over children on used game buybacks. If GameStop decided to move away from Video Games, they lose a huge revenue stream.

\-The GameStop business model is not agile enough to change significantly.

**Computer Parts:**

GameStop employees are incompetent. In 2018, I purchased a White Wii U from a GameStop. The clerk told me he didn‚Äôt know the Wii U came in white.

Selling PC parts would require more space. At the average GameStop‚Äôs current size, they would struggle to have a significant inventory of computer parts. Becoming something like MicroCenter would require GameStop to invest in real estate to get enough room to grow.

\-If GameStop sells computer parts, they will have only a handful of items in store and the clerks will not be knowledgeable enough to help people decide which part to buy.

personalfinance,I've never refinanced before. How do I know if it's worth it to refinance?,"My current mortgage rate is 4.375% and I see rates below 3% right now. I talked with my current mortgage holder about refinancing and they gave me a rate of 3.125% for a 30yr mortgage with a lower monthly payment, but it included 6200 in closing costs rolled into the new mortgage. That seems rather high, and I have no idea how to judge if that is a good idea or not.

Here's my situation -

* Bought a fixer-up house in April 2019 for 140k (NY). Put in some money and it's now probably worth around 180k
* I've been aggressively trying to pay off the mortgage by making extra payments whenever I can. Currently mortgage, taxes, insurance, and PMI comes out to about 1175 a month, and I pay 1500 a month on it.
* Currently owe about 121k on it, with a Loan-To-Value rate of 81.7%. If I can get that below 80%, I can drop the PMI which is about $45/month.
* I have no plans on moving anywhere anytime soon, as I love my house (even if the taxes here are rather high)

So I guess my question is, is refinancing at the above rate worth it? I'm almost at the point where PMI can be dropped soon, so would refinancing reset that? I've been slowly watching as the amount paid for principal rises and the amount paid to interest lowers, would that ratio reset if I refinanced the loan? Should I consider re-financing at a 15-year rate instead because of the even lower rates there? I'm pretty sure I could get that with the current payment of 1500/month.

**Update**: Thanks everyone! I've started the process to refinance at a 15yr loan with a 2.125% interest rate. I'm amazed at the difference in interest paid that will make, and it has the added benefit that I can drop my PMI early. Closing costs are still higher than I would have expected, although I guess that's just NYS which I'm told has the highest closing costs in the US. Break-even point is still about a year, so its well worth it.",finance
stocks,Do you think memeing is a legitimate way of investing?,"I‚Äôve been reading this sub and other finance subs for a while now, and it seems like retail investors like us primarily do two types of analysis: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.

Technical analysis seems like it‚Äôs trying to gauge investor sentiment graphically. However, I‚Äôm not sure how relevant these forms of analyses are in the world of quantitative easing, low interest rate, and quantitative hedge funds. With quantitative easing and low interests rates, it seems like the context has changed too much for value investing to be relevant. We always joke that the stock will go down because the company had a blowout earnings report and justify it by saying ""it's priced in"". With bots, quantitative hedge funds can look at fundamentals faster, look at a wider set of companies, better define relevant companies to compare against, and develop more intricate models rather than simply looking at P/E ratios. So, whatever fundamental analysis we do will always be at a disadvantage.

In the aftermath of a certain stock fiasco, I think information arbitrage using memes is a legitimate form of analysis, maybe better than fundamental and technical. For those that don‚Äôt know, information arbitrage is when we use alternative data other than a company‚Äôs financials to evaluate a company.

Although we can‚Äôt do these tasks as fast as computers, I think humans have an edge, albeit small and fading, in understanding language and especially memes. Language changes quickly on social media, and humans adapt to the evolution of language much more quickly and with less supervision than AI. Meme formats change and evolve quickly online, and we‚Äôre able to understand the underlying meaning with few examples whereas AI need lots of heavily curated data to learn the same thing. By the time they learn one meme, the format may change invalidating the older model.

I was lurking around /rstocks and found this particular sentence, which gave me a feeling of an epiphany (""enlightenment"") or however you call it.

I just realized how common this story is and probably just like me, most of you could relate to this if you are below upper-class (working/middle class) and you never studied economics or another business-related course at your university.

The ""Keep them poor"" comes from the author of the book ""Rich and poor dad"" written by R.Kiosaki. It opened my eyes, but actually, nothing happened. It was interesting, but no one around me had any clue about passive income, assets vs. liabilities and so on. My parents invested in some funds proposed by their bank, steady 2% pa. All they cared.

In high school and at my uni, I had 1 subject about economics, but these classes were not engaging and most of us did the minimal effort as we thought that you can't have a business without money, we haven't been taught (if the wrong gramma sorry, it's my 2 language)  ANYTHING about passive income and how to get the most out of it. Probably even our economic teachers don't use their knowledge in practice or they just don't want to share it?

**I would give you more articles or data, but that's not the point. The key idea of this thread is:**

1. **To appreciate the high volume of new traders.** I understand the frustration that suddenly all stock-related subreddits are flooded with dumb questions and low content threads. It is annoying when people keep asking if they should invest in stock x, y or z and spamming ( üöÄüíé), Remember that hype will fade after some time, but 20-30% of these new investors will remain and start to learn!  Look at the bright side, more people = more trades = more gains/losses (üòÇ), but also **there is a chance that we increase the amount of financially literate people among this 90%!**

Collectivist is a good thing and in this case, we should share our wisdom, by giving resources or advice to new traders, while **new traders should not expect straight answers (like sell or buy). That's not learning, but being lazy.** There are already threads about being patient and helpful, so I am really grateful for those(Shout-out for the authors). Meme stocks promoted investing, which is beneficial for society as far as a society didn't invest all savings into this stocks this week xD

To me it seems like recasting is a good idea. It would eliminate PMI, get us a bit of a lower of an interest rate, and make our payment lower. We would be setting aside the rest divided between emergency fund, putting in retirement, and for home renovations. 

But is there a smarter way to invest/make more money on our profit?",finance
personalfinance,Depositing money in the bank!,"Hello y‚Äôall ! 

I‚Äôm a 22 year old student, and recently I got a 5000 bucks cash prize. I plan to save it, and deposit it in a bank account that has ~2.0 interest rate.

It would very nice if people could tell me if I‚Äôm doing the right thing. I‚Äôm just  starting on my journey of learning financial knowledge, and it‚Äôs such a rabbit hole that I get lost and demotivated every time. As of now, I assume that my money would be better in a bank account. 

My very general goal is to generate wealth in the long-term. 
Any resources or advice that would help me in this would be highly, highly appreciated.

personalfinance,How should I tackle debt and save for a house?,"Hello, I am 26 and in the US. I am currently employed around 65k a year before taxes. 3% goes to 401k company matches to 6% but been using that extra 3% towards building an emergency fund since I learned a few hard lessons not having one. With car issues. And then paying extra towards loans.

I‚Äôm now looking towards building some extra savings up to build up to pay off student debt faster as well as save for a down payment for a house. Currently around 60k in student debt. 7k on a car loan, the student loan is like 50:50 private/ fed loans so the fed loans being 0% have been using that payment to pay off my car faster than the 5 year run I think I should be able to pay it off by aug when it ends.

I currently have Nokia, BB, NAKD, and Aphria stocks but I think I‚Äôd rather be in an ETF where I don‚Äôt need to constantly follow the company news. I have around 1000$ in robinhood right now. My company offers a stock program for reduce price but it comes out of paycheck. They gave us like 5% of our paycheck in stocks in sept that vests in sept this year since they pushed back our reviews.

Debt pyments per month is 315$ priv loan ~ 4.5% interest Fed loan 50$ Not paused ~ 4% interest Fed loan 296$ 0% interest till aug Car loan ~ 200$ a month 6%ish interest

Rent is around 1100$ a month with utilities and pay is about 3600$ a month. I use my credit card to buy most things for reward pts then pay it off.

Bought a few things recently so credit card balance around 400$ but should be gone in a pay check or 2.

My biggest aim is to get out of debt and get a down payment for a house. I can be a little risky but do like to play on the safe side.

Forgot to mention ~3k in a savings account. Not sure if I should keep that there or move it where it gets better interest? I‚Äôve been using that for a safety fund.

Soon I should get around 1.6k from tax return and was thinking about using that for my car as well as if we get another stimulus.


Should my safety fund be in a better account? It doesn‚Äôt seem to get a lot of interest. 

Is a first time home buyer program something I should look at? I plug into Zillow and a decent house in a safe neighborhood looks to be around 150~250k. Any lower and it‚Äôs not the greatest area of crime index.

&amp;#x200B;

# Currently:

I am pretty happy with our current state of finances. I'd love advice / thoughts, if you have them though.

As a background - I graduate with my B.S. in 2017 with no debt, I worked for a year before going back to school. I graduated with my M.S. in the spring of 2019 (with student loans) and began working as a data scientist at a startup. I live in a medium to medium-low cost of living area.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jobs / Income:**

\- My wife and I bring in $7,000 per month ($85k per year) post-tax.

\- I work at a start-up, we have raised a decent amount of money and I have never worried for a paycheck but I recognize that this is generally more risky than working at a large, established company.

\- My wife is in graduate school (M.S.), for which she has an assistantship so her tuition is paid for and she gets a stipend. She also has secured a fellowship which she will begin using once she completes her M.S. and begins her PhD. That fellowship will pay for her tuition and also give her a stipend which is worth $1,000 more per month than what she currently makes. We will most likely be moving to a different city for her PhD.

&amp;#x200B;

**Savings / Retirement:**

\- I save $2,600 per month and it is going into a high-yield savings account (Ally bank, at 0.5% right now).

\- My job recently opened up a 401k for us but they do not have any type of employer matching. I am not currently contributing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Property / Assets:**

\- We own both of our cars. We bought two, 3 year old cars in 2019 when I graduated because my parents were previously letting me borrow the car (hugely thankful for that) and my wife got into a fender-bender which totaled her older car.

\- We currently have $24k in cash. I was planning on paying off a majority of my student loans in a lump-sum when the forbearance ended at the end of January but the extension has changed those plans a little bit.

\- I have shares at the startup which may one day be worth something but I'm not factoring them into my plans. I wanted to mention it in case it came up though!

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses:**

\- We spend $3,500 per month for all of our expenses (I'm including our allotted ""fun money"" in this too), not including student loans.

\- We have a miscellaneous $1,000 / month that goes to an emergency fund that seems to always be spent on something; car repairs, vet bills, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Debts:**

\- I currently have $27k of student loans from my M.S. degree, which are currently in forbearance due to Covid. Its interest is 6.6% and I'm planning on paying them off when the forbearance has expire at the end of September.

&amp;#x200B;

# Future:

Here are where many of my questions are, and I want any feedback you can provide!

&amp;#x200B;

**Emergency Fund:**

\- I would like to build a 6-month emergency fund. With our current expenses of $3,500 / month, that will be $21k. I am most comfortable with 6 months for the emergency fund, especially since I work at a startup and the data scientist job market is pretty competitive right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Student Loans:**

\- I want to pay off my student loans the moment that it makes the most sense to do so. I am planning on paying them off right before the forbearance has expired at the end of September, in which we will have saved an additional $20k. Since this is a relatively high interest rate (6.6%), I will dip into our 6-month emergency fund to pay it off. This will drop the emergency fund down to around 4-months of savings but it will be able to be built back up pretty quickly. Does this make sense to do?

&amp;#x200B;

**Retirement:**

\- I am not currently contributing to retirement, and it feels most natural for me to knock out my student loans before starting to add to my retirement accounts. Once my loans are paid off, and I've brought my emergency fund back to 6-months, I plan to contribute 15% of my income ($16k) to retirement. I believe that putting $12k into Roth-IRAs and then contributing the remaining $4k to my company's 401k plan makes the most sense. If I'm understanding it correctly, that would be $6k for my Roth-IRA and $6k for my wife's Roth-IRA. This is one of the places I am most fuzzy and would greatly appreciate guidance here.

\-- Does it make sense for me to contribute to a Roth-IRA and not a traditional IRA? I found it hard to follow the Wiki entry [regarding this](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) because I don't know all of the answers to the tax questions there.

\-- Does it make sense to max out the X-IRA and then contribute the rest to my company's 401k? I believe that this follows the prime directive!

\-- Does it make sense to contribute 15% to retirement after I've built back up my emergency fund? Or should I begin to contribute 15% while rebuilding the emergency fund? I feel like this is pretty arbitrary, and I'd rather be focused with my money, but I'd love feed back on this!

&amp;#x200B;

**Buying a home:**

\- My wife and I are planning on purchasing a home when it makes the most financial sense. She has 16 months left until she graduates with her M.S. and we are expecting that she will be getting her PhD in a different city than the one we live in now, and this will most likely be a very high cost of living area. Her degree is expected to take between 4 and 6 years, but she says that it will most likely be 4 years. The prime directive states that it only makes financial sense to purchase a home if we are going to stay somewhere for at least 5 years, to purchase a house that is no more than around 3x-4x my income (so maximum of around $350k), and, for my entire life, I have heard that I should put at least 20% down before purchasing a house.

\-- With my current finances, I would be saving approximately $1,300 per month for this eventual down payment. With $70k down, that would mean saving 4.5 years to build this. I have no problem doing this if it makes the most financial sense, but I am curious if cutting down retirement contributions (to 0?) would make more sense in order quickly gain these funds. The only reason I ask this is because of the *potential* for extraordinarily high rent where my wife does her PhD. There is a part of me that is asking whether it makes sense to take a loss when we sell after 3.5 years (assuming she completes her degree in 4 years, and that it takes 2 years from now to build enough for a down payment on something affordable). The more I write about this, the more I am realizing that perhaps buying in a VHCOL area doesn't make sense.. and that I don't know enough to make a well informed decision. Regardless, this is another point where I would appreciate feedback and anecdotes!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this wall of text, and for helping me with any feedback that you may have. I will carefully read through all of your replies and respond with additional questions. I am happy to read any resources that have been helpful for you too!",finance
stocks,Monthly T-Bill Investment,"I already have $6k in the stock market/other risky investments, with $8k leftover in my savings account, and this is really the ratio I'm most comfortable with; I don't feel too comfortable shelling out much more into risky investments. I'm also still a dependent of my parents, and I don't really have any bills or consistent payments I need to make (except for food when I'm not eating college cafeteria food).

I was thinking since the $8k in my savings account doesn't really have anywhere to be used, letting them sit in the (extremely) low-interest savings account might be a waste since I just don't need that much cash. Would buying a 6-month T-bill every month be a good idea? My intuition is that by buying a 6-month T-bill every month, I would get a much higher but still extremely safe interest rate than the savings account, while maintaining a minimum $2k still in cash (savings account) at all times. Since I'm not willing to take on any more risky investments (I might consider AAA bonds too, but that's another story), does this kind of process make sense?

As for buying the T-bill, I was thinking I would simply get new issues from the Treasury directly (through Ameritrade), since I don't really want to deal with the stress of having to do due diligence with bond pricing calculations in the bond market. I'm still super busy with schoolwork and internship stuff and whatnot.

Well, the 2020 to 2022 is a period for gaining significant momentum in the Smart EV sector and which shall rapidly accelerate from 2023 to 2025. As we are noticing multiple companies in EV sector trying to launch their products.

Most of the companies would love to be part of the growing EV sector as it just the beginning excluding TESLA. They will eventually develop products/platforms for OEM's and Tier1 and provide it as a service.

As EV sector evolves more, we should see more partnerships across other companies which aren't part of BB yet might be inclined to use at least one product. As the BB product offerings are diverse and the customer success stories about how they have played a role while manufacturing their own EV products with minimal efforts can boost the marketing efforts.

Chen stated they are going after the other 6 OEM's which aren't using the Blackberry yet. Currently, BlackBerry QNX has design wins with 19 of top 25 Electric Vehicle OEMs, who together have 61% of EV market.

# How is BB coping up during the COVID?

The company expects BlackBerry QNX revenue to be negatively impacted by a slowdown in automotive market related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of which could be partially offset by increased customer demand for the Company‚Äôs endpoint security and productivity solutions that support business continuity and remote working environments, including the BlackBerry Spark platform, SecuSUITE and BlackBerry AtHoc.

# What's upcoming and where is BB focusing strategically?

As you see, the [gross margin](https://imgur.com/Qf6fp2n) has been consistent past few years and revenue is steadily increasing every year.

Notes:

In 2019, due to restructuring, BB was unable to close deals, we should see +ve in 2020.

IoT: Comprised of QNX products, UEM, &amp; Radar

Other: Handheld Devices and Service Access Fee (SAF)

Since BB was moving away from manufacturing of devices gradually, in 2020 most of it done by third party companies. That‚Äôs why we have negative growth under **Other.**

# Pricing for BB products

**QNX Pricing:**

As there are many modules under QNX, like hypervisor, ADAS, clusters, cockpit, IVI. The cost ranges anywhere from the low-single digit dollars to literally high-single digit or low-double digit dollars per module.

Trefis estimates BlackBerry generates about $4 in QNX revenue per vehicle. Automakers are only expected to ship about 62 million new vehicles this year, according to Statista Research. Assuming QNX is installed on at least half of those vehicles, BlackBerry would generate about $120 million in annual sales -- or nearly a fifth of its trailing 12-month software and services revenue -- from QNX this year.

Unfortunately, we don't know the exact price the QNX OS costs or per say other modules under QNX. If more modules of QNX are used, then it's adds up and the Average Rate for Per Unit might be 4x or 5x.

This gives us an idea about how to get more revenue from QNX itself when the manufacturer would use other modules under QNX apart from OS.

We have already seen list of the OEM's from previous posts and in the above spreadsheet you saw list of the QNX products certain OEM's are using

IoT subscription period is typically 4 yrs.

**Radar Pricing:**

Estimation in 2017:

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar.

The Go-to-Market objective is to have approximately a 50-50 split in Radar sales between BlackBerry‚Äôs channel partners and its direct sales force. BlackBerry Radar partners typically sell only this particular solution.

Recently, BB was able to expand channel ecosystem to more than 12 channel partners, this new partnership might help BB capture more of the logistics and transportation area.

**Cylance Pricing:**

Cylance might charge 55$ per endpoint per year.

Announced that Forrester found that BlackBerry Cylance‚Äôs AI-driven endpoint security products delivered a 99 percent return on investment. We will see more revenue in 2021 as we shared earlier that customers who bought UEM are excited about UES too.

At present, the market share is below 1%.

**Projected Product Sector Revenue Growth by 2025:**

**QNX:**

According to survey, the Global In-Vehicle Infotainment Market size is expected to reach $42.7 billion by 2025 (This is where we shall see more competition from different OEM manufacturers as they build their own products)

Global Market Insights, Inc. has recently added a new report on automotive operating system market which estimates the global market valuation for automotive OS will cross US$ 4.5 billion by 2026

And the QNX OS (Just the OS) segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 15% from 2020 to 2026

**Endpoint Protection (Cylance):**

The global endpoint security market is expected to grow from 13.58 billion $ in 2020 to 19.24 billion $ in 2025 at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period.

Assuming the market share in endpoint increases to \~3%. It can be around 577 million

We have to know what the priority level for BB for this product and how much market share they are targeting in the upcoming years. It‚Äôs quite early to say about it and the contribution to the revenue is insignificant compared to other products.

**Challenges:**

QNX:

Toyota, VW, Mercedes Benz have started taking route of AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) which is an open source (free to use) which implies the QNX market share in OS is waning. These are big manufacturers and how blackberry shall adapt is wait and see game.

There is always a case where companies might decide not to use more of the QNX modules just the OS, this will impact the Average Selling Price (ASP) per car as well as the revenue since those modules add up 4x-5x ASP.

IVY:

Revenue from Blackberry IVY shall be more reflective from 2023, stated by Chen. So, there is uncertainty in this area and no revenue estimate. We have to see how this partnership plays out how companies are willing to adopt cloud platform for insights and management of the automotive software‚Äôs.

Cylance:

Currently, the market is highly competitive, and BB has to make it way to top 10 and capture more market share. In 2021, it shall unfold more about it as we are seeing rapid growth in IoT sector across various sectors.

The BB is in the right position to capture more of the automotive market and we have to see how it shall play out in coming years when EV sector is full blown and more cars are delivered, and security threats increase. Also, it offers the endpoint protection, which certainly companies can benefit but not necessarily the SMB which are driven through e-commerce platforms.

Radar:

It‚Äôs barely scratching the surface in this sector and as there are bigger sharks who have been in the market for long time.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company previously stated that it expected to generate $100 million in cumulative revenue from its BlackBerry Radar asset tracking solution over the next three years. The Company no longer expects to generate this revenue within this time frame. (This is a set back and there are other competitors who have been in the Logistics and Transportation Industry for quite some time).

In general, BB has to pitch itself more aggressively in other sectors especially in Medical, Industrial, Oil and Energy. Considering the certifications they have and the clients they serve.

Target Price in 2021: 25-30 (by not considering crazy valuations into account). I personally believe if the IVY platform and Spark product revenue increases then we can certainly see the stock price 4x-5x in coming years.

Positions: 400 shares @ 12 and 2 Jan 20 2023 SP 15. I plan to add more as I see the potential and growth in the newly introduced products.

Can  anyone share some insight on the ETF?  How about on Muni Bond ETFs in  general?  Is this a time-bomb in-waiting with rising interest rates in  the future?  I know in general higher interest rates push down the face  value of bonds, but I'm not sure if that's correlated directly with  Munis.

FWIW, the ETF yields 4.83%  annually, tax-free, which is equivalent to \~7% taxable.  And it pays  monthly so it's nice for an income stream.

personalfinance,FFEL Student loan consolidation,"I was hoping someone might have advice for my student loan questions.


Background: I currently owe around 62k in student loans. All of it is FFEL loans. My interest rate is 6.375% and I make a payment each month for $391. None of that payment goes to the principle because I have around $900 in unpaid interest that I've been working on for years. I am on the Income Based Repayment Plan and have made 10 out 25 years of repayment until my loans are forgiven. 


I have the option of consolidating to a Direct Loan. My interest rate will likely not change. However, with all the talk this administration is doing about possible loan forgiveness in varying amounts and the support I see to push for either a reduced interest rate or 0%, I'm thinking maybe I should take the gamble and throw away those 10 years toward forgiveness. If I stay with my FFEL loan, it likely won't qualify for any executive orders or legislation that pass since it doesn't qualify for the covid relief currently. But if I consolidate to a DL I'll have to make 25 more years until it's forgiven. Since I don't make a lot of money and it seems I never will with the career path I've ended up on, an IBR is likely my only way to pay this debt off. 


So should I take the gamble and consolidate to DL or keep on paying on the track I'm on and hope they don't abolish this program before I reach the goal?

stocks,Good opportunity coming for mREIT's,"Yield curves have been steepening lately, with long-term rates rising much faster than short-term rates. This is very good news for MREIT stocks, especially the more stable ones like NLY/AGNC.

These reit's make their money via the spread on long and short term interest rates. It's possible that they will raise their already fat 10%+ dividends even higher over the next few quarters, which may cause a quick increase in share price. 

Book value may decline, but that was only really a concern early in the year when there were worries about margin calls and liquidity. It's likely that most mreit's even the most troubled ones will see a nice return through 2021. 

IMO it's a nice option for investors looking for a decently reliable 15-20% return on their stock over the next year. 

Main downside - dividends from REIT's count as ordinary income, so putting them in a roth IRA may be a good option. I'd also re-evaluate at the end of the year.

stocks,Dividend investing: Personal Lessons and Prospects,"It‚Äôs been a while since I compose any long post on Reddit and wow I can‚Äôt remember how many dramatic events have occurred. As a dividend investor I have learned a lot of lessons in the past few months, some with benefits, others costing me money. Just want to share some personal thoughts on dividend equities and things I‚Äôve done to prepare for 2021.

I consider myself a dividend investor and in the past few years I was doing alright. My equities portfolio primarily consists of more established industries with a consistent record of dividend payment, such as manufacturing (especially consumer products and machinery), energy, airliners, hospitality, REITs, retail, military industries, telecommunications, and media. I did buy index ETFs but not a lot. For the sake of safety, my bonds portfolio was mostly US treasuries ETFs with different maturity dates and only a small portion of investment grade and high-yield corporate bonds was included. I also invested heavily in gold ETFs. For the past few years, I reaped a steady 3%-5% dividend each year. I rarely trade my portfolio but whatever I have sold generally also brought realized gains. As of early March 2020, my entire portfolio still had a roughly 25% upside. I can‚Äôt say I was doing marvelously in investing, but at least I was happy with the situation. 

I don‚Äôt need to mention how the COVID pandemic changed the entire economic and investment landscape. All I need to say was that sometime in March 2020 I witnessed my portfolio turning from 25% up to 10% down in the matter of days. I was not accustomed to frequent trading, so I was shocked and didn‚Äôt know what to do. Most established and cyclical industries took a heavy beating, so not only did stock prices plummeted, but dividends were also generously SLASHED. On the other hand, all these up-and-coming-pandemic-benefiting-concept stocks that I totally did NOT understand were soaring through the sky. By the time I came to my senses and figured out what I should do, I was in a situation where my portfolio loss almost equaled all the dividends I‚Äôve earned in the past few years and then some. I was forced to adjust my strategy. I sold stocks that either would not recover very soon or still showing gains to cover the losses, and bought in stocks, ETFs and bonds that were doing alright while still generating good dividend. I did more trading in 2021 than in the past 4-5 years combined. In the end, I still ended up earning some money for the entire 2020, but the majority I have owned was eaten up by my initial losses.

In light of the past and looking forward to 2021, My personal thoughts are as follow.

\-Dividend investing is NOT like high-yield savings account or CDs.

personalfinance,Dividend investing: Personal Lessons and Prospects,"It‚Äôs been a while since I compose any long post on Reddit and wow I can‚Äôt remember how many dramatic events have occurred. As a dividend investor I have learned a lot of lessons in the past few months, some with benefits, others costing me money. Just want to share some personal thoughts on dividend equities and things I‚Äôve done to prepare for 2021.

I consider myself a dividend investor and in the past few years I was doing alright. My equities portfolio primarily consists of more established industries with a consistent record of dividend payment, such as manufacturing (especially consumer products and machinery), energy, airliners, hospitality, REITs, retail, military industries, telecommunications, and media. I did buy index ETFs but not a lot. For the sake of safety, my bonds portfolio was mostly US treasuries ETFs with different maturity dates and only a small portion of investment grade and high-yield corporate bonds was included. I also invested heavily in gold ETFs. For the past few years, I reaped a steady 3%-5% dividend each year. I rarely trade my portfolio but whatever I have sold generally also brought realized gains. As of early March 2020, my entire portfolio still had a roughly 25% upside. I can‚Äôt say I was doing marvelously in investing, but at least I was happy with the situation. 

I don‚Äôt need to mention how the COVID pandemic changed the entire economic and investment landscape. All I need to say was that sometime in March 2020 I witnessed my portfolio turning from 25% up to 10% down in the matter of days. I was not accustomed to frequent trading, so I was shocked and didn‚Äôt know what to do. Most established and cyclical industries took a heavy beating, so not only did stock prices plummeted, but dividends were also generously SLASHED. On the other hand, all these up-and-coming-pandemic-benefiting-concept stocks that I totally did NOT understand were soaring through the sky. By the time I came to my senses and figured out what I should do, I was in a situation where my portfolio loss almost equaled all the dividends I‚Äôve earned in the past few years and then some. I was forced to adjust my strategy. I sold stocks that either would not recover very soon or still showing gains to cover the losses, and bought in stocks, ETFs and bonds that were doing alright while still generating good dividend. I did more trading in 2021 than in the past 4-5 years combined. In the end, I still ended up earning some money for the entire 2020, but the majority I have owned was eaten up by my initial losses.

In light of the past and looking forward to 2021, My personal thoughts are as follow.

\-Dividend investing is NOT like high-yield savings account or CDs. You can‚Äôt just put money in the portfolio as if you were depositing it into a bank account, then sit back, relax and enjoy the interests. Dividend equities are still equities and hence they are subjected to market fluctuations. Portfolios need to be regularly reviewed and adjusted.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin just became my primary saving account,"Around 10 years ago politicians in Belgium funneled lots of money from a specific bank which i was using that time, resulting in bankruptcy and they literally blocked my accounts and stole my money to ""rescue"" that specific bank.

I later moved to Colombia because i had family there and was fed up of that corrupt bullshit in Belgium, also it opened up lots of job opportunities for me because i work a lot in South American countries. and duo ridiculous tax rates in Belgium (70% because they double tax first per month then per year on the same income)

However 2 years ago before the Corona bullshit started i sold my apartment and bought a house, i was short for $3000 USD and requested a loan, the bank tried to fuck me by trying to snatch my deal away and try to buy the house from the seller (because they require the seller details for a loan) 

I was lucky and the seller recorded the call and told me how the bank was trying to cheat on me (he hates banks)

This forced me to sell my car with $3000 USD loss in order to get the amount needed, all my bad experiences with banks have made me trust Bitcoin even more, also the bank cheated on my with my portfolio of stocks that i was keeping with them, they lied about my investment profits and kept half of the profit for themselves.

I started buying when bitcoin was around $10,000 usd, now my investment has increased 3fold and im still holding and buying.

And the best part, taxes can't know what i own and i can trade my Bitcoin into cash without locally without anyone knowing.

i bought $300 USD more today and i spread my savings in 2 hardware wallets so no fuckery and my seed is safely stored in a vault at home with instructions for my wife in case something happens to me.",cryptocurrency

Salary: $70-80k a year. 
Car loan: $360 a month, at 4.9% interest rate. 
Car insurance is $270 a month. 
Phone bill is $120 a month.
No debts. I keep my credit usage low and pay off my credit cards monthly. 

I don‚Äôt have a home right now, my boyfriend (who drives with me) and I joke around that we‚Äôre homeless.

So I was thinking instead of buying a house to rent for now, even though I would only be home one week out of the month. I know rent plus utilities may not seem worth it but I‚Äôd really like to have my own space, that I can call mine. 

Is it a stupid decision to rent? Should I just save up to buy a home and keep living in my truck for now? If I look at apartments under $1000 (everything included) would I still be able to save and buy a home?",finance
personalfinance,CreditKarma Tax Technical Issue,"Hey all,

New to this community.

I've used CreditKarma Tax to file my taxes for the past two years or so. My taxes are pretty straightforward, so it's worked well for me.

However, this year, I'm running into an issue. I've completed getting my taxes ready on the site, both Federal and State, but when I go to ""Review and File"" and then get to the step where it wants to me to ""check your email"" for a verification email (for security they say), I do not get an email. I've reached out to CreditKarma Tax support and have an email support chain going, but they seem rather clueless, tbh. They're telling me the usual, ""check your spam"" and such, but I've checked and rechecked and haven't gotten anything.

I'm thinking maybe it's because the IRS pushed filing start date back to Feb 12 this year, but wanted to post here to see if anyone else using CreditKarma Tax is running into this issue or if it really is something wrong with my account or something.

Appreciate any insight anyone can provide!

Cheers",finance

Bitcoin,I‚Äôm ditching my non interest bearing savings account for Bitcoin - I‚Äôm all in. 1-year experiment.,"I‚Äôve read up as much as I can about BTC, and have read ‚ÄòThe Bitcoin Standard‚Äô amongst others. The macro-economic climate we are living in is unprecedented with the lowest interest rates we have seen in years and the eNdless supply of helicopter money. 

I‚Äôve have struggled to save money in past, and now I understand why. Since December I‚Äôve been sAving in BTC instead of cash, whilst maintaining a small emergency fund in cash. Saving has never been easier. I don‚Äôt have any urges to spend money, in hindsight can be explained by the fact that I don‚Äôt want to let go of any of my precious sats. It‚Äôs obvious to me that Bitcoin is the hardest money invented. I want to save in a money (or asset) that is deflationary rather than the continually debased fiat our federal reserve prints. I can‚Äôt compete saving just dollars in a zero interest bearing bank account. 

I‚Äôm at the stage of life that I‚Äôm earning a decent living (not earning mega bucks by any stretch of the imagination), but can save around $1,000USD/month. 

My goal is not a lambo, or any other silly luxury, but is to have finaNcial independence. One of my medium to long term goals is to be able to secure a future for myself, be able to live in a modest but comfortable home. I want to be able to put a decent deposit on a home in 4 years‚Äô time. 

I‚Äôm recently debt free (followed Dave Ramsey‚Äôs plan to obliterate my student loan debt), and now, it‚Äôs time to build my life financially. 

So, for one year, I am going to continue this experiment. Every dollar allocated in savings is gOing into Bitcoin. It will likely continue for many more years. But for now, New Year‚Äôs Day - 2022, I will update you all with my progress. 

See you next year üòÅ",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Addressing the misinformation and FUD about Dogecoin,"People keep posting that $Doge has an infinite supply and is therefore bad. They are ill-informed.

Doge has a fixed emission. It started with halvings like Bitcoin, but now has reached a terminal emission of 10,000 Doge per minute. There's 525600 minutes per year.

Annual emission is 5,256,000,000. Current supply is 128,233,897,815

Current inflation is 5,256,000,000 / 128,233,897,815 = 4.098760226%

Next year Doge inflation will be 3.9%, The year after is 3.8%, In 10 years it will be 2.9%

In 26 years it will be under 2% That is below the target inflation for USD. But we all know much more USD was printed than that.

In just 50 years time, Doge inflation will be 1.3%

In 1000 years time Doge inflation will be 0.1%

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin reaches 0 inflation in the year 2140. That's when Bitcoins inflation reaches 0%

In contrast, Dogecoin will have an inflation of 0.7% that year. Less than half the target inflation of USD.

The USD is completely controlled by the Fed and they can print as much as they want every year and do whatever they want with it. Dogecoin has an algorithmic fixed emission.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Dogecoin has a constant emission rate. That means Doge inflation is constantly going down. In this regard it sits somewhere in the middle of Bitcoin and the USD. Spending is encouraged, and wild speculation is minimised by having more relaxed supply restrictions than Bitcoin. Dogecoin is a decentralised currency and can't be inflated by a government or malicious actor. The government have target rates for inflation, but at the end of the day they can print as much as they like, making Dogecoin vastly superior in this regard.

personalfinance,Clients may want to rethink their moving plans: CIBC,"During Covid-19, homebuyers have eshewed pricey, densely  populated urban centres in favour of remoter locations. If your client  is thinking about joining the exodus, they may want to consider  arguments against doing so, as detailed in [a report from CIBC Economics](https://economics.cibccm.com/economicsweb/cds?ID=12108&amp;TYPE=EC_PDF) on Thursday.

The Canadian housing market has been ‚Äúracing ahead with no looking  back,‚Äù the report said, referring to the country‚Äôs strong housing sales  despite the recession. Higher-income buyers were largely unaffected  financially by economic shutdowns and could take advantage of  historically low interest rates. 

Such pandemic-related factors as well as high home prices in big  cities increased demand for single-family homes in less populated areas.

Such housing trends aren‚Äôt likely to last, however, the report argued.

For example, ahead of the pandemic, home prices were rising at a  faster pace in remote centres relative to urban ones, like Toronto, and  that pace has only increased since Covid.¬†As a result, prices in remote  centres ‚Äúrisk reaching a resistance level, in which the premium paid to  live in a big city has narrowed enough to trigger second thoughts about  moving,‚Äù the report said.

Further, the trend of working from home may fail to become permanent.

‚ÄúDespite the wave of companies announcing permanent work-from-home  policies, much of the post-pandemic world might revert back to operating  like the pre-pandemic one,‚Äù CIBC said.

Based on a StatsCan survey of employers, the report estimated that  the percentage of employees currently doing 100% of their work from home  would be roughly halved after Covid-19.

Further, moving out of the city could hurt your client‚Äôs future job opportunities.

‚ÄúEven if those moving to more remote locations guess right, and  they‚Äôre actually able to do all their work from home post-Covid, there‚Äôs  still a catch: other employers might not be so flexible,‚Äù the report  said.

To insure against the risks of employment mobility and being forced  to return to the office, high earners could purchase urban condos to  stay at during the work week, as is common in cities like New York and  London.

If your client is considering such a move, ‚Äúnow might be a good time to make that investment,‚Äù the report said.

Condo price appreciation has lagged relative to single-home price  appreciation during the pandemic, but that likely won‚Äôt last long.

CIBC expects demand for urban housing will return after Covid as immigration levels normalize.

Even as things stand, urban population growth in 2020 was probably  better than records show, the report said, because of hidden numbers  related to non-permanent residents in Canada with expired visas, as well  as Canadian residents returning from other countries.

‚ÄúSome of the fears surrounding downside risks for real estate tied to urban population growth might be overdone,‚Äù it said.

The bottom line: ‚ÄúShould Covid fade into the background, as is  expected, the vibrancy of cities will return and so will the demand for  housing within them,‚Äù it said.",finance

Bitcoin,I don't invest in Bitcoin,"I don't invest in Bitcoin, I divest myself of Fiat. If there is an investment its in my future, my friends and family. Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme. It's a trojan horse let loose in the middle of the financial sector. The money printers were so busy greasing the wheels of industry and their pals with cheap money, that they didn't even notice Bitcoin for years. With the tireless work of coders, promoters and the sheer enthusiasm for an alternative monetary society, Bitcoin has grown exponentially, and will continue to do so.

Meanwhile the money printers keep on printing, happy to print to infinity. Of course this doesn't effect them, as they are financially secure whatever happens. But for the average person, it's just stealing your financial security. How many ways do they steal your wealth? Inflation, from money printing. House prices show this starkly. Zero percent interest rates, so nothing to gain by saving your hard earned money. Then they tax you, often times multiple times through VAT etc. Capital gains Tax if you do make a decent profit. Even death duties to be paid at the end of your life.

So no, I don't invest in Bitcoin, I Divest myself from Fiat and the whole casino that has been built up around it. Long Bitcoin, short Fiat. Gratitude to all involved and the one called Satoshi for having the vision for a different future.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is claiming exception from withholding smarter than continuing to pay out federal taxes from my paychecks?,"I know absolutely nothing about personal finance, but recently I got into a discussion with my co-worker where she told me how much money she made biweekly.

She showed me her paystubs and I noticed there weren't any federal taxes being taken out, meanwhile I'm paying roughly $240 every two weeks. Come to find out she was exempt from federal taxes.

I don't make very much money, last year making $36,227 with $3,732 of that being withheld.

Bitcoin,We are Fighting a Battle against the Deep State,"I finished reading a book from 1997 titled ""The Sovereign Individual"", a book that brings up decentralized digital currency at a time where the internet was just starting. I just would like to let people know I am really scared for the future. I am 29 years old and work as a registered nurse throughout Covid in a busy hospital. I have also been mostly isolated through  this experience and feel like I have had a lot of time to think. I am additionally in grad school and because of everything happening in society I feel completely distracted and honestly scared for our future because so much is happening right now. 

I feel the world This year has brought me to my knees at times while also bringing to people realization the big picture in detail. Let's look at the Gamestop situation that revealed many dirty cracks within the US financial system in clear daylight. It seems to me there was a liquidity crisis with counterfeited shares that do not exist since more then the entire float was shorted and WSB was buying the entire low float of shares. There are many ""fail to deliver"" shares of GME meaning HFs were unable to cover their short with no spare shares existing from January 15th report. A lot of Hedge Fund money was lost and I believe it was a shock to the financial system with a planned response synchronized from all directions.  They can no longer deny their mistakes. Citadel is a company that is obviously connected to everything. Yellen took 800k for consultation. Main Street Media psychological distraction towards silver, pump the price while holding call options in order to raise capital and crash price down to 26 within the next following days meanwhile an oz of physical Silver is now 36$ in the physical market.

Their plan:

There is a deep state within the elite class of America. Their goal is to enrich themselves as much as possible at the expense of its citizens by siphoning off as much wealth by any means necessary. Hedge funds are used to vacuum cash out of the stock market, Central banks provide the liquidity, government officials take a cut and receive lobby money and insider information.  Government promises to pay the money back on low interest when we all know they are incentivized to inflate the debt away through increased liquidity and stimulus. They lie and pretend inflation does not exist and skewer figures on reports to hide headline inflation meanwhile the Fed is continually debase  our currency in broad daylight. bonuses are being handed out, call options and insider knowledge is spread. Bubbles are appearing everywhere and little is produced natively to support GDP growth.

# The United States if officially a Sweat shop factory run by a group of sociopathic liars with the goal of keeping its citizens in a Feudalist state of serf-etude just as the church did in the 15th century middle ages. Keep the middle class and everyone below to barely make it while simultaneously reliant on the Feudal state for weekly income, higher taxes and increased government waste, fraud, and abuse. The American civilians are tricked into thinking they must rely on government for support and the elite deep state want it that way. The civilian government does nothing to stop a catastrophe.

PMs that are controlled by JPM on a leash via futures market. That leaves bitcoin really being likely the only way out.  My conviction is now rock solid.

We Are At War and many do not realize what is happening. I want to do whatever I can to help protect the network. I know the best thing I can do is likely run a node. I have a simple laptop and not incredibly tech savy, any idea where I can start?

# We Are at the 2nd stage of the 4th Turning in a time of extreme chaos. I am hopeful that society will become stronger after this ends. Maybe there is no end in sight the virus keeps mutating, providing an excuse to keep people indoors and away from each other, or banning together to share our thoughts.

I had this daydream of the future 20x years from now in the digital world within the book where only electronic fiat exists including Bitcoin and other private/public blockchains. There may be a time where they will try to plan how to destroy the network or steal it for themselves. If anyone nefariously reads this  I hope they find me because I will speak my mind to the world. We hold the constitutional right of decentralization within the 1st amendment.

**TL/DR:** Entire U.S. government is corrupt and will one day look at Bitcoin as a threat, or they already do and will want to destroy it. They may already be plotting to do so.

solar,US solar tax credit question,"Background:
I recently purchased a house that had solar installed in 2015. It seems like something is significantly wrong with the system because in San Francisco Bay Area my winter months kWh generation is seriously only 15% of what it was in May/June months. There was a huge drop in output from October to November.

I looked at the historical solar edge data from years when original owner owned the house/system. Comparing year to year from 2015 to 2020 it looks like the system is generating roughly 1/2 what it originally did for a given month. Several panels have significant paint overspray on them (grrrrr WTF).

Question:
If I end up replacing several (all?) of the panels, am I eligible to claim the US federal tax credit for the cost of new panels and associated install labor ( to replace old ones)? Basic info on the tax credit doesn‚Äôt address this less common scenario. To be clear: I‚Äôve never claimed a solar tax credit if that matters.",energy

I'm a more spontaneous person and don't really plan for fun things like eating out or buying headphones. Maybe Misc is too high now? I usually just save extra and dip into it when I want something.

would like to know what you think of the US push to further decirminalize cannabis on the federal level? 

in my view there are several considerations around this regulatory change that could positively influence investment outlook:

1.The no brainer states that want to decriminalize or already have have a better legal backing. 

2.Companies suddenly will have access to non-venture funding, banking services (which as I understand at this point is not the case) 

3. Will become more intersting investment case for the traditional market (pension funds etc)

4.Could be the new tabacco or alcohol?

Which company will win is on a diffrent page, but maybe you guys have a few ideas.

personalfinance,Refinancing Jumbo Loan with less than 20% Equity,"We‚Äôre first time homeowners looking to see if anyone has any experience with refinancing a jumbo loan without even having 20% equity in the loan.

**Our numbers:**

We closed on a new construction house in early 2020 for $660k, 10% down, and got a 3.625% fixed rate on a 30 year loan, which at the time was the best jumbo loan rate for our area. We pay about an extra 10% of the monthly balance toward the principal each month. We now have about $580k in principal remaining, or 88% of the initial balance. PMI is a little under $80/month. We both have excellent credit.

(Side note, we know we could probably do better than 3.625% returns by investing rather than putting extra to the mortgage principal. With a lower rate, investing more is something we‚Äôll be more likely to do, but for now this has been fine for us.)

**Context:**

We originally went with our builder‚Äôs in-house mortgage company because they matched the best rates, and they threw a bunch of money at us to cover closing costs. They made it clear that their loans would be bought out quickly by other lenders, which was fine with us because the terms don‚Äôt change. Our current lender (NASA Federal Credit Union) bought out our mortgage from the builder‚Äôs in-house mortgage company within two months after we closed, and they do not (or will not) refinance until we‚Äôre out of jumbo loan territory, and they also do not reduce/eliminate PMI either without 20% equity.

We can comfortably continue with everything exactly as it is long-term (which is why we were ok  with getting this mortgage in the first place!), and we know that historically 3.625% is a pretty good rate so we‚Äôre not complaining here, but we still want to make the most of the opportunity to get a better rate given how things have changed in the past year. When inputting our information into mortgage/refinancing company comparison sites (Nerdwallet, Bankrate, etc.), they give no results and say to reach out to banks directly, which we‚Äôre not at all opposed to doing, but we wanted to know if there is a better way to compare options than just calling lenders one at a time, hence this post.

**Our goal(s):**

I‚Äôve searched the subreddit for refinancing jumbo loans but everyone seems to have done it with 20% equity in the house, and we‚Äôre still about 3 years away from that threshold. Our top priority is just saving money on interest, so rolling refinancing closing costs into the new terms of the loan is fine with us since we‚Äôre still early on in the loan, we expect this to be our long-term house, and assuming a reasonable rate and refinancing closing costs, that will pay for itself for us.

As a smaller goal, we‚Äôd also like to find a way to not have the pesky PMI even though we don‚Äôt have 20% equity. I‚Äôve read some anecdotal accounts of people straight up asking and showing that they‚Äôre financially stable enough that the PMI is not needed and the lender agrees and reduces or eliminates it, but that didn‚Äôt seem to be an option with our current lender. We totally understand why it‚Äôs there, it just doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask to remove or reduce it.

If anyone has any experience refinancing a jumbo loan like this, or knows of good sites to use to easily compare rates, your help and recommendations would be really appreciated! If we have to call a bunch of banks that‚Äôs fine, and we‚Äôd love some recommendations for our situation. Thanks for reading.",finance
stocks,Google Stock Analysis | Complete Fundamental DD | Is Google Stock a BUY right now? [GOOG],"In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of Google, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term

**\~Very Long Post\~ \[Don't Read Unless You Like DD\]**

Hello everyone! Let‚Äôs start by talking a little about [Alphabet](https://ibb.co/NC5sqGv), they are one of the biggest companies in the world that generates most of their revenues and income from online advertising services provided through their platforms like Google Search &amp; YT while also expanding into multiple other businesses like cloud services and autonomous driving technology through their venture Waymo.

The company was founded during the dot com bubble in 1998 and has more than 130K employees, with the company performing quite well in the past year gaining more than 30%.

I believe Google will continue to [grow](https://ibb.co/S6x0XHc) as their cloud platform will remain one of the biggest in the world, while also continuing to innovate and develop other emerging businesses that might turn out successful in the long-term, while their main competition is Baidu &amp; Bing for the search engine, but their market share is still completely dominant, as they also compete with social networks &amp; online retailers for advertising placements.

So, guys, let‚Äôs go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly results for Google.

Google smashed [earnings](https://ibb.co/4jSwJVr) expectations for the 4th quarter with a beat of more than $6 on EPS and $4B in total revenues.

The company [reported](https://ibb.co/T24JLqY) a revenue of almost $57B in the 4th quarter while generating revenues of over $182B in 2020, representing a 12% increase over 2019 as they operating income also grew to over $40B for the first time despite a very slow start to the year through the first 2 quarters as their ad revenues were crushed due to the lack of travel &amp; other leisure industries as those are some of the biggest advertiser income streams for them.

The company sustained a significant growth rate in the past year in their 2 major income segments, with their services business which grew by 11%, and the cloud services which also more than doubled their revenues, but the cloud services is still losing money as they keep investing into expanding their services to compete with the other major cloud players like Amazon, Microsoft &amp; Alibaba.

The [company](https://ibb.co/Cmpx7vs) has also started this quarter to report their google cloud results separately to give a more detailed view on how the company is performing, as we can now see how the company has managed to increase their revenues streams and how big the YT Ads revenues have become for them as those increased by 30% in the last year. Meanwhile the revenues from Google Search also rose by 6% and the Cloud Segment spiked by 46%, as they also have a big backlog in this segment.

So [overall](https://ibb.co/r4p6F1Z), the company has managed to increase their revenues in constant currency by 14% in the past year while also improving their operating margin by 2%.

Google has managed to keep growing and improving their business operation through major capital expenditures that have accounted for over $22B in 2020. I believe the big spending on capex is really needed, as the competition in the cloud segment in really heating up, so I like companies that keep reinvesting into themselves, as they have also spent over $27B on R&amp;D in 2020, as they keep investing into most of their products and adding new ones in the pipeline.

Also, for the projections of the DCF it‚Äôs important to [NOTE](https://ibb.co/vxtbZcZ) that they had over $13B in Depreciation &amp; Amortization in 2020, with this number growing between 15-30% in the past 2 years so I while use a 15% increase for the DCF to be safe. The other big number that is important is their overall capex spending, which has gone down in the past 3 years, but as things might ramp up again as they mentioned in their earnings call, I will continue to grow this spending by 2.5%/year expecting things to normalize after the company went for a safer approach in 2020.

[Alphabet](https://ibb.co/7GQTZS6) also managed to increase their earnings before interest &amp; tax or EBIT which stood at over $41B while also buying back 1.6% of their total shares in the past year, as they continued buyback [programs](https://ibb.co/c8LKM1g) in the 4th quarter of 2020, buying back over 4.7M shares in just the last 3 months, thus continuing to reward their shareholders even more.

There are a couple of negative outlooks for the company though, as their [effective](https://ibb.co/7vGjYwW) tax rate has increased in the past years, and this might continue to go higher depending on future tax reforms so I will take into account some small raises in the tax rate.

The next problem is the regulatory pressure which can be another bump in the road for Google, but I mostly expect things to drag along and may eventually end with something similar to what happened to Microsoft. Even If they somehow end up breaking their businesses, I think we can see the Cloud business trading at insane P/Es which would increase the actual value of the resulting stocks, while the search engine and YT will remain very powerful even without the contracts with OEMs, which would result in better margins and less operating expenses, as most people would still turn to Google for their searches and videos.

The final problem for Google is the privacy issues, but it seems they have found a way to substitute the traditional cookie technology with a new software interface called Federated Learning of Cohorts.

This technology seems to have at least 95% of the same power of conversion per dollar compared to cookies which would be a huge boost to their privacy issues concerns and will help them maintain their dominance in the online ad‚Äôs world.

But this isn‚Äôt the only technology Alphabet is trying to develop, they still have other proposals in works as well, which might come in even better, so we will have to wait and see what they go with.

Meanwhile, Google also offered some [guidance](https://ibb.co/NKwgyH2) for 2021 as they expect easy comps in the first half of 2021, while they are planning to ramp up the pace of investments this year.

They also expect to keep investing in cloud segment as their [backlog](https://ibb.co/Ks6TNWq) which stands at $30B is mostly attributable to the cloud segment, as Alphabet will continue to focus on long-term growth that will benefit them in the long run as operating results &amp; margins go.

For the price targets, I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on‚Ä¶

So, let‚Äôs start with the discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/fpRmHnk) to see what the current valuation of the company is.

I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later in the long-term projection, and the net income for 2020, to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to an EBITDA of almost $55B

For the next years I used a small increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and also applied a 10% decrease in their net working capital.

I increased the capex spending and their D&amp;A as I previously mentioned, so, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the average SP500 return in the past decades and is what I like to use as a discount rate, given the current low interest rates, we get almost $190B Discounted Free Cash Flows by 2025.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt of the company, which in this case stand at a net $200B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though most of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach.

If we do use the growth approach, we can see that GOOG is slightly overvalued right now, as this implies a loss of about 5%.

On the other hand, a good EBITDA multiple for the company I think is about 20, as the stock currently trades over this multiple, but for safety reasons, I think 20 is pretty reasonable.

And given this multiple &amp; approach we get a valuation of over $2700, or a 32% undervaluation of the company.

But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for Alphabet in 2021 is $2326, implying a 13.3% return from the last price.

Guys, next let‚Äôs move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for Google.

For my [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/W0Lp2W8) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream.

I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the Cloud segment for 2021 as businesses keep needing cloud services more &amp; more, and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth rate.

For the Google Services (which include Search, YT &amp; other revenue streams) I implied a 12% growth, just above last years, as YT keeps booming and the leisure industry advertising will slowly come back. But, for reasonable purposes I also implied a gradual slowdown of this trend by 1% each year.

I believe these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high market share in the search segment and the demand for cloud services platforms.

The 2 other revenues streams which are Other Bets &amp; Hedging I pretty much left unchanged as they don‚Äôt really have that big implications on the final number, but I did add a small amount of growth in both of them.

For their cost of sales, I started from the current ones and maintained them for 3 of their segments, while for the Google Cloud cost of sales I implied a gradual improvement of about 14%/year. So, I am implying they reach profitability by 2024 and reach somewhat of an AWS type of profitability by 2025.

Guys, if we add all of these up, it means for 2025 we would get over $334B in revenues and $237B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $97B.

I also [maintained](https://ibb.co/kJxShSy) the same capex as in the DCF while for the interest income &amp; other incomes which stood at almost $7B this year I implied small annual growths, thus leading us to a $75.4B in earnings before tax.

I also slightly [increased](https://ibb.co/rHNCn0d) their 16.3% effective tax rate to about 17.5% by 2025 in order to somewhat account for possible tax changes in the future and also accounted for some share buyback programs of about 1% each year.

So, for the $62B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 653M shares, that would mean a $95.25 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/1vws94Z) is trading at almost 22 times forward price to earnings for 2025.

Guys, for my personal projections I like to use Forward/PE valuations &amp; multiples, so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $2381 and $3810.

After all these estimates what are my price targets?

[HERE](https://ibb.co/JthYJF1) are my actual price targets‚Ä¶ I think the 2025 bear case price we can see Google trade at is $2619 which would imply a return of 27.5%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Google will trade at 3095$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 50% return on the current price. 

My most bullish case though, would see the company trading at $3572, which would imply a return of almost 74%. 

So yeah guys, these are my Overall price [TARGETS](https://ibb.co/GFPxV3K) for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE‚Äôs with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.

I think these are pretty reasonable targets, as the cloud services will continue to boom in the next decades, while they will also benefit from an increased reach for their search engine and booming YT platform as more people are getting internet access each day, and we shouldn‚Äôt forget that they might have even more great products in the pipeline with interesting names like Waymo.

Alphabet also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/vL0VccC), with almost $320B in assets vs just $97B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by the current $137B in cash, cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities.

I also like to take a look at what the estimates are from the other analysts, and in this case, we can see an average EPS [estimate](https://ibb.co/NYdX76f) by 2025 of $117, which is way higher than my $95 EPS estimates.

The analysts also expect over $370B in total [revenues](https://ibb.co/m0sMt0t) on average, which is also more than $35B ahead of where my targets are pointing, so, I think it‚Äôs safe to say I have been pretty conservative &amp; reasonable with the growth expectations for the company.

You are probably wondering, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for GOOGLE?

Let‚Äôs start by taking a look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/RcJL7DK), we can see that Google was trading in an increasingly tighter wedge formation since the September lows. Right now, after smashing the earnings report the company has re-entered overbought territory with an RSI of over 70, which we haven‚Äôt seen since the big September sell-off. This breakout from this wedge formation came on the back of massive volumes for the stock, so I believe we can see the overbought conditions push the stock lower in the near-term before eventually going back even higher as I expect with my $2326 prediction for the end of the year.

I also think the $1920 to $1935 range can act as future support after it was a good resistance point for the stock.

But, let‚Äôs also take a quick look at what 44 analysts on Wall Street are [saying](https://ibb.co/ZLyzp7h). They are mostly very bullish on the stock with an average price target of $2171 and a high price target of $2610. So, guys, I think the analyst still have some catching up to do with upgrades to the stock after the recent earnings report.

Are you asking yourself, what would I do?

I believe it still has plenty of room to [grow](https://ibb.co/cLGT2BX), so I would start building a position if the stock drops under $2000 and especially buy more if it goes to the previous resistance levels between $1920 and $1935

I also believe that the big % of their shares held by [institutions](https://ibb.co/rw4kX8w), with over 72% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities and increase the support levels power.

So, these are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Google has a terrific future ahead, with their market [share](https://ibb.co/WGNF2dP) of engine search worldwide crushing the competition and the hole digital ad spending worldwide [forecasted](https://ibb.co/zFdsN0s) to continue to grow and take share of the total ad spending worldwide.

I believe Google will remain one of the best companies in the world while also being a good catch-up play to the other big tech names, as Google has underperformed [compared](https://ibb.co/4FDfJZz) to most of the other big names with the exception of Facebook.

In late 2018 we were able to purchase our first home for $132k and since then have never missed a payment, now owing roughly 128k. I know that values in our area are up and that rates are down, but from my research it seemed that it was too soon to refinance. 

I received a letter from our mortgage company recently that said based on a review of our account, they believe we will benefit from refinancing, including a lower interest rate (currently at 4.875) and removal of mortgage insurance. 

I am skeptical of mortgage companies in general and have little knowledge on this subject. We are the first in our family to purchase a home and I am just wondering where to go from here, do I need to get estimates from different companies all over again? Will this require appraisal and all that? Is this typical practice for the mortgage companies? Advice is much appreciated.

But after my application was conditionally approved for the loan, they sent an appraiser to come and evaluate my apartment in late December. Since then I do not hear much update from them. When I emailed them, their loan officer just replies they (the attorney firm they hired) are checking/reviewing my co-op's information. There is nothing wrong with my co-op finances (in fact, it's very good because I was on the co-op board as of November 2020) and it took Guaranteed Rate just about a month from submitting application to close when I initially applied for the loan back in July 2018. 

While waiting for this refinancing process, I am paying my current mortgage with a relatively high interest rate, so I really want to close as soon as possible (or switch to another loan provider?) 

My questions are - 

1) For those who have recently refinanced their mortgages, how long does it usually take these days (COVID era) to close your cases? 

2) More importantly, can I do something legally to make Guaranteed Rate accountable for their delay (say, if I retract my application and decide to go with another bank), can I ask them to reimburse $500 and the application fee that I had to pay them up front)?

gaming,"Toxic ""git gud"" contingent","I thought I'd write something about how the ""git gud"" contigent are toxifying so many games, especially From games.

You say that any boss in a From title was difficult and you'll get 3 assholes popping saying they beat Orphan of Kos, Lord Isshin or whoever, on virtually their first attempt.

These boasts seem hard to reconcile with the fact that everyone knows these are tough games. The bosses are the hardest part with the most complex move sets and therefore usually require *many attempts,* and there is no shame.

I think that in most cases they're likely just straight-up deluding themselves. I used to do this myself when I was about 14. ""Oh yeah, Sephiroth was easy, I beat him the first time"". It was bullshit. I'm 100% certain that my peers did the same. It is difficult for kids to separate their own fantasies from the truth. But many people seem to take this trait to adulthood.

So I believe that just from raw statistics, liars are far more numerous in the population than people that legitimately have Tiger Woods skills in Soulsborne. This is reinforced by the fact that I know several Soulsborne players IRL, and they are not much different from me in skill. Some slightly better overall, some slightly worse. I think I'm about an average player. I don't know anyone who is Tiger Woods and could beat the hardest boss without trying.

Compare this with online where you're shamed for expressing any opinion that a certain boss is very difficult.

Also, I'm convinced that a lot of people are using video guides, and this gives an enormous advantage relative to someone who isn't using a guide. But this type of player will promptly forget all the advantages that he worked to give himself and delude himself that he must be superhuman relative to other players.

I mention this because I have really got fed up with this demographic. First, I think their behaviour is chickenshit, because I know what it's like to have talents in certain things. I was really good at math in school, for example. But I don't go around boasting about how easy I found it ‚Äî why would I do that when it would just make other people feel bad? And it also it would probably only serve to puff up my own ego to the point of giving me a Dunning-Kruger effect.

Additionally, I find the difficulty-shaming to be completely stifling of discussion about these games. If I say I struggled on one boss, I get several comment which treat me like I'm an idiot for not slaying it after 10 minutes. You're not allowed to criticise any parts of the game, because they will argue that the fundamental problem is your not being good enough. Thus only the most platitudinous feedback is allowed.

I'm 100% certain that they appear around many other games and in many other aspects of life as well. I have a sense that they are one of the really poisonous forces out there. It might be a positive culture in the military, but few other walks of life. Certainly not gaming.",technology

[US],"I switched jobs this year in August. The second job I got had a significant pay raise, but I'm a W-2 contractor (so my pay can change each week if I take time off, but is usually the same).

I was using TurboTax to file my taxes, and after entering in my first W-2 it showed I had a \~$3k refund. That's what I was expecting from both jobs after using some online refund calculation website previously. However, after entering the W-2 from my second (current) job, the refund went down to \~$1k.

I understand since a good portion of the earnings in my second job was in the higher bracket, that the percentage of tax I owe on that income has gone up. If my income at my second job were my total income the taxes taken out would've been enough.

The issue is that the job takes out taxes based on how many hours were worked in a week. The percentage of taxes it's taking out has not changed since the new year has started. Since this will be how it works until the end of the year, does that mean that I would owe money in taxes at the end of the year? Or would my employer start taking out more in taxes towards the end of the year because of my bracket?

**TL:DR;** I had two jobs this year. After entering my first job's W-2 into TurboTax I had a 3k refund, but my second W-2 brought it down tow 1k. The amount per paycheck the second job is taking out hasn't changed with the new year. Does this mean that they're not taking out enough in taxes, and that I will owe money at the end of the year if I continue like this?

stocks,DD: Telos Corporation ($TLS),"This is my first time posting DD on any security. Probably won't be any good, so I'd love your feedback. 

I'd like to talk about the Telos Corporation, ticker TLS. It IPO'd back in November and I'm curious about what others think of it as a long term play.

# Basics:

Telos is a cybersecurity company focused almost entirely in the government technology sector. They've been around for decades, but only just went public in the last year. At the time of this writing, they are trading at a P/E of 148.48 and EPS of -$0.1229. They currently hover around a $2B market cap.

Some of their clients include the FBI, State Department, FedEx, Raytheon, Verizon, and Citi.

Some of their partners include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Palo Alto networks.

&amp;#x200B;

# Products/Services:

Like I said earlier, Telos operates in the cybersecurity space. Their largest/most popular product seems to be their ""Xacta"" platform, which is an automated tool to check an organization's compliance to national cybersecurity standards. Additionally, Xacta works as a continuous risk assessment suite that can detect and remediate gaps within an organization's security infrastructure.

In additon to Xacta, they offer Telos Ghost. According to their website, Ghost is

&gt; a robust, scalable, secure communications network-as-a-service that privatizes the public internet to hide network resources and masks the identity  and location of personnel to ensure total protection as they conduct their operations.¬†These same capabilities can also hide servers, applications, and  unified mobile communications to ensure completely private voice, text,  video, and chat over any device.

Telos also offers myriad services from consulting to pen testing.

&amp;#x200B;

# Financials:

I'll be up front, I am horrible with understanding financials of a company. I'll just report here what I see on the Schwab research page for TLS.

For the fourth quarter 2020, analysts estimate TLS will generate revenues of $44.5M, a decrease of 4.31% over the prior year fourth quarter results. Their annualized growth rate over the last four years is 4.5%. In terms of debt, it looks like they are solidly in the red and have been for some time with total equity decreasing from -$125M in 2015 to -$141M in 2019.

 93.7% of last year‚Äôs sales came from U.S. federal government contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

# Leadership

Telos is lead by CEO and Board Chairman John Wood. It looks like he's been with the company for almost 30 years, and been CEO since 1994. It seems that much of the management for Telos has been with the company for quite some time.

Interestingly, Keith Alexander (former 4-star general and director of the NSA) was added to the advisory board last May.

&amp;#x200B;

# Personal Opinion

I was lucky enough to get in on Telos at below $20 and have enjoyed the massive runup in the last couple of months. I'm not sure how much steam it has left in it, but I do consider it to have some growth left. After the SolarWinds disaster, the government will likely increase its posture in terms of cybersecurity and Telos seems poised to answer the call. Additionally, with former government officials advising the board, it seems likely that connections exist to get Telos into the hands of the government organizations that need it most. The biggest turn offs for me are its large debt and the fact that the company has been around forever and only recently went public. This was probably just a means to raise funds. I might take profits soon and let the rest ride.

stocks,Let's talk about video games,"Hi all, 

I'm new to investing and I've been trying to do my research. I am not very good at DD (a lot of the financial data goes over my head) but I'm trying to look at it from a logical point of view. A good tip for investing is to invest in an industry you know. I work in electric vehicles and plan to invest heavily there, but probably the next industry I am most knowledgeable about is video games.... Anyways, here's my opinion, any feedback would be much appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Prospect for Growth**

First off I think that video games as an industry has a very bright future. Video games are the [most profitable form of entertainment](https://gamecrate.com/statistically-video-games-are-now-most-popular-and-profitable-form-entertainment/20087) right now and can only grow in the future. In the last two decades game studios managed to shift the target demographic from kids to adults, with males age [18-34 playing the most games.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players-since-2010/) Video games aren't for kids anymore and the target demographic is expected to age further meaning that gamers have good access to disposable income. 

Video games are becoming more mainstream and also have technology on their side and become bigger and better year after year. It's impossible to say where the medium will be in 20 years, but considering the difference in the industry between now and the year 2000 then the sky is the limit. 

Overall if you want to diversify and invest in some form of entertainment then video games is the way to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Consoles**

I believe that Sony will dominate the next generation of consoles simply because of their exclusive games on offer.  They have had good growth in the last 5 years and I believe this will continue in the next 10 years. They currently cannot keep up with demand for their latest console [but once production ramps up I think they will make significant gains.](https://www.techspot.com/news/88121-insiders-claim-sony-accelerate-ps5-production-2021-meet.html) 

I also see Nintendo doing well. They are carving a good niche in the handheld market and have no real competitors. They also tend to target a younger demographic so don't compete so much with Sony or Microsoft for the adult market. [They are planning to start selling a more powerful verison of their switch console soon.](https://www.tomsguide.com/round-up/nintendo-switch-pro-release-date-specs-leaks-and-more)

I expect Microsoft to underperform in the next generation, though I would consider them to be a safe bet overall because of their other business. They may also do very well from their [acquisition of Zenimax (which owns Bethesda)](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-to-acquire-zenimax-media-and-its-game-publisher-bethesda-softworks/) and may see significant gains once their plans to use that are revealed. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Game Studios**

There are a number of game studios worth considering such as Activision, Ubiosoft, Electronic Arts, etc.

However, I would be hesitant to invest in these as I consider game studios to be VERY high profile. I don't think any other industry has as much scrutiny from its customer base. No one knows when one will engulfed in a controversy and have it's stock price suffer. 

But I think I will invest in Take Two interactive, which owns the huge developer Rockstar.  A Red Dead Redemption 3 or Grand Theft Auto 6 would likely be game of the generation and their [online business model make an obscene amount of money](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/69666/gta-made-half-billion-dollars-2019-3-best-earning-game/index.html#:~:text=GTA%20Online%20managed%20to%20make,Year%20in%20Review%20sales%20brief).

&amp;#x200B;

**Hardware**

Of course there is also PC gaming to consider. No console to invest in here but Nvidia and AMD are solid stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

**FINAL VERDICT:**

Overall I think my investment in gaming will look like this, with the intention of holding for the next 10 years. 

Sony +++

Nintendo ++

Take Two ++

Microsoft + 

Nvidia +

I honestly don't know the inside scoop on Cardano so I'm not going to opine but I do know that there are probably 100 other projects out there with at least as much promise as Cardano, but I don't see those projects being mentioned in the same breath as BTC and ETH nearly as much. Here are some off the top of my head (feel free to mention others in the comments: YFI, AAVE, LINK, COMP, DOT, SNOW, CRV, BAL and many more).

The point is that I suspect we're being astroturfed (or just manipulated by Cardano bag holders)....be careful out there. Be aware of these type of tricks. And when you see suspicious stuff, call it out so that other people may be made aware.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Credit Cards keep getting fraudulent charges on them and I have no idea what else I can do.,"So, I am not sure if this is a relatively common occurrence in this day and age and just sort of ""par for the course"" for most people, if I am unlucky, or if something else is going on here. 

I have 3 cards that I use. 

Visa Debit Card - Tied to checking | Use mostly for bills | online payments | other budgeted items (i.e. day to day purchases)

Discover Credit Card - I almost exclusively use this at Lowes or Amazon (and a few other *reputable* online vendors for items related to the home remodel we are cash flowing. I use it for the cash back, but never use it for actual credit purchases (meaning, I never spend what I don't already have available, so more like a debit card with an extra step. Always pay in full the day after the statement hits. 

Visa Credit Card from my Credit Union - Use very sparingly, only once or 2 times a month on small items and really have it for emergencies because the interest rate is fantastic. 

So, since I have had my Discover card, it has had fraudulent charges on it 3 times now. 2 times were over the past year and a half and one time today. Every time, Discover catches it immediately, contacts me, determines it is fraudulent, cancels the card and sends me a new one. Most of the time, the fraudulent charges aren't even that much. For instance, today's unauthorized charges were 7 charges, in a row for 9.99 and the line said Amazon Kindle Srvcs. 

My Visa Debit Card has never had this issue and I use it a lot more at POS transactions (Chipped)

My Credit Union Visa CC has had this happen 2 times in the past 3 years. A few days ago, actually, it happened again. Weird that both of my credit cards has had this happen in a week. The unauthorized charges on this one were 1 that was listed as a Navy Federal Credit Union ""Membership Fee"" of $250 and then a full on $500 transfer to NFCU. Again, the CC company caught this immediately and contacted me. 

So...WTF? I have no idea why this keeps happening. I am not careless in my securing these cards. They are *always* in my wallet on in the pants I am wearing. No family member is taking them to do anything with them. I do not enter my card number on shady sites. If I do want something from a site that is even remotely sketchy, I will use a virtual card number for the transaction so this shouldn't be able to happen. 

I feel like this is excessive and I don't know what else I could do to better stop this from happening. Any ideas?",finance
personalfinance,Which to pay? Student loans or car?,"Since federal student loan interest was set to 0% last year, I've been saving the money I would have been paying on them waiting to make a lump payment once interest started accruing. However, since the 0% interest has been extended through at least September of 2021 (and federal loan forgiveness is potentially on the table, though I'm not banking on that), I was debating just putting my extra money towards my car loan instead since that is costing me money. 
Curious what the correct thing to do in this situation would be. Do I just save the interest now on car loan by paying it off faster or do I keep saving to kill the student loans? 
Both interest rates are about the same overall between both (average for the student loans and the single car loan interest rate) and both remaining loan balances are around the same as well.

personalfinance,Have money lying around that I'd like to invest while I wait for student loan payments to return,"Hi All,

My wife and I need some advice.

We recently did a cash out refinance on our home to lower our mortgage interest rate and get some extra cash for some emergency house issues (foundation problems, plumbing, etc.), but it turned out that we made enough money to pay for that and wanted to plan on dumping that $30k into my student loans (currently at $49,500 at around 5% average interest) instead.

Since the student loan forbearance has extended until October, we don't just want to keep that money lying around for nothing.

We were thinking originally of opening a Fidelity account and throwing that money into a mutual/index fund, but I wanted to get the opinion of some of you guys that know much more than I.

Ideally, we would have that money sitting in a fund that could get us a safe return (maybe around 2-3%) and have that accessible in October when student loan payments start back up again. There's also the possibility that some of that amount is forgiven by the Biden Administration, too.

Appreciate any advice and suggestions.

investing,Why I'm BANKING on Wells Fargo,"1st, not sorry for the bad pun. I'm a dad, and that's what I do.

Ok, so Wells Fargo (WFC) was hit hard by the pandemic and unlike most other banks, WFC has underperformed in recent years. Not only did the pandemic hit them hard but fed regulations due to their fake accounts scandal really limited growth. They were primarily focused on commercial lending. Their investment banking was just a very small percentage of their operations. So when the pandemic hit, it hit WFC really hard. 

So the reasons I like WFC:

1. As we come out of the pandemic, this focus on consumer lending should be an asset for WFC. 
2. Their new management has focused a lot on control measures so that there will not be another scandal.
3. They are expanding their investment arm.
4. They have lots of money in reserve for buybacks which could see the stock price climb.
5. Also, they were one of the few big banks that cut their dividends. I expect that to return so not only with the price climb, I'll see extra revenue from dividends. 
6. They are cutting expenses.

I got in when the price was around $28 a share. I think the stock could climb to prices pre-pandemic (40s/50s) and maybe even higher, this year or next. Their new CEO has proven good and brought necessary changes. But this could take a while.",finance

As I'm sure most of you are aware, there has been a lot of news around the government possibly forgiving $10k-50k in loans.  Because of her loans aren't owned by the Dept. of Education, we didn't qualify for the automatic 0% interest/administrative forbearance from COVID.  

Her mother has offered to pay off the loans in full. 

My main concern is that we go ahead and have it paid off, just to have the government announce the forgiveness weeks/months later.  We're able to make the regular payments just fine so that isn't an issue.

This boils down to a few questions that I'm hoping the much smarter people of PF may have some insight on.  I know a lot of the details are still up in the air.  
1. Are FFELP Stafford loans not owned by Dept. of Education going to be eligible for forgiveness?  
2. Would the forgiveness be only on a prospective basis?  Example, you pay it off in full on 2/25 and the program is announced/effective 3/1 - are you going to get screwed?

I couldn't find the thread for tax related questions. Not sure if that was a daily or weekly or monthly thing.

Are state taxes figured *after* federal tax amount is accounted for? Random number example:

* 50k income, fed takes pff.. 5k, state tax calculates off of remaining 45k

personalfinance,To invest or not to invest,"For clarity, I also posted this in r/StudentLoans as well

 So I wanted to open up the discussion about using the 20 years differed repayment plan in order to jump-start an investment fund (ROTH IRA). So I have Fed loans (Grad and Undergrad) totaling  \~$93,000 (5%) and private loans of \~$34,500 (6.5%). I was playing around with my amortization calculator and investment calculator to estimate returns. The private loan is a fixed repayment plan at 10 years and can not be changed. The Fed can be adjusted for graduate 20yr repayment/ extended repayment. 

&amp;#x200B;

The total interest for a 10 year ""normal"" repayment is $34,511. The 20 years (10 years private, 20-year fed) would total $63,187. I am proposing using the difference in monthly payments (assuming I can always pay them) between the 10 year and 20-year monthly payment amounts. This leaves a difference of \~$369.34 per month. If this were invested with an 8% return after 10 years, it would return $64,205.60. After 20-years with the total private loan monthly being invested once matured, this would total $206,402. 

&amp;#x200B;

After subtracting interest paid from the loans the 10 years would net $29,694, while the 20 years would net $143,215. This would be a great boost to a retirement fund and may allow for early retirement. What do you all think of this plan? Am I being dumb for thinking this?",finance

personalfinance,For those wondering if they should get the Apple Card : Maybe.,"Starting off, I've come to the conclusion I love cards with reward points. I had the Capital One Mastercard QuickSilver One card with 1.5% cash back on everything and its been great. Really no issues.

 I had bad credit throughout my 20s but got into a good spending habit and raised my credit up to 699 finally. At that moment my choices were to ATTEMPT an Amex or Discover because I might have gotten approved. I didn't. 

I luckily was approved for the $1500 with Apple and was able to buy right away. 

I really do like the great interface that they have for it. Not a fan that they don't at least have a stand along website where I can look at my finances but that's fine. For me I do live by some Exxons, Walgreens and other places that have the 3% rewards points so it is actually great for me. I'm sure they are going to expand that too. Whenever I go to a place that I do not have the option for Apple Pay I am still going to use my Quicksilver Card though because it is obviously better than the 1% you only get with the Metal Apple Card which is a little annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

The 2% is actually really great because every place I shop has the Apple Pay option and it does help add up the cash. I love that we can get the cash the next day where we had to wait a bit with the Quicksilver and it was at 1.5% too. 

&amp;#x200B;

The no fees are great also (I believe if you have a late fee your interest rate will be effected a little though). The metal credit card obviously is cosmetic but honestly it is a really cool piece to have in general. Nice lil flex.  

&amp;#x200B;

I actually am an ""Apple lover"" but This card was really the most I could be approved for with my 699 credit score and Okay payment times. 

&amp;#x200B;

If it is a toss up between Apple Card and one of the premiere AMEX cards that give around 6% for groceries and some other items, and you KNOW you can get approved for both... I would 100% take the premiere Amex Cards like the Blue Cash Preferred Card since in the long run they have much better benefits, along with cash back points and those AMEX perks. 

If you are not to sure, I am still very satisfied with the Apple Card and plan to use it as much as possible until I get my credit up. Once it goes I'm gettin that AMEX. 

(Also my apartment complex uses RentCafe.com and it has an Apple Pay feature on their desktop website so that is already a very nice 2% back. They charge $18 to use a credit card but the reward actually outweighs it a bit)",finance

personalfinance,Buying a house - equity question,"Hi all,

I am looking to purchasing a new home (like almost everyone else) because the interest rates are pretty low right now. My question to you all is: Does it make sense from a financial perspective?

Personal background:

* employed in O&amp;G, 29yo, single, HCOL, +770 credit score, 136k income, renting currently with friendly landlord ($1,145/mo) but my lease is up soon and can't renew because he will be selling the house (no I can't buy it from him), comparable rent in an apartment complex is \~1,600/mo.

Here is a breakdown of my savings:

* rollover IRA - 6.5k
* Personal Brokerage - 28k
* 401k - 130k
* 401k Roth - 20k
* Total: 184.5k

Debts:

* Student loans - 6.6k @ 3.3%
* Student loans - 9.7K @ 3.45%
* Car - 30k @ 2.9%
* Total: 46.3k

My ideal home price lies between 300-375K based on my neighborhood. My theory here is that signing myself up for a home I could build equity in a ""leveraged"" way. So if buy a house for 350k (regardless of down payment) and the home value increases 10% in 3 years then my return would be 35k. The house I would be looking to buy would be new - guaranteeing almost no maintenance cost for the first couple of years.

So my questions are: 

1. I've estimated that putting down 20k for a 350k house nets about a $2,100/mo payment including principal, interest and taxes, home insurance, and PMI. Is it worth the hassle to spend $500 over my would be rent ($1,600) to start building equity?
2. If yes, I want to come up with possible scenarios to put together money for a house. What are my options given my asset/liabilities balance?
3. What am i missing? Is it basically free money from a financial perspective?",finance
personalfinance,Using credit card extended warranty when manufacturer is non-responsive (after sending them the item),"Seeing if anyone might have some insight. I have a faulty laptop that was RMAed to a manufacturer in early December. In early January they told me it was deemed unrepairable and I would be getting a replacement unit shortly. Since then, they have effectively become non-responsive. They have a customer service line that is staffed by contractors who have no information, and who direct you to an email address that never responds. I am told conflicting information like, ""they're still trying to determine if they can repair this,"" ""there are no replacement units so you'll be getting a refund now instead,"" etc.

Is it appropriate now to use Chase's extended credit card warranty? (The laptop was sent it before the warranty expired but has been there so long that it's now past the two-year expiration mark.) While I have the serial number, I don't have the unit so I can't get a repair estimate (but I think it's a faulty motherboard, so essentially unrepairable), and I don't have the warranty language as the manufacturer pulled down their entire website, including the link to the (digital only) manual with warranty terms.

* A couple months ago,  I got a full time job with benefits that pays $40k a year. I plan to stay with it until I finish college.
* I still live at my parent's house. It's paid off and my parents are in good financial standing.
* The only expenses I have are food and gas, which take up a negligible amount of my income
* I'm putting 25% of my paycheck into a Roth 401k
* I put the 95% of the rest into my brokerage account and invest mainly in ETFs and a couple of hand-picked stocks and cryptos. The other 5% I put into my savings account.
* I have Kaiser gold through my employer so any medical emergencies would be almost entirely covered .

CryptoCurrency,A quick look into INTEROPERABILITY CHAINS,"**Intro**

Before the whole WSB fiasco happened and the cryptocurrency sub was flooded with new investors trying to learn the tech and veterans trying to warn them away from pump and dump scams, one of the big conversations going on was the sudden rise of Polkadot as a top 5 coin less than one year after its main net launch. This parabolic rise caught a few people by surprise as it really seemed to come out of nowhere. There is a whole lot going on in the cryptoverse so having an all encompassing perspective of who is doing what is probably near impossible unless you are fledged full time to looking into this stuff. As a crypto noob, I would love to have a conversation about interoperability chains and hope to understand what they are doing and see if they deserve all the hype they are getting.

Chains like Polkadot, although in many ways similar to the Ethereum smart contract platform seem to argue that they offer something unique to the blockchain architecture which enables them to justify their place in the crypto space. While some blockchain communities view themselves or want to view themselves simply as better, shinier version of Ethereum (See Tezos or Cardano), and are explicitly competing with the current smart contracts platform king, these new players really stress the need for interoperability focused architecture which in their view has not been adequately addressed.

What I also find interesting is how these coins usually don‚Äôt market themselves as Ethereum competitors but rather as complimentary chains. Although this statement is not necessarily wrong, it is definitely one that needs to be examined. Why? Because it could simply be a marketing strategy and not an accurate reflection of the truth. When the big dog and its huge community finds out that there is another ‚ÄúEthereum killer‚Äù on the loose, the coin in question draws a lot of attention to itself, sometimes very negative attention. By disguising itself as a non threat, the coin can hide from the mania and hope that it grows discretely on the sidelines until its time is right. Its not a bad strategy and it makes sense why someone would want to do that. It just means that statements like ‚ÄúWe are not competing with Ethereum‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be taken at face value.

So what I simply want to do here is take a quick glimpse at these chains, mainly Polkadot and Cosmos since they are the most hyped at the moment, and understand what it is they bring to the table.

**What do we mean by Interoperability exactly?**

Now while interoperability might seem quite obvious at first glance, it becomes less so when we obverse the way these new players are forming their own architectural base. When we think of interoperability in the blockchain world we think of two different ecosystems linking together by a bridge, facilitating transactions and data transfers between them. An atomic swap can be considered a form of interoperability for instance.

But interoperability chains take this idea a step further. See when you have an atomic swap, no value actually transfers from one blockchain to the next, only the value of the addresses doing the exchange changes. If I am doing an atomic swap between BTC and ETH, those coins remain on their respective chains. Interoperability chains want for it to be possible for BTC to go onto Ether and vice versa. But the objective of Polkadot and Cosmos isn‚Äôt just the seamless transfer of digital assets, it is also about wanting to create an ecosystem out of that seamless transfer. So when these chains view interoperability, the goal is not simply to bridge different blockchains together like Ethereum and BTC, but rather to create a chain that diverges into other blockchains, creating a blockchain of blockchains. So while Ethereum would be considered a layer 1 blockchain, Cosmos or Polkadot would be a layer 0. These interoperability chains would be the network that help facilitate the communication between all other blockchains. They can help you, the user, trade digital assets from one blockchain to another but they can also help you create your own blockchain if you feel like the current existing ones aren‚Äôt suited to your needs. Think of a tree where the layer 1 blockchains are the diverging branches and the layer 0 is the trunk (or the roots) maintaining the entire ecosystem. Cosmos even calls itself the ‚Äúinternet of blockchains‚Äù if that helps you visualize this. The whole things seems a bit grandiose, very much meta, and fairly cool to think about. The question remains; how necessary is it really?

**What is the goal?**

The existence of these chains is based on two of premises which I want to quickly address. The first premise being that in this survival for the fittest blockchain mayhem we are currently witnessing, we believe and claim that there will be more than one survivor. This one seems simple to accept. There are many blockchains in existence right now. Not all of them will make it, not all of them will survive, perhaps new ones will emerge and trump many of the ones we know currently exist. But if the decentralized and distributed utopia crypto evangelists dream about is to become a reality, it is easy to imagine it will be filled with many different types of blockchains co existing and functioning together to help maintain the new world. This ideal is often pushed around here on this sub. People will often make the claim that there is no need for tribalism because there will be many ‚Äúwinners‚Äù that can coexist.

But accepting this premise leads to an interesting thought. It begs the question; is it possible for the entire crypto/decentralized world with all of its applications, NFTs and currencies to be stuffed into a single blockchain? I think that the answer to this question in the immediate is a pretty clear NO. There is no existing blockchain right now that has the capacity to sustain that much transactions without crawling to halt or being subject to insanely high speeds. Personally, I think and would love to witness a time where all data is sourced from on one singular decentralized system that connects the entire world, but if that were to happen I don‚Äôt believe it will be during my lifetime.

But right now, we consider this to simply be a scalability issue, and although Interoperability chains do claim to address scalability, the main highlight for them isn‚Äôt just about speeds but about G**overnance**.

So this question leads us to the second premise we need to address here that is often put forward by these interoperability chains. For them, blockchains are themselves specialized and having multiple blockchains is necessary for a decentralized world to thrive. Interoperability chains have a very clear vision as to WHY there will be different blockchains; because it is fundamentally necessary to organic growth. In [this](https://medium.com/the-spartan-group/demystifying-cosmos-atomic-swaps-ethereum-polkadot-and-the-path-to-blockchain-interoperability-d1a2d75c20d6) interview with Cosmos developer Sunny Aggarwal, he claims that one of the handicaps of the Ethereum blockchain is its lack of \*\*social scalability\*\*. The problem of a single blockchain is that it is bound to a singular governance model which may not suit all of the diverging interests. It is implied that Ethereum‚Äôs focus on Defi makes it unsuitable for other assets, hence the need for other blockchains. It is easy to see the connection between the first and the second premise. If we need blockchain technology for a multitude of different societal functions, then we will need a multitude of specialized blockchains to operate them. So being able to write your own blockchain from scratch gives you flexibility to design the architecture of the blockchain to fit your application‚Äôs needs specifically. The idea here is that many applications will require many governance protocols so one blockchain with only one governance protocol simply isn‚Äôt enough. It is a very compartmentalized view of blockchain.

And vice versa; the more blockchains there are, the more we will be able to do using them and the stronger the decentralized world becomes. So not only do we need to have many blockchains, we also need for them to communicate with each other as seamlessly as possible.

Whether this is true or not remains to be proven in the long run and requires a lot of technical know how that I unfortunately do not have. If that approach is correct then the existence of these interoperability chains will be beneficial to Ethereum and the crypto world as a whole. I suppose to this remains to be seen.

**Cosmos and Polkadot:**

Now onto examining these coins a little closer and seeing what the differences are between them (at a very superficial level).

**Cosmos:**

Cosmos is a non profit attempt at being network of many independent blockchains each powered through its BFT protocol called Tendermint. Anyone on the Cosmos network can easily create custom application specific blockchains, called **Zones**, using what they call the Software Development Kit (SDK). These Zones connect to **Hubs**, which are specifically created to help zones communicate and link with one another. The vision of Cosmos is to have thousands of Zones and Hubs that are Interoperable through the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). Cosmos uses proof of stake as its consensus mechanism

The Cosmos maintnet is live.

**Polkadot:**

Polkadot is a blockchain protocol that connects multiple specialized blockchains into one unified network. It works by having many blockchains running in parallel, called P**arachains**, that connect to a central chain called the **Relay Chain**. These blockchains depend on this singular Relay Chain in order to exist and for security measures. Developers can easily build custom application specific Parachains through the Substrate development framework. Polkadot uses proof of stake as its consensus mechanism.

The Polkadot mainnet and some of its key components are still being built.

**Differences:**

The key difference to take away from all of that jargon above is the difference between a singular Relay Chain and the numerous Hubs. So what does this mean?

For Polkadot,

It means that the Relay Chain holds the final decision over any state change made on a Parachain. If the relay chain is very secure and has many validators then this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem and Parachains can benefit from this security. Not having to worry about maintaining your own security can be a big advantage for certain developers. But, if the relay chain is not secure then all Parachains risk being affected.

Polkadot has a fixed number of Parachains and owning a Parachain can be an expensive process. For now that number is 100, though it may change in the future.

For Cosmos,

It means that there is no global means of security. Every blockchain is independent and has the personal responsibility to secure itself. This can be a lot harder to achieve when you don‚Äôt have a global system to rely on like in Polkadot. But it also means you retain more freedom. Each blockchain can have its own consensus model and needs to find its own validators. The Hubs have only one goal; to help Zones communicate with one another.

Cosmos has no fixed number of Zones or Hubs, anyone can build one of they so choose.

**So are Interoperability Chains competing with Ethereum?**

I think its safe to say that yes these new blockchains are in fact competing with Ethereum AT THE MOMENT and for the simple reason that Ethereum is NOT a Zone nor a Parachain on their network.

For example, if Cosmos wants to create a link between its ecosystem and Ethereum‚Äôs it has to create a peg zone which is essentially a bridge that mirrors activity from one chain to the next without actually transferring any asset. Ethereum is an outsider to these systems and in no way shape or form does it really benefit from it nor from their native tokens unless it decides to move on of these chains.

There is a current project on the Cosmos network right now called Ethermint which proposes to duplicate the ethereum network onto the Cosmos Network and shifting the account balances of ETH users over on the Cosmos platform. Users who hold ETH will be able to use the Ethermint coin in the same way they could use ETH. This comes off as a cool idea but it does not seem like the Ethereum community is scrambling to make the transition. Right now, it seems Cosmos needs Ethereum much more and Ethereum needs Cosmos.

I am not saying that these coins can‚Äôt benefit from each others existence in the long run but I do think it is a bit disingenuous to think they aren‚Äôt competing either.

**Conclusion**

I‚Äôm honestly not sure how to conclude this. The nuance behind these two coins are way way more complicated than I am letting on with this small rant and I encourage anyone just hearing about these coins to DYOR. I think what Polkadot and Cosmos are trying to do seems awesome, I just have a hard time understanding how essential it is. It is also worth noting that that Cosmos and Polkadot are not the only interoperability chains out there and others like Avalanche are also trying to build their platforms and their community. If anyone has any feedback or would like to add something to the conversation I would be eternally grateful as I am simply trying to learn more!",cryptocurrency

NASAA said that ""if the Investors' claims are taken as true, as they must be on a motion to dismiss, then the entrepreneurs and investors before the Court have been the victims of **fraud and manipulation** at the hands of the very entities that **should be serving their interests by maintaining a fair and efficient national market**"". **The suit was dismissed.** Critics also contended that **DTCC and the SEC were too secretive** with information about where naked shorting was taking place.

personalfinance,Getting roomate on mortgage...sort of,"I make slightly above $20 anually, comfortable putting $10k max down, and have $13k on average invested. I really want to buy a house with an close to an acre of land (homesteading) and enough space for me, wifey, bf, and possibly a child later on.

Bf's finances are almost exactly the same as mine, wifey is unemployed. The issue is bf doesnt want to have his name on the loan because he thinks his credit will screw up our interest rates(his credit is decent, mine is good) He will be living with us long term and I have no doubts about him leaving at least for the first 3 years.

What price range should I be shopping in? Is there any way I could get approved for a larger loan even if bf doesn't have his name on anything? Looking in eastern TN",finance
personalfinance,Debt Accumulation: What is my best option?,"Here is my current situation:

Credit Card Debt: $13,275 (Spread across 8 different accounts, average interest of 24.65%)

Home Loan: $79,744 (Monthly Payment of $625)

Monthly Income (Salary): $2,720

Savings: $2,000

Age: 24

Credit Score: 730

&amp;#x200B;

With 8 different credit card accounts, it is somewhat a pain to manage and interest rates are starting to take their toll.  I was thinking that it may be in my best interest to use a loan to pay off all my cards and simply pay one payment each month.  I also understand that I need to take into serious consideration that under no circumstances can I build more credit card debt if I go the route of a loan to pay my existing debt.

My Question:

Should I take a loan to pay off my credit card debt?  If this is my best option, what type of loan and from which lender do you suggest?  I imagine I could do this online fairly easily.

personalfinance,High Yield Savings vs Monkey market,"[Barclays Online ](https://www.banking.barclaysus.com/online-savings.html) Savings Account currently has a steady rate of 0.40% APY. However, when I originally signed up for Barclay's it had an interest rate of over 1%. 

Fidelity [SPRXX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31617H201) has a 0.36% for 1 year and a 1.37% over 3 years.

personalfinance,Best options for energy efficiency home improvement loan?,"I just bought my first home! It has an old oil heat furnace and an AC that is near the end of it's life, and it looks like I can save about $3500 per year on energy bills by upgrading to a geothermal system that would replace both existing units. The up-front cost is in the neighborhood of $30k to install the system (most of the expense is drilling the wells). There are also some single pane windows and old doors that should be upgraded at a combined cost of about $10K. I have plenty of cash on hand to pay for these things outright, but I am an active investor and earn a typical average return of 20%+ per year, so it makes sense for me to finance the improvements and keep my cash available for investing.

Here's the math:

Option 1 - pay cash up front and invest the savings as time goes on:

$0 starting principal, $3500 annual contribution, 15% RoR = $197K after 15 years

Option 2 - finance and invest cash now:

$40,000 cash starting principal, 4.5% interest rate for loan, 15yr term = \~$306/mo payments (exactly erasing monthly savings from energy bills), 15% investment RoR = $374K after 15 years

So it's worth $197K for me to finance the project instead of paying up front, even being conservative with rates of compounding.

So my question is, what loan options are there? Options I've considered:

\- HELOC (probably not possible since I just bought the home)

\- Secured personal loan (higher interest than I'd like)

\- FHA tile 1 ($25K max but it's a start...)

Anything else worth looking at?

economy,Is There a Perfect Storm Brewing?,"Hey everyone,

I don't mean to cause panic, so I apologize if I come off like that.  
I work for an Agency that deals with Loan Officers, Realtors and a handful of other niches. Since I've started working there, I've been doing more and more research on the Market, the economy and definitely the impacts that Mortgage Loans will have on the economy and vice-versa, amidst this Trump/Biden, Covid-19, Fed Reserve dump, GME cluster of events in the last year.

But as I'm watching all of this, I'm seeing what I can only describe as several great stock market hurricanes that are beginning to funnel toward some sort of event horizon.  
I'm no market specialist. So take this with a grain of salt.

Since the Federal Reserve swooped in and printed money, saving the plummeting stock market, the stock market has been growing consistently (since late March 2020). In the mean time, the economy has continued to plummet. The gap between the two has become overwhelmingly large. And when there is such a gap, only two ways this can be reconciled...  
Either the Economy bounces back, new businesses start emerging, current businesses thrive and expand...  
OR...  
The Stock Market is corrected, crashes, and then we get an economic collapse.  


If I had to place a bet right now, I'd bet on the latter, given the current situation.

Without saying ""worried"", does anyone else find this interesting? I'm not expecting a Cuban or a Musk, let alone a Bezos to pump money back into our economy.

investing,"A story about the Dot Com bubble, some profit taking, exit strategies and money vs capital","[ Bot hates me so here is a link](http://www.bloomberg.com/news)

In the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally (this is not nearly as bad though, so chill, companies are actually destroying the estimates and profits are strong).

Back then it was web page development and internet providers, now it's mainly electric vehicles and some parts of tech. 

‚ÄúSt0nks‚Äù were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one). 

Anyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness and a trainee spot at Deutsche Bank's analyst desk. My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. 

Everybody is a genious in a bull market, you put some money in to a company in IT and BAM, the new Buffett (or Cathie).

Eli was good for about 350kUSD at one point, not bad for a student. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.

The ""dip"" came. Eli figured ""st0nks only go up"" - I'm gonna ""buy the dip"". The dip became a slide, then a vortex and finally evolving in to a capital sucking black hole (not an anus ok).

Eli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.



So what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an strategy that I'm using myself.


1. I  usually don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I start scaling back profits and weight to other, new opportunities. The riskier the stock the earlier and more I scale back.

Compound that interest, bitch.

2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This capital has had a ridiculous payback over the years. This is not money, this is capital. I have a savings account with 3 months salary. That‚Äôs money. Money pays bills, capital grows.

3. For every 20% growth I take home for example 20% of the profit in riskier playa. So in G-ME for example I started buying early and by $90 I only had profits invested. By 300 I had sold about 2/3 and on the way down I dropped the last stocks at 115. 

So let‚Äôs say a stock grows from 100 to 120. I take back 4. Then it goes to 140, I take back another 8 so now I have taken 12 total. 

Obviously there is some flexibility here, but use it for inspiration. For more secure stocks you want to hold on more and longer, but for me it‚Äôs a lot about maintaining that cash position.


So what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things. 


1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times.  For example, my G-ME winnings (yes it was a casino) paid for 300 PayPal stocks at $231. They‚Äôre now up 15%. 

Compound that interest, bitch.


2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%). Life saver in March, pure rocket fuel baby. 


3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  I turn it in to money. I have money so I can spend it, use it. 



Moral of the story or TLDR;

Make money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6-10 months. Its not coming back for a while. 

Don't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing earning calls or dips and remember: IT IS NOT MONEY UNTIL YOU SELL.

Disclaimer 2: I was a licensed financial advisor as in a securities analyst, but do your own research. This is not advice, it‚Äôs inspiration.

Guys‚Ä¶

Ok listen; I just had an idea. Following the adoption of our coin by more and more of all kinds of people, with giant billboards etc, and celebrities also stepping in I thought it would be interesting to have a strategy. Let me explain; I saw a post 2 days ago about a guy proposing to use the ‚ÄúPuppy-Bowl‚Äù that airs on Animal Planet before the real Super Bowl. His idea was to make poster or something like that so that a link could be made between the Puppy-Bowl and Doge, this then being spread/shared on social media the day of the SuperBowl. Advertising wise. I made a very quick attempt of poster just to give an idea/image what could be done. You can find the link to the poster here. But first; let us not forget who we are up against here:

Doesn't this picture look all cosy, and rosy and everybody is nice and beautiful and all friends? It does, doesn't it? Well, we'll come to that later... Just to put back in perspective..

Meanwhile someone made an official video for us to spread on SuperBowl-day and I gotta say; it‚Äôs awesome!... It had me smiling biiiiig like only good old Doge can.  :)

&amp;#x200B;

But then I started thinking how could we keep them momentum ***after*** the SuperBowl?..

That‚Äôs when I remembered that I have all these ‚ÄúWorldDays‚Äù-calendars in my Bookmarks. So; for me it‚Äôs all about being able to keep momentum. With well-thought and well-timed campaigns. Some in Feb, some in March, then April, May..  - during summer - and this until the end of the year; December.

So before I share you all these great calendars with days celebrated all over the 6 continents I would first want to share you something - that I think - could be interesting too. That is the political agenda of 2021 with all the dates of big meeting and ‚Äúimportant‚Äù events. Once at Davos, then the WEF, then in Paris etc... You can find a first glance here:

So; to resume- I had an idea to pick maybe 1, 2 or 3 couple of events through these WorldDay calendars. We would have to come together and agree what day and what cause or topic we would want put forward with/trough our Doge. And so - every month - we keep on creating important (!) creative content to keep the buzz going and to show the commitment that we‚Äôve never been so serious and dedicated and are on a roll to convince much more people to join us. For example; going for a more global audience (Asia, Middle-East?..). I mean all the countries; the 195 of-them if we can/could. Or put in the spotlight local causes; you know for social justice for example.¬†I mean, thats the best thing of our Doge; it can be created in and for anything, ""campaign-wise"".

&amp;#x200B;

Also what would be important is that we build the message that we are exploring real possibilities and implications also ***currency-wise.*** As opposed to all that fiat-money where inflation and crony capitalism just got us all. I mean; let's be honest; it's no just the dollar that ""lost it's strength"". This whole world-wide economy became such a mess... It's just unreal sometimes. (The issue and need of talking about creating a market-cap for Doge at one moment is one that will be necessary I think, but that will be for later. And one to be discussed with the founders Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer?.. I don't know about this actually. I am not a crypto expert or developper or anything..)

But just to finish this post - how ironic it is that this year - 2021 -is the year of:

1. ""International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour""
2. ""International Year of Fruits and Vegetables""
3. ""International Year of Creative Economy for Sustainable Development""
4. ""International Year of Peace and Trust""

The 3rd one I just such a sign. Such a sign. For us. To do just do it - happily - by ourselves. Together. I mean all those Trillions and Trillions being printed by the Fed, ECB, BoE, BoJ... and the stock-market being sooooo overbought. This might really end bad one day... So we might just push for a change ourselves.)

So there you go guys; let's start this Plunge Protection Team quickly! There is literally no time to waste as the SuperBowl is today and we need to target events for the rest of February alrealdy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

btc,The importance of interest rate of BCH and its positive consequences,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

The interest rate of BCH is very crucial to develop. It could be done probably some way via DeFi (or CeFi, too but decentralized way is safer route). 

It makes it possible for doing free services for BCH holders. 

Basically, you dedicate a stack of BCH to a service provider. The service provide gets the interest income as payment from the stack.

Then the stack owner gets free service.

This could create an entire ecosystem of jobs, for instance if you speak Spanish natively, you can give online Spanish lessons and get paid from education service which generates its income from the interests of the stake the customer dedicates to the service.

Heck, you can even start entire online university with this - bringing free education to the reach of everybody.

Any sort of digital thing could be financed in this manner. It helps the whole BCH ecosystem also by removing coins as people start collecting BCH stacks for services they desire.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Wall Street look ahead for the trading week beginning February 8th, 2021","Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here at r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 8th, 2021.

# **Fiscal stimulus prospects and strong earnings tailwind may propel stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/fiscal-stimulus-prospects-and-strong-earnings-tailwind-may-propel-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks head into the week ahead with a tailwind, as investors focus on a hefty fiscal stimulus package and the solid earnings season against a backdrop of rising interest rates.
*****
&gt; There are several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, including Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Cisco and The Walt Disney Co. On the data front, there are just a few reports in the coming week, but the consumer price index inflation report is the important one to watch when it is released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell speaks mid-week at a webinar hosted by the Economics Club of New York.
*****
&gt; Stocks surged in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 jumping 4.65% to a new record high, in its best week since November. The S&amp;P 500 closed Friday at 3,886.
*****
&gt; The hyper-activity around short-squeeze names, like GameStop, receded in the past week. Market chatter turned to rising interest rates, the steepening yield curve and market expectations for inflation.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúRates are actually going up as really an expression of the potential that economic activity is likely to start accelerating, and we‚Äôll likely see some inflation,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
&gt; Hogan said investors will stay most focused on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which Democrats are pushing forward. If it is signed into law at its current size, the total federal spending due to the pandemic would be $5.3 trillion, according to Cowen, an investment bank.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think the path of least resistance has resumed to a higher level. I think we had a mini correction a week ago and I think it happened pretty quickly,‚Äù said Hogan of National Securities.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think we continue to grind higher and the only bumps in the road that I can see are a delay in fiscal stimulus or some exogenous factor come in and changes the dynamics,‚Äù he added.
*****
&gt; The market is also depending on continued improvement in new virus cases, said Hogan.
*****
&gt; # Higher interest rates
&gt; The prospect of more spending and an improving economy drove Treasury yields higher in the past week.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% late Friday, after edging to 1.18% earlier in the day, near its recent high of 1.19%.
*****
&gt; The 10-year is the most closely watched, as it influences the rates on mortgages and other consumer and business loans. Yields rise as the price of bonds decline.
*****
&gt; Market pros have also been watching another bond market metric: the yield curve.
*****
&gt; It is the spread between the yield on a short-term Treasury, like the 2-year note, and a longer duration Treasury, like the 10-year. In that case, the spread widened to reach 1.06% over the course of the week.
*****
&gt; That is the highest level since the second quarter of 2017. A steeper curve ‚Äî which is what we‚Äôre seeing today ‚Äî is viewed as a sign of an improving economy.
*****
&gt; Strategists say the move higher in Treasury yields so far is not detrimental to stocks, but instead is a reflection of the economic bounce that could come from the stimulus package.
*****
&gt; Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said the steepening curve is good for the stock market, creating a tailwind for his ‚Äúepicenter‚Äù trade in stocks that will benefit from an improving post-Covid economy.
*****
&gt; His preferred sectors are the cyclicals ‚Äî including industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, energy and financials.
*****
&gt; Lee said the selling by hedge funds after short squeezes in a number of stocks and the record decline in the VIX, the volatility index, has led him to change his view on the stock market. He previously expected a sell-off in the first half of the year.
*****
&gt; Now, Lee sees a ‚Äúhigh probability that the first half 2021 correction is over.‚Äù The VIX, which is based on puts and calls in the S&amp;P 500, started the week over 33 and fell to 20.87 when the market closed on Friday. A low VIX signals lowered expectations for market volatility.
*****
&gt; The sectors that did well in the past week were mostly the ones that will do better in a financial rebound, or in a higher rate environment. Financials were 6.6% higher in the past week as big banks rose along with the yield curve. Higher long-term interest rates are a positive for bank profits.
*****
&gt; The industrial group rose 4.9%, and materials were up 3.9%. Energy, lifted by a jump in oil prices, gained 8.3%. Tech recovered some ground, gaining 4.9%.
*****
&gt; Sectors that do not do particularly well with rising rates, were up less, including utilities, up 2.3%, and real estate investment trusts, up 3%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really about having an economic boom, allowing policy to support that boom,‚Äù said Jim Caron, head of global macro strategies on the global fixed income team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the key driver of why the curve is steepening.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Some strategists say the curve is also steepening because of the U.S. will be issuing a lot of debt to pay for the trillions in fiscal stimulus, and that would cause interest rates to rise.
*****
&gt; That has also triggered concerns about increasing inflation. While economists do not expect inflation to spike, they do see the potential, for the first time in years, for inflation to move meaningfully above 2%.
*****
&gt; Markets will also be monitoring the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, which begins Feb. 9.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt will get a lot of attention. Do the markets care? Maybe not, but everyone will be paying attention,‚Äù said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities.

&gt; # Super Bowl LV: Time to Break the Tie - Go Bucs!

&gt; This year's Super Bowl will be a first for many different reasons. It will be the first-ever game played in the home stadium of one of the teams playing. It will be the first-ever game with a 43 year old starting QB. The age difference between the starting QBs will be the widest ever (18+ years). The game will not be played to a full stadium (atendance capped at 25K). We could go on. Another interesting aspect of this year's game is that it will break the tie between the AFC and NFC for number of championships won (27). The last time the two conferences had an equal number of Super Bowl titles was back in 1990 after Super Bowl XXIV when each conference had 12. The New York Giants broke that tie in 1991 when Scott Norwood went 'wide ride' to give the NFC its 7th straight and 13th total Super Bowl victory. From there, the NFC continued its domination of the AFC (and the Bills) winning the next six championship games, including three against the Bills.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/020521-Super-Bowl.png))**

&gt; We've all heard of the Super Bowl market indicator which says that a win for the NFC bodes well for the equity market while an AFC victory is a bearish signal. For years, there actually was a wide gap in performance for the market following wins by either conference in the past, but in recent years the disparity has narrowed. In the 27 years where the AFC has won the Super Bowl, the S&amp;P 500 averaged a rest of year gain of 6.9% with positive returns 70% of the time. When the NFC wins, though, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of year performance has been a gain of 10.5% with positive returns more than 77% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/020521-Super-Bowl-Wins-NFC-AFC.png))**

&gt; When it comes to individual teams, 13 have won the Super Bowl more than once. The two teams with the most victories are the Steelers and Patriots each of which has won the game six times. The Dallas Cowboys otfen refer to themselves as 'America's Team' but Pittsburgh is the ""Stock Market's Team"". In the six years where the Steelers won the Super Bowl, the S&amp;P 500 experienced positive returns for the remainder of the year every time for an average gain of 18.8%! Market returns for the Patriots following their six victories has been a much more muted 4.6%, including a decline more than 21% from the end of the team's first victory in 2002. The 49ers and the Broncos have 'only' won five and three Super Bowls, respectively, but following their victories, the S&amp;P 500 has been up for the remainder of the year every time for an average gain of more then 20%!

&gt; So, what about this year's teams? The Chiefs have won the Super Bowl twice in their history, and the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a rest of year gain of 8.1% following their victories. While the S&amp;P 500 was down for the remainder of the year after they won in 1970, the decline was less than 1%. The one year the Chiefs made it to the championship but lost, the S&amp;P 500 was up over 14% for the remainder of the year.

&gt; For the NFC, Tampa Bay's one and only appearance in the Super Bowl was in 2003 (XXXVII). They won that game, and the S&amp;P 500's rest of year gain was over 29%. Additionally, while they're on a new team now, in the three Patriots vicotries where Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski were both on the team, the S&amp;P 500 was higher for the remainder of the year all three times for an average gain of 12.7%. Go Bucs!

&gt; # Should Investors Root For Tom Brady Or Patrick Mahomes?

&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks fall. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but ‚Äúdata don‚Äôt lie‚Äù: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 54 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt always work, as stocks did quite well the past two years even though AFC teams won.

&gt; It was originally discovered in 1978 by Leonard Kopett, a sportswriter for the New York Times. Up until that point, the indicator had never been wrong.

&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl Indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC‚Äîand ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 7.1% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 65% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Here‚Äôs the catch. Stocks have actually done just fine lately when the AFC has won. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained 10 of the past 11 years after an AFC Super Bowl champ.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.3.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; ‚ÄúThere have been 54 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,‚Äù said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúAnd wouldn‚Äôt you know it, the best stock market performance happens after the Bucs win the big game? But I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm still not rooting for Tom Brady.‚Äù

&gt; Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories. For some reason, the author‚Äôs favorite team, The Cincinnati Bengals, isn‚Äôt on this list. We double checked the data, but they still aren‚Äôt on there.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.3.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, this is Tom Brady‚Äôs record 10th Super Bowl. It turns out; stocks don‚Äôt do well when he is in the game, up only 0.5% for the year. Meanwhile, should he lose (again, what the author is hoping for here), stocks actually do quite poorly, down 10.4% on average.

&gt; # Post-Election Februarys Have Been Even More Troublesome

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a3e19a00cddddb7704cdd8a753391f6e/21a0af750a31c87e-f0/s500x750/12edd49a31c1cf7460cb21815b25d793853b7db8.jpg))**

&gt; From yesterday‚Äôs post, we knew February has a tepid recent record. In post-election years, February‚Äôs historically record has been even worse as historical average losses swell. In order to include as much data as we have available, we are using DJIA data since 1901, S&amp;P 500 since 1930, NASDAQ from 1971 and Russell 1000&amp; 2000 data beginning in 1979. When comparing post-election year February to the recent 21-year February seasonal pattern, the overall shape and trend does not change greatly however, weakness becomes more prevalent as the mid-month surge is less pronounced and second half declines expand.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3c9c5cb8cb9d933fd2d96b686791066c/21a0af750a31c87e-1e/s500x750/26d3402fd26a76aa62cc8617497bd3095256cb33.jpg))**

&gt; Breaking down historical performance by year confirms frequent post-election-year February losses, most notably by NASDAQ and DJIA. Generally speaking, when February is positive it is an ‚Äúok‚Äù month, but when the month has been down, it has frequently been down by sizable amounts. There are seven double-digit losses in the table and not a single double-digit gain.

*****

&gt; # Typical February Trading: Lackluster Over Last 21 Years

&gt; February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has averaged a measly ‚Äì0.04%. Over the last 21-year period S&amp;P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.6% in February. February‚Äôs first trading day has historically been good, like yesterday, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities over the last 21 years. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been somewhat disappointing for bulls.

&gt; # As Goes January, So Goes The Year

&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2021, until the late January selloff, as everyone got GameStop fever. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2021?

&gt; There‚Äôs an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, ‚ÄúAs goes January, so goes the year.‚Äù This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?

&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.7% on average over the final 11 months and were higher barely 60% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.1.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; ‚ÄúA weak January could foretell of rough times ahead in 2021,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThe good news is lately the trend has been broken, as stocks have done quite well after a weak January.‚Äù In fact, 8 of the past 9 times January saw stocks lower the final 11 months finished higher.

&gt; # Have We Seen the Top in Negative Yielding Debt?

&gt; Negative yielding debt has been one of the most extraordinary and peculiar consequences of global monetary policy initiatives, turning the basic premise of fixed income investing upside down. Instead of one party lending another party money, and the lender receiving interest in return for the risk incurred, since 2018 the levels of outstanding debt in which the lender pays the borrower for the privilege of loaning the borrower money has skyrocketed. This has left both lenders and fixed income investors in the unfortunate situation of attempting to ‚Äúlose less‚Äù rather than ‚Äúearn slightly more‚Äù than the value of the loan extended.

&gt; The total value of negative yielding debt around the globe set a new record in the final month of 2020, eclipsing more than $18 trillion as governments around the world issued debt to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of these bonds are issued by governments in the developed world such as Japan and Europe, while US Treasuries remain one of the few sovereign bonds in the developed world that held positive yields throughout the pandemic. Though the Federal Reserve has committed to keeping short-term rates near zero for the foreseeable future, it should come as a relief to investors that thus far, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dismissed the idea of negative short-term rates in the U.S.

&gt; However, negative yielding debt does affect U.S. investors. Even after accounting for the costs of hedging out currency risks, Japanese investors can obtain 70 bps more in yield by investing in the U.S. 10-year Treasury note compared to a 10-year Japanese government bond, while German investors can earn 0.37% after hedging costs, compared with the -0.45% current yield of the German 10-year bund, which is the highest level in nearly five months. These factors increase demand for U.S. debt, which has helped to depress Treasuries yields and dampen the outlook for fixed income investors.

&gt; What does the future of negative yielding debt look like? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the good news is that this amount of negative yielding debt has declined substantially in the past two months and fallen back below the previous record high set in 2019. We believe this amount should continue to fall in 2021 as global economies recover and safe-haven yields rise, contributing to the 10-year Treasury yield moving toward our year-end 2021 forecast of 1.25‚Äì1.75%.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks.",finance
Bitcoin,InFlAtIoN cEnTrAl BaNkS 1!11!! ... you have no idea what you are talking about,"This market frenzy has brought in so many people that are outright ignorant.

""Central banks are the enemy"" ""They are devaluing the dollar and creating inflation"" ""BTC and decentralization is the only saviour from the dollar/euro/pound/yen doom"". Please shut the fuck up. Please. Please. Please.

Inflation is not bad *usually*. It helps boost consumer demand and consumption, and it drives economic growth and invetsment. Can you imagine a world without inflation, but with deflation, where the value of your currency appreciates year after year? It's a world where everyone starves with low employment, because nobody wants to spend if they know that next year their purchasing power will be greater. And if there is no spending, there is no income. No invetsment, no growth.

**The reason why Central Banks target 2% inflation and expand monetary base is not to erode your fucking savings or  because there is some kind of hoax or plot against you.** It's because they want you to keep having an income and spending a minimum to keep the economic wheel spinning.

Central banks in the last two decades have printed so much money just to avoid deflation, and all of this expansion has BARELY kept inflation above 0, because many countries are facing decade long economic downturns and debt crises, and there are external factors keeping inflation from growing in the developed countries. The average rate of inflation in the USA has been 1.7% over the last decade, and it has been even lower in Europe.  If the FED had not printed that money in 2020, unemployment would be much higher than it is today. You would be looking at a 1929 scenario. CENTRAL BANKS ARE NOT YOUR ENEMY.

If central banks were really out to erode the 10k in your bank account and wanted to resolve the debt crisis today, they would print WAY more money than this, they would put 100k directly in your account, but they don't, because their statute specifically says that they should target 2% to protect the little guy's savings.

**Also.** Many people see BTC as this magic new invention that allows  you to hedge against inflation and preserve your purchasing power. I'm going to let you in on a little secret: other ways to do this have existed for centuries. Bonds, stocks, gold, real estate, you name it ... If BTC is this digital gold you all claim it to be, then good luck: gold has had  inflation adjusted returns of 0 for the last 40 years. Only productive assets like bonds or equity actually grow over time.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,bank is refusing to allow a refinance for a commercial property loan,"Not sure if this is the correct thread, but a family member has a commercial property loan and has been making payments timely and accurately for over 10 years. 

He wants to refinance in order to get a lower interest rate. 

The bank he has been working with(I think union bank) has refused to allow a refinance and hasn't given a reason as to why. 

The family member is retired which could be a reason why the process might be harder but he has excellent credit and has been a long time customer with multiple commercial loans with the bank, all of which have never been delinquent. 

Any insight or direction would be great.",finance
personalfinance,Invest money or pay off car,"Should I invest my money in stocks or use that money to pay off car. 

I'll have $1,600 a month to play around with. 

My car loan is $24K. $399 a month for 72 months. 5% interest rate.

I will refinance my car with BOA and lower the interest rate to 3.45% later in the month.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Newcomers; I have made a coin analysis for you so you are not the next DOGE bagholder.,"EDIT: Huge thank you to u/Gabgra11 for helping with the readability of this post!

**BTC** \- has and will only succeed as a Store of Value. Will probably be the leading cryptocurrency for the next bull run.

**ETH**  \- probably the most versatile network currently existing. &gt; 90% of  all crypto applications are written on top of the ETH network

**USDT**  \- Sketchy stable coin. Probably artificially inflating all crypto's by  printing money. No one likes it but still uses it as a trading pair.

**XRP**  \- Highly centralized pre-mined cryptocurrency. Currently sued because  of their sketchy start-up phase. Beginners usually buy this, simply  because its cheap, but my advise is to stay away from it. The  organization can easily inflate the currency by bringing more coins on  the open market, grabbing your money away.

**DOT**  \- One of the supposed ETH killers. Personally do not know enough about  it, but I think it looks too much artificially inflated. Has a very low  network usage compared to ETH.

**ADA**  \- One of the supposed ETH killers. Seems to be one of Reddit's  favorite. Has been in development forever. Has some partnerships. Has  seen big growth lately. Yet, did still not really deliver a real product  I believe (correct me if I am wrong). Therefore imo what comes up, must  come down.

**BNB**  \- Central cryptocurrency for one of the biggest central crypto  exchanges: 'Binance'. Gives benefits to holders (e.g. people can stake  it to earn other coins, used for airdrops, lower trading fees). Has  performed really well over de previous bear market.

**LTC**  \- if BTC is gold, LTC is silver. However, has not seen any dev updates  in a few years and seems to only hold because it is already known. I  believe LTC is outdated.

**LINK** \- Connects different cryptocurrency chains. No clue why that would result in such a large market cap.

**BCH** \- BTC imposter

**XLM** \- Has some nice partnerships, basically the open source variant of XRP.

**DOGE** \- Memecoin, useless but funny.

**AAVE**  \- Our first in the list of DEX (decentralized exchange) coins.  Basically the networks behind these coins allow you to post a collateral  (lets say $10) and lend the same amount of money ($10) for a given  interest rate. Lets you take advantage if you think your crypto's will  increase in price. However, DEX do not work like banks. You always have  to have at least the same amount of money as collateral as that you want  to loan. I cannot understand when I would ever need that. Then; this is  talking about the NETWORK, not the COIN. The coin AAVE basically allows  you to vote in changes to the network and you can get discount on said  interest rate. It has not very much to do (yet) with earning profit from  DEX, which makes me wonder why the market cap of these coins needs to  be so high.

**WBTC**  \- Bitcoin that you can transfer on the ETH network, made possible by a  smart contract. 1 WBTC is always backed by 1 BTC and should have a  similar price. Basically LINK only for BTC.

**UNI**  \- another DEX coin. Also does not really generate any value (at the  moment). Important note, as for many other crypto's: the circulating  supply is only 1/5th of the total supply. People who created the crypto  and very early investors/friends get filthy rich of you buying these  coins. Always double check the Circulating and Total supply of a coin  before investing. Eventually having a low circulating/total supply ratio  will mean the coin will see more inflation in the future.

Some other interesting projects (top 100)

(20) **XMR**  \- Biggest privacy coin. If you want to make money by investing in a  coin that is also used by drug cartels, war lords and other sketchy  figures, this is your shot. Privacy of course also has a nice  fundamental characteristic and is very valuable, but these things  happening cannot be ignored. Likely will be the first crypto to fall if a  government ever decides to regulate crypto's (and go underground)

(30) **VET**  \- Interesting crypto that aims to use its blockchain to validate the  authenticity &amp; quality of products. I don't really have a clue why  the coin should hold a lot of value though.

(34) **NEO**  \- Was seen as the Chinese BTC. The owner made some weird statements  about BTC in the past, saying that it should increase its total circulating supply or so. Still an interesting project, but does not offer the full crypto ecosystem that e.g. ETH offers.

(36) **IOTA**  \- Is not a blockchain, but a directed acyclic graph as backbone of the  network. In theory this offers a scalable solution. Their plan is to  offer a (microtransaction) payment and data transfer system for the  Internet of Things. Has seen considerable delays in its development. All  eyes are on the moment that the network becomes truly decentralized,  named 'coordicide'. Has one of the biggest non-profit organisations  working on the ecosystem of all crypto's. Set to roll out its network  1.5, named Crystallis.

(67) **BAT** \- Something with a browser and paying money to users of said browsers by showing ads.

(71) **NANO**  \- Is a greener and faster alternative of what BTC was envisioned to be -  a currency instead of a Store of Value. Has a hate it or love it  mentality. Completely mined cryptocurrency.

All other top 100 coins I did not investigate or see any value in.

If  you are interested, I am invested in ETH, IOTA and NANO. I also see  value in some of the other projects (eg. BTC, BNB, XMR, VET). Always do  your own research. I would be happy if people here would start buying  coins because they could see a working product roll out of it in the  future, not because it gets spammed in the daily, because it gains 10%  every day in the past or because they think 'DEX = good = DEX coin is  good'. Do not get your fingers burned. Invest wisely.

Some last tips:

Do not buy &amp; store stuff on unpopular centralized exchanges.

Do not try to chase the pump. Buy your coins and stick with them.

Try to understand the past dynamics of BTC. A good website that visualized BTCs past performance is '[lookintobitcoin.com](https://lookintobitcoin.com/)'.

Make  an exit strategy. I have personally seen my 10x gain reduce to a 1.5x  gain in 2017. Consider DCA'ing out of crypto when you see fit. The  bullmarket is there, but it will not last forever.

Welcome to crypto.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Pay off car loan or student loan?,"So after struggling for a few years financially, and doing grad school, I'm in my last semester, and got my final student loan check. There's enough left over to pay off my car loan (approx. $5500), if I wanted. 

I know you're supposed to pay off your highest interest debt first, so I looked up the interest rates, and both the car loan and the student loan have similar interest rates (approx 4.3%). 

Should I pay off the car? Or pay back the unused student loan funds? Any benefits to either?

Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Anti-Steering Disclosure - what do the figures really mean?,"Hi folks! So what does the Anti-Steering Disclosure really mean if my ""chosen"" rate and fees are higher than one of the other options? I have sent the loan officer an email as well, but just reconfirming here.  I've never posted on Reddit, so not sure why the ""image/video"" option is disabled, so I'll try to describe the options:

1. ""Loan with the lowest Interest Rate"" 1.750% and $3,189 ""Total Origination Points or Fees and Discount Points""
2. ""Loan with the lowest interest rate without negative amortization, a prepayment penalty, interest-only payments, a balloon payment in the first 7 years of the life of the loan, a demand feature, shared equity, or shared appreciation"" 1.875% and $1044.00 ""Total Origination Points or Fees and Discount Points""
3. ""Loan with the lowest total dollar amount for origination points or fees and discount points"" 1.990% with $812 ""Total Origination Points or Fees and Discount Points""
4. ""Your are applying for a loan with the following terms:"" 2.125% with $999 ""Total Origination Points or Fees and Discount Points""

The loan person just replied with a simple ""we discussed the different options."" Of course, when he mentioned the 1.99%, the total fees/points, etc. were close to $3,000. So are the figures on the anti-steering disclosure some sort of a starting point similar to the advertised rates, but when you get the actual terms, the fees are always higher?

Thanks.",finance
dogecoin,Doge to Stability,"have been following cryptocurrency for a while. One of the most  interesting aspects of Cryptocurrency is how unlike Currency it has been  for the last decade.¬† I have read all the arguments and they make  theoretical sense but how would we ACTUALLY make it stable, especially  since everyone is just looking to make a buck.¬† Most theorize that as  more companies ""accept"" it, then it will become a legit currency, but in  reality those companies may accept it but then just convert their Doge  into something more stable ( I personally would not sell a car for 1  million doge and not convert it for fear the market would drop out).

So  then HOW do WE degenerates make it stable.¬† I have been inspired by the  Gamestop crowd because you can see the power of a group moving  together.¬†   


The next question is WHY make  it stable. Is it not better to just ride the wave up. Well if you are  like me you see what's going on around us.¬† INSTABILITY.¬† Sure the  dollar has been great....but for how long. How long does the USA stay  top dog? Especially considering the constant political arguing,  tribalism, cancel culture, etc. ¬† If you don't see that the USA is a  late stage empire then you're not looking (see Sir John Glubb Fate of  empires at [http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/glubb.pdf?](http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/glubb.pdf?)).   


This  is not a ""get rich scheme"" but how do we ""make some money now scheme""  and then create¬† a ""reserve"" currency for when and if there is a dollar  drop.¬† A currency that is not controlled by the FED, democrats,  republicans, big Tech, ultra wealthy and powerful but is controlled by  people who work, raise families, and grind it everyday for their  families and communities.¬† Let's actually make it the people's currency.    


So the next question is HOW.

Step  1. Buy with money you can spare, and that you are NOT speculating with.  Speculate with other money. This a buy and HOLD! Hold until it is  stable and legit.¬† That means instead of cigarettes or scratch offs you  buy doge.....and you HOLD IT.¬† Maybe skip drinking with your buddies one  night and spend 30 bucks on doge.¬† Don't buy the purse since you have  3, buy doge.   


I repeat, do not use  speculative money.¬† This is a buy because you CAN trust other people.¬†  Also, don't use money you can't afford to lose because sometimes you  CANNOT trust other people.¬† But how do we build trust? How trust is  built at all times. Slowly and Steadily.   


Step  2. Determine our price.¬† So someone has to determine price. Maybe it  should be the Pope. Maybe it should be Elon Musk. I wish Mother Teressa  was still alive....I would choose her.¬† But for now it is me. What I  would do is tie it to the Swiss Franc. They are Neutral and have the  most stable currency.¬†¬† Since most of us are buying in dollars right now  let's say we shoot for 1.11 cents USD.¬†   


Step  3. Once the price is up to 1.11 USD/1 swiss franc we buy and sell as it  goes up and down. So if it goes above 1 swiss franc we sell. If it goes  down we buy.¬† So practically speaking once it is above 1.05 swiss  franc, we sell and convert to francs. Which should bring prices closer  together.¬† Once it is below .95 swiss francs, sell francs (which would  be stronger) and buy doge, which should once again bring the two closer  together.

""No ups, No Downs, Only Doge""   


Then once stable people would accept it as currency.

I currently hold 25,000 Doge at a cost basis of .017 cents.   


I realize this is a crazy idea and the thoughts of a madman!

personalfinance,Need advice on dealing with a lemon of a car.,"So, I've been paying $340/month for the last 5 years on my car loan, which because of my bad credit stuck me with a 22% interest rate. It's finally paid off (yay! and go fuck yourself COVID) but needs a lot of repairs which I wasn't able to do because with those payments I couldn't save anything toward them. There's steering/tie rod issues, fan issues, coolant/antifreeze issues, and possibly suspension issues. And those are just the major ones. Since August 2019 I've had repairs to the transmission, brake pads/rotors, wheel bearings, water pump, and exhaust. I'm also a delivery driver/gig app worker, so my car is my money maker.

If it was fully restored, my car would only be worth maybe 2K (2010 Mazda 6 with 175,000 miles). A part of me really wants to just get rid of it now and collect whatever I can get for it, but another part of me is really loath to jump into another loan. I'd really like to enjoy having the extra $$$ at the end of every month to take care of other things or maybe start actually saving.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loans Suggestion,"Hello,

So, I have recently filed my taxes and found out the amount I will be receiving is a fairly good amount. I currently have 3k in savings and make about 350-500 a week, depending on hours. I have about 26k in loans that won't go into repayment until next year but I am wondering if I should use some of my income tax or savings to pay off the smallest loans I have.

The smallest is 1000 and the largest is 4500. I'm not sure if it is better to pay them off now or wait until I can sign up for repayment and start a monthly payment plan.

My monthly expenses consist of 300 in rent and about 135 in utilities/other bills, so I have more than three months of living expenses covered so I want to start tackling my debt.

Any suggestions would be kindly appreciated.

TLDR: Pay off some student loans now or wait until repayment becomes an option.

Edit: They are federal student loans and interest has been frozen on them, but I do have about 400 in interest already applied, so I'm not sure if I should at least pay that off or just continue waiting till I can pay more.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"It got lost in the FinCen FUD - the SEC proposed new guidelines pertaining to the sale of ""digital asset securities."" Prospective legislation would impact the future of crypto in the United States. You still have two weeks to make your voice heard.","In December, in the midst of debate over the implications of the SEC's XRP suit, and furor regarding proposed FinCen legislation, the SEC quietly unveiled 17 CFR Part 240 - ""Custody of Digital Asset Securities by Special Purpose Broker-Dealers.""

[the full ""Commission Statement and Request for Comment"" may be read here](https://www.sec.gov/rules/policy/2020/34-90788.pdf)

In short, the SEC is proposing that non-registered broker-dealers will be allowed to deal in ""digital asset securities"" for at least a period of five years.  That sounds all well and good, BUT...

 - Broker-Dealers offering digital asset securities would be required to limit their business to ""dealing in, effecting transactions in, maintaining custody of, and/or operating an alternative trading system for digital asset securities.""
 
Interpreted literally, this not only means that traditional brokerage houses would not be allowed to sell tokenized stocks, but they would likely be discouraged from offering any cryptocurrencies to their user bases.  Likewise, cryptocurrency exchanges would not be allowed to sell ""digital asset securities"" alongside ""digital asset non-securities"" (like Bitcoin).  

 - It is required that the broker-dealer ""establishes, maintains, and enforces reasonably designed written policies and procedures to conduct and document an analysis of whether a particular digital asset is a security offered and sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an available exemption from registration, and whether the broker-dealer meets its requirements to comply with the federal securities laws with respect to effecting transactions in the digital asset security, before undertaking to effect transactions in and maintain custody of the digital asset security.""

Hundreds of thousands of dollars of litigation does not always lead to a clear answer as to what is and is not a security.  This requirement seems impractical at best and intimidating at worst, and it would presumably be seen as applying to all cryptocurrency exchanges that served US customers.

 - The commission statement additionally emphasizes existing security law which requires that broker-dealers maintain control and custody of behalf of their customers, and appears to infer an assertion that it remains illegal for broker-dealers to allow for the withdrawal of digital asset securities (except in the event of bankruptcy, or death, or what not).
 
In other words, in the name of keeping investors safe, the SEC says that cryptocurrencies should be exclusively held by one of few centralized brokerage houses.  

(EDIT - I don't think it is illegal for broker-dealers to allow for the withdrawal of securities, in fact I think they are traditionally required to allow for withdrawal where it is requested, but the SEC's statement only specifies that 'digital asset security' broker-dealers would be required to allow for the withdrawal of digital asset securities in the event of a liquidation event or the equivalent.)

This proposal is pre-Biden admin and hopefully does not reflect the views of Gary Gensler.  Nevertheless, this remains a good opportunity to make your voice heard.  [Feedback can be submitted here](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-25-20/s72520.htm).

Since December, only twenty comments have been submitted to the SEC, and the few I have read are nothing more than XRP holders bitching about the SEC's decision to sue Ripple.",cryptocurrency

solar,"[NJ] Looking for solar, but am overwhelmed with options. Looking for some unbiased advice.","Hi all, I own a ~2,200 sq. ft. suburban home in southern NJ.  I'm feeling overwhelmed with solar options, and I feel like it's tough to find an unbiased opinion from a knowledgeable person.  The only people I've talked to are the salespeople from the companies trying to sell me solar.  My wife and I will be providing our own financing, because all of the vendors I've talked with so far have been up front in saying that although they provide low interest rate financing, there are other ""hidden"" costs such that if I provide my own financing they can give me a better deal.

I'm not sure if there are any obvious things I'm missing - but right now I think I'm leaning towards a Sunpower system installed by Ad Energy.  Here's the proposal they provided:  https://sunpower.showpad.com/share/c7rZWOL22Xu7W26VVhHsF/1 

I've also gotten similar quotes by Momentum Solar and Trinity Solar, but it seems like the microinverters by Sunpower are preferable to the series inverters that the other systems use (I think??  let me know if I'm wrong about that).

It's coming to about $32k for a 10kW system (~11.7MWh/yr), plus I would need to pay ~$1200 for tree removal.  The salesperson gave me the talk of ""if the number is too high, I can talk to my manager to see if we can work it a little bit..."", which leads me to believe I'd be able to negotiate ~$1000-$1500 off the price.  It's really just so difficult to determine whether I'm getting a good deal or not, so I'm hoping someone with experience in the industry can provide some confirmation that I'm not getting ripped off, or give me some ideas of things I might be missing.

My goal is just to offset my energy usage by ~100% (~11.5MWh/yr) at the lowest overall cost, including parts, labor, maintenance, repair, etc.

Does this proposal seem like a reasonable setup?  Are there any better options that I haven't seen yet?",energy
personalfinance,CC debt consolidation options,"I have a lot of CC debt I have been carrying for a couple years. Long story short, I lived off CC's while I saved cash for a mortgage. Dumb, I know, but it's too late to go back. I have never missed a payment and have been able to maintain roughly the same balance (+/- $1500) for 3-4 years now. My credit is not fantastic and I have high interest rates on the cards and am paying a lot in interest every month. If I can lower that interest, it would give me the buffer I need to pay this down.

&amp;#x200B;

I had thought of a home equity loan, but I do not think I have had the mortgage long enough. I had thought of a refinance, but I am not sure it would make enough of a difference. (and it would be tough to come up with the fees) I am new to home ownership. I had tried some of the online debt consolidation lenders, but the interest rate is still high and the amount of the loans is not what I'd like. My only other thought is speaking with the credit union I use for banking. I had a loan with them that I paid off 1.5 years ago and have had accounts with them for 7 years. I am not sure they can do anything the others wouldn't.

Based on the 28/36 rule...

* 28% of our monthly gross income is $9.33k
* If we wanted to pay off $300k in loans in 5 years with 4% rate, we need to make $6.6k in monthly payments
* 36% rule says we should pay up to $144k/yr or $12k/mo on debt payments (for us, student loans + mortgage)
* So with $12k/mo debt payment allowance and a $6.6k/mo student loan payment, we can afford a max of $5.4k/mo in mortgage payments
* Both our credit scores are above 760
* People keep telling us that Dallas is having a housing boom so we can expect any house we buy right now to increase in value rapidly in the next 3-5 years
* We can probably afford around $40k-$60k for a down payment at the moment

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bubble** 

It‚Äôs February of 2021, and let‚Äôs be completely honest: We‚Äôre in a bubble. It‚Äôs kind of like 1999 but not the same. In 1999, interest rates were much higher. Today, they are nearly zero. In some countries, they are even negative. From a long-term perspective, this is very bad. 

**The Federal Reserve is completely to blame for this**. Their policies are entirely reckless, and officials refuse to acknowledge what is going on here. The Coronavirus hysteria caused by the media and enabled by officials made the crash last summer the worst man-made disaster in the history of our financial system. The Great Depression was caused by over-speculation and a lack of regulation in an emerging financial system. The Great Recession was caused by greed and fraud (strangely, no one is in jail for this). This market collapse was caused by elected officials and the fed, who got trigger-happy and cut rates to zero back in the spring of 2020.

Whatever we wind up calling the burst of this bubble is to be determined. It will, however, be entirely manmade because the fed refuses to acknowledge the speculative behavior currently going on in SPACs, Cryptos, Penny Stocks, and anything else that serves as a legal Ponzi scheme for inflating the bubble. Even real, dividend-paying stocks have gotten way overvalued in some sectors. Also, since the fed has no plans of raising rates within the next two years (so they say for now, at least), if you‚Äôre searching for yield, you have nowhere else to look than the equities markets or one of these legalized forms of Ponzi schemes. It‚Äôs extremely unfair to conservative or retired investors looking for an honest return on their savings. This all is actually why it is a great time to look at Dogecoin, as I will get to in a moment. **So long as rates are near zero, the bubble will continue to go on for longer and longer. And while it continues, people will constantly look for the next big thing.**

**For How Long?**

Now, this may sound all doom and gloom, but that‚Äôs not my point. One day the bubble will burst, but I‚Äôm not making a prediction of when that will happen**. Anyone making up dates for when the bubble will burst is either clueless or a con artist. No one knows when this bubble will burst.** It could be weeks, months, or even years. One thing is for sure, the bubble will not burst just because things are overvalued. That‚Äôs not how bubbles work. 

**There needs to be a catalyst to burst the bubble**. A major military conflict. An unexpected move or comment by the fed (raising rates, calling out the bubble for what it is, etc.). Another nationwide lockdown. I can go on with examples, but a little selloff here and there (August 2020) that causes the financial media to lose its mind is not enough. Just because you claim the bubble is bursting isn‚Äôt enough either. If you follow the media, you will get burned over and over again. That‚Äôs how it works. They want you to go to their sponsors for help, and once they burn you (sell you gold, overcharge you for poor investments, etc), you‚Äôll come back to them hoping to figure things out. It‚Äôs a shell game. **When the bubble burst, it will happen extremely fast and unexpectedly**. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with playing the bubble, but you need to be mindful of when it ends because once the music stops, there will be a mad rush for the exits. You don‚Äôt want to be stuck holding the bag because everything will get crushed when the bubble burst. Even the blue-chip stocks that pay solid dividends will get hammered.

**Fundamentals Don‚Äôt Matter (For Now)**

**In this bubble environment, fundamentals don‚Äôt make sense and, quite frankly, they don‚Äôt matter**. You can argue back and forth all day long about whether something has a practical future or whether something is overvalued. I‚Äôm not here to do that about Dogecoin, Bitcoin, or any other crypto. The same could be said about Penny Stocks right now. (Hint: virtually all of these companies are way overvalued). You can find tons of articles of that nature, and I‚Äôm not likely to change your preconceived notions anyway. If we look at all the irrational bubbles that have occurred lately, you are a complete fool if you believe that TSLA or BTC is worth nearly a trillion dollars. It‚Äôs worth nowhere near that valuation. 

How do I determine what something is worth, and who do I mean? It is called the market cap. In layman‚Äôs terms, that is where you take all the stock shares and multiply it by the share price. And I‚Äôm not recommending buying or selling TSLA or BTC, I‚Äôm just pointing out that these valuations are absurd. Does that mean they will not pass 1 trillion dollars? Of course not. There‚Äôs a very reasonable chance they do pass a $1 trillion market cap. That sounds absurd to write but it‚Äôs true. *When* the bubble bursts, you better believe fundamentals will be back in play. **This disconnect can‚Äôt last forever. But it can go on for a while. And while it lasts, we all want to make some money**

**A Quick Word About ALL Cryptos**

While I don‚Äôt believe Cryptocurrencies are going anywhere (as in, people will always buy and sell them), I also do not see any APPLICABLE future in them other than trading with other people. In fact, the biggest use I see of Cryptocurrencies is for illegal and untraceable transactions. The government will do all they can over the next several years to bring in lost tax revenue and track transactions better, but that‚Äôs the extent to which Cryptos will have relevance. How do I know this? Because the federal reserve, which is backed by the taxing authority of the US Government and the might of the US military, isn‚Äôt about to let some alternative currency usurp the US dollar. How do you think we can afford to provide all this government stimulus to fight Covid? If you think about this, you will see why other countries are much worse off. They must play by our rules, while we get to export our inflation to other countries because they must use the USD to buy commodities on the international exchanges (look at what happened when Saddam tried to circumvent this). If they print more money, their currency gets devalued. That‚Äôs why as bad as things look, relatively speaking, the US isn‚Äôt in terrible shape compared to the rest of the world.

If your financial future is so married to Bitcoin, ask yourself this: what happens if your account gets hacked? Who will you call? Who will make you whole again? If you have a brokerage account with legitimate stocks, there are regulations in place. There is the SIPC which protects again brokerage failure. With Bitcoin, you are completely gambling. This lack of regulation and lack of price stability means that there is no viable path to Bitcoin being a legitimate currency. Does it mean people can buy and sell it? Of course. But if you are in the cult of believing that Bitcoin is the future world reserve currency, you need to get your head examined. 

Gold and Silver con artists have been trying for decades for people to get on this alternative currency train. At least gold and silver have some practical industrial applications. And hundreds of years of history on its side. Crypto isn‚Äôt anything but something people agree upon as having value. Why do I point this out? Because the one thing you need to do is separate yourself from what you think you know about Crypto and Blockchain, etc. While it all sounds cool and revolutionary, it really doesn‚Äôt matter. The US government could easily create their own form of Crypto that gives them more control. The decentralized part just doesn‚Äôt jive with our current global hegemony. If you don‚Äôt understand this, you should think more and read less. Once you accept this, you can start to see all Crypto as fundamentally worth the same: virtually nothing. **The technicals, however, are why we want to look at** Dogecoin**.**

**Relative Valuation of Dogecoin**

Now that you understand a little more background into where we are, **I believe Dogecoin is extremely undervalued**. Why? It‚Äôs simple. Relative valuation. This is one of the easiest and most efficient ways to compare investments. Ok, so maybe this isn‚Äôt really investing anymore; it‚Äôs gambling. Still, we can apply the same concept. Imagine two companies: they are in the same industry and have similar margins, earnings, growth prospects, etc. One company is valued at $50 billion and costs $120 per share, and one is valued at $85 billion and costs $80 per share. Which one would you invest in? Of course, you would invest in the one that is worth $50 billion at $120 per share. The cost per share means absolutely nothing. It is psychological. 

Now, you say Dogecoin isn‚Äôt on par with Bitcoin and that where I‚Äôm going with this isn‚Äôt a fair comparison. Go back and read the last section. That‚Äôs why I wrote about the practical applications of Cryptocurrencies in general. None of that matters. The only thing that matters is the general sentiments shared by people that buy and believe in Cryptocurrency. So, let‚Äôs look at the current valuations:

Bitcoin ‚Äì Price $40,500, Market Cap $755B (estimated as of 2-6-21)

Dogecoin ‚Äì Price $.05, Market Cap $4.4B (estimated as of 2-6-21)

(Source: Yahoo Finance)

Now, I‚Äôm not saying Dogecoin is worth what Bitcoin is. I‚Äôm not even saying it's worth half or a third of Bitcoin. Who really knows? No one does. You certainly cannot say for certain that one is better than another. One is more ‚Äúestablished‚Äù and has more name recognition. What I am saying is this: **if Dogecoin goes to $1, it will have a market cap of just over $85 billion.** Even at Bitcoin‚Äôs current market cap, that‚Äôs just over 1/10 of its value. And that isn‚Äôt even pricing in more appreciation of Bitcoin‚Äôs value over time. **This means I see tons of room for Dogecoin to run.** (I know some will mention dilution via minting of new coins, but that‚Äôs another discussion and not entirely relevant to the points I am trying to make in this piece.)

Could Dogecoin match Bitcoin? That sounds absurd, but let‚Äôs look just for fun: **if Dogecoin were to have the same market cap as Bitcoin, that means it would have a current price of $8.55**. So, what am I saying here? You must know the range of possibilities (within reason, if that even exists anymore) before you start thinking about price targets. To say Dogecoin is going to $100 is just absurd; things need to be put in the proper context.

**Why Dogecoin?**

Using relative valuation, I believe you could make a case for any Crypto. Will they all run to Bitcoin‚Äôs level? Of course not. The last question is why Dogecoin? This is the most important one that we have to answer before deciding on buying Dogecoin. **The answer is simple: hype and name recognition**. If I look at the most valuable cryptocurrencies by market cap, Dogecoin is number 12. I have taken an informal survey of probably 100 people over the last two weeks. I showed them the top 15 Cryptocurrencies by market cap to see which they were familiar with: **Stellar, Binance Coin, Cardano, Polkadot, XRP . . . almost all of these were completely unheard of. But, somehow, they have valuations of 2-3 times Dogecoin.** 

Dogecoin has a few things going for it. First, hype. Elon Musk and many other prominent celebrities are pilling in. Mark Cuban has said he‚Äôd buy it over a lottery ticket. That alone can help aid a very quick lift off. Second, the name Dogecoin is very easy to remember and a trendy thing. What the heck is Cardano anyway? XRP? I mistakenly called it XPR before I edited this piece. And if you are still hung up on the practical use of Dogecoin or other Cryptos, you are missing the point of this piece entirely. Look at the story behind Bitcoin. An anonymous person online created a decentralized platform for money movement or something like that. What? How in the world did that idea ever take traction? **It‚Äôs just like people online arguing over which Penny Stock is the next big thing. Neither person is right, but the perception is really all that matters.**

Third, **stimulus checks will be hitting within weeks or months**. This naturally promotes price inflation when people have more dollars chasing few goods. People will inevitably pile into whatever they think is the next great thing. Dogecoin has momentum right now. And this brings me to number four.

Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, **FOMO is very powerful right now**. There are people all over the world that know people who have won big money in this bubble. Penny stocks, GameStop, Bitcoin, and many others that you can name. How many people do you personally know that have won big in the lottery? Probably none. **This is a unique time in history. People have won big in this market and are looking for the next thing.** 

Dogecoin is something that could pick up steam quickly. It could blow up overnight. It may not, and that is the risk you take. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs just money that you can always make more of. **Life-changing money is worth the risk when you find the right risk-reward ratio.** 

Do your due diligence, but also think ahead to a scenario that you could imagine. **Would you be that surprised if Dogecoin reached $1?** And if it did, would you be surprised if it started running towards multiple dollars? $1 is a psychological number that typically leads to a further breakout. The current market cap suggests this is all very possible. **Now imagine getting in at four or five cents.**

personalfinance,[CA] Individual Shared Responsibility Penalty and Tax Year 2020,"EDIT: I live in California

Hello /r/personalfinance, I hope ya'll might give some insight.

I got married in October of this past year. After getting married, I signed up for my husband's employer-offered coverage (that he's had all year) and had coverage for November and December. I did not have any individual coverage from January through October of 2020. For Tax Year 2020, I believe filing jointly gives us the best advantage.

When doing taxes, hub and I used different options to make sure we would get to the same result: I used FreeTaxUSA, and he used HR Block.

Everything is great on the federal level; we received the same exact result on both sites. 

However, when it comes to the Individual Mandate for the state return, I show I am getting a penalty of about 900 dollars (which I figure is 2.5% * our AGI, which is ~92k) on FreeTax USA. However, when hubby processed the same information on HR Block, it indicates that I am exempt from the penalty.

I looked around online and could not find any documentation that would support that - I do not have an exemption, and I do not believe I would qualify for one if I were to apply.

Should I just err on the side of caution and brace for that penalty, or am I missing something here?

I believe we're gonna file with HR Block in any case, if we're wrong then it should be covered in the guarantee.

If there are any other details I can provide, please let me know.

personalfinance,Best way to protect saving for a down payment with the coming expected inflation,"Hello,

I hate to add another inflation post, but I have some questions I couldn't find answers to. As we know, the money supply of the USD rapidly expanded last year due to emergency covid spending. From my understanding, we haven't seen massive inflation yet as people are holding on to whatever stimulus they received by spending conservatively. When the velocity of money increases to normal rates and all this new money is in circulation, it is reasonable to expect higher rates of inflation that we have traditionally seen in recent history. This could set me back months or even over a year for my down payment savings for a house. I've always known about TIPS, but their prices are very volatile as they are driven by future inflation expectations and supply/demand for the securities rather than interest rates in general. [Here is a mutual fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/performance/vipsx) for TIPS and they earned 9.01% for the last year!

This was to put people on notice that he plans to continue to buy and hold more to stabilize the coin. While doing this, he is creating a support at how much he himself holds.

While tesla is public, SpaceX, Neuralink, the boring company, are not.

personalfinance,Can home loan officers negotiate down payment requirements?,"My husband and I had an offer accepted on a home we really love yesterday - yay! Because we were casually looking at the market prior to this week, we had only previously done a Verified Approval through Rocket Mortgage prior to submitting our offer. We‚Äôre shopping around for the best rate from a lender now and we need to get this locked in ASAP. 

Our Chase loan officer promised to match any lower rate we can prove we‚Äôve been quoted, and he has made good on that promise, already adjusting our interest rate from 2.85 to 2.75%. 

However, he has said we do not qualify for Chase‚Äôs program that allows for a 3% down payment on our $330,000 loan due to our income ($130,000/year), and has instead built our application around an assumed 5% down.

I‚Äôm curious if loan officers do have the discretion to bend rules such as this and allow us a different down payment amount despite not fitting into the parameters of their specific program. Is something like this normally negotiable, but would require approval from the higher ups?

Edited to add: Two other lenders have told us 3% down is no problem with all other elements remaining the same.

personalfinance,What is a hassle free method to invest in stock market?,"Sorry if this unnecessarily long, I just feel like some backstory is needed. My interest in investing started back when AMD was \~$10 a share 5+ years ago. I saw the potential and wanted to invest but had credit card debt, line of credit debt and a student loan. I could maybe justify investing with the latter two, but with 20% interest on a credit card there's nothing more important financially than paying that off.

I paid off the credit card and wasn't expecting AMD value to keep rising as it has, so I opened an investment account with my bank in case there would be another opportunity I was confident in. As a Canadian, I had to fill out so much paperwork to have the option to invest in the USA. Had to include 2 photocopied ID's and a birth certificate copy. I mean it was practically a novel I sent in.

Being busy with work, I decided to just keep paying down the debt (now \~4% interest average), with hope of a stock opportunity I could catch, but within the year the bank closed my stock investment account due to inactivity. I know interest rates are effed right now because of covid, but my bank is paying 0.01% interest on my TFSA and offered me 0.05% RRSP with a ONE month 1.45APR bonus. I hate them. I would rather lose money completely on stocks or bury it in the yard.

So my question is really how can I open an investment account easily and preferably not through my bank? I'm obviously not rich, but don't mind paying a modest fee to keep the account from being terminated. Also, I know a return on investment is never guaranteed with stocks, but i would be more than cautious to not lose more than the 4% annual interest i current pay.",finance

I also want to preface this post by noting that I am aware that I am in a relatively good place, so my focus is on optimization/fine-tuning and getting second opinions on my decisions - if you're a power user and are considering whether to read this long post or prioritize someone else who might need financial guidance more urgently, prioritize someone else! 

Some info: 25M, full-time employed, part-time MBA student (expected graduation: summer or fall '22, covered by employer and non-taxable). 

Assets:

* Income: \~$60,000 
* Checking + savings: \~$9,000
* Employer-sponsored retirement: $44,400 (Vanguard, all Total Stock Institutional)
* Traditional IRA: $12,200 (Vanguard: $5,700 Total Stock Admiral, $3,500 Emerging Mkts Admiral, balance in Total Bond Admiral)
* Traditional Brokerage: $4,000 (Vanguard Total Stock Admiral)
* HDHP w/HSA plan: $3300 (contributing $1500 annually, investable portion is 54% Vanguard 500 Index Admiral, 36% Vanguard International, 10% Vanguard Total Bond)

Maybe TMI, but some additional notes re: the retirement mix: the Traditional has a relatively high balance with more shares in Total Stock because I rolled it over from a previous employer with a worse retirement plan, and I'm pumping all my current employer's plan into total stock institutional because the emerging markets/bond funds are investor class. I consider my Traditional IRA as my avenue for diversifying the retirement, and would consider moving the total stock portion into emerging/bonds if there's a good case in preferring that over the total stock market. I consider my traditional brokerage an extension of my checking/savings, but focusing on long-term growth.

Expenses:

* Private student loans: $205 every other week (balance: $28K, just refinanced down to 3%)
* Federal loans: $15K, hovering between 3.5-4.5%, but in deferment + not accruing due to grad school
* Typically rent would be $1000-$1400, but life is remote &amp; saving while living with parents for now.
* Currently \~$500-700 on food monthly
* Additional expenses: around $100-150 for some miscellaneous things, like paying down a laptop purchase with no APR and the occasional book/trinket from Amazon

I am wondering what I should be considering to continue to optimize what I'm doing here? I'm not currently interested in buying a house because (1) I don't think I can afford the type of house I want right now and, more importantly, (2) I don't know where I plan to be a year from now. 

I have been considering going back to renting because I've been with my parents for nearly a year now and it's a bit painful, but I also find that additional \~$1200 (+ whatever extra auxiliary spending I'd take on) a month in savings difficult to pass up, so my current focus has been on somewhat increasing my voluntary contributions to get closer to that $19,500 cap (edited - thanks!) and continuing to bolster my brokerage as an extension of emergency fund/long-term growth/having it for that eventual home/car purchase. 

Is there anything you might suggest I do differently, or something I'm not considering?

( Yes, I said passive as i am still gonna be working at my full time job and No, you wont be able to afford Lambo and mansion from Dogecoin anytime soon) So taking calculated risk is the best way in my opinion as long as you are aware of your financial situation, ignoring the hype and focusing on more realistic picture ( Yes, because of the exposure Dogecoin gained recently and all the business joining the bandwagon to accepting it more widely does promise a brighter future for the crypto it self.) so he said but there is no hard cap on how many Doge coin can be generated and I politely pointed even us dollar has no hard cap on it either that whats the maximum amount of dollar bills can be produced by Feds (I know it will sound harsh but do your own research and see for your self) plus US dollar is not backed by gold either it just has a papergold backup (Since 1970 I believe, but I could be wrong here). So that being said it is equivalent to just normal paper if you really think about it. Btw this is not a financial advise just a conversation I had with my friends with some personal point of views.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Advice needed on complicated life insurance investment,"&amp;#x200B;

I have a rather complicated scenario that I‚Äôm writing this post to

1. solidify in my mind that I understand it and
2. ask for advice from the group.

Have been a lurker and understand that most do not see life insurance as a good long term investment tool, but I‚Äôll outline our situation and would appreciate all criticisms on this.

We are in our early 40‚Äôs, dual income, higher net worth family. Total income \~1.5 -2.5 million/year and we save a rather large portion of it. Each year we max out our SEP, IRA and other pre-tax options and those are robo-invested in various stocks and getting fairly good returns.

**Total scenario:**

Stocks (pre tax portfolio) $1M

Cash (like to have cushion real estate purchases, stock market dip opportunities, currently getting minimal interest etc): $1.5M

Real estate: $10M, some income generating, some not, currently $400-500k/yr returns

Life insurance: 16M on both of us (10/6, me/wife)

Whole life policy started 8 years ago, 2 more years to fund, $200k/year, 2M total investment

Our goal is to use the life insurance policies to plan for age 65 - 90. With no specific yearly income target, but maximize what we can get from it.

My question is about ‚Äúpurchasing‚Äù more whole life. The explanation for the quotes will follow.

**Our currently whole life policy is essentially as follows.**

\-We are in year 8/10 and have funded $200k each year.

\-Current surrender values $1.45M (with 1.6M invested, so at year 8, that is a bit above the projection)

\-We plan to fully fund the policy over the next 2 years and not touch it

\-Following the projections at age 65, it should be worth \~$5.5M

Here is the scenario I have been approached with:

1. Take out a non-recourse loan (I have no personal liability) against the 1.4M in the life insurance policy at guaranteed rate of 3% for 10 years (unsure what loan would be at &gt;10yr, but no early pay off penalty)
2. Use loan to invest in Nationwide life insurance Universal Indexed Life policy (using one of a few different models - Mozaic II, Zebra II or 1 or 2 year S&amp;P index with floor and ceiling (usually 0% floor and  \~10% ceiling for segments) with varying degrees of participation rates.
3. Essentially, over 7 years, 5M is borrowed for life insurance @ 3%, which is invested and (theoretically) earns &gt;3%. Over a long, long time I essentially get the arbitrage or difference of life insurance growth that is greater than the 3% loan, but it‚Äôs on a significant amount of money.
4. At 65 years old, the prediction (using AG49 guidelines in the prediction w/o participation rates), would be a total of 9.4M of life insurance between the ‚Äúold‚Äù and ‚Äúnew‚Äù policy, for a difference of 4M.

**Cons**:

\-My policy is on the hook for 3% interest each year for the loan - could potentially (slowly) drain the policy if get multiple years of hitting 0% floor

\-Predicted breakeven (i.e. when loan debt = new life insurance policy - old life insurance policy) is year 12. I was looking forward to celebrating when my LI policy finally breaks even next year.

\-Loan interest rate unknown &gt; year 10

\-Insurance guy makes a lot of $

\-Sounds too good to be true. When something sounds like this, I get wary. This is a con.

**Pros**:

\-I PAY NO MONEY. I literally do not have to spend a penny upfront to potentially increase my return 74% 23 years from now when I want it. I do it or I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not going to use it until then. I am NOT going to take out a 3% loan off a solid investment and invest it in the stock market. That's not me.

\-Tax free income after age 65 or whenever I decide to start withdrawing sooner on policies

\-For the new strategy to equal the old strategy ($5.5M), rather than drawing more money ($9.5M) at 65 yo, we could start withdrawing at age 57.

\-Participate rate and a small multiplier not built into projections  - I do get it - the projections are never as rosy as they make it, but it‚Äôs at least a point to consider.

\-Between my wife and myself we would have $42M (28/14) of life insurance (way overkill).

**Summary**:

We have our investments divided up into different areas: stocks, real estate (many of our properties are long term buy and hold bare land or homes that our family lives in and some offices). I look at life insurance as a part of the whole picture but the rock-solid-tax-free-long term retirement draw.

I‚Äôve included the illustrations - please note there are 2 one for me and one for my wife. You have to add them together to get the numbers I‚Äôve provided. Year 23 = age 65

**My questions are as follows:**

What pros and cons do you see?

Any experience with Nationwide positive or negative?

Any experience with Mozaic II (has only been around 4 years) or Zebra II (basically 200 most stable companies out of S&amp;P 500, also Mozaic II has 180% participation rate and Zebra 140% on 2yr segments)?

In conclusion Dogecoin is like two different sides of the same coin that's hedged against inflation and deflation, one is a joke at traditional fiat currency and the other is a joke at the myriad of crypto currency currently on the market.",cryptocurrency
stocks,Lockheed Martin DD,"\*long post\*

Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering the largest defense contractor in the United States; Lockheed Martin (LMT). This is my first attempt at writing a DD, so sorry in advance if it's dense.

**Business**

Lockheed Martin is a well-known federal defense contractor. Lockheed is responsible for some of the most storied and powerful fighter jets in the world such as the F-16, the C-130J Hercules, the F-35, and many more. They're also a very influential missile producer with offerings including the PAC-3 system, the THAAD System, the Javelin Missile, and the Hellfire Missile.

Lockheed gets 74% of its revenue comes from the US government, 25% of its revenue from international governments and 1% was from commercial and other customers.

Their operations can be broken up into 4 distinct segments: Aeronautics (40% of revenue), Rotary and Mission Systems (25% of revenue), Missiles &amp; Fire Control (17% of revenue), and Space (18% of revenue). Let's take a closer look at these segments.

**Aeronautics**

This segment includes advanced military aircraft and unmanned drone production. This is probably Lockheed's most storied segment and is where a majority of people know them from. The F-35 program made up over 69% of the aeronautics segment's net sales in 2020 and is the crown jewel of Lockheed Martin's aerospace offerings. Production of the F-35 is expected to continue for a long time given the US government's inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft, commitments from 6 other international governments, and interest from other countries.

The drone part of this segment is very promising. Drone spending is expected to have a CAGR of 19.8% through 2023, and seeing as Lockheed is the largest drone producer in the US, they stand to benefit significantly.

In 2020, Lockheed Martin delivered 120 aircraft including 46 to international governments. This segment got 69% of its revenue from US government customers and 31% of its revenue from international governments.

**Missiles and Fire Control**

This segment provides air and missile defense systems, tactical missiles, and ground precision strike weapons. Some of their famous offerings include the Patriot Advanced Capability system and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. They also have some more cutting-edge (and expensive) offerings such as the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod and the Infrared Search and Track fire control system.

**Rotary and Mission Systems**

This segment provides commercial helicopters, surface ships, radar systems, cyber solutions, and simulation systems. This segment got 72% of its revenue from the US government, 25% came from international governments, and 3% came from commercial customers.

**Space**

This is the segment we know the least about as a lot of its operations are classified. The main customers of this segment are the US Air Force, the US Navy, and the National Guard. The US government accounted for 87% of revenues and the rest came from international customers.

This segment produces satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike, and defensive systems. One of the largest programs in this segment is the Trident II D5 Flett Ballistic Missle, the Space-Based Infrared System, and the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. I can see massive tailwinds making this a very profitable segment.

**Revenues**

Lockheed brought in revenue of $65.398 Billion in 2020, a 9.34% gain YoY, a 30.88% gain from 3 years ago, and a 61.33% gain from 5 years. I think these numbers are absolutely staggering considering the performance of other Aerospace companies this year (Raytheon's revenue contracted 26.55% YoY and General Dynamic's revenue declined 3.62% YoY).

Switching over to COGS, we have COGS of $56.744 Billion in 2020, an 8.82% gain YoY, a 30.90% growth from 3 years ago, and a 57.49% growth from 5 years ago. While these increases may seem large, I'd argue that in the Aerospace industry, it's only natural that COGS growth will follow revenue growth. The only thing I'd want to see when it comes to this is revenue growth outpacing COGS growth which it has in Lockheed's case.

Finally, taking a look at Net Income, we see a 2020 total of $6.833 Billion, a 9.63% gain YoY and a 112.04% gain from 5 years ago (I left out 3-year growth because they had just spun-off a company meaning we get a growth rate of 248.46%).

**Margins**

Lockheed Martin currently has a net margin of 10.45%. Their net margin has expanded by 17.54% in the last 5 years. Comparing this margin to their peers, Raytheon is currently operating at a -5.55% net margin and General Dynamics is operating at an 8.35% margin.

**Cash On Hand/Debt**

Lockheed Martin currently has cash on hand of 3.16 Billion, representing an increase of over 108% YoY. The amount of cash they've stockpiled makes me think they may be gearing up for an acquisition, or (much more likely) continuing to pay done debt.

Speaking of debt, Lockheed Martin has been paying down debt significantly for the last 5 years. They've shrunken debt by 18.42% in the last 5 years and 13.64% in the last 3 years.

**Free Cash Flow**

Lockheed Martin has had a growing FCF for a while now. In the last 3 years, they've grown FCF by 21.09%, and grown it by 55.53% from 5 years ago.

**Dividends**

One of the most surprising things I found about Lockheed is its dividends. Lockheed currently pays a 2.99% annual dividend ($2.60 quarterly) that they've grown for 18 consecutive years. In the last 5 years, they've grown the dividend by 59.34% and maintain a payout ratio of 40.75%.

For me, the fact that they pay such a hefty and sustainable quarterly dividend was just an affirmation that Lockheed has been undervalued by the market.

**Price Ratios/Other**

Lockheed has a TTM PE of 13.24x. This compares well with the current average industrials PE of 107.38x. Considering the growth rates we've observed in the last 3-5 years, I feel like this is a pretty low PE, although I recognize the short-comings and general unreliability of the PE ratio when it comes to valuation.

What I find really interesting about Lockheed is just how efficient they are at generating capital. They have an ROE of **149.38%!** This number is even more insane when you consider their peers' ROEs. Raytheon has an ROE of -5.53%, General Dynamics has an ROE of 23.00% and Northrop Grumman has an ROE of 32.03%.

**Conclusion**

I'm really bullish on Lockheed. I think they've been undervalued by the market just because they're a member of a sector with some laggards. That being said, I would love to hear some second opinions as I'm not as experienced as many of you are.",finance
personalfinance,I'm so confused,"Edit: I want to thank you guys for the quick responses. Im 28 but ive never really thought about taxes and how they work just that they do. I appreciate it and will strive to learn more.


Unsure if anyone can actually answer this but here is to hoping

I tried to keep this short and have failed so here.

Last year i got a job in January temporarily while waiting on another to go through as I didnt know how long the process would take. I was there until April when Covid had them put alot of their employees on unemployment. So I went on unemployment but for the first 5 weeks or so, I really did forget to hand in my form to have taxes taken out. I handed in the form and I was on unemployment for another 5 weeks until I was able to go to the job I had been waiting on since January. I did my w4 like im suppose to and my state tax i even had them pull an extra $50 out of my check because I was warned my state can be stupid. Ive been working there since.

The new job im making way more money then I ever did so im figuring im in a new tax bracket but when I put the was and the 1099G I was so confused. 

I live in MD and I went to go do my taxes the other day with turbo tax. I put my first two jobs and everything looks like it checks out. I go to put the 1099G form and suddenly im owing the state $1000 plus the $1500 i was going to get in federal went down to $161. Like I dont know what the heck going on. I went to credit karma to just double check and make sure its not just turbo tax being stupid and credit karma is saying ill owe just under $1000.

I'm basically trying to understand where I screwed up or if I should actually go see some like hr block because this doesn't seem right.

I had a budget planned for this year and all the money that I was going to put into my savings might have to go to this and its....infuriating. any advice because I know nothing about taxes and higher brackets or really anything. Years past id put it into turbo tax and call it a day but im so lost. Please help me.",finance
personalfinance,Buying too much house?,"Hey all! Been a lurker on this sub for a while now, decided to finally post about my current situation:

My wife and I are DINKs in our mid 20s and make roughly 110k a year together pre-tax. After taxes, my 10% 401k contribution, her 12%, and insurance premiums, our total monthly take-home pay is just north of $6k. We're recently debt free after grinding out 2 years of car and student loans before paying those balances in full. We've recently started looking at first homes, and wanted to get some outside perspective on our situation, as well as advice for how we should proceed. 

&amp;#x200B;

We live in a metroplex and are looking at homes priced from 275-330k. The monthly mortgage payment (everything included, PMI, HOA, property tax) @ 5% down 30-yr (not much liquidity due to recent debt payoffs) typically comes out to $2-2.4k a month due to having to overpay to compete in such a brutal seller's market. My question to you: is this an acceptable monthly payment for us? My rough budgeting puts the maximum of $2.4k a month at 40% of our post-tax/401k/insurance take home pay. We budgeted our other expenses conservatively and came out to saving $1.6k, or 26% of our take-home income per month. The rest goes to groceries, utilities, gas, road tolls, cell phones, fun budget, miscellaneous spending, and a pet budget. 

&amp;#x200B;

To an outsider looking in, what would you suggest? Go for a house in this range, look for a cheaper property, or just keep renting and grow the down payment? My gut tells me to secure a home during these low interest rates at as close to $2k/month as possible. I get that overpaying isn't ideal, but we're planning on keeping this home for at least a decade, so covering the closing costs shouldn't be an issue and having a lower interest rate is preferred. Let me know your thoughts/grilling/etc, all is welcome!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR;

&amp;#x200B;

* Combined post-tax/401k/insurance income of $6k/mo.
* Looking at homes w/ mortgage payments of $2-2.4k/mo (everything included, PMI, HOA, property tax) , which at max is 40% of that take-home pay.
* Saving $1.6k, or 26% of that take-home income per month, the rest goes to conservative pools of money for utilities, groceries, gas, fun, misc. spending, etc. 
* Should we pursue a home at this price point, try for a cheaper home, or just wait and save a larger down payment while renting a while longer?

cardano,First mover advantage and network effect. The big lies in crypto. Don't fall for it.,"I figured I would write this up because I keep seeing people making these unfair and misleading first mover/network effect arguments over and over again, they are just lies. Being first mover or having network effect are not magic things that make everything oke and removes all competition.

# First mover advantage

There are more disadvantages to being first mover in this space and tech in general than advantages, the first mover advantage is arguably even a myth. Most of today‚Äôs behemoths ‚Äì from Google and Facebook to Instagram and TikTok ‚Äì were ***not***  first-movers. Moreover, the last 20 years have seen a flood of first-movers failing, with companies like Nokia, Yahoo and G.M. all  facing dire straits or going under completely. These are not outliers.

First mover disadvantages: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover\_advantage#Disadvantages\_of\_being\_a\_first\_mover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage#Disadvantages_of_being_a_first_mover)

&amp;#x200B;

# Network effect

Network effect matters, it matters a lot. But there is no such thing as an insurmountable network effect, especially in the current crypto space. There are plenty of examples of disruption of very dominant actors in different industries. Microsoft was a monopoly and Apple managed to take a huge chunk of market share. Yahoo was the dominant search engine and Google took over. Nokia had a 50% market share in the mobile phone industry... Nobody uses MySpace anymore...

&amp;#x200B;

**Why network effects in crypto are not that significant.**

The size of the crypto industry is tiny compared to many other industries and seeing the potential it has. There is so much room to grow. The crypto industry is now at a $1 trillion marketcap. That's a whole industry of a revolutionary new technology that's not even worth half of Apple, one company, alone ([https://companiesmarketcap.com/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/)). And there are so many use cases not realized yet. I would argue there hasn't even been real adoption yet, the top applications are DeFi which is for the vast majority used by speculators and yield farmers and not real users, gambling and scams. And there are 22.6M developers in the world while there are only 80k Solidity developers on Ethereum.

There are also NEGATIVE network effects. Instead of 'more users = better experience = more users joining' you get 'more users = worse experience = users leaving'. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network\_effect#Negative\_network\_externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect#Negative_network_externalities)) We have already seen negative network effects happen and they come to light the best when we are in a bull run (more users join). In 2017 Bitcoin was congested and transaction times and fees skyrocketed (worse experience). The narrative changed from 'p2p cash' used by merchants etc. (usage of Bitcoin in daily transactions was shilled heavily before the network got congested) to 'SoV' only. And people moved over to other solutions and Bitcoin dominance dropped (users leave). Ethereum had similar issues around that time, Cryptokitties alone pretty much stopped Ethereum from working. And currently Ethereum has major issues with congestion and high gas fees as a result. These negative network effects are only going to become worse the more users try to join unless the issues are fixed.

Bitcoin was promised Lightning Network to solve it's scalability issues but as far as I know it is not being adopted after 3-4 years of development and pushing for adoption. So Bitcoin is currently going to stay a SoV only and/or there will be heavy network congestion this bull run.

Ethereum is moving to PoS to solve this but ETH 2.0 is at the very least still a year away, this is way too late for the mass of new users that are coming in. Layer 2 scaling solutions are promised to keep Ethereum running properly until ETH 2.0 but we have yet to see this really happen.

&amp;#x200B;

# How Cardano plays into this

Cardano was inspired by Bitcoin and learned from the mistakes of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. They took all the good things, got rid of all the bad things and improved. They took Bitcoins monetary policy and security properties for example and improved on e.g. scalability, energy consumption and decentralization. Cardano has the same if not better properties as Bitcoin to be a SoV, let that sink in. They learned from Ethereums problems that arose over the years like the DAO hack and used a rigorous principles first approach using academic peer review, formal methods and a functional programming language to prevent these problems from occuring, this is going to be the industry standard for development (to understand why peer review and formal methods matters see [In Defense of Peer Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-rbn73cUEk) and what formal methods are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal\_methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods)). And created Plutus and Marlowe to minimize bugs/mistakes which were often made using Solidity. They learned from UTxO and account based models and created Extended UTxO which has more benefits.  They learned from the terrible fee structure Ethereum has and improved to prevent high fee issues. They learned from the problems Ethereum governance has and made it more decentralized and efficient. They learned that non-profit development running on donations is not sustainable and created an on-chain treasury to fund Cardano development in a decentralized way. The list goes on and on. Also don't forget that IOG is years ahead in research and there is tons of improvements yet to come. The first mover disadvantage here is huge.

There are 22.6M developers in the world and Ethereum has only 80k Solidity developers. Cardano is going to tap into the remaining 22.5M developers and make it easy for Solidity developers to move over to Cardano with IELE, KEVM and the ERC20 converter, see: [The Island, The Ocean and the Pond (Soon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8a6tX53YPs). You tell me if having 80k developers in a group of 22.6M developers is a network effect anyone should be fearing.

Cardano has an on-chain treasury that is replenished by transaction fees and the reserves. It's worth almost $200M at current ADA price, imagine when ADA is $1 or much much higher. This is a forever sustainable source to fund development. Cardano does not have to rely on unsustainable donations or centralized entities deciding on funding. It will fund projects every 6 weeks and will just keep on chugging along forever. This will attract developers continuously. See Catalyst (link provided by bot in the comments). You tell me if this will bring network effect faster than some enthousiasts building on Ethereum.

IOG's other strategy for adoption is to bring economic identity to billions of people in developing countries. The idea behind this is that there will be less resistance than in developed countries to adopt the technology because these countries need it the most (most are unbanked and don't have financial services or good solutions for other problems like identification, land registry, etc. unlike people in the US or EU), don't have incumbents who will resist, have a young population who can adopt new technology more easily and it makes them able to compete in the global market. They also have the fastest growing economies and there is a lot more value to create. And when these countries adopt crypto and show the value it creates for them then developed countries will follow more easily. This will bring millions of users who will use Cardano for real problems they have not to gamble or be a ""yield farmer"", this is lasting real adoption. IOG has been working in Africa for 3-4 years and is really close to closing a multi million users deal in Ethiopia. See this latest interview with IOG's African Operations Director: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUPKtfTLvAk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUPKtfTLvAk). And when Fortune 500 companies can easily reach all those millions of people in Africa with their products and services and can play in those markets then they have incentive to use Cardano. Again, you tell me if this is a better way to get adoption and network effect than whatever Ethereum is doing. You tell me if millions of real users is not going to create network effect.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone who is not utterly biased will come to the conclusion that Cardano can challenge and pass Ethereum and Bitcoin. Keep using critical thinking. Think for yourself. Do your own research.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,No way to contact the car loan company,"I purchased a honda car last year, and financed it through their own lending company, honda financial services. They offered the best interest rate, which was quite low due to the pandemic.

Around a month later, I got the first letter from them to setup an online account and start the monthly payment. All good till here.

A few months ago, their online payment portal stopped working. I can login, but it looks like my account was wiped clean. I cannot see the remaining balance, change payment method etc... I had set the auto pay, so even without the account functioning they've been able to deduct the monthly payment from my bank account. So i know that i am not defaulting on any payments.

Their website is horrible. There is no way to email or contact them. The phone number they have their just has automated options to tell the remaining balance. There is no option to talk to a human about the login issue.

How can I contact the honda financial services? I want to change the monthly payment, and i might move soon, so I need to change my address as well.

dogecoin,Why the doge inflation argument fails.,"**Popular anti-doge argument:** Doge has no cap so it's worthless. Look at BTC. It's capped and that's a major reason why it's so expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

**Counter-argument:**

**Yearly inflation vs Yearly gains;  Population Growth; USD**

* 5 billion new coins per year at 138 billion outstanding is 3.6%. 
   * That % can only go down as the total outstanding coins rises (5 of 138, 5 of 143, 5 of 148, etc.)
   * Even assuming there are zero coins lost and it truly is the maximum 3.6% inflation per year, the only way it's ""inflating to worthlessness"" is if your yearly return is less than 3.6%. Doge has increased at least 20% every day for the past week, with a total of like +310% over the past week. Now of course people can counter that with ""well it can crash any minute"" but do you think you won't make more than 3.6% on your yearly return on dogecoin (or any crypto)? 
   * The human population is exponentially increasing. In my own life time, the human population increased from 6.05 billion to 7 billion. Now we're at 7.8 billion. More global population = more potential demand. We're only at the infancy of doge in terms of mass market appeal and look at the (on paper) gains we've made so far in the last week.  

* As Doge grows over the next year and beyond, attitudes will shift from viewing Doge as a meme coin to one of acceptance. This will likely be driven mainly by doge coin's heavy market cap increase/price increase, and also time. It takes time for people to change their views.
* The USD also has no limit and is endlessly printed by the fed and is not considered worthless. The conclusion that Doge is worthless because it is limitless is insufficient by itself and requires more supporting evidence for the argument to hold merit.

**Conclusion**

I can't wait to see where doge is in 3 years. $$$",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Question about the economics of crypto,"Once my tax returns come back I'll be making my first crypto investment for the long term. ~10% of my invested assets. Planning 60% ETH, 40% BTC. I like the tech on ETH more.

Mainly doing this because of money printer go burr, fed has lost it. Expecting negative rates coming in the future...

However, the reason the fed targets a 2% inflation rate is that deflation destroys economies. So, in a world where crypto is actually widely used as a currency, how do the hodlers out there expect it to be a currency that facilitates economic activity as well as continues to grow in value? 

I'm having trouble getting my head around this... I do expect fiat to become less valuable pairwise with crypto... but this whole idea is making me think crypto will never be a good currency, and probably will just be a decent inflation hedge to fiat...

CryptoCurrency,"Comparing different ""high yield savings accounts"" for crypto and stablecoins: would it be feasible to use any of these like a standard checking account for the high interest rates?","Hi everyone! I'm relatively new to cryptocurrency, really got involved in the past 3 months. Recently I've started seeing a lot of these ""high yield savings accounts"" where you deposit your crypto and earn interest rates that are way better than standard fiat savings accounts rates.

I've done a bit of research and posted some info and comparisons below, and would love input from y'all.

Nexo, https://nexo.io/earn-fiat :

* high interest savings accounts on both crypto and fiat.  
* 10-12% APR, credited and compounded daily.  
* highest interest only if you stake 10% Nexo tokens.  
* earn in kind or in Nexo.  
* free to withdraw at any time.  
* they say zero fees.  
* also pays dividends on Nexo.  

crypto.com, https://crypto.com/en/earn.html :

* up to 12% p.a. in simple interest, paid weekly.  
* higher rates on stablecoins.  
* highest rates only if you stake CRO tokens currently worth $3256, otherwise highest is 10% if you lock up funds for 3 months, 6% if you want flexible withdrawals.  

Blockfi: https://blockfi.com/crypto-interest-account/ :

* up to 8.6% APY on GUSD (maybe 9.3% APY on USDT?), compounded monthly.  
* withdraw at any time.  
* one free crypto and one free stablecoin withdrawal per month, further withdrawals have fees.  
* interest can be paid in a different currency than the holding.

* withdraw any time.  
* they say no fees.  

Celsius, https://celsius.network/earn-rewards-on-your-crypto/ :

* website less straightforward to navigate.  
* up to 12.5% APY on stablecoins, paid weekly.  
* earn in kind or in CEL.  
* they say no fees.  
* withdraw at any time but 24 hour lockup on first withdrawal, iirc.

* up to 12.8% interest on USDT if you lock it up longer.  
* not sure if there are withdrawal fees.  

My personal question is this: I'm considering using one of these options almost like a standard checking account and depositing most of my monthly paycheck in it (in either fiat or USD-equivalent stablecoin) after taking out bills that I have on autopay from my normal bank account. Other than bills, most of my day to day expenses are put on credit cards and paid off monthly anyway, so I'd only need to withdraw to pay the credit card bill or for emergencies. I'm not sure if this is a stupidly risky proposition, or a way to get massive returns on my income, or both.

If I were to try this, which option would be best? I know a lot of people use Celsius and I have an account there myself, with small holdings. I also have a crypto.com account with small holdings. I've been comparing the other options. Honestly, Nexo looks like the best bang for its buck, but I'm hesitant because 1) it's hard to buy Nexo tokens in the US and 2) a lot of the people talking about it online sound like paid marketing shills, tbh. But it looks awesome. Daily compounding interest would make a big difference if you're trying to use this for passive income.

I'd prefer something with easy, quick withdrawals. Also not sure about the relative safety of each of these options. I'd love some input!",cryptocurrency

investing,A case for buying Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPs),"I was looking at many different asset classes, and so many of them look overvalued, or are close to being overvalued.  However, something I have never invested in before ,Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPs), caught my attention. They have been providing nice returns over the last 2-3 years and the volatility is small compared to stocks. 

* The main reason for TIPs to go higher over the next \~5 years is US demographics (just look at  the US population pyramid). Large portion of US population is close to retirement ,and gradually their investments will be pushed more into safer asset classes (bonds). This is especially true due to large target date funds and other passive investment vehicles which automatically re-balance investor's portfolio based on their age
* For existing bond holders, TIPs are better option than just bonds because they also protect again inflation (due to stimulus packages, money being printed like crazy)
* In case of gradual stock market correction, TIPs will be one of the safety assets for preservation of capital (stock market over valuation is disputable) 
* On another note, rising interest rates could drive TIPs to go down

Don't get me wrong, TIPs will not make your rich but 10-20%  of your portfolio in TIPs would not hurt.

This post is intended for the U.S. Audience, but I encourage you to check the capital gains regulations in your country if you do not live in the United States

When your crypto gains are taxed, your cryptocurrency tax rate will be either your income tax rate or lower capital gains rates, depending on how long you held the crypto. Your holding period dictates whether you pay income tax rates or capital gains tax rates. 

If you hold the crypto for a year or less before selling it, exchanging it, or spending it, then your gains are short term and taxed at your income tax rate.

If you hold the crypto for more than a year, then you are taxed the lower capital gains rate, which changes depending on your federal income tax bracket. Some other countries have similar rules.¬†

## Short term capital gains tax brackets (equal to your income tax rates)

Here are the federal income tax brackets in the United States for the 2020 tax year. These tax rates apply to short term capital gains (crypto or other capital assets held for less than 1 year). Note that this is the same as your ordinary income tax rate.

personalfinance,Creating a Multinational Retirement Savings Plan,"Hi, All --

Here's my questions:

A) What are the implications of having a 401K and IRA and retiring abroad? 

B) What if I have a retirement plan in other countries (e.g., RRSP in Canada) -- should I maintain those retirement plans for ""travel"" money, or convert them to an IRA? I'm still not sure where I'll retire.

Context:
I am 29M Canadian citizen that worked in Canada up until 2016 and then in the US up until now. I'm working towards my permanent Green Card with my company, but there's a chance I might have to leave the US for 12 to 18-months (work in Canada payroll).

I neglected my 401K and IRA (made contributions on/off) because I wasn't sure on where I would retire and the tax implications of retiring abroad. I've stuffed my savings and brokerage accounts in replacement. 

I'm now further educated on benefits of a 401K and IRA and want to start making contributions. But I'm still hesitant on the implications of having multiple retirement savings and deducting from both once I retire.

We are expecting to have at least $33k in extra income this year. We have already maxed out our 2021 Roth IRAs using our savings (we still have a 6-month emergency fund). There are a few options we're considering:

* Contribute to 401k/457b plans through our workplaces. Neither of our employers offers matching. We also do not qualitfy for a HSA.
* Start saving up for a new car. Ours is quite old and likely to need replaced in the next \~1-5 years. We'd probably buy a used car for around $15k. We do have good credit so not sure if it will be worth buying in cash vs getting a loan.
* Start saving up for a house or condo. This would be on a 5-10 year timeline, but we live in a HCOL area and plan to stay here indefinitely, so most likely we'd need at least $80k for a 20% down payment. Then again, some people say the 20% rule is outdated and it may be sufficient to put down 5-10%, so we are not sure.
* Pay off student loans. We have $30k in federal student loans (4.5% interest). Currently they are in deferrment and if they're not forgiven, we're planning to make only minimum payments, but there's also the option to pay these off faster.

Since we've already maxed out IRAs, we're a bit stuck on dedicing how much of our extra income we should devote toward additional retirement savings vs. shorter-term goals.

- The past few days have been crazy.  We love it.  It seems to keep going up.  But please remember, it may not keep doing that.  In fact, it just went down.  Wheee!

- Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency.  That means it is not based on anything physical - there are no gold reserves, nor any government behind it that can print more or less money, fiddle with interest rates, etc.  Lots of people decided that Dogecoin is worth something, and that's the only reason it's where it is.  Dogecoin is also not a stock, which at least in theory means you own a little tiny bit of the company it represents (I want the nice coffee machine).  

- Dogecoin is not Bitcoin.  Bitcoin (and many others) came much earlier, and has artificial scarcity.  There can only ever be so many Bitcoins (21 million).  People can keep mining Dogecoin.  That means the supply can keep going up.  There are also a lot more Dogecoin in existence than Bitcoin.  Like a whole lot.

- A lot of people (yo) have large amounts of Dogecoin sitting around from early on.  Many of the amounts you see are not from anyone investing big sums, but from mining or buying really cheap years ago, when most of this sub was just goofing around.  Don't feel pressured to buy.

- Dogecoin is mean to be fun and easy.  I know there's a lot of srs bzns investor types coming in, but remember, this community once sponsored a race car, and has collected for a bunch of charities, including via the [Dogecoin Foundation](http://foundation.dogecoin.com/).  Please just keep that in mind as we go to the moon.

- Please **never invest any money that you cannot afford to lose.**  Don't invest your college fund, your mortgage, your rent money, or the $100 you owe your drug dealer, and don't invest anything that you'd be really, really, really sad if you lost it.  We don't want anybody to be sad.

I'm not saying Dogecoin won't skyrocket.  There are good reasons to think it could gain a lot more value, and a lot of reasons that it might go back down a bunch.

stocks,Chewy DD - insight from a vet.,"TL:DR ON THE BOTTOM

Hey everybody, this is my first time making a post like this. I'm a fairly new investor - I've been having a financial advisor do most of my investing and have been wanting to take a more active role in my investment - starting with my DD on Chewy so here goes. If it's not obvious enough, I'm not a financial advisors and take my post as the ramblings of a person with limited knowledge trying his best, so here goes. 


**Overview**

Chewy was an online retailer started in Florida. In 2017 chewy was acquired by PetSmart for 3.3 billion, and the ipo was offered in 2019. 
Sales grew every year and by 2018 sales had reached 3.5 billion w/ 66% of sales being from automatic recurring shipments. Chewy reported its first loss in April 2019 selling of 270 million from its previous sales. 
**When Chewy first went public in June 2019 it's IPO offering was 22 per share. 

As of 2019 the company was valued at 10.2 billion.** 

**My insight:**

Chewy has a few different areas of products to focus on that can be separated into 2 groups: basic consumer products (furniture, toys, food, etc), prescription products (medications, rx diets), and non-prescription medical products (examples - think things like supplements, medical grade shampoos, etc etc)
I've separated it into 3 groups for a reason and I'll get to that soon. 

I've been a vet for the past few years, and working in the vet industry since 2012 as a vet tech until I graduated vet school in 2019. 
In the last two years, I've worked at several vet clinics from super low income to super high income and in between. I write prescriptions every. freakin. day. It's half of my job. And historically, most vet clinics would have an in house pharmacy holding most of the needed medications and OTC medical products (shampoos, supplements, etc) and people would buy them from us. 

Somewhere between 2015-2019 people started asking more and more for prescriptions after realizing that they could get some of their medications at regular human pharmacies. This was a big hit to vet hospitals, but we rolled with it because we still had the pet specific prescriptions that human pharmacies didn't carry, and the OTC products. 

Then in 2019 - I started seeing a massive shift where we weren't able to sell OTC products anymore. It seemed like over the course of a year, it got significantly harder to sell things like medical grade shampoos, fish oil supplements, joint supplements - all things that didnt need a prescription, but previously you could only get at the vet. Chewy came in and undercut our profits by a massive amount. I'm super involved with the finances at my current clinic and saw that for us to match chewy's prices we would either have to sell for a minuscule gain or no gain at all - to the point where it ended up costing us money if you considered the man hours it took to manage inventory and the opportunity cost of losing shelf space to these products. 

Now in 2020 is where shit really started getting weird. All of a sudden, NOBODY was buying food from us either. SO MANY PEOPLE were already getting food from Chewy that once they needed a prescription food, there was no way in hell they were gonna drive down to the vet once a month to buy a bag. They would ask for a prescription and put it on autoship on Chewy. 

So now chewy has OTC foods, supplements and products that used to be found only at the vet, and prescription foods. 

**BUT WAIT - THERES MORE.** 

In 2020, I have literally AT LEAST 50% of my clients ask ""is this medication on chewy? is it cheaper?"" and my answer is always a resounding ""hell yeah it is"" (idgaf if my hospital doesnt sell the product as long as the pet gets its medications - doesn't change my life one bit. I literally dont make any more or less money with where you get your meds). 

**Let me give you an example, something I deal with EVERY. FREAKIN. DAY.** 

I have a dog come in w/ a real bad skin infection. I suspect its cause of environmental allergies, but we gotta treat the skin infection first. I want to prescribe marbofloxacin which is an amazing, albeit expensive antibiotic. These numbers listed below are real numbers based on my hospital in Phoenix, AZ. 

* Exam fee = $59
* cone to keep from chewing = $12

I prescribe marbofloxacin for the infection and apoquel for the allergies. I also prescribe a prescription strength shampoo to help clear the infection and then a sulfate free shampoo for maintenance after the infection is cleared. Lastly I recommend an omega-3 supplement for long term skin care. The client says fuck you I'm gonna get this on chewy. Listed below are prices all taken from chewy. 

* Marbofloxacin 50mg tablets - 1 tab every 24 hours for 14 days (30 lb dog dose) = $52
* Douxo chlorhexidine shampoo to help clear the infection = $30 
* Douxo calm shampoo for long term help of allergies = $34.50 
* Apoquel 16mg tablets - 1/2 tab every 24 hours - 60 day supply = $73 dollars. 
* Welactin Omega 3 Supplement = $25 dollars

So do the math - **I spend an hour talking to this client for their dog and I make a measly $71.** 
For my 1 hour of work - **chewy makes $214.50** - AND THEY DIDNT DO SHIT. And $130 of those chewy purchases will be long term and for life (the shampoo, apoquel, and fish oil supplement). 

This is not a random scenario. This is something I deal with EVERY. DAY. I can give several more, literally. 

Chewy is destroying vet hospital margins - and as a vet I think the reckoning has been a long time coming. Some vet hospitals will go out of  business, and some will adapt with the times. I personally think playing both sides is the best route and it's what I plan to do. 

**COMPETITORS:**

1. Vet hospitals - I think that more forward thinking vet hospitals will adapt with the times. More and more vet hospitals are partnering with companies like VetsFirstChoice - online pharmacies that are connected with the hospital. These pharmacies allow me to put in the order for the patient's prescription products, the prices are significantly closer to Chewy's price, and it's way less effort on the client. The client now doesnt have to go on chewy.com -&gt; order the medication -&gt; wait for me to approve it -&gt; wait for it to ship. Instead, I tell them we have this product in our online pharmacy and the price is the same as chewy. I order it for them and put in the directions, it automatically puts in their shipping info, and all the client has to do is check their email and pay. I think this will be a massive competitor due to convenience to the clients. Clients HATE having to wait for me to approve their medication requests from chewy (a process which will take at least 24 hours and clients are super entitled and throw a fit if they have to wait a day for anything). 

2. Walmart and Costco - Historically, these have been the largest competitors for pet medications. Over the last year, they have significantly beefed up the pet medications that they offer and their prices are ultra competitive with chewy. The benefits to these locations is clients can drive to a brick and mortar store and get their medications the same day. The biggest issue right now is low variety, they don't carry all of the pets needs (so clients will forsake the same day convenience in an effort to get everything from the same place), and currently I've been having a lot of issues with their customer service. The pharmacy techs will not know that those medications are not carried by walmart, and will tell the clients ""we dont have it"" when I know they do and clients get super pissed off by that obviously. 

3. Other pet medication suppliers - Things like heartlandvetsupply and 1-800-PetMeds. These have been around for YEARS and have never been able to make a dent, and now with otehr competition I don't think they will either. These are only found by very price savvy clients who don't mind extra effort to get meds and oftent it's not even much cheaper. 

**Price prediction:**
I cant give you a price prediction - I'm not experience enough to know what the price SHOULD be. But my point is that I think Chewy is still going to grow and I think it's a definite buy. 

**TL:DR - Chewy is here to stay, and I think it's a definite long term buy**

defi,A true stablecoin would not be tied to any fiat,"Remember when bread was a nickel?

Neither do I. My point being, fiat currencies are constantly changing in value. They are not truly stable

      The purpose of stablecoins, to add stability to the volatile crypto world, would prove useless if the underlying fiat became volatile. Governments engaged in poor monetary policy throughout history. This caused runaway inflation, or deflation. Not to mention, if the purpose of crypto is decentralization, why would we tie a cryptocurrency to a centralized government?

      A true stablecoin would never inflate or deflate, but maintain the same value over time. The toughest part of creating a true stablecoin would be defining ""value"" in a way that would remain consistent across the world and through time

      The simplest method: Take the usd, and subtract the current inflation from the stablecoin. This would require trust in the US to accurately predict inflation, and would not successfully decouple crypto from a centralized government

      Another method: Take something with universal and consistent value, such as a loaf of bread, and create a LOAF Token to represent that value. This would require a worldwide average to determine value, perhaps using chainlink. A potential problem might be a grain shortage, which could cause the value of a loaf of bread to sharply change

      Last method I can think of: create a basket of goods that show consistent and universal value worldwide. Create an algorithm that tracks the aggregated, weighted prices of these items. We could even make a governance token that votes on changes to the algorithm over time

personalfinance,"Older guy, messy situation","Age 50, public sector employee, stable job, separated.

Around 2010, our kiddo was diagnosed with severe disability. Wife resigned from 10 year employment as a teacher to become a paid in-home caregiver.

I had my own company at the time, which did ok, but went to public sector work for benefits, flexibility, and stability.

We short sold the house, credit cards tanked, and we split amicably.

She rents space in her new partner‚Äôs house, with her new partner, and our medically fragile kiddo.

I rent an apartment with my new partner at $1300/mo in California. My credit rating has recovered and is now good.

I‚Äôve been paying my student loans diligently the whole time. Currently about 70k remains at about 7.5% with payoff scheduled for 2036.

Wife has not been paying her student loans and they have ballooned to about $100k. I don‚Äôt know the interest rate as I write this.

Having neglected thinking about retirement for many years, I‚Äôve been shoveling my current income into a 537 (max contribution) and a little more into a 401k.

I pay wife $1,500 per month in child support voluntarily just because that‚Äôs what I think would happen in a divorce, and she needs the money anyway. She resigned to care for our kiddo and I‚Äôm not going to hang her out to dry. I‚Äôm also concerned about her student loans and the fact that she‚Äôs no longer contributing to retirement.

I have a 0% auto loan of about $17k for a ramp modified van. I use credit cards for convenience only, paid off in full monthly.

I have maybe $1,000-$2,000 cash left over each month when all is said and done. I don‚Äôt have much to spend that additional income on, so it usually ends up moved over to savings.

I have about $40k in a regular savings account as an emergency fund, which I estimate is maybe 6-8 months of emergency fund. Wife has about $15k saved up herself, I just found out, which surprised me.

Wife carries a few thousand in cc debt. I don‚Äôt pry into her finances but she‚Äôll tell me if I ask.

My partner pretty much breaks even every month... no savings, no retirement, no debt. She‚Äôs a divorced single mother with  teenager and a dad who doesn‚Äôt pay anything... and probably lacks the income to pay anything anyway.

Here are some options I‚Äôve thought about but don‚Äôt know what to do:

1. Consolidate my student loans into fed direct loans and get on the PSLF loan forgiveness program. I didn‚Äôt realize this was an option until recently. My concern here is that I‚Äôll still be paying loans and interest for 10 more years and the amount forgiven won‚Äôt be that much at the end of those 10 years. Maybe I‚Äôm better off switching to fed loans to get a better interest rate but paying them down faster anyway. Of course, doing so will increase the principal balance and lower the minimum payment, which will increase the total amount forgiven after 10 years of continued payment.

2. Maybe buy a house for my partner, her daughter, and I... getting out of renting an apartment.

3. Maybe take the additional cash flow and invest it in stocks or something else.

EDIT: 

‚Ä¢ Now that my wife has secured her own health insurance as a caregiver, we can divorce.

‚Ä¢ Wife‚Äôs loans are not in default.

‚Ä¢ Caring for our daughter is a full time job in itself and wife can‚Äôt get out to work another job. However, if there is some little thing she can do intermittently to earn a little money from home, she‚Äôd probably like that. I‚Äôm over at the house to help 3 nights per week and about half of each weekend, allowing my wife and her partner to get out and go do stuff.

‚Ä¢ My partner, also age 50, will be switching jobs soon and will be able to start a retirement fund and should have a little better cash flow. Her mom may be able to help with some cash down on real property, but I‚Äôm not going to ask right now.

‚Ä¢ My wife‚Äôs partner has good income, owns the house where my wife and daughter live, and she socks much of her income away in retirement accounts.",finance
personalfinance,HELOC or Private Student Loans,"Happy Sunday, everyone!

My wife and I are wanting to make a big purchase (\~$10,000).  Our credit is good and we can afford to pay it off over a year if we need to.

My question is this.

If we are confident we will be able to get approved each time, is there any reason not to make the purchase on a 0% interest for 12-24 month credit card, make the minimum payment, then pay a 3-5% fee and do a balance transfer to a new 0% card the next year?  Repeat to basically get a 3-5% interest rate and invest the difference.

We aren't planning on making any big purchases for at least 2 years, when we might start shopping for a house, and if we need to we can just pay it off to reduce our credit card debt before then if it is impacting our score.

personalfinance,Zero percent interest worth paying more for vehicle?,"So my daily driver has essentially bit the dust.  I won't go into every detail, but basically the car is worthless.  It has rusting on a piece of the frame that requires replacement (verified by a second, independent garage) and that work will cost at least $2000 more than the car is worth.  It's not an immediate issue (per both garages), but the wife and I agreed it doesn't make sense to do the repair.

We had always been planning on either a truck vs. van, but for several reasons the wife and I feel a truck is the way to go.  So, an option that arose was to purchase my father-in-law's truck.  He's been looking to sell and upgrade for a while, so helps everyone involved from that perspective.  The problem is that the truck is worth more than I originally estimated.  Our top number to spend was $25,000, but I really wanted to try to keep it under $20,000.  I think the truck is going to be closer to $30,000.  We have always paid for cars in cash and don't plan to change that.  But, my father-in-law mentioned in passing that he would be fine if we just paid him $250 per month with 0% interest (in-laws are fine financially, this would not hurt their financial security in any way).

In Alabama, the amount of your trade value gets deducted before sales tax is calculated, so if we sell it to carmax, we increase the price of the car by the trade value +4% ($140). What I cant seem to find an answer to is if we the tax exemption by trading the vehicle carries over to income tax or not.

I would use the HELOC for future home projects. I'm not looking to sell the house since I'm pretty comfortable with the commute/area, and I see the value of the area continuing to increase over the next 5+ years.

personalfinance,Can I afford a new apartment?,"I've been really struggling with this the past few weeks and want some unbiased opinions.

I currently live in a studio, I've been in this particular one for 4 years.

I'm going a little batty in my current studio. Very little sunlight can come through my windows, the lack of space is wearing on me, and I'm having issues with a neighbor. My monthly rent is $960,

I have a chance to move floors to a 1bedroom. I've seen the apartment, it would increase my space by 30%, it has the view I would want most out of any unit in the building. However it is $325 more at $1285 - all utilities are included. That's almost an extra 4k a year. The new rent would be 20% of my gross, but 30% of my net, depending who you ask that would make me technically rent burdened.

My gross salary is $74,500 (with a 5-10% bonus at the end of the year, not included in that) my net is about $4200 a month. I have about $80,000 in my 401k, I have $11,000 in federal student loans and $40,000 in private.  I have 0 credit card debt. I live in a major city and my neighborhood is very walkable, so I do not own a car. I don't currently pay for a transit pass since I'm working from home, I'm unsure when/if I'll go back to the office. Before lockdown, my pass was $100 and I'd maybe spend $120 on Lyft/Ubers.

I'll have saved enough to pay off my federal student loans by October. I'm currently not making federal payments, but since interest is not accruing, and I'm unsure what will happen politically, I'm making any payment decisions in September when I have a better picture. Either way, unless something tragic where I'd need to use savings, I won't have a federal payment after October.

After that, I plan on paying off my private student loans. I have 10 years left, but I can cut that a little in half moving my federal payment over. However, if I stayed in my studio apartment, I could pay off my private student loans in 3. But the idea of staying here another 3 years makes me anxious. I also feel like I'm a bit behind on my 401k.

Speaking of savings, I have 6 months of net salary saved. I don't have much of a family support net, so this was best for my situation, instead of using part of that 24k to pay off debt. This in addition to the loan money I've saved.

I don't know if I want to stay here in my area, so buying a condo or house isn't really in my medium term plans. I have the vague idea I'd like to buy, but it's not something I'm passionate about. I'm not particularly handy, and I'm single, so there's a lot to homeownership that's not appealing to me.

So is it stupid for me to move to a bigger place? Should I be using that $325/4k for something else?

I am filing taxes in the first place because my employer withheld some salary, even though I was employed for only the last two months of the year and thus haven't reached the first tax bracket for 2020.

I've double and triple checked the correctness of all information input into TurboTax, yet the amount indicated to be refunded is less than the amount withheld. Additionally, the value of this missing amount does not correspond to any withheld amount (or any sum of withheld amounts) on my W-2 form.

Is there a tax peculiarity that I am unaware of or is this simply a mistake on the part of TurboTax?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for the helpful information! Many have indicated that my situation is due to Social Security and Medicare taxes, however this doesn't make sense to me from two different angles:

* This would imply that lowest income earners have the choice between filing taxes and paying Social Security and Medicare taxes, or not filing taxes (which is legal for sub $12,400 income) and not paying any taxes at all.
* By default one can write off some $12,000 instead of itemizing business expenses, donations etc. Since I have earned less than $12,000 this year, I can write off everything making my taxable income $0, and thus owe no taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

By u/[htzlprtzl](https://www.reddit.com/user/htzlprtzl/)'s recommendation I've tried [freetaxusa.com](https://freetaxusa.com). They indicate that I do not owe any taxes at all (perhaps this only applies to federal tax as many have commented), but the refund indicated is only half of what my employer withheld. I've entered the fact  that I am a dependent with some unearned income, and I am quite sure that freetaxusa is indicating that my taxable income is $0. I do not understand what is going on but I will assume that I do in fact owe some taxes despite the fact that I could have legally not filed taxes (and not paid anything).",finance

investing,Gold can continue its victorious march to $ 2.5-3 thousand per ounce in 2021-2022,"What is ... gold

 Although gold looks like a metal, in terms of its properties it is more likely the oldest currency or financial asset.  Less than 10% of the gold produced in the world is used in the industry, while the majority is used for investment, savings and jewelry production - also a kind of savings.  At the same time, gold as a financial asset has several characteristics that are interesting from an investment point of view.

 First, it generates zero real returns.  That is, you bought an ingot of gold, and a year later it is the same ingot of gold.  In the ordinary world, zero profitability is very little.  But in a world where trillions of dollars in debt yields negative nominal yields, 0% yields are taking on new colors.  Therefore, investment demand for gold is growing and has every chance of continuing to grow in the foreseeable future.

 Second, gold mining is limited by the production capacity of gold miners.  In 2020, the United States printed 20% of the dollars already available at the beginning of the year.  And usually a textbook on macroeconomics suggests that in such cases, the value of the currency should fall.  This is what is happening, and therefore the value of all assets that bring dollar returns will continue to fall.

 Gold production in the world in 2020 amounted to approximately 3.3 thousand tons, or about 1.5% of the total amount of precious metal mined in the entire history (about 200 thousand tons).  This means that the emission of this currency - gold - occurs at a rate of 1.5% per year, which is much lower than the average rate of emission of the dollar and euro over the past ten years (for example, 7% in dollars).  Therefore, we should expect that the rate of gold against the dollar and the euro will grow.

 Thirdly, no country in the world has a monopoly on the printing of this ancient currency.  The ""printing press"" for gold is the mining and metallurgical companies that mine it all over the world.  Therefore, no one will be able to use this currency as a geopolitical tool to put pressure on other states.

 This leads to a growing demand for gold from the central banks of countries that do not issue such reserve currencies as the dollar and euro.  Over the past ten years, the world's central banks have bought 15% of the world's gold production, and this trend can be expected to continue.

 By the way, in many ways, the properties listed above are also suitable for bitcoin - limited emission, lack of control over emission by any state, zero profitability - which makes bitcoin interesting for investors in a world with printing presses.

 What's next?

 The past 2020 has been a good year for gold, with prices up more than 20% over the year, which coincides with the difference between the increase in the dollar money supply and the increase in the gold supply.  At some point, the metal price was above $ 2 thousand per ounce, but now it is consolidating at $ 1.8-1.9 thousand, which may become a good entry point into the market for investors who missed this year's rally.

 2021 has every chance of becoming no worse than 2020.  In the last weeks of last year, the rise in inflation expectations resumed, and the strongly accelerated growth in commodity prices suggests that expectations will soon materialize in inflation statistics.

 At the same time, the rhetoric of the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank suggests that interest rates will remain zero or negative, and monetary policy is soft for at least several years.  Therefore, it is likely that real rates will fall deeper into the negative zone, which will force investors to return to gold.

 Expectations are also positively affected by the continuing devaluation of the dollar, and the recovery of the global economy with the start of mass vaccination will lead to the recovery of another important component of demand for gold - the jewelry market.

 If in the first few months since the beginning of the pandemic, the demand for gold from the jewelry sector fell by 50% year-on-year, over the past few months it has been actively recovering and will continue to recover in 2021.  All these factors indicate that gold can continue its victorious march to $ 2.5-3 thousand per ounce in 2021-2022.",finance

personalfinance,Amount left over after expenses and how much to invest,"I've been trying to figure out how much I should spend on housing each month (either rent or mortgage). I figured up a budget with all known expenses: utilities, car payment, insurance, health insurance, phone, food, gas etc. With the amount I used (I was using a mortgage calculator, since I like how Zillow lets you add utility costs as part of the monthly housing expense) and I found I'd have about $600 left after expenses each month.

Is this a bad amount to have left? Of course I know other things come up too like oil changes, haircuts, car repairs or home repairs if you own. Or other things you might want to buy but aren't really needs.

If I did buy a house I'd probably put about $70k or $80k down and keep about $50k in savings. Does this seem doable? If I rented I think I'd invest more since I would still have savings.

The thing is I want to invest more and start doing a retirement fund since I have never done this since I started working in 2012. I've always put my money into savings accounts, but obviously I need to start a Roth IRA or something. I don't know much about investing or retirement accounts since my parents all have retirement accounts through the state. But I do not and it's never really come up until now. I have $135k in savings, and I owe $6k on my car which is $200 a month but low interest rate. No other debts. I'm worried about future inflation since I keep hearing about that lately.

If I had $500-600 left a month after expenses, I'm assuming all of that should go to retirement or investments since I already have a substantial savings regardless if I buy a home or not? Or is that not enough to have left for those things?

Should I keep a large amount in savings too or should I put most of that into retirement (once I figure out if I want to buy a home or not)?

I don't spend a lot on ""big toys,"" but I do want to buy a second cheaper vehicle and maybe a small camper in the future after I buy the home or decide to stay with renting.",finance

1. Large &amp; established
2. Relatively 'conservative' finances with less debt than a typical American or European company of similar size
3. A large domestic market to keep revenues healthy as companies now look to expand abroad

The reason for 3 is that Japan is a demographic timebomb where they have way too many older folk and are still a little too xenophobic to allow enough foreigners in. This creates a dilemma for Japan where it has to decide to either loosen monetary policy and allow their companies to take on more debt to expand (and drive economic growth) or let in millions of young outsiders.

personalfinance,Pay Additional Principal On Mortgage?,"About two years ago, my wife and I bought a new custom home and financed the purchase with a 15 yr. mortgage. Currently, our loan balance is $507, 605 and interest rate is 3.1%. I just turned 70 and at the current rate, I will be 83 when the house is paid off. 

My wife hates paying interest and wants to pay an additional $200/month towards the principal. Looking at the amortization schedule, it looks like we would pay off the mortgage about a year earlier and close to two years earlier if we double to $400/month  extra. I'm not seeing a compelling reason to do this, other than to save some money on interest.

We were unable to sell our previous residence and so we are currently renting it out - we own it outright. Once the current tenant's lease is up, we will consider putting the house on the market - if we do, then we will use some of the proceeds to finish our basement and use the rest to recast the mortgage, which should enable us to lower payments to the point that we will not have to dip into IRAS to compensate for the loss of rental income. Otherwise, we are fine with the current stats quo.

So, my question is, can anyone offer a compelling reason to apply more $$ towards the principal?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Not another fairy-tale ending - a word of warning for those entering the crypto scene,"For myself, life over the past few years has seemingly gone from bad to worse - and before I go into the details -this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúpity-post‚Äù or a sympathy searching exercise, this is simply a warning, and hopefully a lesson to others who are entering the crypto scene.

My crypto journey began back in earnest at the start of that famed 2017 ‚Äúbull run‚Äù ‚Äì I had a little bit in savings and had done my due diligence ‚Äì this really was the future, and it could potentially set me and my family up for life.

I bought in with every bit of money I had to spare. All told, it was about ¬£6,500, and the price of Bitcoin sat at just under ¬£9,000.

This was exciting. The price continued to increase and I religiously opened and closed the Coinbase website to see the price soar by the hundreds and into the thousands. Work took a backseat and I became consumed with the markets, red and green candles being the first and last things I saw in the day.

I wanted more. I became envious of those that had bought into cryptos years before. So I looked at alternate avenues to increase my Bitcoin holdings‚Ä¶ this was going to be the making of me! Sadly it turned out to be quite the opposite.

**Scams, Scams everywhere‚Ä¶**

The first venture I looked into was a third party bitcoin mining platform which promised exponential growth. It sounded too good to be true (spoiler: it was). I used a credit card to buy more Bitcoin. First mistake. I maxed the card and sent around ¬£6,000 in Bitcoin to a mining company known as Crypterra. The reviews were good, the discord was active, people were seeing payouts ‚Äì it was all looking legitimate. But of course it wasn‚Äôt. Payouts dried up. The devs went silent and the site disappeared and re-appeared sporadically before going offline indefinitely. It was over and I had lost most of the ¬£6,000 from my credit card.

**Robots are the future?**

The price of Bitcoin was still holding strong and I‚Äôd made small gains with my original investment which was still untouched. Perhaps I could increase by Bitcoin gains elsewhere and pay off the credit card I had maxed out.

Again, I looked into ways to bolster my Bitcoin reservesI looked into trading platforms, cryptocurrency bots in particular. How hard could it be? As long as the price of Bitcoin went up, it should balance out any losses as I learned the ropes. There were a few that caught my eye. And following what I thought was sage ‚Äúyoutuber‚Äù advice ‚Äì I dove into the world of trading with bots ‚Äì linking up a Binance account and setting up my automated systems to work their magic and trade whilst I was asleep/working/sitting on the toilet, you name it.

As you can imagine, these bots weren‚Äôt the holy grail they were promoted to be, and I was losing Bitcoin left, right and centre. I became more and more ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù with the strategies‚Ä¶ doubling my stakes, tripling my stakes to recoup what I had lost. I didn‚Äôt see it as real money (despite paying with hard earned money to fund these accounts) ‚Äì it was magic internet money, just ones and zeroes ‚Äì so the reality of it didn‚Äôt hit home how much I was actually losing. Shock horror, I lost it all.

**Taking it to the bookies‚Ä¶**

I had effectively been gambling my money away, and in my increasingly agitated state I sought out other communities to try and regain my money. Sports-betting communities, gambling communities, Twitter ‚Äútipsters‚Äù and Facebook groups who had all the inside knowledge.

I was down over ¬£12,000 from my savings and the ¬£6,500 from the credit card combined. I decided to open another two credit cards. One to fund my betting account and the other for backup. I quickly went through the first card‚Äôs funds, but I was ‚Äòstill learning‚Äô, this was ‚ÄòOk‚Äô ‚Äì next time I would get it right. The second card (third in total) was quickly exhausted, and I was now close to ¬£20,000 in the hole from when I started, all within just a few months.

**The hole grew ever darker**

As I write this now I am actually afraid and embarrassed to share the total losses I have made over the past few years (it‚Äôs actually much worse than I could have ever imagined). I have no-one to blame but myself; the greed, stupidity and at times, pure arrogance have lead me down this path. A path which at the moment seems irreversible for me.

To see the price of Bitcoin now makes me feel physically sick ‚Äì if only I had been patient. If only I hadn‚Äôt chased my losses, if only I hadn‚Äôt played with money that wasn‚Äôt mine - I wouldn‚Äôt be in this predicament. As the debt mounts ever higher and interest rates on credit cards are crippling me, it will be an incredibly long time before I have any financial stability again. It has made me mentally unwell and I‚Äôm still figuring out the next steps which I know include professional support and removing my head from the pile of sand in which I have buried it.

I sincerely hope that those who read this account of my situation don‚Äôt fall into the same trap. The world is once again hyped for crypto, and with it come the pitfalls and scams and false promises of financial freedom and becoming rich. Don‚Äôt try and cheat the system, don‚Äôt chase your losses and don‚Äôt use money that isn‚Äôt yours in the first place.

**TLDR:**

To put it succinctly, the above is a very short overview of the financial hole I have found myself due to greed, arrogance and stupidity over the past few years. Hopefully a warning to others. Don‚Äôt chase losses, don‚Äôt look for the next get rich scheme and don‚Äôt invest money that isn‚Äôt yours to start with. Basically, don‚Äôt ruin your life like me. If only I had just held.

**EDIT:**

A quick edit to say thank you to everyone who has taken the time to read the above and replied in the comments. I've had some very honest and insightful responses and some incredibly useful suggestions about how I can bring myself back from this dilemma. I'll be seeking professional help both for the gambling and the debt management and hopefully get myself on the right track for the sake of my own sanity and that of my family's.",cryptocurrency

I have a credit card with a $10k limit, the balance currently sits at $9400. It is a higher interest rate but I keep using it anyway.

I also have a credit line through PayPal with a limit of around $4k and that‚Äôs hovering around $3400 used.

My wife has a credit card with a high limit but off the top of my head I can‚Äôt say what the balance is or the limit.

My plan was to put the tax return towards the high interest card and pay it off entirely.

We own our home and have a significantly higher interest rate than what is available these days. My hope would be to refi our loan ASAP to lose our PMI and get a lower interest rate/lower monthly payment.

Which would be the smarter move, paying off the high interest card entirely and then whittling down the other debts with the newly available monthly funds. Or paying all the accounts down below 30% at once and then staying on top of those to eventually wipe them out. I‚Äôm trying to become more knowledgeable about my financial options and (without sounding like I‚Äôm making excuses) I haven‚Äôt had great role models when it came to financial stability.

XRP,Stop worrying about XRP's price. This isn't a day trader's game which is why many of you will lose. XRP is a Set-it-and-Forget-it game. You will be wealthy if you hold. Here's why:,"If you are holding XRP hoping for it to go to $1.00, $10.00, $100.00, just know that it will, but you have the wrong mindset. 

The US Dollar is on its way out, fiat is on its way out. By holding XRP, or BTC, or any coin or token waiting for it to reach high dollar cost, you are essentially falling into an inflation trap. 

What you must work on now is not asking yourself and others how high XRP can go in US Dollar swap out exchange price, you must begin to ask yourself ""What purchasing power will my XRP bring?"" 

XRP isn't setting itself up to be the world standard for the crypto space, IT IS set up to be the world standard in the crypto space. 

What does that mean? 

It means that the world's most powerful banks are already positioned for the transition from the US Dollar as the World Reserve Currency to the next world reserve standard. And what token are they using to replace SWIFT? XRP. They say it all the time specifically by name. Prices will remain low for institutional adoption before the inevitable fall of the US Dollar. It may take a day, a week, two years, it doesn't matter, all you need to know is that you are holding digital gold by holding XRP for the long haul. 

So in order to have an idea of what the true value of XRP will be you must first factor in multiple things. 

1) XRP is designed for large cross border settlements. 

What does that mean? It means its not designed for you to buy products on Amazon. Its designed for large financial institutions to move extremely large sums of currency, cross border, rapidly. 

In simple terms, its made to be used for moving hundreds of thousands to millions in today's value of US Dollars quickly from Central Bank to Central Bank. 

I'll let your imagination run wild in what that could possibly mean for the true value of XRP with only 100,000,000,000 in existence and with each transaction that number decreases. 

2) There are 100,000,000,000 XRP in existence, premined, and decentralized.

This is important to factor in because it means no one country can invest in mining ops and have the lions share of the total supply, thus hurling the world into financial ruin if they choose to flip a power switch

This is also important because no bank can inflate the currency like the Federal Reserve does to the US Dollar with infinite lending 

Finally, this is important because there are only 7,000,000,000-8,000,000,000 people on earth meaning that if all of them were to hold XRP evenly divided they'd only hold ROUGHLY about 14 XRP each... there isn't enough to go around. 

3) This is speculation, but cannot be ignored or ruled out. XRP can potentially be backed by or partially backed by physical Gold. 

This is important to factor in because fiat debt is over $145,000,000,000,000 in unfunded liabilities. There is no way to clear that debt without a reset and revaluation of a monetary asset... A MONETARY ASSET... So when people post about ""Muh yellow rocks"" it just shows how little they understand finance and MONEY. 

IF XRP is backed by physical Gold, you WILL have an overtaking of Bitcoin as the king of crypto as the true value of Gold is conservatively $14,000 when adjusted for inflation conservatively and well over $30,000 when adjusted with inflation plus the debt load. 

I hope this helps some of you who are frustrated about not making a quick buck. This is far bigger than you realize.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Paying off mortgage strategy opinion.,"Hi everyone. I have a plan to pay an additional $1,500 into my mortgage principal, which will allow me to pay it off in 3 years. My current mortgage interest rate is 2.75% and about 7 years of a 15 year mortgage remains. 

I definitely want to pay off my mortgage and my question is, should I pay the extra $1,500 into the mortgage, or invest it into an ETF/Mutual Fund and make pay off the mortgage at the end of the 3 years, with the money that was invested?

Thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Check my math (using the interest holiday to pay off private student loans),"Currently I have 2 student loans left from college

* Private Balance 2337.88 @3.75% variable interest (Currently paying 360 a month to this loan)

* Federal Balance 48632.11 @4.25% fixed but currently on interest and penalty holiday due to covid (Currently paying 400 a month) 

My plan (that I am trying to validate) is to pay all the money to the private loan for 3 months and pay it off (2337.88/3 = ~780.00, which I know is slightly over my current total payment amounts but I can swing an extra $20 a month). Then paying the whole $760 to the federal student loan. 

as far as I can tell because of the 0% interest on the federal loan, I would end up coming out ahead by ~$200

**My Math**

*Paying as I have been*

Private will be paid off in 7 months (September) 
2337.88 / 360  = 6.5 months 

Federal would have a balance of 45,832
48,632.11 - (400 X 7) 

*Paying private loan first*

Private would be paid off in 3 months 
2337.88 / 3 = 779.29

Federal would have a remaining balance of 45,592 after September

4 X 760 = 3040 (the number of payments left at 0% interest according to the email from the Govt)
49632 - 3040 = 45,592

Can somebody double check my math, or let me know if there is something I am not taking into account?",finance
personalfinance,How to get a human at Fidelity Investment?,"Basically the title. I set up a Roth 401k with Fidelity a few weeks ago and still can't deposit any funds, despite my bank information showing up as linked.

personalfinance,How to best invest money set aside for a 5yr loan,"I'm financing a new car over five years for which I've set aside some money with the intention of investing it and drawing upon it to pay off the car. I'm interested what sort of investment or blend of investments I should consider that 

- nets a solid 7-10 percent per year
- is low cost
- is tax efficient

Things I've considered (and why I'm unsure):
- Certificates of deposit &amp; high interest savings accounts (very low interest rates)
- Index &amp; mutual funds (not sure about cost/tax efficiency of executing sells every month)
- Stocks (not sure about tax implications of selling stocks every month especially wrt short/long term capital gains)
- P2P lending (not sure about tax... you get the idea)

Ideally I'd set this up so I just plow my money in, automatically sell some portion of this investment each month, reinvest any gains, and have automatic payments from the loan draw from this account. The theme here (as you can see above) is I'm not sure about the tax/cost implications of taking money out of this investment 12 times a year.

stocks,DD: $AI (C3.ai) Long Analysis,"It's a new day, the sun is shining, the tank is clean, and $AI is trading sideways... $AI is trading sideways!?!? Who is even $AI?

$AI is the ticker symbol for [C3.ai](https://c3.ai/), which is an enterprise AI company. They provide a modular AI solution for enterprise companies and have big name clients across the Federal government, finance, and manufacturing.

$AI had an IPO last Dec that was largely unnoticed. Their IPO price was $42 on Dec 8 that opened to the public on Dec 9 at $100. There was a somewhat quiet response within the first week staying between $90 - $128 but from Dec 15 - Dec 25 it soared from $99 to it's ATH of $183.90. Since then, it has faced lots of resistance around $150 with support around $120. Over the past few weeks, it's been forming a pennant indicator and accumulating ready for a breakout currently in the handle of a cup and handle. The price target is $170 as it looks to try test ATH again.

Others from Trading View concur with a bullish sentiment - [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AI/ideas/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AI/ideas/).

While I think $AI is overall pricey for the long-term, they are in a rapidly growing domain with large contract opportunities to easily double and triple revenue YoY. Just because it's expensive (eg valuation is high), doesn't mean it's not a good deal.

Thoughts? How many of you trade recent IPO companies and if not, what do you look for before determining to be a longer-term investor (e.g. not day trading)?

personalfinance,HELOC to pay off investment property or 1st rental mortgage?,"Hello everyone, I'm seeking for some advise with investing. About me:

\-28 yo with stable incomes that makes $45k/annually, so about $1300 to take home bi-weekly

\-extra $1200 from roommates each month 

\-own a home outright (inherited from family) value at least ($340K)

\-recently paid off my car loan, has no other debt as of today besides some daily expense 

\-total expense that I'm accounted for is $700 per month (foods, utilities, insurances)

\-after all this, my credit score comes out to be 750 or at least higher (I'm not sure since I just paid off my car loan couple days ago)

I'm leaning toward HELOC since it makes more sense to get approved (I just got the 45k job 1 year ago and before I was working as a contractor for Roberthalf because I just recently graduated from school so my last tax return reported as $37k - the year before it was maybe 25k) to buy an investment property in my area (the range would be around 220k or less). I'm not so sure about getting approved for the 1st rental mortgage since my tax return of last year is very low (37k). Even with 3 times that number comes out to be $120k. 

I'm doing my research and see Third Federal only offers a HELOC for $200k max with 2.24% variable rate. That is a very good deal considering my situation.

 Should I start looking into this option? My goal is to buy another properties and work toward the house to pay it off sooner  than 30 years repayment term using my income, my extra cash from roommates and income from the investment property.

I appreciate all your feedbacks.",finance
cardano,Polkadot and Cardano comparison.,"# Staking

(I use some of the same Cardano terminology for Polkadot here to make the comparison more clear (I hope). Polkadot has nominators (delegators) and validators (pools).)

**Polkadot**

* Unbonding period of 28 days. Tokens are locked up and to be able to start using them you have to wait 28 days.
* Slashing. You can lose DOT as a punishment if a pool misbehaves.
* There is a minimum amount of DOT required to earn rewards. This amount is dynamic and I couldn't find out how much it is currently. I've seen people in threads talking about 135ish DOT (135 DOT is $2,970 currently).
* You can delegate to up to 16 pools and once pools are elected to produce blocks the protocol will pick one of those 16 pools for you to support with your stake.
* A pool is ""oversubscribed"" once it has more than 128 delegators. This means only the top 128 delegators  as measured by amount of stake allocated to that pool will receive rewards. All other delegators don't earn any rewards.
* To be able to run an active pool you need a minimum amount of DOT. This amount is dynamic and depends on certain factors. Currently you need more than 1.7M DOT, at current price that's $37.8M (yes, that's real... I triple checked it on their wiki).
* Returns: 14.1%

**Cardano**

* Tokens aren't locked. You can move them whenever you want.
* There are no punishments, Cardano works with incentives instead. You can never lose ADA, you can only lose out on potential rewards if a pool doesn't perform.
* There is no minimum amount required to earn rewards. You only need a 2 ADA deposit to register your wallet and 0.17 ADA for the transaction fee.
* You delegate your stake to one pool.
* Pools can become saturated. Any stake over 100% saturation will not give the pool additional rewards but since there are more delegators the pool will need to divide the same rewards to more delegators which diminishes the rewards per delegator (I'm not 100% if this is accurate but it's close enough).
* Returns: 5-6%

There is more to it but I don't think it is necessary to get into it more. You can learn more about Polkadot staking here: [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking)

And this is a great place to figure out what staking is on Cardano: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano\_ELI5/comments/kwmli8/what\_does\_it\_mean\_to\_stake\_your\_ada/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/kwmli8/what_does_it_mean_to_stake_your_ada/)

&amp;#x200B;

# Monetary policy

**Polkadot**

* Total Initial Supply: 10 million.
* Total Planned Inflation: Unlimited.
* Maximum Token Supply: Unlimited.
* Inflation Rate: [Dependent upon the staking rate](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QCs1KgGGAEIDugOHHD6n8kI4UG2v5nO_DwXt-D8El4A/edit#gid=494484132) in the network, but maxes out at 10% as the staking ratio approaches 50%.

**Cardano**

* Circulating supply: 31 billion.
* Total Planned Inflation: 14 billion.
* Maximum Token Supply: 45 billion.
* Inflation Rate: Every 4-5 years half of the reservers (the 14 billion) will be used. So inflation rate will reduce over time.
* This is basically the same as Bitcoin. 21 million max supply, circulating supply 18.6 million and every 4 years there is a halving event that slows down inflation.

For more details on Cardano's monetary policy see the official documentation: [https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/cardano-monetary-policy.html](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/cardano-monetary-policy.html)

# Treasury and Governance

**Polkadot treasury**

If you want to make a proposal for funding from the [Polkadot treasury](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-treasury) you need to deposit 5% of the asked funds or at least 100.000 DOT.  This amount is burned if the proposal is rejected. Proposals are decided on by the council which consists of a maximum of 24 ""actors"" (currently 13).

**Cardano treasury**

Proposals on Catalyst for the [Cardano treasury](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/cardano-monetary-policy.html) don't require a deposit. You make a proposal, you get feedback from the community, you refine it and then all the ADA holders can vote on it and the proposals with the highest votes get funding. Project Catalyst is still an experiment and will be refined over time. [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/index](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/index)

&amp;#x200B;

**Polkadot governance**

Changes to protocol parameters etc. go through a referenda process. Anyone can propose a referendum by depositing the minimum amount of tokens for a certain period (number of blocks). The proposal with the highest amount of bonded support will be selected to be a referendum in the next voting cycle. There can also be council referenda.  When all members of the council agree on a proposal, it can be moved to a referendum.

The council is called upon primarily for three tasks of governance: proposing sensible referenda, cancelling uncontroversially dangerous or malicious referenda, and electing the technical committee.  A proposal can be canceled if the [technical committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#technical-committee) unanimously agrees to do so.

There is a lot more to it. It's a complicated topic. I thought it was important to point out that the council of max 24 actors has a lot of control here. If you want to know more read this: [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance)

**Cardano governance**

There is nothing known about Cardano's governance yet except for the [CIP procedure](https://cips.cardano.org/) as far as I know. My guess is it will look a lot like Catalyst. If anyone knows please comment.

&amp;#x200B;

# 

# Consensus Protocol

(There is a lot here that I don't understand and don't know but I wanted to add this subject anyway. I have no clue what is better and what is not. Polkadot was inspired by Ouroboros Praos (Cardano) and GHOST/Casper FFG (Ethereum). They have different philosophies on subjects like finality, how to scale, how to deal with attack vectors, etc. but most of this goes over my head so I kept it simple. Do your own research if you want to know more.)

**Polkadot**

*Nominated Proof of Stake*

Hybrid consensus splits up the finality gadget from the block production mechanism.

BABE is the block production mechanism that runs between the validator nodes and determines the authors of new blocks. BABE is comparable as an algorithm to Ouroboros Praos, with some key differences in chain selection rule and slot time adjustments. 51% byzantine resistant.

GRANDPA is the GHOST-based finality gadget.  30-20% byzantine resistant.

[https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-consensus](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-consensus)

&amp;#x200B;

**Cardano**

*Dynamic Proof of Stake*

Ouroboros. 51% byzantine resistant.

[https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/understanding-consensus.html](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/understanding-consensus.html)

&amp;#x200B;

# Scaling Solution

Polkadot will use sharding and claims to eventually be able to do 1 million tps. Cardano will use [Hydra](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/26/enter-the-hydra-scaling-distributed-ledgers-the-evidence-based-way/) as a layer 2 solution which will scale to whatever is necessary. Here is an interesting 4:00 minute video on why IOG decided to not use sharding and instead chose for the Hydra approach: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHus4eqPID4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHus4eqPID4) I would like to add that this amount of scaling is also not necessary yet. For the next couple of years Ouroboros by itself can scale enough (1000 tps when optimized) to deal with the demand.

&amp;#x200B;

# Interoperability

Polkadot focuses on interoperability with other blockchains a lot more than Cardano. It calls itself ""the blockchain of blockchains"" and the idea is that you can develop complete blockchains with ease (using Substrate which is a blockchain framework) on top of Polkadots [parachains](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parachains) which all share the security of the main Relay Chain and benefit from interoperability with eachother.

Cardano is seeking to be interoperable with legacy systems and other cryptocurrencies. Cardano is going to integrate [KMZ sidechains](https://why.cardano.org/en/introduction/sidechains/) to do this. You can find Cardano's philosophy on interoperability here: [https://why.cardano.org/en/interoperability/the-grand-myopia/](https://why.cardano.org/en/interoperability/the-grand-myopia/)

&amp;#x200B;

# Smart Contracts

Polkadot will not support smart contracts natively. This feature will be build by other projects on top of their parachains. [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) and [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re/) are two of those projects. It was rumored that Moonbeam would bring smart contracts to Polkadot in Q2 2021 (might be delayed because of parachain issues on the testnet).

Cardano supports smart contracts natively starting with Plutus and Marlowe which will be released in Q2 2021 (EDIT: it's now september 2021, private testnet has end of may). [Plutus](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/plutus/en/latest/) is a completely new haskell based smart contract language designed by Phillip Wadler, the creator of Haskell. [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/10/06/marlowe-industry-scale-finance-contracts-for-cardano/) is a domain-specific language (DSL) based upon the Plutus platform and it allows domain experts to build financial contracts without having to  first master a difficult programming language. Marlowe utilizes visual programming tools (lego-like blocks) in an online development environment to implement standard financial  instruments. Marlowe is an easy-to-use smart contracts development platform optimized for finance. It is a fast track for finance experts and  finance engineers to build smart contracts with blockchain technology.  It is also a prototype DSL for similar languages in insurance, supply chain and legal.

&amp;#x200B;

# 

# Development progress

Cardano doesn't have smart contracts, governance, interoperability or a scaling solution developed yet.

Polkadot has governance but no smart contracts, interoperability or scaling solution yet.

Polkadot planned to deploy their parachain auction in Q1 2021 but because of problems this doesn't seem likely.

Polkadot will not support smart contracts natively. Smart contracts were supposed to come to Polkadot in Q2 2021 on a parachain. Cardano will support smart contracts natively and they will be released in Q2 2021.

Polkadots governance solution is easier to develop than what Cardano is doing with Catalyst because they use a centralized council who makes a lot of the decisions which is much easier than a DAO.

IOG uses a rigorous first principles approach with academic peer review, formal methods and a functional programming language. I'm not aware of what Parity's development standards are except that Polkadot is written in Rust but their standards are likely lower than IOG's.

&amp;#x200B;

# 

# Miscellaneous

Polkadot has Kasuma which is bascially an incentivized testnet like the Cardano ITN that ran for 6 months except this is a permanent testnet for Polkadot. It replicates real world scenarios much better than a regular testnet.

This is just a weird design decision I came across and I wanted to mention: In order to activate and use DOT, you must deposit and maintain a  balance greater than 1 DOT.  Without the existential deposit of 1 DOT, the account will be wiped from  the blockchain‚Äôs state to conserve space, along with any funds in that  address. Currently 0.9 DOT is almost $20. So they might just delete your $20 if you don't pay attention.

&amp;#x200B;

*If you think I have been unfair or something should be changed/added please let me know. There is obviously a lot more to it than what I wrote here but I thought this was adequate for now as a comparison. I could've also added e.g. 'Vision and strategy to adoption', 'Research' and go deeper into decentralization and distribution but I have no clue what Polkadot does on those fronts and tbh I don't think it will be on par with Cardano anyway. I tried to keep my own opinion out of it as much as I could but of course I am biased towards Cardano, sue me.*

*I made this because I saw yet another thread asking for it and some comparisons I've seen lately on youtube are tbh very lackluster or bad.*

*Here is another breakdown from a month ago with some additional information:* [https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/ko66bm/cardano\_vs\_polkadot\_breakdown\_detailed\_overview/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/ko66bm/cardano_vs_polkadot_breakdown_detailed_overview/)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT**: Found this after I wrote this thread. Polkadot's Nominated Proof of Stake is becoming unstable because there are too many nominators (only 6,700). And the workaround strategy to solve this means anyone with less than 200 DOT ($5,200) can't earn rewards as a nominator and they are advised to use exchanges to stake until there is a fix. [https://polkadot.network/polkadot-staking-an-update/#:\~:text=Since%20it%20went%20live%20on,it%20matures%20through%20its%20launch.&amp;text=Polkadot%20is%20a%20Nominated%20Proof,nominators%20to%20maximize%20chain%20security](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-staking-an-update/#:~:text=Since%20it%20went%20live%20on,it%20matures%20through%20its%20launch.&amp;text=Polkadot%20is%20a%20Nominated%20Proof,nominators%20to%20maximize%20chain%20security).

They used Cardano's Ouroboros Praos, changed it for their needs and now they have to fix a big fundamental design flaw they added.

&gt;BABE is comparable as an algorithm to Ouroboros Praos, with some key differences in chain selection rule and slot time adjustments.

Basically they butchered Ouroboros Praos without doing their due dilligence and it is backfiring only 8 months after launch.

It all comes back to this.

**EDIT 6-1-2021**: Polkadot still has 297 validators (most likely because it costs you 1.8M/$40M to run one) and Cardano now has 2,538 (up from 1,671). r/dot has 25k user (up from 12k) and r/cardano 500k (up from 140k).

My pup needs an emergency surgery, \~$1,030, so I sold half of my stake, \~$5k now. I attempted to wire $1,100(USD) into my American Express Savings Account. The wire went through, but now they are keeping the $1,100 saying that they don't accept money from cryptocurrency trading platforms.

This is how big banks will put crypto traders in their place...

I have filed with the FDIC/OCC, here is the complaint:

""I transferred $1,000 from my Charles Schwab (CS) checking account into a Kraken account for use of cryptocurrency trading on 1/28/2021. I made a profit on the trade and sold some of my crypto holdings for USD. Wanting to transfer some of these winnings to a bank account, I initiated a wire of $1,103.61 from my Kraken account to my American Express National Bank (AENB) High Yield Savings Account on 2/05/2021 at 11:19am ET. Not seeing the money in my account by end of business day, I began to grow concerned, but allowed until 2/08/2021 to see if the money would appear in my account over the weekend. Not seeing the money in my account at 11:04am on 2/08/2021, I called AENB using their customer service number in an attempt to track down where the wire transfer went.

I was told that ANEB received the wire, but that ANEB was not going to place the wire into my account. When asked the reasoning, the first representative could not give me any information. I asked for a supervisor who could better answer my questions. I spoke with that supervisor, who also couldn't answer my questions, and asked for a secondary supervisor. This process of transferring me from one supervisor to the next, lasted for an hour and fifteen minutes. I finally spoke to someone who better helped me understand the situation at-hand.

What I learned is that AENB does not allow transfers from cryptocurrency trading platforms according to their internal practices. This is not written in any policies which the consumer agrees to with AENB, which can be found online under the name of deposit\_account\_agreement.pdf. Instead AENB is relying on the section in the agreement titled ""Deposits -- General"" where it states, ""Deposits may only be made in U.S. dollars, by electronic funds transfer (EFT), including Automated Clearing House (ACH) transactions, or, in our sole discretion, by wire transfers..."".

AENB not accepting the transfer is an annoyance, especially with them seemingly using this ""catch-all"" a s reasoning. That being said, however, the larger issue is that now they are keeping the money wired to them and refused to send me the two things I requested:

1. A written statement (email or mail) as to why they are not accepting the transfer
2. An email with the federal wire tracking number with them sending the funds back to my trading account.

As of 1:33pm today, 2/8/2021, it appears that they have stolen $1,103.61 from me and used broad, sweeping policies that have harmed me, the consumer. In total, I spent an hour and thirty-six minutes on the phone with AENB representatives only to find that my only course of action is asking for the assistance of the FDIC, OCC, and the CFPB.""

I was hoping to buy it out with a loan in order to reduce interest as well as payment overall. I wanted to get a quote from the dealer to compare to my current credit unions offer, but he basically said not to bother. The lenders in the dealership basically are a separate entity and would charge fees for comparing various quotes. I know my credit union is offering 2.75 to 3% Which is better than normal and some other banks. Should I just apply there and go for it? Should I be asking for a better rate? Lastly, are there any drawbacks or catches from what I am trying to do?

Thanks so much for your insights",finance

dogecoin,Fundamental Defense of Dogecoin,"Disclosure: 80K dogecoins at an average cost of 2 cents a coin. I bought in early and have since added additional coins because I do think this is a solid investment. 

First and foremost, I think it is important to acknowledge the state of this sub right now. The vast majority of posts on this sub are memeing rocket emojis to the moon, reposting tweets from a variety of celebrities and others with very little financial due diligence regarding Dogecoin. As such, for valid reasons, folks are pointing out that holding onto DogeCoin has risks and every person who invests in Dogecoin needs to be aware of them. I fully agree that you should know the risks of Doge before purchasing. Buyer beware. 

However, I believe in the financial foundations of our beloved jokecoin/meme and am continuing to HODL my stake in my doge for the foreseeable future. The purpose of this post to explain my reasoning. 

First, the economic engine regarding all items is built on transactions. This is a terrible gross over simplification of macro economics, but the foundation of the economic engine is and will always be transactions. (If you want a full 30 minute macro level lesson on how the economy works (in the fiat world), watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&amp;t=526s)  

The hype around dogecoin is causing merchants to accept dogecoin in the form of payment, and the dogecoin community is actively seeking charities to accept dogecoin for donations. The more and more people push for this, the more credible the coin becomes as a currency therefore increasing value. As Doge gets adopted as a valid form of payment, it will mean that the buying and selling of dogecoins will be here to stay, regardless of the current pump hype. People are going to want to utilize these doges to pay for things, and have already done so. 
TL:DR (1 Doge = 1 Doge)


Second, Dogecoin is an inflationary currency versus deflationary. Detractors of our beloved meme coin rightfully call out that Dogecoin is an inflationary coin with no cap. This is true, and shouldn't be understated. 

However, I don't believe that this is the nail in the coffin. Most currencies are inflationary, and over-time do decrease in value. Actually, a little bit of inflation is healthy for a currency. In the fiat world, this inflation is managed by a combination of interest rates, money printing, purchasing of financial assets, taxes and payment of goods and services for those taxes. So, regarding Doge, I don't think the inflationary nature means it's worthless. I honestly think it is a good thing in the long run because being inflationary will ensure that the price of Doge will stay accessible for folks seeking to utilize it for transactions between buyers and sellers.  

It is true that there is an inherit danger of Dogecoin currently experiencing run-away inflation. (Google Zimbabwe inflation to see what happens here) Run-away inflation occurs when a money printer goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and then someone forgets to add the deflationary shit to the sauce. 

Dogecoin currently is set up in such a way where detractors are pointing out that there isn't enough deflationary shit in the sauce. True, However, I believe that currently the demand for dogecoin outweighs the coins that are being produced/mined, allowing it to increase in value overtime in the short-term. It's important to state though, that this IS a long term headwind for the coin, but it's not unsolvable. Our beloved dogecoin overlords who have gone MIA could implement methods in the future to keep the coin inflationary, but prevent runaway inflation by implementing a variety of safe guards. One such safe guard could be a yearly coin mining cap that prevents the amount of coins entering the supply outpacing the demand. All currencies both fiat and cryptos do this in one way or another. Dogecoin's source code can also account for this. 

I got other thoughts but need to get back to work. I have a price target of Doge at 25 cents a coin currently and think it can go higher if appropriate inflationary safeguards are implemented.

personalfinance,Question about refi.,"So my interest rate for my 30 year is 3.75%. This was started back in 2013.  My taxes are really high where I am, so my escrow is about 1400 a month, with about 900 to principal, and about 1200 to interest.  I put 10% down, PMI has been gone for about 2 years due to home values rising.  I pay an extra 400 per month to principal, just to pay down loan.  Estimated payoff for me now is about 2037, so 16 years.  Is it worth my effort to refi my house at a lower rate, so I pay less interest, or the way I‚Äôm going is fine?  Kind of difficult to see what point the math makes sense, especially because mortgage brokers are pushing me to refi, because they make money.  Out of pocket costs to me will be about 1800-2500 for a lawyer, my state requires it for mortgages.  No points on the new 2.875 rate for 20 year.",finance

# Six facts about stocks that will puzzle you

**Hardly any general insights can be derived from most studies on stocks. They usually focus on only one country or are based on time series that are too short. Historical price data from 23 country stock exchanges going back to 1900 paints a more realistic picture of the stock markets and dispels supposed certainties.**

Researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton are a financial market institution. The researchers constructed time series for major asset classes based on historical sources dating back to 1900. The data show, for example, what returns equities have yielded over 118 years in 23 different countries. In turn, the financial market researchers used the country data to develop a world equity index that represents more than 90 percent of globally tradable stocks, as measured by market capitalization.

The data offers investors a more realistic view of the characteristics of stocks and dispels several myths. This is because market studies are usually either based on performance over only a very short period of time, or they focus solely on the U.S., the largest and best-documented stock market in the world today.

But this approach distorts reality. After all, short periods of a few years or decades are hardly meaningful, and stock market development in the U.S. is a unique success story whose results cannot be transferred to other countries.

Thus, long-term market data from 23 countries paints a different picture of international stock markets that will turn many investors' perceptions upside down.

## 1. High real interest rates are followed by higher stock returns

""Rising interest rates are poison for stock markets,"" is a truism among investors and journalists. It is based on the observation that stock prices often fall when interest rates rise unexpectedly. But that is a very incomplete view of what happens in the stock market over the longer term. Historical stock price trends in 21 countries point in the opposite direction: real stock returns, which are **returns** net of inflation, were low when real interest rates were low and they were high when real interest rates were high.

If real interest rates were 9.4 percent or more in any one year over the past 118 years, real stock returns added up to an average of just under 11 percent per year over the following five years. When real interest rates were minus 11 percent or less, investors made losses of 5.5 percent a year on stocks over the following five years.

During periods of very high negative real interest rates, inflation was also high in the last century. Today, nominal interest rates are at historic lows, but real interest rates are not, because consumer prices are also rising at a low rate.

The fact that the longer-term relationship between real interest rates and stock returns has been positive is no surprise to financial market researchers. After all, this is exactly the result that theory suggests. According to this theory, the short-term real interest rate for bonds with maturities of less than one year is the so-called risk-free interest rate. For risky investments such as stocks, investors demand a premium, the risk premium. The real return on equities therefore consists of the risk-free interest rate and the risk premium. If the real interest rate falls, the return on equities must also fall if the risk premium remains the same.

Conclusion for investors: there is no need to get anxious if real interest rates rise. In the short term, stock prices may fall. But over the longer term, investors can expect higher real returns from equities.

## 2. Stocks are riskier than most investors believe

The financial industry and many media outlets that have been taken in by it, or are themselves part of it, like to promote equities. In times of record low interest rates, this high-yield asset class is indispensable for asset accumulation. After all, share certificates in companies are not that risky in the long run, they often say.

As an example, the propagandists cite, among other things, the yield development of the German stock index DAX. Anyone who invested in the index at any time between 1949 and 2017 and held the investment for at least 15 years always achieved a positive return.

These data are impressive and illustrate that stocks are a long-term investment. But they gloss over risk and exaggerate returns because they tell only half the story:

1. The time period chosen excludes the much worse decades before 1949.
2. The returns are nominal, i.e., not adjusted for inflation.

For investors, nominal returns are just smoke and mirrors. They say nothing about the actual growth or loss of assets. Only real returns, which are adjusted for inflation, provide information on this. They show how an investor's purchasing power has developed. If, for example, the nominal return is positive but the inflation rate is higher within a given period, the real return is negative. This means that an investor's real assets and purchasing power are declining.

Since 1900, consumer prices in countries with developed stock markets have tended to rise, interrupted by only a few episodes in which inflation declined. Nominal returns are therefore higher than real returns, from which inflation has been removed.

As only nominal returns are quoted by the financial industry and in the media, the impression conveyed by these figures is distorted. Investors are led to believe that their assets have grown more than they actually did. Losses are also lower on a nominal basis than in real terms as long as inflation is rising.

Looking at the full story of German equities unearthed by researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, the world no longer looks quite so rosy. Their data set spans from 1900 to 2017, so it also includes the two world wars, the period of hyperinflation and the crash on Wall Street in the early 1930s.

During World War 2 and in the years that followed, German stocks lost a total of 96 percent of their value in real terms. From 1900 to 1954, investors made no profit on German stocks. The accumulated real return after 54 years was minus 3 percent. A buy-and-hold strategy during this period would therefore only have preserved purchasing power, but would not have led to any real increase in wealth.

The stock markets of other countries such as France and Japan also had to endure similarly long lean periods. The longest period without real asset growth on the world stock market was less than half as long. It was only 22 years (1910-1931). This underscores how incredibly important it is to diversify a portfolio internationally and not to get too involved in a single country stock market.

Measured against the world stock market, the two world wars were by no means the worst periods that shareholders had to endure. The losses after the stock market crash in the 1930s, the oil price shock in the early 1970s, the bursting of the Internet bubble at the turn of the millennium and after the financial crisis of 2008 were considerably higher.

From 1900 to 2017, investors in German equities achieved an average annual nominal return of 8.4 percent. In real terms, however, i.e. after deducting inflation, the return on equities was only 3.4 percent.

It is true: German equities, as well as those of other countries with developed stock markets, have risen over the long term. However, the lean periods that investors had to endure were considerably longer than time series show, which only cover the sunny side of the 20th century and are not adjusted for inflation. For from 1950 to the end of 1999, the real return on the world stock market was an impressive 8.6 percent per year, while investors from 1900 to 1949 achieved only 2.7 percent after deducting inflation.

## 3. Economies with high economic growth do not deliver above-average returns on shares

Many banks suggest to their customers that where the economy is booming, there are particularly high profits to be made on stocks. As proof, they like to cite the rapid economic growth in emerging economies such as India and Brazil and the fabulous returns that have been achieved there since the turn of the millennium compared with the slower-growing industrialized countries. Especially in the years before the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008, banks were beating the drum for investments in the so-called emerging markets, when stock returns there were literally skyrocketing.

But returns over short periods of time raise false hopes. If you want to know something about the true character of the stock markets in the emerging markets, you have to take a closer look at the long-term development. And it looks less glorious than many investors probably expected.

While stocks in developed countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and Germany returned an average annual gain of 8.4 percent from 1900 to 2017, inclusive, the figure for fast-growing emerging markets was just 7.4 percent.

One percentage point may not seem like much, but over 118 years, this difference leads to a huge difference in total wealth: In the industrialized countries, one invested U.S. dollar increased to $12,877, while in the emerging markets, according to calculations by financial market researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, the figure was just $4,367.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the stock markets of the developed countries were sometimes ahead, sometimes those of the emerging countries. At times, they rose in parallel. But after World War 2, the emerging markets crashed. In Japan, which was not yet an industrialized country at the time, the stock market lost 98 percent of its value, measured in U.S. dollars. In China, investors suffered a total loss after the communists came to power and the stock markets were closed in 1949. In other emerging markets such as Spain and South Africa, stocks performed poorly because of the aftermath of World War 2.

It was not until 1950 that emerging markets picked up again. By the end of 2017, they averaged 12.1 percent returns per year compared with 10.8 percent in the developed world. But the annual lead of 1.3 percentage points on average over the past 68 years was not enough to fully make up the shortfall from the 1940s. Over the entire 118-year study period, the established, slower-growing industrialized countries delivered the higher stock returns.

For their study, Dimson, Marsh and Staunton ranked the individual countries according to a simple rule that has become widely accepted among providers of stock indices. According to this rule, countries with a per capita economic output of at least $25,000 a year are considered developed countries. Countries that generate lower GDP per capita are considered emerging markets.

The data show that, contrary to what the financial industry often claims, there is no positive correlation between economic growth and stock returns. Other studies tended to find higher stock returns in countries with weak growth, i.e. a negative correlation.

There is no clear evidence as to why this is the case. Researchers discuss various possible explanantions:

1. **High valuations**. When investors prefer to invest in countries with high economic growth, share prices there rise, and with them valuations. The result of high market valuations is often below-average returns.
2. **Global instead of local**. Many listed companies operate globally. Economic growth in their home country is not decisive for them. In other words, even in real economic terms, there is not necessarily a correlation between GDP growth and corporate performance.
3. **Dilution effects**. High economic growth must also be financed. Many listed companies finance their expansion by issuing new shares. While profits may rise, they are spread over more and more shares. This results in a dilution effect that leads to lower returns.

Investors should therefore not be impressed by high growth data and forecasts. They are not an indication of above-average stock returns in the future. These tend to be offered by slow-growing countries with undervalued stock markets.

## 4. Shares are no hedge against inflation

There is a persistent belief among many media professionals that stocks are a good hedge against inflation. The argumentation they use to support this (unfortunately untenable) thesis goes something like this: If inflation rises, companies can raise their prices to adjust to the new level. This increases their profits, which in turn leads to rising stock returns.

This argument does not hold water for several reasons. Perhaps the most important is that the numbers show the exact opposite. Stocks are not a hedge against inflation.

What professional investors expect from a hedge is immediate and, if possible, equivalent compensation as soon as the event of loss occurs. This means that if, for example, inflation rises from 2 and 4 percent, the nominal return on equities should also rise by at least 2 percentage points at the same time. That would be a 100 percent hedge. The real return, i.e. the return after deducting inflation, would remain unaffected by inflationary spikes.

But this example is no more than wishful thinking. For as inflation rises, the real returns on equities fall - and vice versa. International equities as an asset class therefore offer a hedge against deflation, but not against inflation. The financial market researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton prove this on the basis of 21 countries whose data series go back to 1900.

According to these data, investors in international equities achieved the highest real returns (11 to 12 percent) in the past when the inflation rate remained below 2 percent. In the past, a 10 percent increase in inflation led to a decline in real stock returns of about 5 percent.

If the extreme cases of hyperinflation (Germany, 1922-23, Finland 1918, Italy 1944, Japan 1946) are included in the calculation, equities perform somewhat better. Real returns fell by 3.5 percent when inflation rose by 10 percent.

Other studies support these findings. They also show that the relationship between real stock returns and inflation is negative. However, economists are still unable to provide a clear explanation as to why this is the case. What is clear, in any case, is that in the short term, stock prices do not necessarily follow corporate profits, which may determine returns in the long run. In the short term, it is rather factors such as monetary policy and investors' risk appetite that are decisive.

Because the latter usually falls when inflation rates rise, investors demand higher risk premiums for stocks, which depresses their prices, according to one theory. This theory is supported by the negative correlation between stock valuations measured by price-earnings ratios (P/E ratios) and inflation. American stocks, for example, were highly valued between 1970 and 2010 when inflation was low and vice versa.

Even though real stock returns decline as inflation rises - the bottom line has historically been positive as long as inflation has not exceeded 19 percent. So, on average, nominal stock returns have been higher than inflation. But this does not equate to an effective hedge against rising consumer prices (see above).

## 5. Less risk, more return

The more returns investors want to achieve, the higher the risks they have to take, is a widely accepted financial market theory. An empirical comparison of individual asset classes confirms this correlation. Since 1900, stocks have been the asset class with the highest return. At the same time, however, the risk measured in terms of volatility was also the highest. Government bonds of more than one year generated lower gains, but fluctuated less. Government bonds with maturities of less than one year, so-called money market paper, were the safest, but also the least lucrative.

However, if we look at individual countries within the equity asset class, the relationship between risk and return is no longer so clear. Rather, the data point in the opposite direction. In countries whose stock markets fluctuated comparatively less, investors tended to generate higher returns (see charts). A good third of the returns can be explained by volatility, as the regression analysis shows.

**Equity markets with low volatility tended to generate higher returns**

[Table on the linked website]

## 6. Dividends are the main source of return on shares in the long term.

Speculators hoping to make quick profits on the stock markets pay particular attention to the price performance of shares. In the short term, share prices can fluctuate enormously. Within a year, for example, a 40 percent gain or loss is possible.

But these capital gains and losses, which determine real stock returns in the short term, play only a minor role for serious investors who want to build up and increase their assets over the long term. The longer the investment period, the more important reinvested dividends become. According to calculations by financial market researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, dividend yields have contributed around 80 percent to total returns on the world stock market since 1900. In the U.S., it was about two-thirds, and in Germany it was as much as 100 percent, because the annual capital gain was negative at minus 0.23 percent.

---------------------------------------------------------

Specifically, this part confuses me:

&gt;Because the latter usually falls when inflation rates rise, investors demand higher risk premiums for stocks, which depresses their prices

Isn't the price (minus the risk-free interest) exactly the risk premium in case of stocks? I don't see how the risk premium can increase while the price decreases.

Also, while the text was updated in 2020 and the referenced study is from 2018, it feels like it disregards modern developments like tech companies. On the other hand, ""this time it's different"" might also apply here in the sense that current tech innovation might not be permanent growth guarantee just like innovation in the 20th century wasn't.",finance

personalfinance,Financial Advice! - Personal Loan OR Liquidate Stock Options/Fidelity Select Tech Fund,"Hi Friends,

Looking for some advice on this one.  Before getting to my actual question I thought it may be helpful to provide some context of what I'll be up against over the next 2 or so years.

I currently work as a Software Consultant and have been fortunate enough to earn a pretty good living.  My company also offers stock options which have done extraordinarily well over the last 4 years.   My wife (currently an ICU Nurse) is in school to get her Doctorate as a Nurse Anesthetist.  

In about a year from now she will have to quit her job as a nurse to start her final 2 year clinical rotation for the Doctorate program she's in.  Essentially we are losing all of her income for 2 years.

We also have 2 kids both of whom are currently in daycare and will remain in daycare for the 2 years that my wife is in school.  Not sure how many parents are out there but daycare tuition in the city we live in are absurdly expensive - to the tune of about $2,750/month OR about $66,000 for 2 full years (the amount of time my wife will have to quit her job and go full time in clinicals).

What I'm trying to strategize around is to how best to pay for the $66,000 in daycare expenses.  With my income I should be able to cover our mortgage and other expenses but won't be able to cover the daycare expenses solely from my income.

My question - do I look at taking a personal loan for ~$60,000 with an interest rate of anywhere between 8-12%?  Or do I consider liquidating my stock options to cover the cost for daycare.  In addition to the stock options that I have I also have enough money in my FSPTX (Fidelity Select Tech Fund) to cover the cost of daycare.  I also have enough in crypto investments to cover the daycare costs as well.

The company stock options, FSPTX Fund and Bitcoin investments have been absolute gold over the last couple of years with returns of anywhere from 20-50%+ each year.  I would hate to have to liquidate that money as I'd prefer to have it continue to work for me over the next 2 years.

However - the thought of taking out a loan/be in debt also sucks.  I think I know the answer to my question but really wanted to get some advice from other folks on here.

‚Äú[FuboTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV) ($FUBO) is an American streaming television service that focuses primarily on channels that distribute live sports, including NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer, plus news, network television series and movies.

Launched on January 1, 2015 as a soccer streaming service, FuboTV changed to an all-sports service in 2017 and then to a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) model. As a vMVPD, FuboTV still calls itself sports-first but its expanded channel lineup targets cord cutters, offering a selection of major cable channels and OTT-originated features that can be streamed through smart TVs, mobile and tablets and the web. The service is available in the United States, Canada and Spain as of 2018.""

From their [home](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome) page:

They are the only competitors in their space of digital sports broadcasting, offer 4K streaming and upscaling of live sports, cloud DVR capability ranging from 250 or 1000 hours on standard plans, and is available on Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox One, Android TV, Android Smart TVs, and Android/iOS smartphones and tablets, with plans ranging from $24.99/month to $79.99/month (not including add-ons).

The Latino Quarterly plan includes 250 hours of DVR space and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but only has 32 channels. This plan needs to be prepaid every 3 months for a total charge of $74.97 and does not offer a monthly service (*Channels page).*

Upgrades include additional DVR space--1000 hours for an additional $6.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly--and increased device casting--an additional 2 devices at home with 3 on the go for another $9.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly plans. You can also add a variety of channels and sports packages (the Latino Quarterly has fewer channel add-ons compared to the Family and Elite plans, which both have the same channel varieties). Sports Plus with NFL RedZone is an additional $10.99/month, but includes all professional and college sports broadcasting services for football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, fighting, etc. (*Channels page).*

Fubo has recently removed its former Standard plan, which included only 65 channels, up to 2 casting devices, and only 30 hours of DVR support for $60/month.

**Financials and Growth**

Fubo has yet to file an annual report as they have gone public in October of 2020, but they have filed a [10-Q](https://s21.q4cdn.com/819998841/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/16be93b6-1b43-471a-a81f-a8b07e43e47c.pdf) for Q3 2020. All numbers in thousands.

Assets-

Between December 31, 2019 and September of 2020, assets have increased from $368,225 to $799,313 (a 117% increase) . Total current assets increased from $17,973 to $58,016, but accounts receivable decreased from $8,904 to $6,975--this may be attributed to the increase in prepaid subscriptions which increased from $1,445 to $12,177 which shows strong customer satisfaction and retention.

Liabilities-

Liabilities have increased from $145,049 to $290,376 (a 100% increase). The largest contributors to their liabilities are ‚ÄúDue to related parties‚Äù increasing from $665 to $85,847, ‚ÄúWarrant liabilities‚Äù increasing from $24 to $28,085, and ‚ÄúAccounts payable‚Äù from $36,373 to $61,679. Long-term borrowings have decreased from $43,982 to $25,905.

Revenues-

Subscription revenues increased by $53,433, totaling $92,945 for the year. Total revenues including advertisements and licensing have increased by $61,202, totaling $112,669 for the year and an increase of 47% YOY. Q4 revenue is estimated to be between $94,000 and $98,000 which would be a 77-84% increase YOY.

Expenses-

Subscriber related expenses total $114,315 for the year. Total expenses have totaled $500,249 for the year.

Subscribers-

Ended Q3 with 455,000 paid subscribers, a YOY increase of 58%, and plans to end 2020 with over 545,000, an increase of 72% YOY.

**The vMVPD Sector**

Cord-cutting has become increasingly popular over the last few years with consumers dropping traditional cable and satellite networks in favor of streaming services--such as Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, etc.--and vMVPD services.

[In 2019 alone, 6.3 million people cut their cable connection, totaling 39.3 million. In a survey of what they might miss most from cable networks, 52% said they don‚Äôt miss anything, 23% missed live events on TV, 22% missed news, and 19% missed live sports](https://www.emarketer.com/content/most-cord-cutters-aren-t-missing-cable-tv)*.* Although not all of those that miss aspects of cable will pay for another subscription service, the sentiment exists for a sports-focused platform that offers other large networks as well.

[Another report by Parks Associates reveals that 17% of vMVPD subscribers switched from traditional TV within the last twelve months. In the same report, a survey conducted on current broadband households determined that 43% were ‚Äúlikely to switch to a‚Ä¶ vMVPD within the next 12 months](https://www.broadbandtechreport.com/video/article/14196415/report-examines-vmvpd-sector-growth-in-broadband-pay-tv-market)*.""* The potential growth exists for the live digital broadcasting space, although it is slowing down.

With the spread of COVID and quarantines, people have been spending more time at home. When things open and quarantines end, that will be the true test for these providers as people will spend less time watching TV.

**The Sports Betting Sector**

Legal sports betting has taken a huge leap in recent years with the introduction of online sports betting; the ability to place wagers from anywhere at any time and have instant gratification has boomed with its slow legalization. [This sector has a forecasted value of $150 billion with other competitors already having a completed project and vast market share. In 2019, DraftKings ($DKNG) and FanDuel (PDYPY) controlled 83% of the market share](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/27/fanduel-draftkings-race-to-win-150-billion-sports-betting-market.html).

[FuboTV plans to join into this space with its own sportsbook. Their recent acquisition of Balto Sports in December of 2020, whose business was in simulating fantasy sports games, is Fubo‚Äôs first step into sports wagering. They plan to create a free-to-play gaming system alongside online sports wagering](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201006185/en/fuboTV-Acquires-Balto-Sports-as-First-Step-Into-Online-Sports-Wagering-Market)*.*

[Their next planned acquisition, which was announced in January of 2021, will be to acquire Vigtory, a sports betting and interactive gaming company. According to BusinessWire, they plan to utilize Vigtory‚Äôs ‚Äúsportsbook platform and digital gaming assets, and its consumer-driven betting technology, to develop a frictionless betting experience for fubo‚Äôs customers](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005596/en/fuboTV-Accelerates-Development-of-Sportsbook).""

These recent acquisitions set Fubo up to create an all-in-one viewing and betting experience, which could add new customers to their subscriber list and seal them into online wagering.

[It has been over two years since the Supreme Court has denied the federal ban on sports betting, which would have made online betting illegal in all of the United States. Currently, more than two dozen states have legalized sports betting, but most have only legalized in-person betting. More states may be willing to legalize to take advantage of the increased revenues and taxes associated with gambling and online wagering. As of 2020, six additional states plan to legalize some form of betting, although some are only allowing in-person. There are an additional 14 states that are considering the notion to allow legal gambling, whether in-person, online, or tribal](https://www.actionnetwork.com/news/legal-sports-betting-united-states-projections).

**Management and Investors**

David Gandler - CEO / Director / Co-Founder

Appointed as CEO and director in April of 2020. Prior to Fubo, Gandler had a 15 year career in marketing and advertising in local broadcast and cable TV within both general and Hispanic markets at companies such as Time Warner, Telemundo, and Scripps Networks Interactive.

Alberto Horihuela - CMO / Co-founder

In charge of marketing, Horihuela was head of Latin America for SVOD service DramaFever.

Simone Nardi - CFO

Nardi has worked as SVP and CFO of Scripps Networks Interactive where he was responsible for the finance and strategic planning for the company‚Äôs international business. Was also a key player in refinancing TVN S.A.‚Äôs billion dollar debt.

Large Investors

* Islet Management, LP with 5,108124 shares
* Morgan Stanley with 3,317,333 shares
* FMR LLC with 1,262,907 shares
* BlackRock Inc. with 956,678 shares
* Merger with FaceBank for $100 million revolving credit

**Analysts and Estimates**

Average analyst ratings put Fubo at a Buy to Strong Buy rating with an average price target of $45.50 with a high of $60 and a low of $30. EPS estimates are estimated to be -5.23 for 2020 and -1.64 for 2021.

Currently has a short float of about 75%, but the short volume has been holding at roughly 15-20% over the last month and has drastically declined from its October short volume of over 50%.

Originally valued at $700 million less than a year ago, a current valuation of $3.19 billion is respectable for this company and is on par for its current performance.

**Risks**

* Marketing fails and Fubo is never known as a household name, so consumers stick with other more known providers
* Their sportsbook fails and becomes dead weight and wasted money
* Subscriber count and streaming drops as quarantine lifts, reducing revenues while maintaining expenses
* Consumers opt for cheaper options
* People paying for the sports package cancel when the season is over, creating a boom and bust cycle if not managed correctly

**Final Thoughts / TL;DR**

With its drastic growth over the last year (400% in the last 4 months), support from FaceBank and well-known investors, and plans to join the sports betting sector, FuboTV has potential to become a household name and grow well beyond its current valuation by combining both sports broadcasting and online sports betting into one convenient place. Although unlikely to overthrow any of the current forces, it can become the best live sports broadcaster that people can turn to when they cut cable but want to keep live sports. It has many hurdles to overcome (creating their sportsbook, better marketing, increasing subscriber count, etc.) before it is any real competition to its already established competition.

At a $3.19 billion market cap and very high (75%) short interest, it will be very difficult to realize consistent growth, but it is on par for a company with almost $100 million in revenue.

**My Position**

25 shares at $47.30

personalfinance,Need some help navigating my 1099-R and 2020 RIRA's/TIRA's using TurboTax,"In 2020 my wife and I's MAGI was too high to directly contribute to our ROTH IRA accounts.  To get around this we used the backdoor Roth conversion method.  I'm having a hard time navigating through TurboTax's prompts when I go in to enter my 1099-R.

In 2020 I put $6,000 in my TIRA account and then used the backdoor Roth conversion method to get it into my RIRA account.  TurboTax is taxing me on the $6,000 even though I already paid taxes on this money already (the money came out of my already-taxed bank account) and is showing that I owe a large amount in federal taxes because of it.  I know I need to tell TurboTax that I shouldn't get taxed on this $6,000 but I don't think I've gotten to those prompts yet.

After filling out my 1099-R information under the ""Wages &amp; Income"" section I get the two prompts below asking me if I rolled or converted any of the money reported on my 1099-R into a RIRA account.  According to my RIRA Form 5498 I converted $6,575.86.

[https://imgur.com/flRyQiQ](https://imgur.com/flRyQiQ)

&amp;#x200B;

The next prompt asks me if I converted all of it, to which I say, ""Yes, all of this money was converted to a Roth IRA"".

[https://imgur.com/vMYlCw5](https://imgur.com/vMYlCw5)

Now it gets trickier... After completing these two prompts and hitting continue I get 5 more prompts.  See next section below.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here are the 5 prompts I get:

Prompt #1: [https://imgur.com/JXhEjbq](https://imgur.com/JXhEjbq)

Note that prompt #1 is asking about 2019 non-deductible contributions.  I included my 2019 Form 8606 information at the bottom of this post.

Prompt #5: [https://imgur.com/FecImZa](https://imgur.com/FecImZa)

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm most confused about prompts #2, 4, and 5.**  I don't understand why its asking me about a re-characterization at all, I thought a backdoor Roth was a conversion? 

After I complete this I'm sure I'll have more questions but this is the start.  I believe I will be telling TurboTax about the non-deductible $6000 in the ""Deductions &amp; Credits"" section.  I'll make a new post once I'm past the ""Income &amp; Credits"" section.

financialindependence,How do you think a $15 an hour minimum wage would affect FIRE for you?,"Please keep this a financial discussion with possibly some social discussion, but absolutely no political discussion, thank you.

I do have feelings about if this should/ needs to happen, but I‚Äôm more interested in what people think the ramifications of it will be to them regarding FIRE. For me I live in a low cost of living area, but work in a higher COL area. This has both allowed me to save more each year, but also plan on spending less post FIRE. My state is one of many that still uses the federal $7.25 min wage, and my understanding is that many jobs in my area do pay less then $10. Because of this I could see the COL in my area going up significantly if this was to change. This would obviously also change my FIRE number, and I don‚Äôt see that investments would necessarily increase at the same rate. If you are still working you might see a pay increase, but if you are making say above $50k a year I wouldn‚Äôt count on it. Still not the end of the world, since you still adjust your time frame to RE. But if one had already FIRE‚Äôd I could see this being a much bigger deal, possibly even bigger then a bad ‚Äúsequence of returns‚Äù event at the beginning of retirement.
Now this is for me living in a LCOL area, I‚Äôm guessing that those that live, and plan to stay living in a HCOL area will see far less effect from this. But it will be interesting to see. What are other‚Äôs thoughts on this?
The above was what I originally posted on Saturday, and had it automoderated down, after some suggestions I‚Äôm resubmitting with the added info.  

While I was thinking of this a bit more abstractly, I did have a suggestion to mention some of the specifics since there is an actual bill in play. I think this a good run down of the bill in the house. https://edlabor.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2021-01-26%20Raise%20the%20Wage%20Act%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf
And coincidentally today the CBO released there analysis of the effects said bill would have on the economy. Quite a bit of the analysis seems to be more about the overall economy, but it does bring up the costs of goods going up.

By Sonali Basak  
(Bloomberg) -- Michael Novogratz, the founder of  
cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital, sees Bitcoin more  
than doubling to $100,000 by the end of the year, spurred higher  
as more companies allow customers to use the token to make  
purchases.  
The coin jumped to an all-time high of $44,795 Monday after  
Tesla Inc. said it had bought $1.5 billion of the token with  
corporate cash reserves. The company also said it will allow  
customers to buy its electric cars with the coins.  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see every company in America do the same  
thing,‚Äù Novogratz said Monday in a Bloomberg Television  
interview. Between corporations adding Bitcoin to treasury funds  
and the city of Miami also considering adding the cryptocurrency  
to its balance sheet, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be a lot. It‚Äôs the  
messaging that matters, you‚Äôre seeing the herd here, and it‚Äôs  
coming.‚Äù  
The long-time crypto enthusiast and investor also  
speculated that other companies would consider moving excess  
reserves into Bitcoin, perhaps as a hedge against inflation or  
against a falling dollar.  
Novogratz said Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù in his  
decision to ‚Äúlisten to the people,‚Äù or weighing the interests of  
a rising generation. ‚ÄúOne of the things that connect Bitcoin,  
and Tesla and solar stocks and ESG investing is millennials and  
Gen Z, young people are buying into the future, and they see  
cryptocurrencies -- Bitcoin and other currencies -- as their  
currencies,‚Äù he said.  
MicroStrategy Inc.‚Äôs Michael Saylor, among the first to put  
cash into the cryptocurrency, said in September that the Federal  
Reserve‚Äôs relaxing of its inflation policy helped convince him  
to invest the enterprise-software maker‚Äôs reserves.  
But Bitcoin‚Äôs famed volatility -- it plunged 25% in two  
days last month -- has made it difficult for usually risk-averse  
CFOs to make it a regular part of corporate treasuries.  
‚ÄúNow you got the biggest, the wealthiest man in the world  
and one of the biggest stories doing it,‚Äù Novogratz said.  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to think other CFOs and CEOs are saying, what should  
we be doing?‚Äù",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Looking for advice as first time buyer on HCOL Condos in this climate,"Long story short, just ended a 5 year relationship (had a ring/ready to propose which she wanted until recently) and we had plans to buy a starter home in Orange County ~$750K ($100K/down each) 3bd/2bth. We were looking for the past 8 months but our timing with COVID, low inventory, and low interest rates really made it difficult as we watched ourselves get priced out of some of the better areas.

I'm now in a situation where I'm 36 and feel like I should buy a place to restart my life, but with $100K down I'm basically looking at 2bd/2bth condos.

Annual income is $110K/gross + ~10% Bonus + $10K Equity

* $100k Savings (for down payment)

* $230k Investments (would only liquidate for emergencies, capital gains taxes/etc.)

* $114K Roth IRA

* $237K 401K

* Net take home excl. bonus/equity is ~$5.2K after HSA/401K contributions against ~$2.1K in monthly expenses ($1100/rent and ~$1K food/entertainment/misc) = ~$3K monthly buffer currently

* I rent a room in a nice $1M+ home with 2 other older gentlemen (55+), but now in my 30s and entering the dating pool again feel like it's a bit weird. Main reason I was here was because ex was getting her masters and living at home rent free, and we decided to save as much money as possible for a house when she graduated.

I'm looking at condos with an all in monthly payment (mortgage + HOA + Insurance + Taxes) of ~$2.5K in more desirable areas where it would be easy to rent a 2nd room (Irvine, Costa Mesa, Tustin).

The main reason I'm hesitant on buying is because of how insane the market is over the past year with COVID/Low interest rates... not sure if it's smart to buy a 2bd $500K condo at this point plus the additional $300-$400 HOA.
Plus side is low interest rates, but I expect home prices to drop if interest rates go up as well..

Alternative option is finding a roomate more around my age to rent a 2bd apartment for now (~$2.2K apt), but I feel like if I'm going to have a roomate anyways buying a condo and renting out a room makes more sense? I plan on living there at least 5 years.

Just trying to get some other people's perspective, it's kind of scary jumping into such a big purchase like this, thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on paying off CC debt,"OK so it's the same ole classic story you've been hearing from many posters....I was young and dumb and stupid and now I have credit card debt. Lucky for me- the past two years my income has gone up significantly and I've paid off a significant amount of debt as well as learned to budget and mostly importantly- stopped my impulsive spending habits. Now I just use my debt card/cash for spending. I most recently paid off a personal loan!!! The more I payoff, the more motivated I feel to keep doing it. I have also watched my credit score slowly but surely rise to 730 which has been rewarding. The biggest thing affecting my credit seems to be my high credit utilization ratio- so just another reason to pay off my debt! I also picked up a second job and have been putting every last cent of that toward my debt. Now I have one credit card left to pay off- it is my lowest APR which is why I've just been paying minimums to pay off the other stuff first. But now it's time to face it- my balance of about 16K. I have a plan to pay it off within the year-- BUT of course that would mean eating a bunch of money in interest. I'm prepared to do that- it just is the consequence of my own stupidity in past years. But after looking over this sub and reading some other posts I decided to look at some options in ways I could save on that interest potentially. Worst case scenario- it stays as is and I still get it paid off fairly quickly. 

Here is what I have tried so far:

\-Balance transfer. I was denied due to ""revolving debt as a percentage of available credit lines"". I tried to get a balance transfer card with 0% APR for 20 months- I'd be able to pay it off no problem in that time but obviously that plan is done now that they denied.

\-Called my bank to ask for a lower APR on the credit card. Even tried two people. They both said no, they don't do that on existing cards. :(

So, now what I'm thinking is getting a personal loan. I just worry because some places seem so....sketchy. My credit card APR is 16.65%. Is it reasonable to find a personal loan with lower interest rate or is that not a thing? I did get some offers suggested to me from NerdWallet based on my credit score that were for like 7%- from places called Sofi and Upstart but I get scared about trusting these places. I haven't actually fully applied for these loans so haven't read the terms and conditions. Does anyone know of anything about these places and if it's actually worth it to apply to them? Or have other suggestions on what I could do? Or is the best thing to just continue with my plan of throwing all my money at this and pay it off this year?

personalfinance,Should I look into refinancing my house if I don't think I'm going to live here that long?,"I bought my house in 2018 for $73k with $3k down. 

Current rate is 4.125% and I have ~$65k left on the loan. Current payments are $625.03 (including taxes, insurance, &amp; PMI) but I round it up to $700 to put more towards the principal.

I'm currently paying PMI of about $40 a month and it small but it annoys the crap out of me. I'm sure the house is worth more now (it was worth more then, but I bought from family so I got a p good deal) so I think a refi would remove that. 

Also my credit score is 800+ so I'm assuming I could get a much lower interest rate, altho I'm not sure who the best company is to go with. 

My problem is, I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to be here so I'm not sure it's worth the closing costs and I don't know what to do. I'll likely be here at least another year, and there is some question of my mom renting if I leave, in which case I'd have the house for minimum a few years but that's all uncertain and I'm just not sure what the best thing to do is.

Bitcoin,Is Tesla's purchase of $1.5B BTC really a good thing?,"I think the news about Tesla buying $1.5 billion in BTC is honestly really bad news. The skeptic in me thinks that this is just a quick way for Tesla to raise a metric fuckton of cash really quickly as Tesla could have easily made a killing just based on the pump in price today, and even more if they are willing to speculate in the near-term. At the end of the day, BTC is a *speculative* asset and I personally wouldn't want to be a large public company w/ shareholders to report to if/when the game of hot potato ends and you are left holding a fraction of your initial investment in BTC. Elon has quite a history w/ the SEC and the crypto market is, frankly, the one spot that the SEC can't really get him on anything right now due to the lack of regulations in the space ([especially BTC](https://www.investopedia.com/news/sec-chair-says-bitcoin-not-security/)). He can literally say almost whatever he wants w/ no repercussions whatsoever. 

I also can't help but think that the timing of this move is a bit suspect as well: Why now? Why not a year ago when the price of BTC was still growing, but at a substantially lower price point? Risking a couple hundred bucks on something that sort of looks like a bubble is one thing; risking $1.5 billion is another thing entirely. My hunch is that they are not as long as they say they are on BTC.

Elon hyping/pumping up DOGE at least makes sense: It had a very low value and great ""meme potential"" (read as marketability) and is consistent w/ Elon's meme lord persona; IE a perfect storm for a pump from the internet's most wealthy meme dealer. For Elon (who almost certainly has skin in the DOGE game), it is the easiest returns that he will get in his life: He sends a couple of tweets and the value of DOGE goes up almost 8 fold. Rinse, wash, repeat, and deleverage his holdings in DOGE for massive profits. For everyone else, we are left waiting w/ bated breath for him (or some other celebrity figure) to send another tweet and reaffirm the price of DOGE. Who knows what will happen to the price w/out reaffirmation? The question is ultimately how long does Tesla/Elon plan on holding on to BTC/DOGE, respectively. According to Tesla's recent SEC submission ([link here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm)), the plans to actually adopt BTC don't seem to be near final and the duration they plan on holding BTC doesn't seem to really be clear either. Not that any of that matters though. Also, note that the document says that Tesla may end up liquidating any/all BTC after receiving it as payment. Consider what liquidating every BTC that goes into Tesla would to the sell-sided market on BTC exchanges. That is a whole lot sell orders on the market if Tesla keeps selling cars at the rate that it has been.

Yes, adoption is good for the utility of the currency; that is a no brainer. More opportunities to actually spend BTC on real goods/services is a great thing that helps BTC live up to its role as an alternative global currency. I would love to live in a world where I could just walk into the grocery store and pull out a card tied to my BTC wallet to pay for groceries or to buy a hat at a local business w/ BTC.

However, at a fundamental level, the accumulation/centralization of vast amounts of BTC by large corporate entities should be a concerning trend as it antithetical to BTC's decentralized promise. Replacing the fed w/ a handful of large corporate owners as the primary issuer of a currency is only slightly more decentralized than what we were working with before. The Federal Reserve at least has to be somewhat transparent about their impact on the money supply; large corporate entities w/ BTC, not so much.

Apple is making it almost impossible for Facebook and other apps to get 3P conversion data i.e. did customer purchase the product on nike app after they clicked on the Nike Ad? This data is what allows advertisers to truly measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. This conversion data is fed into MachineLearning algorithms which makes the targeting better and allows Facebook and other social media companies to show relevant ads. Personalized ads also helps to keep small apps free of charge. These free apps might need to change their business model unless they can survive on non-personalized ads.

The market is pricing in the impact of this change to FB but I'm not sure if it's pricing this in to shopify, snapchat and other similar businesses that rely on personalized ads. Shopify sellers use personalized ads to drive traffic to their niche products. Going forward, it's going to become difficult for these small businesses on Shopify to acquire new users. What do you all think?

Facebook and Apple war was inevitable if you've been paying attention. Apple made a shift to services in 2015 after slow growth in hardware sales. Apple saw how much money Facebook et al were making on mobile app install ads and felt entitled to a cut of it. Facebook app has been getting bigger every year with more apps and services into Facebook like Games, Instant Articles and it has started to look like an app store. See [https://mobiledevmemo.com/coming-war-apple-facebook/](https://mobiledevmemo.com/coming-war-apple-facebook/)

Apple's own apps are exempt from this which gives them an unfair advantage over their competitors. Right now they are just blatantly privileging themselves by allowing their own apps to track users without the prompt. This is just another example of Apple holding themselves to a different standard when it comes to ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù.

personalfinance,Uninvested Vanguard IRA - how can I clean this mess up?,"In [continuing my story of finance illiteracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lbl89d/prioritising_contribs_to_hsa_vs_401k_wo_matching/), I just found out that I have about $500 in an Acorns IRA from tiny \~$5 contributions from 2019 through 2021, and $11k in a Vanguard Traditional IRA from lump sum max contributions in 2017 and 2019. In addition to not having contributed in 2018 (for no real reason other than not knowing what I was doing), the Vanguard funds are all in a Federal Money Market (Settlement fund) account. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, this is where funds are kept to then be invested, but I never did invest.

A few questions:

1. Should I invest in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund?
2. If so, what fund would you recommend considering I‚Äôm hoping to retire around 2045/50 but currently grossly behind plan? (Perhaps [VTIVX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTIVX) or [VFIFX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VFIFX)?)
3. Should I aim to max out my IRA for 2020? (Emergency fund secured, no debt, 401k but no matching)
4. Should I rollover my Acorns IRA into Vanguard?",finance

Bitcoin,Cold storage wallet v. Exchange with Interest,"I‚Äôm relatively new to cryptocurrency. I have only been trading for about 3 months now but when I started I jumped in balls deep. For security reasons I decided to get a cold storage wallet to store the bulk of my BTC. Now, I‚Äôm seeing that a few exchanges are offering interest rates if you store your BTC and other crypto on their apps. I‚Äôm hesitant to do this because a relative of mine had a significant amount of crypto stolen from an account last year but I‚Äôm also experiencing FOMO with all the crypto that I‚Äôm not earning interest on. WHAT TO DO? üò´

investing,Second Quarter Results: 6 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and the average return was 72% (37% as a portfolio),"Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, there was interest in seeing the quarterly performance of everyone's picks

The first quarter can be seen here: [http://redd.it/jti14m/](http://redd.it/jti14m/)

For this quarter, the key takeaways are as follows:

* Overall average return of 72.2% (driven by the GME pick)
* If you invested equally in each stock, returns would have been 41.9%, or if you bought one of each stock, returns would have been 37.5%
* 86% of the 254 picks have shown a positive return, with 80% greater than 10% return and 20% greater than 100% return
* Highest returning pick: Gamestock (GME) at 1342% flagged by  /u/EmployerOfTheMonth, to which they stated *""If it goes up, people will think I'm some sort genius for going against the crowd, if it goes down, people will just mindly brush me off as a moron for actually thinking this was underrated""*
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen an average return of 62%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 93%
* If you had invested equally in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 53.1%

In graphical format, you can also see the results here: [https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png](https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png)

# For those who keep asking for another round of tracking underrated stocks, I'll add a comment below to collect new picks to monitor.  Happy to update you on a similar cadence.

As a reminder, please do not interpret results seen here as an endorsement of the investing prowess of the community. Invest at your own risk.

For those also interested, there was a stock picking survey back in October of 2018.  That overall portfolio is up 58% with an average return of 138% (driven by the triple digit gains in Enpahse and Tesla).  You can see the original picks in my history; happy to provide an update on that one if there is interest.",finance

personalfinance,Best Way to Pay Capital Gains Taxes?,"I recently made a decent bit of money off a stock (if you're on reddit you can probably guess which). It was about $20k. I am in the 22% tax bracket, so I should owe about another $4400 in taxes. My questions is what would be the best way to pay this? I sold in 2021, so I have a year to deal with it, but I am fairly new to investing and have never had to deal with capital gains before. I also know there is a penalty (\~3.4% I believe) for underpaying taxes and I would prefer not to pay an additional penalty (last year I got a $900 refund so I assume I will have that as a cushion). I also have state taxes to pay (do you owe state taxes on capital gains?) I see my options as:

1. Adjust my withholding from work to pay extra each paycheck (how many exemptions should I remove, or should I just have and additional $300 taken out each month?)
2. Make a quarterly tax payment of $4400 now or something close to that (I don't know how to do this, but I've seen it as an option).
3. Set some money aside (\~$5000) to have available for taxes when I file next year (ie. deal with it when I file 2021 taxes). This would likely end with me paying the 3.4% penalty 
   1. Use the money to pay off debts with a higher interest rate (car loan and personal loan), and deal with taxes next year (pay the penalty, start a payment plan to pay the taxes, or save money that would have went toward debt payments over the year to save money for the tax payment).

I'm leaning toward 3/3.1 but wondered if anyone could offer some advice. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Lost on how to maximize new income,"I just graduated college and I am starting a new job, so I am trying to figure the best way forward financially. The role has zero benefits in the first year, so I was looking at getting some cheap insurance from the marketplace such as this [catastrophic plan](https://content.carefirst.com/sbc/AHHVCN0HRXCVCN73N012021.pdf), although I don‚Äôt know if I can keep that after I turn 30 later this year. The employer doesn‚Äôt have 401k match, so I planned to put $500 into my Roth IRA as my retirement contributions for the year. 

Post tax Income: $51,000

**Assets**
Savings: $5,000
401k: $52,000
Roth IRA: $6,000

**Debt**
Federal Loans: $62,000 (currently 0%, normally a mix of 3-6%)
Private Loan: $5,200 (3.75%)

Current Monthly Expenses: 1500 + health insurance (minimum of $200)
Loan Payments: $700

I want to make sure I am taking the right steps financially now that I am finally in my first job in my career field. Should I try to aggressively pay down the private loan during forbearance period, should I save money and then do lump sum payment on Federal loan before interest rates go up, or should I just stay on the 10 year plan (starting this year) and put money into investments?

Also, would it be smart to throw an extra 1k into my Roth from last year being I plan to maximize the contribute in 2021? Any other insights or thoughts on things I might be overlooking would be greatly appreciated.",finance

Bitcoin,Remember Musk changed money before!,"Hear me out from an objective standpoint. Think of it as a movie script. After you've read this script let it sink in, then comment.

All of Elon Musk's entrepreneurial endeavors are geared toward establishing a new country on mars that is self sustaining, self governing. Recognized or not, no one will be able to do anything about it. Nobody has the physical means to.

He will break away from earth and leave all that is twisted about today's society behind.

Bitcoin is one of the tools to make the martian utopia happen. That is why he is on board.

At first in his earlier years, Elon has tried to make earth a better place by revolutionising money, transportation, energy, communication, ...

Really tried hard. More than any of us. He was rewarded for that in being the richest fella on this rock. 

He's been ridiculed, mocked, opposed, scoffed,... But there he is. 

Some time ago, he had enough, that is when he started the starship project.

There was some event in his life that made him decide and realize that this society is a sinking ship and nobody can do anything about it anymore. Not even him. It will run itself to the ground.

He gets it. We are just trying to fill out pockets as much as we can, running round like ants, going nowhere and with no other goal letting our ego's blow up.


The implication of a breakaway society on mars however is that almost no one will be able (or even allowed) to be part of the first settlers. This will leave us here in turmoil for decades to come.

Society WILL fall, because of greedy self destructive evil men and women coupled with limited vision and vast resources. There is no evidence that beyond propaganda and populism anything is actually changing for the better. It gets worse every year, election, protest, ....

The upside is that all of what Elon will achieve on mars in the meantime, will eventually trickle down to earth and change humanity for ever. It will take decades to get a smooth running society up there. 

Once humanity has all but destroyed itself, we will be looking around in the dust, thinking all this makes no sense anymore. Finally the rest of us will wake up and think what have we been doing, what was the point of all this nonsense.

Slowly we will start to implement the societal model mars implemented.

Bitcoin is the cornerstone to societal transition. That is why Elon Musk is on board.",cryptocurrency

&gt; # 1. Dow set to dip after six-session win streak

&gt; * U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday, taking a pause after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 rose for their sixth straight sessions and the Nasdaq did so for its third session in a row. All three benchmarks logged record-high closes. February‚Äôs blistering gains ahead of Tuesday‚Äôs trading on Wall Street sent the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq up nearly 4.7%, 5.4% and 7%, respectively.

&gt; # 2. Trump‚Äôs second impeachment trial to begin in Senate

&gt; * Former President Donald Trump faces the start of his second impeachment trial, an uphill battle for Democrats determined to prove him guilty for inciting last month‚Äôs deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, experts see acquittal as the likely outcome. Out of office for nearly three weeks, the one-term Republican president, ensconced at his Florida home, still commands the support of swaths of the party and the loyalty of many GOP lawmakers, who largely doubt the legality of the trial itself. The trial is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET.

&gt; # 3. CBO says federal minimum wage of $15 would cost jobs

&gt; * Raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour in annual increments to $15 per hour, as President Joe Biden has proposed, would cost 1.4 million jobs over the next four years while lifting 900,000 people out of poverty, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The hike would add to the budget deficit, which could help Democrats pull the issue into the budget reconciliation process. Doing so could enable the Democrats to pass Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus approach with no Republican votes. As part of the pandemic relief effort, House Democrats on Monday proposed a faster income phase-out for the next round of direct payments checks.

&gt; * An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization said Tuesday the search for how the coronavirus was introduced remains a ‚Äúwork in progress,‚Äù but the ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù pathway was indeed from animals to humans. Scientists have been working for the past four weeks in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. The team dismissed a leak from a lab, saying that such theories should be regarded as ‚Äúextremely unlikely.‚Äù

personalfinance,What to do with escrow money? Pay off Home Improvements or Principal on Refinanced Loan?,"We just refinanced our home after 4 years of payments to drop PMI,  and lower interest rate by 1%, which lowered the monthly house payment. However, that did restart our 30 year clock which I am putting down the $200.00 I saved from the old payment as principal towards the new loan. Because we refinanced in October, we had a surplus of $4800.00 from escrow from the old account that was mailed to us as a check. I verified with the current lender than my next escrow analysis will not occur before November and that the money my current loan is taking out for escrow will cover house insurance and property tax. The question I have is what should I do with that escrow surplus. Should I put it towards the principal of the house so that I pay off the house faster (interest rate of 2.5%), or should I put some of it towards final payments of new doors/windows (final cost 2400.00, 7.99% interest rate) instead?",finance

Apparantly lot of users have sent money, bank confirmed the transaction, but the money has never arrived. No response from CoinBase support at all. I dont know whats going on but is there any advice you can give me? Could CoinBase be just a ponzi scheme?

This is problem which many people have since the 2021 began.

Is there any way I will see the money? There are people who got their transfers canceled (after 10+ business days), but the money have not been refunded back to the bank ACC. Some people claims that CoinBase suspended their ACC just for trying to get answer from support (They made multiple tickers with no answer)

/edit I might have overreacted. Its a lot of money for me.

/edit 2; Money arrived on the account I have sent money from. Apparantly my name on my ACC did not match my name on Coinbase (No idea why).

personalfinance,Student loans late payments suddenly disappeared from credit report and I don't know why.,"I tried asking this in r/studentloans and didn't get a response.


 So I checked my credit report this morning and it jumped almost 50 points out of nowhere. Dug deeper and realized that my late payments from student loans were removed from it.

As is the story with many of us, some confusion about deferment dates led to several months of late payments that were each counted 3x/each because of the backwards way that student loans are set up so it killed my score.


Has this happened to anyone else? Was there a new rule that was implemented by the biden adminstration or by the credit bureaus that I missed or is this a mistake that I can expect to return to the way it was before soon enough?


I knew they were deferred through March and Biden is pushing to extend through September. That's why I was wondering if maybe I missed something. 

The late payments were in 2019. 

All are federal loans. 

I have not paid on them for as long as the payments have been deferred. 

I'm only basing this off of free credit reporting services (CK, My banks app, and my capitol one CC), and I know they aren't always the best source even though they are helpful. But all three I check are saying the same thing, which they usually do.",finance

personalfinance,"26 Years Old with Student Loans, Question About What to Do With My $$","Hello all,

I am 26 and have about $54,000 left on my student loans. They are federal with interest rates of around 4.5%. I have been making steady payments since I graduated. I have freezed payments since interest rates are at zero. Prior to that kicking back in, I intend to throw a significant amount of $$ at the loans to trim them down. I want to leave myself with around $10,000 in savings and then continue to pay the loans down month by month.

Specifically,

* I have around $40,000 in my savings account, accumulated since student loan interest rate freeze.
* I make around $55k per year
* Fiance makes around $85k per year and has $$ saved for house down payment, etc. He maxes his Roth IRA and 401k, no HSA offered. We will be on my healthcare plan when we're married.
* I currently contribute to my 401k to get company match, but that is my only retirement investing
* Company offers HSA and contributes $700/year toward it. I do not currently contribute too much to it. Just a few hundred dollars a year.
* Our living expenses are reasonable and our cars are paid off. He has no student loans.

My questions:

* If I want to maintain an emergency fund of around $10,000, would it be reasonable to contribute $6,000 to a Roth IRA for 2020 tax year and leave it uninvested (ie- liquid) for the time being? By the time student loan interest unfreezes in October, I'll definitely have $30k + to put toward loans and &gt; $10k in emergency fund. Within the next year and change, I hope to be able to accrue enough $$ to put additional money in for 2021 tax year to Roth IRA. I may not invest the Roth IRA $$ right away so I can put significant $$ toward loans and feel comfortable having some ""liquid"" money in the event I need it (would still maintain some money in a bank account for first access). Reason we would consider this is that the Roth IRA is obviously a great retirement vehicle and I am limited on how much I can put toward it each year and so I figured it might be smart to get the $$ in there. Worst case scenario, if I needed to touch that money and it was uninvested for the time being, I could. So it acts a lot like my emergency fund while I need it.
* I think I should prioritize contributing the max to my HSA this year? Obviously at some point, we'll dip into that $$ for healthcare expenses and we may not always be on the HDHP plan, so it could be good to get some money in there.

Sorry if this is a sort of confusing situation. Just basically wondering if it is an unreasonable thing to do to have $$ put into a Roth IRA uninvested just to get my $6k in while I can. I am confident in the future, I would have the income to continue getting my 401k match, maxing out Roth IRA and HSA. Just for the short term, I have a student loan situation I am getting out of.",finance
cardano,How would credit systems work in decentralized blockchain networks like Cardano?,"Hey all, I'm still a little new to blockchain and have really enjoyed learning about Cardano's approach to the problem space.

I was trying to imagine a credit system being implemented in blockchain, but kept getting tripped up on the decentralized aspect.

If person A doesn't pay a loan, traditionally-speaking their credit is dinged and person A might have a hard time getting a loan again later (or pay higher interest rates, etc.). Except on a decentralized network, how do you keep track of person A? And how do you make sure person B isn't person A, etc.?

I can see credit systems working when an entity / company / org owns the entire network. For example, let's say Equifax has their own blockchain network. They onboard you using IRL identity and only they have access to add to the ledger, so they can keep track of who's who. Maybe American Express has their own crypto coin (and thus maintain their own blockchain network) and are able to contact Equifax's network to lookup credit history or even request that a new credit event be recorded (e.g. person A opens a crypto coin loan).

But in a purely decentralized network (like Cardano), where not one entity runs it, would a credit system like this even work?",cryptocurrency

defi,Clever DeFi ‚Äì Creating Better DeFi for a Better World,"https://i.redd.it/9ruz1majchg61.jpg

The name of Clever DeFi has already been quite prevalent in the world of cryptocurrency and finance. Built by Bryan Legend, an Australian entrepreneur, the platform aims to change the whole scenario of financing throughout the world.

The features and components available in the DeFi platform are quite sophisticated and sublime. Thus, to operate it, you might need a small amount of know-how in the technical aspects. But, once you are familiar with it, everything will be a piece of cake for you.

The Clever DeFi, in essence, is pretty unique in its own accord. Hence, its advantages will be somewhat different than any other common DeFi platform as well. So, let‚Äôs take a look at them.

¬∑¬†No Permission ‚Äì¬†You will not require any type of permission or provide official paperwork to enter the world of Clever DeFi. Thus, you are not going to be confused about anything at all. The account creation procedure is pretty simple and straightforward, as well. Hence, if you do end up making any mistake, you can always correct it quickly.

¬∑¬†Long-Term ‚Äì¬†As per reports, the mechanism of Clever DeFi will last for around 888 cycles, which constitutes almost 34 years. If you are considering opting for something long-term, this platform will be ideal for you. Also, the interest rate is pretty higher, as well. Thus, it can become a continual source of income for you.

¬∑¬†No Initial Withholding ‚Äì¬†During the initial of the minting period, the company owner will not hold any token at all. Hence, the whole procedure will continue smoothly, without any unethical action. Moreover, the organization will also provide 01% interest every fortnight during the interest distribution period.

personalfinance,Co-worked changed W-4 now no Federal Taxes coming out?,"So a co-worker of mine decided to change his W-4 for the new tax year. He makes about $55K, his wife, about $40K. He used the new method to calculate his W-4 for the new year and was looking forward to seeing if his taxes would go up or down. Got paid, his pay stub shows NO federal taxes coming out.  FYI - he works for the fed'l gov't if that has anything to do with it. He has 2 kids and has the 4K child tax credit.

So what this couple did was change the W-4 so taxes come out of her paycheck and he gets the 4K credit. Is that why no taxes came out?  Is he gonna get paid without taxes coming out until the 4K child credits are used up?  I'm thinking not but with the tax changes maybe that's how it works?

Glad he looked now so if it is wrong, he won't have to pay taxes in one big lump sum at the end of the year.

Holding money in fiat is increasingly trending towards simply losing money. As the FED prints more and more, our dollars are rapidly losing purchasing power. 

This isn't a post calling for people to go all-in on crypto, rather it's arguing that it's actually *smart* to invest (hedge) some into what may soon be a less risky investment than the dollar itself. I'd say that right now I feel more comfortable holding a majority of my assets in crypto rather than the dollar. 

We see large (very large) institutions looking at Bitcoin as a store of value, and it seems that the Tesla news could be the first domino of many to fall as large companies look to hedge against the dollar.

If corporate interest hold TOO much Bitcoin, and BTC is the new ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù then THEY control markets and governments. ***Corporations start controlling the value of the dollar. 
before, Government owned a majority stake in gold to back the dollar, those days are long gone. 
The US government would have to OWN a majority of BTC for it to be a standard against the value of the dollar. i.e. The **federal reserve would have to BUY BTC to balance power between governments and corporations. 

What I‚Äôm seeing is a bunch of old people running Congress and the senate, who didn‚Äôt even know what Reddit was, let alone the future implications of BTC on governments/dollar value.

The danger is, corporations would own the dollar, NOT governments (USA i. Our case). It‚Äôs not a standard if 1 or 2 company‚Äôs can just SELL a huge stake of BTC and effect market value. That becomes oligarchy and power to the corporate interest, which ever it maybe.

personalfinance,Spending/Financial Minimalism?,"Is there such a thing as spending or financial minimalism? I hate clutter and in most aspects of my life, I've found ways to keep everything I own in good shape, organized, and simple. But my financial life is not the same.

My financial overview (feel free to skip): I make 50/yr and haven't had a raise in over two years and before that didn't get a raise in four years. I know that the cost of living goes up every year and I need to be more vocal about requesting these raises. But beyond earning more, I feel like I look at my bank account transactions and just see clutter. Additionally, I spent part of my early 20's accumulating some credit card debt that I am determined to eliminate. I consolidated the cc debt with a private loan, but I am kicking myself for replacing my broken computer (a necessity for an intensive computer science course I am currently paying to take) and putting the additional balance on my credit card again. I paid off my private student loans, but still have federal. I've been playing around with a stock app and have seen some decent gains this past year. Some very smart people have told me I'm at the age where I should be looking at a Roth IRA. I don't typically buy a lot of things; most of my splurges are ubers to work, uberEats, and my local deli. 

Back to the idea of financial minimalism. The general minimalism route is to put everything in a big pile and to keep what holds value for me. But with finances, I can't just say this cc debt doesn't spark joy, so I'll just throw it in the garbage. Everything in my jumbled financial pile holds value not for me but over me, in that I am required to address each of them. 

Spending minimalism on the other hand just seems pretty self evidently a good idea. Track what you spend and try to stick within a budget. Cut out subscriptions. Stop using credit cards. (general question: is it ok to close credit card accounts or will that have a negative impact on credit score?) But spending is an addiction likened to cigarettes. A short high and a terrible low but quick bounce back and you want it again. What is an equivalent patch for spending? Or if I'm feeling the urge to spend $8 on an uber, do I say 'no just walk to work and spend 8 on one of your stocks' ??

Any feedback or insights would be much appreciated.,"There's a few options that I have been thinking as far as using this money wisely. Here's a breakdown of what I have going on with my current financial situation in regards to this payment.

32 YRS 35k/ yr

I have a high interest car loan, 14% that I owe 15.5k on which was very very bad but I had no one to help me co-sign &amp; no extra funds at the time (literally drove a wrecked car to a lot and drove off with the new/used one) I have thought about paying this off &amp; just avoiding the 325.00/month payment &amp; just paying this off completely. That seems to be the most logical option but I don't just want to see that whole payment poof gone &amp; have literally nothing to show other than I payed off a terrible loan.

Next thought was utilizing my savings account as a direct deposit with a years worth of payments rolled in $3900.00 + $4200.00 (my half annual rent) @ $8,100 total &amp; riding out the year debt free while retaining $7,900.00 for a base savings/emergency fund.

Our company offers a savings account that we can opt to have a specific amount deposited only from our biweekly payroll that currently has an interest rate of 4% which is very rare. I thought about putting what I would spend on the car every month plus rent into this account $8,100 or more depending on how well I budget. Next year I'll owe less on the car &amp; my savings plus money I chose to retain as a bas should eclipse what my profit sharing was this year ( Early March)

Does this strategy seem to make sense or am I just better off spending every dime paying off the car 2016 Sonata 31k miles.. I'll be upside down even though I know I already am now but I am already used to hanging out to dry.

I might even use the $7,900 to max out a traditional IRA 6k &amp; deduct the contribution with my tax return this year.. my tax return would be more plus Biden is shelling out another stimulus to add to savings (even though not what it's for)

personalfinance,College student - made ineligible Roth contributions,"When I started interning, I dumped all my earnings into a Vanguard Roth IRA. During the period when tax forms were being sent out, I realized that I would not be receiving any tax forms from the organization I interned at. It was a nonprofit and therefore I was paid in the form of stipends as a reimbursement.

Long story short, my earnings from being an intern are not considered earned income and therefore all of my contributions are not eligible. From what I've read online, my contributions are excess contributions and I'll need to call Vanguard to ask for a return of my excess contributions plus all earnings from that excess. I'm still a little confused and have some questions about my best course of action and what my tax liabilities are. I'm only filing because I will need to pay taxes on the earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I still have my Roth contributions tied up into ETFs. Should I sell all my holdings and then request for a return of excess? If I directly request for a return of excess, would it take longer since Vanguard would need to sell my shares for me?
2. How long will it take for me to receive my 1099-R after I request for the return of excess? I want to file my taxes ASAP and this whole situation is making me anxious.
3. What is my tax liability? Say I made $200 in earnings. I would fall in the 10% federal bracket and would need to pay $20. In addition, I would also be taxed an additional 10% penalty and would need to pay another $20. That would be $40 total in taxes, correct?

UPDATE: Called Vanguard and they walked me through the process of filling out the form to request a return of excess and earnings. Sold all my holdings. Will not be receiving a Form 1099-R until next year.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Strategy During Deferment - Investments or Savings Account?,"I've been struggling to stick to a conservative strategy around my student loans while payment and interest are deferred. I won't have to make any payments or incur interest until September. Meanwhile, all of my investments have been doing great, so it's just hard to wrap my mind around hoarding cash in an account that is earning almost no interest.

My emergency fund is set and is probably much higher than needed, so all of my extra money goes into either investments or student loans. I have about $60k left in the loan, and I can probably save enough to pay it all off in September if I focus exclusively on that, especially if federal action takes another $10k off the loan. That said, it's tempting to invest the extra money in an index fund instead, just so it can do *something* in this crazy bull market. 

My questions are:

1. Would it be a bad move to add this money to my existing index fund position (VTWAX) and withdraw from that in order to pay off the loans later in the year, assuming I'm willing to take on the risk of this money being inaccessible when I want it?
2. Is there anything that would make sense that  has a higher yield than my savings account (0.4%) but is less risky than an index fund?
3. Is it smartest to just stop FOMOing about missing out on potential earnings and start putting the money somewhere safe?

We are buying a two bedroom condo in Ann Arbor primarily to get our 2 year old son in to good schools. It is $205k with and property taxes are about $4k per year. 

The interest rate on our loan quoted from the KW bank is around 3% if we do a 3% downpayment.

KW claims that if we are using a KW agent (my new step-mom) they are the best bank around and save us a bunch of fees. 

However, my dad and his wife have been involved in a bunch of MLMs and it's my understanding that KW strays on the MLM side of things.

Bitcoin,DCA using a credit line?,"I know what the safe decision would be, but no risk it no biscuit, right?

I‚Äôm contemplating a high-risk/high-reward DCA strategy that‚Äôs pretty damn simple.

personalfinance,"Received 1099 after filing taxes, but already reported the income","Hi, pardon my ignorance- I have some questions about things I don't understand super well and I'm really stressed out.

I filed both my Federal and State taxes last week using Turbotax online. I live in Pennsylvania. I reported all the income I made last year using Paypal (I do freelance illustration work so I tallied up all my invoices). Last year I did illustrations for a book, and it was my first time doing something on a ""professional level"", if that makes sense, so I wasn't super familiar with how things would play out. Anyways, I was just contacted by the dude who hired me and informed that he was sending me a 1099, and I already reported that income he paid me when I filed my taxes a week ago- without the 1099. So now he's stressed out, and I'm stressed out, and I don't totally know what to do, because my anxiety is bad enough and the idea of screwing up my taxes and getting squashed by the IRS like an over-ripe grape keeps running through my head.

To my understanding, what I must do now is:

\- wait for my return to be either accepted or rejected by the IRS

\- fill out a Form 1040X and file an amendment based on the 1099 I'm going to receive

\- potentially have to file amendments for both my Federal and State taxes, since I'm not sure yet if these both require amendments

I guess my main question is what to do if I've already reported the income. Will amending my return effectively be ""double-reporting"" the same income? Will I be able to chop off the amount from the 1099 when I amend it and include it separately as its own thing? If that makes sense? I really have no idea what the hell I'm doing, I'm super stressed out and confused, and any and all related advice would be really appreciated. Thanks.",finance

stocks,Best Investment Strategies/ideas post-memestock?,"So yeah wanted some informations and to share my quite disapointing adventure in investing. Started last year to invest ""for fun"" since the interest rate at banks are insultingly low and felt I was loosing money by not investing. Just to see how it goes at first, I put my money mostly in ETF and safe stock (and small quantity of stock too). I made like 100$ in 3-4month with a 1000$ investment. Now the meme stock part, I managed to buy 1 share of GME at 40$, but didn't want to sell anything to buy more, regreted it. I then added 2000 to my account, it takes 3 days to clear, the peak is coming and I still don't have my funds, FOMO hard, buy 1 share around 230, add some AMC and BB to the pile, sell that share around 330, still decide to buy more after that because it's the ""dip"". Well, If I sold february 1 I could had still made like 500$, but didn't, I bought more GME because my smooth brain said YOLO and we were going to the moon right? Immediately regret it the next day, Paper handed (another cool kid term) and didn't want to lose anymore money, sold all the meme stock at a lost, except BB at a smalll profit in the following days. Now I'm back to square one with -300$ to my original funds. Since I was mad and tired of loosing I immediatly tried to buy some stock that seemed to be a bargain, bought lower than it was a few weeks ago and when it was climbing back up from a dip, since then it's been dipping again, loosing me even more money, but i'm still confident it will rise back up over a few months.

Now, for my question, what should/could be my best strategies to regain my losses asap (if possible), because after that I plan on putting back 90% in etf and only keep a small percentage to gamble, I learned my lesson and I don't think i'm made to play with ""volatile stock"". It hits even harder to know that I could've already remade my losses by putting money last week in weed stock that's exploding now (I hesitated between weed and that other stock i'm currently losing money on), but I feel it's too late for that now. Also was thinking of taking everything out of the stock market and put it in bit coin instead, i actually made around 1500-2000$ in 2020 with them so yeahh, at this point I feel it's easier there lol, but I would wait for a dip from the all time highs of right now.

TL;DR : was ""winning"" a little before my smooth brain decided to get on the hype train of memestock, lost money, now I wants to be a ""safe"" investor.

vet,Really need cat food advice,"My cat Smokey is 10 years old and she suffers from hyperthyroidism and pancreatitis.   


For years she has eaten Iams ProActive Health Healthy Adult dry cat food. Prior to us receiving her diagnosis of pancreatitis the vet recommended she switch to wet food because she began vomiting quite often. Not long ago we got the diagnosis of pancreatitis and have been trying to find her a food that would help with managing it. 

We began feeding her Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Feline Formula wet food on a meal-time basis instead of the free-eating format she had before. It's incredibly cost-prohibitive for me which got me looking around for an alternative today. I happened to have the Iams bag laying around and ended up reading the label and it claims to use natural ingredients and not have additives. 

So now I'm a bit confused as to whether this Taste of the Wild food is any better than the Iams food with regard to her pancreatitis and hope someone can offer me an answer to that. 

Smokey is very picky about what she'll eat, about the only reliable wet food I've had luck with is Nutrish, but again, I'm not sure Nutrish is good for her pancreatitis (though I'd prefer it because it's somewhat less expensive than Taste of the Wild.)

personalfinance,Should I let my dad help pay for my down payment for a house straight out of college?,"I just graduated this past January and am starting a new job at the end of Feb. The pay is $150k and it was supposed to be in NYC, but due to COVID, everything is virtual for the foreseeable future. 

The condo I'm looking at is in a great location in a largely populated, suburban city right outside Philadelphia. Amenities-wise, it's brand new, has a private balcony and clubhouse, right next to a major shopping center. Financially, it costs a little under $300k. With a generous loan of $60k from my dad, I'm looking to put down 25% down payment (\~$76k) with estimated closing costs to be about $10k. With interest, I'd be paying \~$1800/mo mortgage. So all in all, I'll be putting down $20k of my own money and then paying mortgage, borrowing the initial $60k from my dad. 

I'm planning on living in this condo for no longer than a year and renting it out to earn a little extra monthly income (profit of \~$500) and sell the property after 5-7 years. Hopefully, my end goal is to make money and reinvest it into more expensive, higher ROI property. 

I'm wondering what you guys think of this--I plan on fully paying my dad (he's taking money out of his retirement) back but it obviously will take some time. These are the pros and cons I've come up with:

Pros: having a mortgage will reduce my taxable income, everyone says to take more risk in your early 20's, this condo is in a great location and brand new (my dad says if I buy a property it has to be brand new so there aren't going to be too many maintenance issues for tenants), I am really interested in real estate investment and want the learning experience, people say don't try to time the market, interest rates are apparently pretty low now

Cons: haven't even started my job yet so who knows if I get fired lol, people say it's a seller's market right now, I'm not sure where to start with paying my dad back or how I should approach the repayment

Basically, I could stay at my mom's, live comfortably and pay little to no rent, but have my money accumulate and sit and waste a good opportunity that most people don't have to learn how to invest in real estate. Or I could take some risk and use my opportunity.

I am our only income as my husband takes care of our preschooler. Thankfully it has been stable through covid. My husband is older and has met his retirement age. We have waited a few years but decided to apply for benefits soon as we for see his expenses increasing and because of our son will also get money too. From all of our information, we were expecting around $800 in SS retirement benefits for my husband plus another half for my son. 

Today we have learned he gets half that amount and need to pay back some of our first month of benefits- but have a chance for repealing the decision. They said it was due to having a pension - but he had long ago cashed that in (going through the SS application process we did find out that there was 8 dollars in the pension that we cashed out).

I have been more fiscally savvy but his fiscal ignorance (coming from a super poor family) has costed him in the past and I am afraid is striking again and cannot understand why his cashed out pension matters.

He has been a Jack of all trades and has done many things for income before me. He worked at an Ohio community college as their printer and at that time received a pension - which he cashed in the 90s to by land and build an off grid home (we still own this property which yields him about $3,000/year in net income).

When he was sick he didn't qualify for unemployment because NJ because he did know that he had to pay into a fund as a self-employed house cleaner. He also did not get money from the federal government due to not paying enough quarters with his cleaning business due to above SNAFU with the accountant. Our son had a 100+ day hospital stay that has limited my fiscal cushion but we were not bankrupted. We have always managed to make it through. Yet we have been counting on him getting at least $700 from SS in retirement to help save for his end of life expenses some day and help pay for a life Insurance policy that will end when he is 80.

personalfinance,About to enter grad school. Should I prioritize saving to reduce student loans or invest for retirement?,"I was planning on putting $2k into my IRA to maximize my savers credit when filling my taxes but then I got into grad school. I still have around $6k saved up for grad school (would be $8k if I don't invest). I'm doing the math and with a conservative annual return (I estimated 5%) it seems like my $2k will make me more in an IRA when compared to the interest I'd save on student loans. 

I am currently debt free at 25. My program tuition is $54k and I'm estimating a high $40k in living expenses/other fees/etc for a total program cost around $95k. I have pending scholarships as well as loan forgiveness programs that would cover all of my tuition. This will be my first time taking out student loans. I'm also about to accept a new position with a significant pay raise so I can funnel even more money into my savings.

Is it worth holding off on contributing to my IRA? Or is the smarter move to eat my school cost and maximize my IRA contributions? I messed around with the numbers and it seemed like maxing out my IRA (aka the whole 8k) makes me significantly more than what I'd be saving in student loan interest. 

I know that reducing student loans is a more stable path and that the market dips so index funds may not make the same annual returns. I'm just looking for a different perspective and advice. Thank you!

Edit: I believe I only have to take out federal loans so the interest rate is 4.3-5.3 then I will probably refinance after graduating to a lower interest rate (assuming I don't get the loan forgiveness program nor any changes with federal student debt).

Details:

- Combined gross income was about $170k, and is now roughly half that.
- We purchased the house at a little over $410k; we put 10% down, and our monthly mortgage is about $2400 (which amounts to about half our new take home pay).
- We live in the midwest US in a middling cost of living area.
- The only other outstanding debt we have is about $5000 worth of student loans at a low interest rate for $100/month; cars are paid off, and no dependents.

In hindsight we are happy to have only put 10% down because 20% down would have left us with little spare cash which half is now serving as emergency funds (about $20-30k).

stocks,Question regarding cannabis and the stock market,"Hello all! I want to apologize now for what I anticipate will be a relatively long post; I tend to ramble a lot haha. I‚Äôll be sure to include a TLDR at the end for those that would like a quick summary.

I first got into investing around a week and a half ago during the $GME situation, but I was too skeptical about it and too poor to buy into $GME specifically. To play it safe, I bought two AMC shares in case they took off like people were saying they would, but I also invested in some companies that I thought had potential since I‚Äôve always been interested in the  stock market, and a basic rule of thumb is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket.‚Äù One of the companies I invested in was $APHA for 2 shares at $14.40. My main thought process was a mixture of combining something that I enjoy with the idea ‚Äúinvest in legal weed before it gets legalized, then hopefully it‚Äôll happen soon and the prices will go way up.‚Äù 

Flash forward to the present; I‚Äôve invested a total of $65, and my entire portfolio is worth $99.95 with a huge chunk of my profit being tied to Aphria; the price is currently sitting at $27.70 for a share, so they‚Äôve nearly doubled since I first got them! I‚Äôm very happy with this, but now the part where I‚Äôd like some advice: I don‚Äôt know whether my original thought process is flawed. I understand that the stock market always fluctuates and nothing is certain, but assuming things stay relatively non-apocalyptic, is the idea that weed shares will go up in price after federal legalization?

I haven‚Äôt done a whole lot of research on the industry as a whole, but I remember reading headlines about how the cannabis industry tends to be very profitable when implemented at state levels, so I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt be profitable once implemented nationwide.

If you‚Äôve read this far, I sincerely thank you, and I welcome any advice you have for a new investor :)

-inflation cannot happen bc the fed is just printing money to get the economy leveled due to lack of liquidity. Once it‚Äôs back fed will take back their money and inflation won‚Äôt be high. They also control interest rates to offset inflation. So why the huge worry of becoming the next Venezuela? 

-the us govt isn‚Äôt backed by gold anymore. They back themselves so obviously they fight wars to make sure USD is the standard global currency. And if it stays like that then the dollar is stable. So wouldn‚Äôt usa try everything they can to make sure btc doesn‚Äôt become the standard reserve in that sense? Maybe btc just like gold and it doesn‚Äôt effect usd status as world reserve?  
But with all these things why are people panicked and buying btc to hedge against inflation and devaluation? Fed is keeping tight control with interest rates and monetary policy (input/output money supply). I know this is the main reason micheal sailor and everyone using to buy btc. 
Can someone explain why what the fed is doing won‚Äôt work? They did it before in 2008 and it was fine.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Bitcoin's biggest advantage will also be its biggest hurdle for mass adoption.,"I've always thought cryptocurrencies were interesting, but like most people I assumed it was just a fad; some made up, internet ""money"" couldn't possibly displace the mighty, government backed USD. That was until last October when I threw away some extra money I had in my Robinhood account into BTC last October and it proceeded to 4x in value. Since then I have done a ton of research into the technical aspects of Bitcoin and tried (to the best of my ability) to understand what makes it tick. It is only because of this research and new knowledge that I was confident enough to make a real wallet, and start really investing in the future.

But the biggest hurdle for me to overcome wasn't the fear that Bitcoin would plummet in value or somehow break or be hacked. I was confident in its future. The biggest hurdle for me was the fact that *I would actually be responsible for my own money.*

I am currently in college and am probably on the older side of Gen Z. Possibly because of growing up in the digital age, it was ingrained in me that I needed to save up my money, and put it in the bank. Because banks are so big they are much better at keeping your money safe, and it's also insured by the government at a federal level. So no matter what happened, if my money was in the bank, I could always count on getting it back. I didn't have to keep a safe and hope no one would rob me, becasue it was all taken care of. I didn't need to worry about anything. This shift in liability away from the individual and onto a larger entity is seen everywhere in our current society (company custody of personal data) and the psychological factor behind this is immensely underestimated. It has been programmed into most of us that the large, faceless entity is to be trusted. Because without us they can't exist, so they have to take care of us right? I can see an example of this almost everywhere I look.

I have just recently succeeded in convincing my father to buy into Bitcoin (I told him to buy in 2013 but he didn't listen). After he told me that he purchased it through Robinhood, I explained the whole ""not your keys, not your coin"" argument, but he was just fine leaving it where it was. Even when I told him that his assets weren't insured, just under the protection of a flimsy company promise, and offered to teach him how to easily setup a multisig on Bluewallet, he resisted.

Everyone has become so used to their money just being numbers on a website that isn't theirs. Giving their money voluntarily to a company to hang on to, because it's safer there. They do this (and frankly we all still do this) because it just works. When we tell people to create their own wallet, we are telling them to take (potentially) thousands of USD and put it all in something as dainty as a phone. This makes it a no brainer to not to buy Bitcoin for people who aren't informed enough to understand seed phrases or multisig. *Why should they put their hard-earned money into something that could easily be stolen/lost/forgotten/destroyed, when the bank is insured?*

This, I believe, will be the biggest hurdle on the path to full Bitcoin adoption. Because when more people move to Bitcoin, if a majority of it is held through brokerages or exchanges, Bitcoin will fail in what it set out to achieve. Because then all it really is is just ""digital gold"". And digital gold isn't transformative, it's just another asset you can buy and sell on the market through some third party company without actually buying or selling anything. It's just another way for the hedge funds and the other big financial dogs to take advantage of the little guy, while claiming to have good intentions.",cryptocurrency
investing,Selling Puts to Generate Yield in this Bubbly Market. Talk me out of it!,"Market feels a little frothy and I'm moving to cash. That said I still want to generate income on the idle cash in excess of money market rates (nil). I don't want to touch bonds as rising interest rates will crush long durations bonds and short term bonds are also generating nil returns. Looking for suggestions but am leaning towards selling puts.

My thought is to sell July 2021 puts on AVGO, MSFT, AAPL, TSM. Setting strikes for 25-35% discounts on these stocks would get you a rough return of 3-4% annualized. Nothing spectacular but beats money markets. In the event the market crashes before July, I would be happy to buy any of these stocks at the discount.

Let me know if you have better suggestions for names to sell puts on (without excessive risk) or other strategies to generate yield. I'm not inclined to buy high dividend yield stocks as those will still get dragged down in a market correction and then you are stuck holding them until they recover. I'd rather generate yield now while remaining liquid so I'm in a position to bottom feed after a correction.",finance

personalfinance,How am I doing financially? Looking for an honest opinion. 31 years old. Only starting taking personal finance seriously in the past few years.,"31 years old. 2 years out of grad school. Got my first ""big boy"" job right after I finished. Didn't have the best financial direction from my parents when I left for undergrad so only started getting my shit together (e.g., investing, budgeting, etc.) in the past year or two. E.g., only opened a Roth IRA in 2017, only deposited $1,000 in it (deposited an additional $5,000 in 2018), and let that money sit in Vanguard's Federal Market Money Fund until May 2020. Had no idea I actually had to invest it. Oof.

Maybe ~$73,000/year pre-tax. Thankfully, no debt and no car payments. I pay my credit cards (Chase Freedom, Chase Freedom Unlimited, and Chase Sapphire Reserve) in full every month. But, as you can imagine, I wish I was further along financially. Was hoping to get some input from everyone here to see if I need to be doing anything differently.

Net Worth | $50,000
---|---
Roth IRA | $24,200 (Vanguard
401k | $16,000 (Merrill)
HSA | $3,800
Savings/Checking | $6,100 (Ally)

Both my Roth IRA and 401k are invested in Target Date Funds. Maxing my IRA out each year from now on. My 401k is through work and my company matches up to 4%. When I first started working I did the company match. I've gradually increased that to 10% over the past two years. I don't actively contribute to my HSA. I live in California where I've read that HSAs aren't quite as useful; I put enough in there to cover medical expenses and haven't touched it since. I have not invested the money that is currently in my HSA.

I've got a few grand that I'm playing with on the stock market. Bought into the GME hype, got scared, sold for a small profit, and got out. ~$3,000 of profit (recouped my initial investment). Currently have that money in Fidelity invested in a few ETFs and random stocks (BB, MSOS, ICLN, FPAC, IPOE). Was thinking about pulling this money out but figure I'll just leave it in. I do enjoy following stocks and riding the roller coaster. But thinking about putting most of my money into ETFs. Probably 80/20. Will leave a little fun money (20%) to put on meme stocks or whatever I think might blow up.

My emergency savings fund is right around ~3 months. Slowly adding to this until it's up around 5 months but I'm pretty comfortable with where it's at right now.

So...some questions that I had:

* Should I be contributing more to my 401k? *See question 2 for a bit of a caveat first, though.*
* I'm nearing the age where I'm thinking about (trying to) buy a house. Would it make more sense to put excess money into the stock market (into a stable ETF) so that I've got a bit more liquidity (rather than investing this money into my 401k)?
* Do you think Target Date Funds are the right call for my IRA and 401k? I'm not so financially fluent that I feel comfortable doing something like the Boglehead Three-Fund Portfolio (or beyond) but I hear people talk about putting everything into VTI and VTSAX all the time. Curious what the hype is about.

Think that's all the questions I've got. In terms of when I want to retire and how much I'd like to have saved by then...I'm less sure. Can we just take the average? Assume I'd like to retire around 60 and have a monthly budget of...? $5,000? Not even sure what's typical for retirees. 

Would love to get any and all input. This is the first time I've really shared this with anyone so curious to hear what people have got to say. And please don't sugar coat it if I need to make any drastic changes to my portfolio/saving/spending, I've got thick skin.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Took a HUGE gamble and it Paid off.,"I've been so desperate lately.   Lockdowns FKED me and my wife so hard we fell behind an additional $120,000 in the hole on top of a mortgage and having a newborn one month prior to the CV19 outbreak.  

 We were both forced out of business for nearly 2 months, not eligible for stimu, or unemployment.  We went from hauling in $20K a month combined to literally negative -$10K.  

For the following 6 months we combined for about $3,000 a month but still went negative. It was either the house or pay taxes.  Obviously you have to keep your house. 

Most people can say ""I don't feel bad, because you made so much money most people don't even...etc"".       Sure but we went borderline poverty and almost lost everything.   

3years ago I was an average Joe. I'm in the trades wirh 12 years experience and was making a modest $60K with no health insurance.   She worked for a school making about the same until she started her own business.    We don't come from money.  I grew up piss poor most of my early life.  We just got lucky with opportunities to start a business.  

 But anyway we aren't giving up.    The IRS may have a lean on our home but I'm not letting that take me down.    

I did something very balsy.  Because we are already behind so much that a little more wouldn't do much more damage.   It's either take another hit but still keep the house or just take a chance and hit big. 

I did a cash advance on a CC at a 29.99% interest rate for $2000..

 Dumped my entire portfolio about $11k,
Basically drained my bank but left enough for one month mortgage. 

Then I sold my entire collection of extremely impossible to find cassettes. About $4000

And I took it one step further. 

I called my mom and asked her if she can co-sign for a new work truck.   Told her u was despersre, She said yes.   I sold my original truck for $24,000.  

I dumped all of into all into this Terra Luna few days ago because I noticed it kept going up. 

I DIDNT EVEN READ INTO IT!   Something I never ever ever ever do.   I just said all or nothing.    and BAM!  it paid off.    I dumped and more than doubled my investment.

Now I have the money to pay off the IRS and get that lean off our house, catch up on the mortgage and pay off almost all our CCs.  


I didn't tell my wife what u did and I am full aware that it is a move that leads to a divorce.  But I said fuck it... If she gonna leave me for making desperate risky moves in desperate times than she never love that much.  

Fuck bills.  Life revolved around being responsible and paying bills just to have a decent roof over your head and if you can't make it then you're a loser????    You got to be kidding me.     I Don't GIVE. A FK ANYMOFE!! I grew up POOR I can do this shit.  Only NEED FAM AND A BIG FAT FKING JOINT AND RHE STARS AT NIGHT

You know what.  If you have a mom around.  Be blessed for what you got.  She's not rich. If she said no to co sign, I wouldn't have sold my work truck.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Cautionary Tale: Nexo.io not as advertised if you are a US Citizen,"I came across Nexo.io yesterday and it seemed very attractive: It is advertised as an exchange where you can also earn 5-12% annual interest on your tokens compounded daily- except what they don't tell you is a lot of these features are not available to US citizens... Unknowingly, I decided to pull the trigger, I signed up, transferred in some assets, and used them to buy 10% of my assets as NEXO tokens, which is supposed to allow you to earn higher interest rates on all tokens.

First thing I noticed was that I couldn't figure out how to use the exchange... I just had wallets... well after digging through their support page there was a single sentence at the bottom of their exchange page that said the exchange is not available to US citizens... would have been nice to know. But what the hell I still earn a lot of interest right?

By having 10% assets in NEXO, this earns an extra 1% interest rate. It is also advertised that you can then opt in for an additional 2% interest if you chose to get paid Interest in NEXO tokens... But surprise again, this is not available to US citizens...

I tried using their support page for more information, but there was little there. They were pushing this 24/7 live chat feature, which sounded very reassuring, so I asked for more information there... The ""live chat"" was a chat bot that when I told it I was unhappy with it's answer told me it was glad I was happy and ended the chat... lol

Now, it still seems like a pretty good deal even at the lower interest paid that I am eligible for. Also the site and wallets are nice enough in use, but I thought well maybe I won't bother with having my assets in NEXO coins... except then I realized as a US citizen I can't use their exchange to exchange my NEXO coins back into other assets. I have to transfer my NEXO to another exchange that accepts NEXO... and well there are not many exchanges that that do trade NEXO so now I have to figure that out. 

I really feel like I got trapped, on purpose, with false advertising.

TLDR... Major features of Nexo.io including the exchange and top interest rates not available to US citizens... do your research before getting into a new ecosystem.

I am now looking at celcius, which seems to have basically the same business model as Nexo.io, can any other US citizen who uses this site provide some insight?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Car advice (am I being too cheap?),"Hello, I‚Äôve learned a ton from this subreddit and am a bit embarrassed to have to ask this instead of figuring it out myself, but I think emotions are getting involved and I need some more objective advice.

So I think I need a new car. I‚Äôve gone through some issues with my current one which I‚Äôve had 8 years, and although I have recently sank ~4k in repairs into it and it should live for a while longer, it‚Äôs left me stranded twice and driving it stresses me out. I think I could get 5k out of it if I‚Äôm lucky, 3k safely id say.

I think I want a Toyota Tacoma. I want to get 300k out of my next car, 4x4 is non negotiable for where I live and small truck fits my lifestyle great. 

Now for the numbers:
814 fico credit score according to discover

Just over 100k annual income

I take home like 5500 a month, and max out my 401k match. 

I pay 2k in rent/bills, so let‚Äôs call my monthly expenses 2500 to allow for food and stuff.

I have 10k in savings, and each month 2k goes towards this savings account.

So, looking at this, what is reasonable to spend on a car?? I applied for a 20k loan for a used truck but the interest rate was a very disappointing 6.99%...
I have a good credit score so I should be able to get a decent rate on a new vehicle right? But even at this 2.5% interest rate everyoje is talking about a 40k loan over 5 years is like 870 a month, which seems totally absurd to me. Could I get a comparable interest rate for a certified pre owned 2019 truck? That would bring the payments down to 550 which seems decent. But I have 2200 per month just savings budgeted, am I being a stupid Scrooge by stressing myself out driving a shitbox just to not bring that down to 1500 ish? It just seems insane to me to get a loan when I‚Äôm not even maxing our 401k contribs and am still working towards 6 months emergency fund but I‚Äôm not sure if those are unrealistic standards to hold myself to. I mean I could get an old truck for 5k that has 200k miles on it but I‚Äôm sick of spending money on shitty vehicles and I just want to feel like I‚Äôm gonna arrive at my destination every time I leave.

Yeah this post got out of hand. Clearly my emotions and my finances are tangled, so I‚Äôd appreciate some help unraveling them :)",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Be careful of celebrities, when it comes to crypto, some things are not as hard to predict as you think.","Elon Musk tweets DOGE, buys bitcoin. Many of us, myself included were talking about this during the DOGE surge, that there's a high likelihood he was diverting attention away from bitcoin so he doesn't have to buy it high.

&amp;#x200B;

Michael Saylor, as respected and truly leading the vision for industry for adoption as he is, talked about bitcoin after buying it, every-time. Now, this has to do with legality and SEC filings as well, so I'm not going to claim they are malevolently misdirecting the public.

&amp;#x200B;

I will however, point out that some things are not as hard to predict as people think. For example, after Saylor's event with all of these companies, many of them will take a position in bitcoin. If you are reading this and thinking, ""I'll buy bitcoin when they enter"" let it be known that you'll always only know AFTER they enter. And by then you'll miss the biggest pump.

&amp;#x200B;

About the DOGE incident I will also say this, ""celebrities are paid based on attention and public interest"" this means, that someone who loses 10k on DOGE on YouTube, assuming they get say 1 million viewers and 70k new subscribers, can make that money back much easier than we can.

&amp;#x200B;

Snoop Dog can push whatever coin he wants, as long as he gets more attention, that will convert to money for him. Anyone that follows him in though......good luck, hope you know what you're doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Elon Musk and Michael saylor can both  leverage their followers to pump at certain low liquidity points to push the price. I would even go far enough to say that Elon may be practicing with pumping DOGE, figuring out how much initial sway he has, and how long the momentum can be kept up.

&amp;#x200B;

It's true, I do also believe it possible that Elon's just a memelord and loves to mess around, but remember even while playing golf, the rich are networking. It would not surprise me if Elon, genius as he is, figures out the best way to make his entertainment also pay him real money.

&amp;#x200B;

Notice that both of them release news of buying into bitcoin when price shows weakness and low volume, and the news usually catapults price past difficult resistance or hold important supports.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you've been following the crypto space, you would know there's several people on YouTube that called Tesla getting into bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Since people like it when posts give them value I will say this, ""As bitcoin prices rise, the pressure is on for other hedge funds (competing with Micro Strategy) and S &amp; P 500 Companies (competing with Tesla) to enter bitcoin, They WILL need to FOMO in eventually. When? I don't know. But once the price goes up enough we will see it, because the returns of bitcoin is simply too high to not enter an amount.""

&amp;#x200B;

Since 2020's ""FED printer go burrrr"" People having making jokes about how, ""Why do we need an analyst? If you put all your portfolio into Tesla you probably made a better return year over year than any of these professionals"" 

&amp;#x200B;

This has had impact, the GME incident, the pumping of small cap companies, wall street getting rekt left and right by retail. If wall street keeps lagging on bitcoin, they may lose so much confidence from the younger generation, that they eventually go out of business as most of the young manage their own portfolios and put money into bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, Alt season has began a while back, as soon as late december and early January, this means that ANY alt-coin with a small enough market cap and retail attention can literally 10x overnight (looks at DOGE) if you follow celebrities, know this, there will be a bunch of shills about to come out and promote any sort of coins, and those coins will have very high returns in a short time. But most of them will be unsustainable.

&amp;#x200B;

Be careful out there, feel free to join in the Pump and Dump if you know what you're doing. Or (like me) not, your choice.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

* Celebrities make money through attention, so they can throw money at riskier stuff
* Celebrities can leverage their influence to affect the market
* Industry adoption is coming, more companies will likely follow Tesla
* Any small-cap Alt-coin can be pumped by celebrities
* Be careful with what celebrities tweet, those rarely are serious investments

dogecoin,I want to quell some fears for new buyers/people to this sub.,"To answer a few questions and dampen a some doubts and fears I need to tell you about the USD compared to Doge.   

  Yes Doge is inflationary, and yes the USD is inflationary.  But there is a big difference and I would like to show you why as simply as I can.  The fed for the USD tries to keep inflation at 2%-3% annually.  It always ends up closer to 3% on good years.  

  So I'm going to do some math. 1.7Trillion USD are in existence, physical or not doesn't matter. So 1.7trillion X 3% = That is 51 billion dollars annually that gets added to the pool of U.S. money.  So that means 51Billion gets added to the percentage.  Next year that will add 52Billion.  So the supply AND percentage increases continuously.  

   That's why your dollar is worth less every year.  
 Now let's explain Doge inflation model.   Doge at has from what i understand 100Billion coins in existence and releases roughly 5 billion a year annually. 5billion√∑100 billion= 5% THIS year.  Next year the coins in existence will be 105Billion but here is the math magic. 

  The rate release annually is still 5billion at a fixed rate.  So next year your inflation will be 5billion√∑105Billion= 4.7% rate.  On the third year it is 4.5%.  The fourth it is 4.3%.   It will continue to do this forever.  Making the currency predictable, stable, and allowing it to beat the USD in every sense of the word.  Mathematically it is a sound currency.  This is why i would encourage you to buy it and hold it. It has REAL APPLICABLE VALUE!!!  That is all, I hope this helps some of the nervous buyers out there.

Forex,Tips for beginners: The learning process and understanding risk,"# Introduction

Hi everyone. I am new to both r/Forex and Reddit. I wanted to create a helpful post here to all beginners starting out, mainly because reading through this sub I notice a lot of beginners deviating from what is a ""good"" learning path. This is not a strategy nor does it contain any tips for technical or fundamental analysis, but should provide some insight into subject rarely discussed. 

I also want to point out that English is not my mother language, so I do apologize for any grammar or spelling errors that might confuse you. If you get confused, just ask. 

# A good learning path

I have been trading for a few years and I have probably made every mistake in the book. I am still continuing to make mistakes, its only natural and part of what makes us human. But talking to new traders, I come to conclusion that mistakes are either frowned upon or feared. People usually do not like to admit they were wrong or easily blame any mistakes on distraction or ""smart money"" hunting them down. **Learning from mistakes is essential to develop as a trader**. But there is one thing often overlooked. It is better to lose when you are wrong then win. This is something very important to keep in mind, as you should **always** hope your trade goes bust when you are wrong. Winning when you are wrong can have potentially catastrophic consequences. 

Let me give an example:

You sit in your car under influence (alcohol) and you decide to drive from point A to point B. Reaching point B without an accident is worse then hitting a tree. Because success when you are wrong will change your perception of reality. If you drive from point A to point B, without a accident, you might convince yourself that you are capable of operating a vehicle under influence, and you will probably have no problem doing so again in the future. Hitting a tree, will probably prevent you from driving drunk again as you now have understood that your either not capable of driving drunk, or that it was the wrong thing to do. But if you succeed, you might keep on driving eventually hitting and killing a child playing on the street. 

The same thing goes when trading. When you succeed when you are wrong, you might hit your 3:1 TP for that particular trade, but you will go on losing three times that before you realize something is wrong. 

My point is, do not fear losses. They are what makes us grow. You **absolutely** have to lose to learn. There is a common misconception that you can learn and practice on a demo account and once you go live you just bring that knowledge over and you will succeed. This is far from true. You should be ready to blow out one or two account before you start getting somewhere. You will be totally comfortable with charts and decision making once you spent on average 10,000 hours in front of chart. For people with higher intelligence, this will be lower. 

# Evaluating your strategy

When testing and evaluating your strategy most people will look at historic charts and think that their strategy is valid and then go on trading on a live account. Back testing is something that must be done, but rarely helps you in any way. The human mind works a little different when you want evaluate your own creation. You will naturally be drawn to the successful results of your back test more. This means that when looking at a historic chart, your eyes will only catch those times your strategy did work. You will ignore or not see the times it didn't. Let's for the sake of argument assume you enter on a 61.8% FIB retrace. This is your strategy. Now when you start looking at a chart, you will automatically start looking for any fall or rise that retraced. You will then take your tool and drag it from the top to bottom of the original move and then see that price bounced on the fib level. You are happy that it worked and move on to find the next one and next one after that. But what about that fall, which reversed and went all the way up? You are automatically ignoring that. Your eyes will only see what you want them to see, and you always want to prove yourself right.

When back testing, always and I do mean always, aim to prove yourself wrong. Do not just look at a historic chart when doing this. If using Tradingview for example jump to an older date and use the replay mode. If you are not using Tradingview use Forex Tester or any other software that lets you live trade historic charts. This is the best, yet still somewhat flawed, way of back testing a strategy. But a strategy will never prove itself unless it is traded live.   


# Understand value

There is a lot of talk about smart money, distribution and accumulation and tons of other perspectives that will make you doubt the validity of the market or think that it is rigged against you. It's not. It is just very very complex. Forex is much more complex than other markets, specially the stock market. 

Forex has no real accumulation and distribution. Forex has perceived value that is a result of fundamental policies like inflation, interest rates and GDP growth. One country economy measured against another. There is no underlying asset to own and distribute/accumulate like stocks. This is a heavy leveraged market where you can have a bank account funded with JPY but you can still long or short the AUDUSD even tho you do not own neither AUD nor USD. 

The Forex markets majority transactions are utilitarian, it means that it is used to pay for something. It can be tourists wanting to exchange money, it can be a company that want to pay for goods or services. The majority of the volume in Forex are for utilitarian uses. These people do not care about the future exchange rate. They will get the exchange rate that currently reflects the **perceived value** of that currency. The currency's perceived value changes as different policies are implemented to correct or promote inflation, or any other fundamental event that can have this effect like wars, tsunamis, unemployment, elections etc. 

The ""smart money"" people mention in Forex is commonly mistaken with the smart money in the stock market. The smart money in Forex consists of two major participants, the large speculators and the commercial interest. The large speculators always add to their position when it is trending, and the commercial always trade in the opposite direction of the trend, mainly because they are hedging another investment for example in a foreign stock market. So thinking the market is rigged against you, specially in a deep and liquid market like the Forex market, is not entirely correct. You just don't understand value. 

Value is very hard to identify on a chart because it can shift so frequently and suddenly. But the main rule of thumb is that whenever price is in a range, that is the currently perceived value range. How it got there, matters as well. A fast climb in prices which then ends in a range, tells us that this is pair is being valued higher than before. Here is an example:

&amp;#x200B;

[EURUSD Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/bufudkbcxlg61.png?width=2376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47a4ae0856b1927c4cb8518be50eb2d33b61edea)

You can see that price went straight up, and ended in a range. This is the current perceived value. I see a lot of people starting to immediately go short once price starts to turn around lower. But the truth is, as long as that value does not shift lower, anything below this range will actually be discounted prices since we are lower than the perceived value. I will go into more detail about this when discussing risk. 

But the value (equilibrium) is extremely important to understand so you can position yourself correctly (or stay away from trading) as you use value as confluence to your existing strategy. Do not ignore the equilibrium in the market, it will pay off in the long term trust me on this. 

# Risk

This is the most important part where basically all beginner traders get it wrong. Risk is NOT just risk reward ratios. I will not go into detail on RR ratios, as there is plenty of information on this subject and you have to adjust that to whatever fits your strategy and win rate. But understanding when a position is riskier then usual is vital. To understand risk you need to properly understand volatility. 

When volatility is high, risk is naturally higher. But, the reward can be higher as well. So naturally, you want to be able to predict the next volatility expansion in your desired direction. 

Volatility goes up when liquidity goes down. As something gets volatile it is usually because there is a lack of liquidity on one side of the market, either the buy or the sell. Market makers (liquidity providers) always want a non-volatile market where each transaction can be matched properly with least amount of risk and just sit back and earn the spread. But the reality is far from such a perfect world. When volatility goes up to much, spreads increase as market makers needs to compensate for the risk of not being able to match the order. Liquidity gaps occur, slippage occurs etc. And when the market is slow, spreads are usually lower which in turn means lower transaction costs. 

Now, the true resistance and support in the market comes from volatility contractions -&gt; volatility expansions. 

&amp;#x200B;

[EURUSD Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/mifls9pdxlg61.png?width=2696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc3d4d19e69187c47522f1280ddb9c10b8115c6)

When volatility decreases, there can be a new evaluation in the market and direction of least liquidity usually is obvious after that contraction ends. These zones are important as they have a fundamental basis to why they occur, how and what happens. I will not go into detail about this but if you want to learn more you can download and read the following papers by just googling them

*"" Foreign Exchange Market Microstructure and the WM/Reuters 4pm Fix "" by  P. S. Michelberger‚àó and J. H. Witte*  

*"" The market microstructure approach to foreign exchange: Looking back and looking forward  "" by  Michael R. King, Carol Osler and Dagfinn Rime* 

*"" Microstructure of Foreign Exchange Markets "" by  Martin D.D. Evans‚Ä† Dagfinn Rime‚Ä°*  

Now the basic rule of thumb is, to reduce risk (notice i used the phrase reduce risk and not increase wins)

\- Risk is increased when shorting below a value range, unless a new lower value range has been created

\- Risk is decreased when longing below a value range, unless a new lower value range has been created

\- Risk is lower when positions yourself on volatility contractions (smaller equilibrium)

\- Risk is higher when going against the trend (even when you respect the value ranges)

\- Reduce your exposure to market noise by widening stop losses

\- Always use higher time frame charts like the daily when you are in your first years of trading. Scale down when you are justifying your entry using whatever strategy you have  


Each trade is unique. Each entry is unique. Each stop loss is unique. Each pattern behaves uniquely. One pattern can one time lead to a range, one time go up and another time go down. Your most and primary objective should always be to reduce risk and exposure. Do not patternize the market, treat it uniquely. Do not build patterns in your head that say ""Whenever it does x and y I will buy"". Take risk and exposure into consideration every time and with a proper strategy and money management system you **cannot** fail.",finance

First of all let me underline the fact that I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. This is merely the result of some of my due diligence that I am sharing with you because I believe that if we succeed together as a community the future of crypto will be even brighter. I‚Äôm simply looking at the number and trying to apply common sense. I also look forward to reading your constructive opinions.

**The Buffet indicator (above)**

Will show the disconnection between the Market Cap (stock market) and the GPD (economy) in the USA. When at 100% it means the Market and the GDP are in Balance. Above, the market it's overvalued and under the market is undervalued. As you can see from the graph‚Äôs last update in Q3 -2020 we are were then at 160.3% the biggest disconnection since this charts exists or since 1970‚Ä¶ This does not factor in Q4 -2020 and the stimulus of Biden. We could well be at 170 or 180% at the time of this post.

Now as the graph shows with the internet bubble of 2001 when the disconnection between the Stock Market and the Economy is too important it eventually has to reconnect. And this can happen in two ways:

* The GPD (economy) growth has to outpace that of the sock market to gently close the gap to something more sustainable. But this requires a strong economy not hampered by a pandemic.
* The stock market corrects more or less brutally.

**But what is the link with Crypto?**

Well as most of us have experienced in March 2020 if the stock market corrects too fast it takes down crypto in its fall even more brutally.

**But it will just rebound like in March 2020 right after the crash!**

Two of the mean reasons why the market rebounded in March 2020 so quickly is because of the strong moves from the FED with interest rates back to zero and all the money printing. Eventually the US will have to stop printing money at this rate (the US has printed 30% of the total volume of USD in just 2020 alone) and interest can‚Äôt go much lower than zero (although there are talks about negative interest rates).

**So here is what I think could happen:**

When the US stops printing money and the stock market‚Äôs rally loses strength we will be walking on very thin ice. Note this could take months if not most of 2021. But at that point we‚Äôll be at risk of a serious market correction that is very likely to take the crypto market down in its fall.

**What will trigger the stock market correction?**

This is the one million BTC question. Nobody knows when or what could trigger the correction.

**Great so what should we do?**

Enters a bit of risk management and DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging):

* Take some profits
* Progressively DCA out when your coins create new all-time highs
* Keep an eye on intertest rates and money printing in the USA
* Keep an eye on the above Warren Buffet Indicator
* Don‚Äôt invest money you can‚Äôt afford to lose

Last but certainly not least, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm very bullish on the future of Cryptos, I truly believe it‚Äôs the future and that DeFi and DeEx will change the financial markets as we know them. But I also want to have a bit of cash at my disposal should a correction come so that I can double down on my positions. A bit of risk management when we create all those new ATHs would allow that.

Good luck with your investments and may we all thrive together!

**TLDR;**

The US stock market is more disconnected from the US GDP than ever. When the FED stops printing money it could reconnect quite brutally. When it does it will take the crypto market in its fall. Apply caution, have an exit strategy DCA out and take profits.",cryptocurrency

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak

&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&amp;P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.

&gt; * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.

&gt; # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4

&gt; * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.

&gt; * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM‚Äôs crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.

Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is ‚Äúbigger than any one account,‚Äù said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

*****

&gt; # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments

&gt; * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump‚Äôs second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he‚Äôs no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.

stocks,Are High-Dividend ETFs a good investment for me at 23 years old? (SDIV and SDEM),"Hello, guys. I am 23 years old with around 10-11k in savings right now. I am reading a lot about passive income because I have some short term goals I would love to see fulfilled in the next few months or years. One of the things I came across was high-dividend ETFs, where the stocks are already diversified, so I wouldn't need to scramble to make and meticulously observe my own custom portfolio. It generally follows the S&amp;P, although the bounceback hasn't been quite as high as the S&amp;P since the pandemic plummet. But, the SDIV has a dividend yield of around 10.77%.

My savings account has a very low interest rate, like less than 1%, and I'd love to move the money somewhere else with a higher yield. My thought process is, if I can put my 10k in a portfolio of high-dividend stocks or a high yield ETF, and add $400-500 to it every month, my dividend yield amount will compound along with my personal contributions, and it will build up quite quickly. I'd go from $80 a month to $100 a month in just 4 months. And it would keep on building from my understanding.

The SDIV has also been around since 2011, I don't think it's going to go anywhere. I'd want to do more due diligence, but is this a good plan overall if the SDIV checks out in terms of sustainability?",finance

investing,Market Outlook Post Earnings,"Hey guys,

The reason for this post is to just create a discussion on your market outlook and how you‚Äôre preparing for such outlook. I came across some data that inspired this post which states that of the 81% of companies to  have reported earnings this quarter, they by average beaten estimates by 15.2% higher. This has made the forward P/E about 22.1. Although still highly valued definitely not as high as other previous data. So I believe that maybe the market rally we saw coming last year into this one was about higher earnings despite COVID, and with that theory realized we might see either a sideways push or a correction in the near future. I am just preparing for this by keeping 10% of my account in cash to snatch some stocks in case of a pullback, and of course 90% I will remain invested because despite my own outlook the market may continue its rally higher due to lower rates and dovish fed stance. I will also keep dividends in cash to maximize reserves and increase opportunity.

personalfinance,Refinancing parents' mortgage,"Hi all,

I'll try to keep this brief. My (22 F) parents own a house that they bought a few years ago at a 4.7% interest rate. It's a rental property in a decently large city, which of course has been hit hard by COVID. They had been struggling to make mortgage payments before, but are especially struggling now due to reduced rent and lack of tenants. I have been paying off their mortgage since the beginning of COVID in order to help them out, and brought up the idea of refinancing with them. They would love to refinance, but their main problem is that they haven't filed their taxes since 2011, and quite honestly are not very organized people; I'm not under the impression that they're going to get their information together to catch up on their taxes despite my pleadings. In order to help them out in this regard, I was thinking that they could sign me on to the deed and the mortgage and that would allow them to refinance because I have good credit and up to date tax records. I'm pretty open to any combination of me assuming partial ownership/full ownership in order to refinance and also help them pay down their mortgage faster, or just any advice on this situation in general because it's a burden for by myself and for my parents.

My main questions in this circumstance are the following:

1. If I become a partial owner of the house, will their inability to produce their tax records hinder a refinancing process? Or would I have to become a sole owner?
2. Who would be the appropriate person to approach about this situation from a legal standpoint to get the ball rolling? For instance, in order to become an owner of the house, what officially needs to be done, and what parties would need to be involved (i.e. real estate brokers, lawyers, etc)?
3. Is there a difference between buying their house from them vs having them sign over the deed/mortgage? What do these two processes look like?
4. Anything else I should know? I'm not as well versed as I would like to be in terms of real estate/ real estate law lol, so forgive me Redditors if this isn't even a feasible situation!

Thank you in advance friends, and let me know if I need to provide clarifying details :)",finance
Forex,How to approach forex trading with fundamental analysis,"# Problem

You think fundamentals are important but you don't know how to start? What is the right way to assess any economic number rather it is good or bad for the economy appearing in the economic calendar? I want to present a good way for this problem.

# Solution

A good way to find out what the released data is telling is to score every economic number according  if it is **normal** or **abnormal**.

To determine this we will work with the mean and standard deviation. Here an example:

[Everything what falls between -1 and +1 standard deviation is normal. We will score them with lower numbers. Any number outside is abnormal and gets a higher score.](https://preview.redd.it/73lwbnez5og61.png?width=1648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6f0981c98804c1d716e6fe4aeb98a2d466e7d7e)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[As we can see in our histogram, 74,68&amp;#37; of all data falls between our first standard deviation. 97,44&amp;#37; of all the released data falls between the second standard deviation.](https://preview.redd.it/re7xpr858og61.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a2715906e57176e4c787cf3e9b114b95025b4e5)

[As you can see, what we do now is determining the mean of all CPI m\/m data with the score of 0. 2 positive standard deviations gets a score of 10. 1.5 negative standard deviations is scored with an -8. Anything above 2 positive standard deviations and beneath 1.5 standard deviations we expect an intervention of the Federal Reserve.](https://preview.redd.it/34qugl0z8og61.png?width=127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e0d917e1470692b7c5a54e37a2101a10bb9b997)

&amp;#x200B;

**This approach is what we do for any important data which is released for each country.**

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,"Continue to make extra truck payments, or pay off in full?","Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

A little over 2 years ago I bought a used truck, it was around $28,500. My minimum payment was somewhere around $450, and my APR is 2.90%. I put down I believe $3,000 - reducing my loan to about $25,000.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been consistently paying anywhere from $600 - $700 per month, sometimes as high as $700/$800 to pay it off as quickly as I could.

&amp;#x200B;

In present day, my total payoff balance as of today is $8,811.99 (excluding the $650 I just started payment on).  

&amp;#x200B;

I have roughly $27,000 in the bank. Once I pay all of my bills, it'll probably be closer to $25,000.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to get a $4,000 ""COVID"" bonus from work (pre-tax), and I should getting my yearly bonus. I don't know what it will be, but last year it was around $7,000 and it can be as high as about $9,000 - $10,000. Of course, it could be lower, or $0.00.

&amp;#x200B;

The only debts I have are my truck payment, my mortgage, and my credit card. My credit card I pay off monthly. I use it for every purchase I can and then I pay it off in full to take advantage of credit card points. My *typical* credit card bill is approximately $1,500 / month, but can sometimes be higher if there was something out of the ordinary I bought.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been considering taking all of the bonus money I'll be receiving and simply paying off the truck immediately - and then taking those payments to rebuild my savings. I was always planning on pretending I didn't have that extra ""payment"" anyway, and putting it in my savings - but now I'm thinking about paying it off in full.

&amp;#x200B;

However I'm unsure if maybe I should wait until it's paid off a bit lower since the interest rate isn't horrible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of me says I should pay it off in bulk, but then there's a small part that says having that extra money squirreled away ""just in case"" is a better idea. Girlfriend thinks I should pay it off.

I guess I'm looking for extra thoughts

Anyway my mortgage servicer sent me spam about a promotion they're doing with quicken loans for refinancing. I figured I'd give them a call and hear some numbers associated with it. I expected to be underwhelmed and turn it down but the opposite is true. They're offering me a reduction to 2.875% and estimated closing costs are only $4,200. I'm going to be double checking all of their math in terms of my payments but they say that means $110 a month less an interest paid. I know that means my payment doesn't go down by 110 it goes down by more like 80 because of increased principle but I'm fine with that. Principal payments I view as an investment and a positive thing.

We are currently contributing up to that match level in her account, but nothing to my 403b. Our gross income is right around $170,000 combined and my wife owes \~$300,000 in student loan debt across 10 loans with interest rates between 5.31% and 6.84%.

The prime directive mentions paying off high interest debt before contributing more to a 401k above the match. I agree with that overall, but I feel like the return on the investments could be higher than the interest we're saving by paying off the loans earlier. Especially in tax sheltered accounts like 401k and 403b where we're reducing our tax burden at the same time. 

I think that 6.84% is too high to delay paying off and 5.31% is too low to rush to pay off, but there are 8 other loans with rates in between the two extremes. I'm struggling to figure out where to draw the line between maxing out money towards student loan debt and maxing out those tax sheltered retirement accounts. Any suggestions about how we should approach this?",finance

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/fed-chair-powell-citing-bleak-jobs-picture-says-policy-will-need-to-stay-patiently-accommodative.html

&gt; The real unemployment rate in the U.S. is closer to 10 percent, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday, after misclassification errors are factored in to the official government figure. The current unemployment rate, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics last week, is 6.3 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We are still very far from a strong labor market whose benefits are broadly shared,"" Powell said, in a virtual speech for the Economic Club of New York on the state of the labor market. ""The pandemic has led to the largest 12-month decline in labor force participation since at least 1948,"" he said.
&gt; 
&gt; While the national unemployment rate has fallen from its March peak of 14.8 percent, it is still much higher than its pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate in February 2020, before the coronavirus took hold of the economy, was just 3.5 percent, the lowest level in almost 50 years.

&gt; ‚ÄúGiven the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some will struggle to find work in the post-pandemic economy, achieving and sustaining maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy,‚Äù Powell said, stressing the importance of low interest rates. ‚ÄúIt will require a society-wide commitment,‚Äù he added.

personalfinance,Advice regarding my restricted stock options in a pre ipo company.,"Seeking advice on a throwaway account so I can be more transparent with my financials.

Hi kind personalfinance folks, seeking some advice here regarding my restricted stock options in a pre ipo company.

I am a Director level employee at a pre IPO company. Prior to hire I negotiated a private equity heavy compensation package resulting in a 60,000 restricted stock options grant over a 4 year vesting period (25% cliff year 1, equal monthly vest month 13- year 4). I am currently 16 months into my employment with the company. Currently I have a option strike price of $7.77

While I am 100% not disclosed on any details related to when/if the company would IPO, I believe based on publicly available financials (fund raising rounds / amounts, etc) that the company is likely to IPO within the next 8-18 months.

Currently the FMV of the shares are less than my current strike price. This is very attractive to me as I believe that exercising my vested stocks at current FMV (at a loss) would allow me to minimize my income tax liability, while allowing me to begin holding the shares to shorten the amount of time post IPO I would need to hold before I could hit long term capital gains threshold.

Here come the questions.

1. The capital required to exercise my options is about \~200k, and far more than I have liquidly available. I could liquidate all my stocks and equities but am very apprehensive in doing so. Is there an instrument that a financial institution would provide someone in my position in order to capitalize my strike?
2. How do you view the risk of exercising my vested options knowing they are restricted. For me the most obvious risk is that the company doesn't go public in the timeline I hypothesize and I'm subject to interest on whatever loan I would need to take to exercise. I acknowledge that there is a risk that the company never goes public. In my mind on the small chance that would happen it would mean that a private equity firm would come in within 2 years and dismantle the company for assets. At that point I would expect my shares to be purchased or converted by the PE firm. Is this correct from a process perspective. Specifically is a PE acquisition going to provide liquidity? Is there data on what a PE typically pays for shares vs FMV? I assume pennies on the dollar.
3. I know these are questions I need to ask to a financial advisor, and I've asked mine and gotten C+ answers. To my financial advisor's credit he told me pre IPO option grants are not a specialty of his and that there are people who do specialize in this line of work particular to tech companies. Is there a gold standard firm who I can consult? Where are good resources for me to learn more.

If you've made it this far THANK YOU!!! This could literally be the biggest financial decision I ever have to make.

Forex,What Spreads Are and Why They Are So Important,"[https://youtu.be/839UlSa6F54](https://youtu.be/839UlSa6F54)

The spread is the difference in interest rate payed out between two different assets. But the spreads that are especially taken in consideration by economists and regulators are the spreads between different government bonds. In order to calculate these spreads are usually used bonds that are considered risk-free like the US Treasury Bond or the German Bund. On the other side we take government bonds of countries that are considered riskier. The increase in the spread of the returns between the two financial products are usually sign of fear in the market place towards the riskier country‚Äôs ability to pay out its debt. For example, spreads between Germany and southern Europe countries strongly increased during the sovereign debt crisis that followed the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. When fear comes into place investors sell off bonds of risky issuers which causes interest rates to go even higher and making the crisis even worse, until a regulatory entity steps in. In the case we made previously, it was the European Central Bank which solved the problem. A strong rise in interest rates can cause very bad consequences for the overall economy because both individuals and companies will have to pay higher interests on their debts. This causes people to consume less and, in the end, people start losing jobs and companies go bankrupt and default on their debts. This means that it‚Äôs very important to insure stability.  If the rise in interest rates is dictated by the central bank instead, it‚Äôs usually done in order to contrast inflation so that people are more incentivized to save money rather than spending and using less leverage. This also pushes investors to go from riskier investments like stocks to safer bonds. This usually causes a drop in equities prices.",finance

I need to buy a new car because the amount it would cost to fix is a third of what is worth and has been needing very costly repairs for the last year or so.

## What is long-term capital gains tax?

Long-term capital gains tax¬†is a tax on¬†profits from the sale of an asset held for more than a year. The long-term capital gains tax rate is 0%, 15% or 20% depending on your taxable income and filing status. They are generally lower than short-term capital gains tax rates.

## EXAMPLE

## 2020 Long-term capital gains tax rates

**Single filers**

Tax rate .... Your income

0% ...  $0 to $40,000

15%  ...  $40,001 to $441,450

20%  ...  $441,451 or more

Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income according to [federal income tax brackets](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets/).

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409)

## Capital Gain Tax Rates

The tax rate on most net capital gain is no higher than **15%** for most individuals. Some or all net capital gain may be taxed at 0% if your taxable income is less than $80,000.

A capital gain rate of **15%** applies if your taxable income is $80,000 or more but less than

$441,450 for single;

$496,600  for married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er);

$469,050 for head of  household, or

$248,300 for married filing separately.

However, a net capital gain tax rate of **20%** applies to the extent that your taxable income exceeds the thresholds set for the **15%** capital gain rate.

**Note:** Net short-term capital gains are subject to taxation as ordinary income at graduated tax rates.

## IRS Treatment of Cryptocurrency

The IRS  addressed the taxation of cryptocurrency transactions in Notice 2014-21,  which provides that cryptocurrency is treated as property for federal  tax purposes. Therefore, general tax principles that apply to property  transactions must be applied to exchanges of cryptocurrencies as well.  Notice 2014-21 holds that taxpayers must recognize gain or loss on the  exchange of cryptocurrency for cash or for other property. Accordingly,  gain or loss is recognized every time that cryptocurrency is sold or  used to purchase goods or services. How the gain or loss is recognized  depends largely on the type of transaction conducted and the length of  time the position was held.

## Settled for cash.

Cryptocurrency  gains from trading coins held as capital assets are treated as  investment income by the IRS, and the same capital gains rules apply. A  taxpayer who sells a coin position for cash must report a capital gain  on Form 8949. A coin position held for one year or less is considered a  short-term capital gain, taxed at ordinary tax rates; a position held  for more than one year is considered a long-term capital gain.

\-The company operates as an iBuyer of real estate properties, mostly residential properties. They allow property sellers to put in information of their properties and make online offers instantaneously, claiming that total expenditure of selling via Opendoor would be much cheaper than hiring a real estate agent. After purchase they will renovate the property and sell them online. They also offer home loans and refinancing of mortgages.

\-They currently offer services in 23 cities in USA, mostly in West Coast, Midwest, Central Atlantic and Southern states. The company claims it has serviced more than 80,000 home owners. The company sold more than 18,000 properties in 2019.

\-Revenue for 2019 reached $4.74 billion. Despite the pandemic, revenue in first three quarters of 2020 reached $2.3 billion and operating loss diminished by more than 34% to $119 million.

\- Catherine Wood's ARKW bought a lot of the stocks. As of Feb.3 the ETF holds approximately 4.24 million shares of OPEN (1.63% of ARKW portfolio).

My personal pros:

\-Online exchange of real estate properties only take up 1% of total property deals in USA. It could be the next big thing in online purchase like online car selling and buying.

\-The company pledges to expand its mortgage business and with the booming housing market due to low interest rates it could add to the company's operating incoming.

\-The company is yet to move into housing market in New England and Northeastern states and when they do it would be a lot more growth space for their business.

My personal cons:

\-The management has stated that the company might not turn profit until 2023. (That being said, it seems many popular stocks nowadays are attractive for their future prospects, not current profits)

\-The recent hype of the stock could be attributed to recent buyings of ARKW.

\-The company's current business mode depends heavily on huge cash flows to buy properties for cheap and provide mortgages. Sudden circumstance changes (failure of securing cash input, Fed raises interest rates, resurgence of pandemic, luekwarm economic recovery e.t.c.) could take a heavy toll on the company's business.

personalfinance,How should I allocate my money/investments?,"Hello everyone,

I am a 24-year-old, single male who is currently living in the Minneapolis area. I got a master's degree last December and started my first job as a software engineer this January. I am currently making $70000 year before tax, or about $4400 after tax (before putting money in 401k or any investment).

But because of the master's degree, I have an $81K federal student loan with an annual interest rate of 6%, which means I need to pay almost $1K per month for the next 10 years. Luckily, I have a relative that is willing to pay half of that on a monthly basis, and I will only need to start my first payment in September because of the new policy on the federal student loan. 

I got my bachelor's degree in another country, which adds an additional $20k student loan with a 0% interest rate, and the first payment also starts in September (the monthly fee is about $140).

Because I need to drive to work, I bought a car with a car loan. The monthly fee is about $330 and lasts for 63 months. I plan to keep using this car until it is broken (not planning to buy a new car at least for the next 5~10 years).

Combining all the debts I have, I need to pay about $970 per month.

My current rent is about $1100 per month, and the lease ends at the beginning of this August.

My company offers 401k plan, and the policy is 50% match up to 6% of my salary. The company uses Principal as the servicer of the 401k account. My company offers three 401k plans: traditional, Roth, and after-tax (not Roth).


I got a few questions regarding my current situation:
1. Should I wait for the $10K loan cancellation proposed by the new government? Or I should refinance before the first payment?
2. Should I move to a cheaper apartment for my next lease? Or the current rent is reasonable?
3. How should my money be allocated? I have seen the wiki page and the flowchart from this subreddit, and below is my current plan: (by order)
    1. Get full match for Roth 401k
    2. Pay rent/debts/credit card balances every month
    3. Save up 3-6 month of emergency fund
    4. Max out HSA
    5. Max out Roth IRA
    6. Max out Roth 401k
    7. Max out After-tax 401k

    Does this plan make sense? Is there anything that I missed?
4. For my Principal 401k account, there are tons of investment options for me to choose from, which is overwhelming, even I have already looked at the wiki page about it. I tried to use the RetireView function, and it recommended a portfolio based on my preferences. Should I simply use the portfolio? Or is there an effective way to choose my investment option?

The IPO lockup period expires in 2021, so in several months I'll suddenly receive a bunch of stock.  The company is allowing me to **choose between a low (22%) or high (37%) federal tax withholding rate**.  That is, they'll withhold that fraction of shares and pay their value as tax on my behalf, leaving me to work out any further tax payment needed.  Withheld shares' value will be set as the stock price at market close the day prior.

Which rate should I choose?

**First thought: low**, because it's an interest-free loan on remaining tax owed.  I can sell the extra shares myself, invest the proceeds elsewhere, and won't have to pay taxes until April 15th, 2022.

**Second thought: high**, because many fellow employees will sell on lockup expiration day, injecting supply and depressing price.  So I should ""sell""\* as much as I can at market close the day before (via withholding) to minimize capital loss.

I currently have a Roth IRA with Vanguard.

PUTTING MONEY IN

1b) Assuming part 1a) is yes, if my income in January 2021 was $500, can I put that $500 towards 2020 --since the deadline for 2020 contributions is April 2021-- or is the contribution based on the year in which you make the income?



TAKING MONEY OUT

2a) If I haven't invested anything, i.e. the money is still in my ""settlement funds""  (Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund) if I take it out, will it affect anything (ie, I have to pay a penalty, etc)?

2b) I've been reading a lot about being able to safely take ""contributions"" out but I wanted to clarify what constitutes a ""contribution."" I'm assuming that ""contributions"" include both the money you have invested and the money that you put in the Roth IRA but just haven't invested yet (so basically your contribution is all the money that you've put into your Roth IRA from your income).

personalfinance,"Instead of health/motor/life etc insurance, i contribute 25% of my pay into an emergency fund bank account. My friends think i'm crazy...am I?","first of, i live in a country with free healthcare, so no million dollar hospital bills like in America.

I always find insurance to really annoy me:  
You pay money every month to some company, then when you have an accident they will either deny your claim for some inconspicuous reason, or the overheads will be a huge chunk anyway. And then in a time of stress/emergency, sometimes the insurance company will just go bankrupt and no one gets covered. 

So, since i was about 17 i started putting 25% of my pay into an account with a reasonable interest rate instead of getting insurance. These days the account is big enough to rival my home loan deposit, and it grows reliably every week as my income instantly gets siphoned into this account.

So far, in 10 years i have had to access it twice. Once when i was in a car crash and once when i chipped a tooth.

I'm filling out income forms at the moment for my home loan application and i'm feeling a little self conscious putting down $0 on all questions pertaining to insurance expenses.

Am i crazy for dealing with my insurances in this way?",finance
personalfinance,"First real job, no 401K. Help me save more effectively!","Hi, I'm a recent college grad trying to make responsible plans for my future. I'm hoping to get advice on saving for retirement and long term goals without a 401K. 

Income: My chosen career path is farming, which means my budget looks a little different than what I often see on this sub. I just accepted a position making $15/hr, and I'll work about 40 hours a week, with time and a half for overtime. Online calculators tell me to expect about $1,800/month take home pay. 

Expenses: My ""rent"" is only $175 a month because I live with my partner's family. I am paying car insurance yearly ($800), own my car (but will need a new one in the next 3 years), and am still on my parents health insurance and phone bill. I will get a lottt of free food from my job. My rough budget says I have about $600/month in expenses. My student loans are federal and currently in covid deferment, but the total balance is $14,000 and monthly payments would be about $150. 

Savings: I have about $30,000 in a savings account with .03% interest. I've saved this money through my part time and full time jobs, since I have been lucky to have family support that allows me to have a very low cost of living. I have just opened a Roth IRA and a money market account through betterment. I am currently putting $100/month in the money market and I haven't decided how much to put in the Roth. I have no current plans for my long term savings, but I imagine the money might be used for a down payment on a house, a wedding, or to eventually go to grad school. 

My questions: I've always been good at saving/not spending money, but I feel ready to start taking investing more seriously. I like the simplicity of automatically transferring money to betterment, and I do not want to make day to day choices about stocks. About how much should I be putting into long term investing and the Roth? Also, if student loans don't get forgiven, should I pay off my loans in full with my savings? Any other advice is also welcome.  I know I am lucky to have so much support from my family and my partner's family, and I hope to use the next few years to ensure that I can support a stable future for myself.",finance
economy,Potential problems in the bond market?,"Bond yield increases typically show signs of inflation which is typically met by the fed increasing interest rates. This is followed by a decline in stocks and an increase in bond prices (decrease in yields)

However 2020 has proven to be different. Yields have risen and mirrored the s&amp;p since March 2020 fairly accurately. This means that the bond market expects inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes - but we know that the FED is not even thinking about thinking about raising rates until at least 2023. 

The inflation worries pull investors out of bonds and into stocks as a hedge, which sends bond prices down and yields up. Yields are so high it‚Äôs economically impossible for the government to pay out. Yield to maturity is down slightly but the interest payments cripple the governments ability to pay off its debts.

Does this lead to a default in US treasuries where the fed has to come to the rescue again and further disorientate the markets or do interest rates actually rise which destroy the banking system and send down the fed‚Äôs already fragile and precious stock market?

How is a currency system with a hard cap on its supply going to accommodate economic growth? Is the assumption that the price of bitcoin would consistently rise with long-run GDP growth? And wouldn‚Äôt a currency with structurally increasing purchasing power discourage investment? My understanding of the benefits of something like the gold standard isn‚Äôt that it fixes the supply of currency, but puts a logistical cap on the amount of new money that can enter the system at any given time. You can theoretically expand the money supply under the gold standard, but doing so would be prohibitively expensive. What am I missing here?",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,WHY DOGECOIN SUPPLY IS NOT INFINITE,"So I have seen two major questions floating around. The first question is this. Question: Mining Dogecoin and how new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. Is there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer: mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let‚Äôs compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let‚Äôs compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That‚Äôs without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time. But in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency this doesn‚Äôt matter. In fact it‚Äôs actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is 40,000 dollars and the price per Dogecoin is .07 with a realistic possibility of only reaching $288.60 at current market conditions. That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That‚Äôs why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. 

Next question: 

Question: Is getting Dogecoin to increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Can and will it really happen? What will change if it does happen? How high can Dogecoin realistically rise in price? Market cap explanation and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. 
	
Answer: Yes, despite not having a fixed or capped supply, the value of the currency can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.

Market cap = price x supply. Price is determined by supply and demand (buying snd selling of Dogecoin. Supply is determined by mining Dogecoin. 

The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is 9,000,000,000 (9 billion). if Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of 128 billion dollars. Since the current supply of Dogecoin Is 128 billion in circulation. Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency currently has a market cap of approximately 700,000,000,000 (700 billion dollars). This means that at $1 the total supply of Dogecoin would be ‚Äúworth‚Äù about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is 2,000,000,000 (2 trillion) since 1 dollar = 1 dollar (LOLZ) the market cap of the US currency is 2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach this market cap - the price can be calculated through dividing the market cap (2 trillion) by the supply (128 billion). This means that dogecoin would equal the entire US currency‚Äôs (M0 money supply in economics) at $15.60. This is definitely not impossible but highly highly improbable to ever reach this value any time soon. As in like 3-10 years away minimum. Now the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (paper) currency is 37 trillion dollars. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value would be $288.60 This is the theoretical limit to how much Dogecoin can be worth due simply to the fact that if it was valued at anymore than that amount it would be ‚Äúworth‚Äù more than the entire world‚Äôs paper currencies combined which is not possible without adding more supply. It‚Äôs important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change. 

Thank you for reading this entire post. I have cleared up this misconception and many other misconceptions in my misconceptions regarding Dogecoin article here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lfhomy/misconceptions_regarding_dogecoin_revised_version/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf  I will be posting an update 1.2 version later on.

gaming,Why did Greatest Hits die out and how could it be brought back?,"For those of you who are too young, back in the day a program existed for PlayStation called Greatest Hits. This is where they'd print new copies of a high selling game with a special label and sell them for $20. 

Itt was the game publisher's choice as to whether or not they wanna give their game a Greatest Hits release. But back in the PS1-PS3 days, almost every game that qualifed for a Greatest Hits release got one.

The program opened on PS1 in 1997, with Greatest Hits games originally costing $25. The requirements for a game to have a Greatest Hits release were that the game had to sell 150,000 copies and be out on the market for at least 1 year. 

Later on, they upped the minimum sales requirement to 250,000 copies and lowered the price of Greatest Hits games down to $20.

The program opened on PS2 in 2002, with Greatest Hits games costing $20. Any game that sold at least 400,000 copies and was out on the market for at least 1 year could qualify for a Greatest Hits release on PS2.

The program opened on PS3 in 2008, with Greatest Hits games costing $30. Any game that sold at least 500,000 copies and was out on the market for at least 10 months could qualify for a Greatest Hits release on PS3.

You can technically say the program exists on PS4, but it's very rarely used with PS4 games, and only Sony produced games seem to use it at all now. It also took 5 years to open up on PS4, compared to the 2 years it took on prior PlayStations (the program opened on PS4 in 2018, with Greatest Hits games costing $20. The minimum sales requirements for this have not been made public however).

I think it'd be smart for them to bring Greatest Hits back to how it was in the PS1-PS3 days. Games have all kinds of DLC, microtransactions, battle passes, and other paid content, and if a game got a Greatest Hits release people could save money on buying the base game and have more incentive to buy the extra content.

Of course the qualifying sales threshold would have to be made higher, maybe about 1,000,000 copies sold after 1 year.

CryptoMarkets,"The Rule of 72, How Long Till I Double My Money?","One of my favorite nuggets I came away from my time in college was learning about the rule of 72. Basically, you can figure how long it will take to double your investment by dividing your interest rate into 72. So for example, If I invest $10,000 and make 10% interest each year, I will double my money in 7.2 years (72/10 = 7.2).

Now fast forward to the cryptoverse where you can make 5-10% gains in the course of a few minutes. Now, you can apply this same concept and double your stack in a fraction of the time. Compound interest is a beautiful thing.

With that being said, some people can not handle trading and should just HODL. You know yourself best.

\*\*Full disclosure: I own 75k in Toyota calls. I also own a Porsche and Audi (no Toyota products). I‚Äôm also not good with investing. So don‚Äôt listen to me.

Wow, some of the best plays truly are right in front of you, because Toyota is hilariously undervalued now that they‚Äôve decided to enter the EV market.

Toyota, is an engineering and business legend. Nobody engineers better than Toyota, nobody optimizes businesses and Toyota.

When I went through business school we studied Toyota in almost ever classroom. Toyota practically invented modern business practices and engineering practices.

If you haven‚Äôt heard of Toyota as a professional in business or engineering, you should probably be fired.

The following statements may sound like opinions, I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre facts.

\- Dominates the manufacturing supply practice. Nothing is wasted in Toyota‚Äôs business, everything runs **LEAN and AGILE.** During economic downturns Toyota will always come out on top simply  because they‚Äôve **perfected** the art of **efficiency**.

\- The finest engineers work at Toyota. Everything Toyota produces is an engineering marvel. Products optimized perfectly for each single demographic to be as affordable and reliable as possible  while being practical and usable.

Today, Toyota officially entered the EV business. The company with a perfect supply chain, the company with the highest amount of consumer trust, the company that has the finest engineers in the entire automotive industry and a practically infinite amount of wealth‚Ä¶has entered the room. So let‚Äôs look at their positioning.

\- Toyota is bound to be a huge recipient of the Biden‚Äôs plan to supply the federal government with EVs.

\- Fun fact, the top ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù companies are asian. The big three make most of their junk abroad.

\- Toyota is planning on being the **first** to deploy the **SOLID STATE BATTERY.**

**- MASSIVE Energy density** compared to existing technology.

\- Solid state batteries can easily reach **500+ mile range.**

\- **Much** faster charge time.

\- Have already begun the production process

\- Toyota plans on unveiling the first solid state powered EV this year with release soon after.

\- Toyota produces over 10,000,000 vehicles a year. Tesla reached 500,000 this year with a goal of 20% growth a year.

\- Toyota is the most trusted brand internationally in the automotive world.

So Toyota, a manufacturing behemoth is switching to fully electric with aims of putting their world class engineers to produce the world‚Äôs first solid state battery commercial vehicle. Nice.

Let‚Äôs talk about some numbers:

\- Price to book ratio of 1.137. Anything under 3 is considered undervalued. Tesla is around 40.

\- PE ratio of 17.17. Anything under 20 is undervalued, Apple is at 37 and **Tesla is 1301.**

**-** Expected to increase margin from 5.5 -&gt; 7.2

* 121% increase in operating income from China
* 24% Increase in cash/cash equivalents since Apr 2019. Impressive considering covid
* Relatively stable/balanced asset/liability ratio, has barely budged since covid).
* Has somehow decreased cost and expenses by 16% during covid.

If Tesla is the King Kong of the EV world, then Toyota is Godzilla, a nuclear powered dinosaur of a company from outer space. He‚Äôs landed and he‚Äôs gonna blow up your bubble. Yes I‚Äôm aware of the ‚ÄúNot just a car company‚Äù phrase, but as Burry said, ‚ÄúEnjoy it while it lasts‚Äù, because no company should be trading with a century of growth priced in.

**Firstly, let me say that this is specific advise for a short term play (in and out by next Friday latest) and I think there is serious (75-125% returns in 1 week) profit potential still left on the table even at current after hours prices.**

My total position atm is

500 $TLRY Average $20.8  
1200 $APHA Average $10.1

I'm aiming to hold TLRY until \~$145 per stock and APHA to \~$45 per stock

The reason I would recommend people to still enter the stock atm

1. A lot of potential for more upside, just 1 piece of good news/announcement/tweet could send this rocketing up  
**2) Lunar New Year is happening this weekend and stocks historically tend to go up right after. This might seem insignificant but it's actually quite a big factor since a lot of Asian countries like Korean, Japan, HK, Singapore have many wealthy retail traders who are just now getting news of this rush and are starting to buy now/over the next few days. A bit like how the international rush of money into GME only happened a bit after the US rush**

Not to directly compare this to the rush of money into the ""over shorted meme stocks"" recently, but if there was a time period comparison, I would say we are currently at the equivalent point of Friday, 22 Jan at the moment. 1 big catalyst coming out such as Elon Musk tweeting, a Republican senator supporting federal legalization, etc and we'll see a massive upwards surge into the \~$150 range for TLRY.  
Even without an obvious catalyst, I think there will be a natural surge over next few days and the weekend to \~$100 because of later buyers entering now, especially from international countries.

The reason I would recommend new entrants atm to buy TLRY over APHA is

1. Short ammount (TLRY is much more shorted, \~50%. This opens the door to a chain effect situation where continued price increase will force shorts to cover and lead to even greater returns)
2. Hype, TLRY is the headline name (kinda like GME was for the WSB situation) and this means that in general for the next few days-week, it will likely go up higher/faster than APHA so if you're in for short term gains, choose this

This is partly caused by the fact that the eventual ticker after the merger will be TLRY

3) If Elon Musk/some other notable influencer does a positive tweet, he/she is most likely to reference TLRY and this could cause an instant huge bump in stock price which will affect TLRY much more than the other marijuana stocks",finance
CryptoCurrency,February Boom,"Hey all,
I‚Äôve started to notice that everyone in their isolated crypto communities have been celebrating nearly-mooning. At which point I began to notice that almost all Cryptos experienced a massive boom starting pretty much right on February the 1st.

Eg:

NANO from $1 to $4.5
And DOGE infamously from 1 Doge = 1 Doge to $.08c

All within a fortnight. That‚Äôs hundreds of billions in value added.

Does anyone have any analysis or possible explanation for the sudden uptick in interest and investment into the crypto sphere? Is it run-off from the Gamestop madness?

CryptoCurrency,Crypto no longer in control of the many?,"Decentralization was the main goal of crypto, where the people have a say with how things are run and what they like and don't like, instead of the few elite controlling everything. 

It is no secret that governments and companies are getting into digital currency and they were long before these big headlines of them announcing they bought bitcoin. They been buying them up, and wait for a good time to announce it and then watch the price rocket up and sell.

Most popular platforms are centralized such as binance, crypto.com, celcius, nexo, coinbase, ect. Yes their are DeFi platforms, but the number of your average person using those are very small in comparison. 

We can try and fight the powerful centralized platforms, but they have the established elites on their side. They control what we see and don't see with censorship. They push articles saying ""buy this, and sell this"". And if there is a platform that starts being a serious contender to them, they will start throwing their weight/money/influence around to make sure they will win out and their competition will be thrown out.

These things have happened already in these past few years. What's to stop them from carrying it over to the crypto world? With the FEDs printing the USD non-stop and throwing the value of the dollar into the dumpster, it's quite clear they intend to ditch the fiat currency and go digital. When that happens, they will throw their weight around pushing all DeFi out, saying we only accept these approved currency. 

So they will have these all in one bank type platforms, only accepting the tokens of the established elites and governments. You can only buy things from the monopolies (like the FAAMG) with the tokens that were accepted by these bank type platforms. Essentially, nothing will have changed except now everything is digital, they can see your every purchase, and you can only buy things from the establishment, killing all small businesses and competition.

ROI,"US Month: In Puerto Rico, fertility control was developed in the early 20th century.","Neo-Malthusianism ‚Äî the belief that poverty stems from the proliferation of the poor ‚Äî was a popularly held view throughout the West, notably by prominent U.S. officials and intellectuals, who also endorsed pseudo-scientific eugenics theories as a means to guarantee that only able-bodied, rich, white people were encouraged to reproduce.

The colonial governments in Puerto Rico and the U.S. were filled with people who believed these philosophies, Puerto Rico was deemed overpopulated, specifically by poor black and indigenous people. To solve the problem, government officials instituted policies that reduced births through sterilisation.

Starting in 1937, when Law 116, allowing eugenics-based sterilisation, passed in Puerto Rico, the U.S. federal government began subsidising and promoting the irreversible procedure on the archipelago. With additional encouragement from local industrial capitalists, who favoured sterilised labourers, and health workers, who went door-to-door imploring mothers who had two children to undergo hysterectomies or tubal ligations, sterilisation became so common and normalised that it was simply referred to as ‚Äúla operaci√≥n.‚Äù By 1953, nearly one-fifth of Puerto Rican women had received the free procedure. Many of them were unaware the surgery was irreversible. Over the course of three decades, the colonial government, under the Puerto Rican Eugenics Board, also ordered the sterilisation of people.

Puerto Rican women continue to have the highest rate of sterilisation in the world. Studies have concluded that the decision of Puerto Rican women to continue to undergo sterilisation is not voluntary, but rather conditioned by their socio-historical, economic and personal constraints.

personalfinance,Bank of America Home Loan,"Hi everyone,

I'm a first time home buyer and decided to out an offer for a house that is $188,000. I called BofA as my first option for home mortgage and due to some grants available, I decided to move forward with them.

My annual income is bad. I'm single and I make $28,000 a year. I got pre-approved by BofA. My credit score is 804 and my savings are $20,000. I'm putting down 3% and the interest rate for the loan is 2.875.

The process of underwriting has been going well. However, they asked to verify employment. As part of that conversation, the loan officer told me about debt-to-income ratio. My loan monthly payments will be $1179 and I make $2,333 a month. So, I'm at 50%. The loan officer said to submit the employment verification that he will work on it, but I am already frustrated. I have less than 2 weeks to close and I have a feeling that the debt-to-income ratio will be a reason to decline me last minute. Even though I have provided enough evidence to show that I pay $950 in rent currently and have been making payments diligently towards that every month for more than 3 years. And my credit score is 804.

I'm really stressing out. Has anybody experienced BofA for home loans? Is the debt-to-income a deal breaker??? Any insights???",finance

personalfinance,Is it usually a good idea to pay off a car loan early in lump sum? How is this calculated?,"I have the functional financial literacy of someone who took basic HS economics and college Eco101.

Last year my old car broke down during the pandemic.  As doctor who has to travel long distances in the middle of COVID, I took a car loan that's payable in 4 years on 16% interest while paying a 50% DP, so effectively paying the remaining half in 4 years.  At the time it was what I could afford for the foreseeable future as medical practice income went down during the pandemic.

Near the turn of the year however income went back up, as well as the larger hazard pays we get.  Thankfully I didn't get COVID (yet...) so this came to me as a windfall of sorts.  I'm now at a position to be able to actually pay off the car loan earlier than expected, less than a year into the loan.

I tried googling advice on early car loan repayment, however most of it seems mixed.  Some say that I'll save a good amount on the interest rates if I pay it as early as possible, while some say it'll be close to the same amount anyway when factoring in early payment and other miscellaneous fees.

Decided to ask here for advice if I could/should pay the car loan early.  Likewise I couldn't get info on how the recalculation of repayment will likely go, so if anyone can point me on how the lump sum repayment calculation will more or less be it would be great so I can make an estimate on how much money I should prepare for it.

This is in the Philippines btw.  Hoping that loan and bank policies aren't that different.  Thanks.",finance
economy,Protecting our wealth: Where's our safe haven?,"Hi, new member here. This might be a boring post, but I genuinely want to have a discussion with you all about what you think is the best way to protect our wealth.

Not a prerequisite, but this video helps set the tone for this discussion:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0&amp;list=PLE88E9ICdiphYjJkeeLL2O09eJoC8r7Dc&amp;index=4&amp;ab\_channel=GoldSilver%28w%2FMikeMaloney%29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0&amp;list=PLE88E9ICdiphYjJkeeLL2O09eJoC8r7Dc&amp;index=4&amp;ab_channel=GoldSilver%28w%2FMikeMaloney%29)

The Fed's been pumping the dollar for ages, and it only seems to be getting worse. Our intuition tells us it can't be possible to keep on printing money and piling on debt without having some consequences down the road. The purchasing power of our dollar is going to get weaker and weaker.

Perhaps to protect against our weakening currency, we should be invested in things with inherent value. Physical goods, commodities, maybe the classic gold. Or maybe it's still better to invest in stocks. After all, these companies do produce goods with inherent value right? But wait, their valuation seems to be off the charts nowadays. Which is the better investment? Given the uncertainty, seems like the usual conservative advice is diversify. The key takeaway here is that we're forced to ""invest"", because the government and their elite friends created an environment where no investment directly leads to loss of wealth. You bet they love this environment because they are the ones with the most investments, benefitting the most out of all.

So in a hypothetical world with a fixed monetary supply, what would happen? They say a fixed monetary supply leads to deflation. People will HODL on to their money, reducing demand, to which companies react by reducing output, and thus a vicious cycle of economic contraction ensues. I'm not sure I buy this argument though. Do you think your spending habits will change drastically if there's deflation? It'll obviously depend on the rate of deflation, but I doubt it can be very high. How much do you think human labor efficiency goes up by each year? Because that's what's money is supposed to be right? A representation of the effort you expended, such that you can exchange it for someone else's effort. A world where money doesn't represent human labor is corrupt. And in an unjust world, there is civil unrest. Look at our polarized country right now.

Back to fixed monetary supply and deflation. If GDP is any sign, then we're probably looking at 2\~3% growth in goods produced each year. With a 2\~3% deflation rate, holding on to your money is going to get you 2\~3% more stuff the next year, and 2\~3% more the next, then another 2\~3%, and so on. Are you really gonna hodl and hodl for those 2\~3% annual gains? I don't think so, you're gonna spend your money, UTILIZE your money, and live your life. After all, why do you want money if you're not going to spend it for its utility?

It's true deflation may lead to slight contraction in consumer spending. However I think this is a good thing. You will be wiser in how you spend your money, and certainly wouldn't take on debt like crazy (in a deflationary environment, your $1000 mortgage payment feels much larger in its 30th year than in the 1st year, because the purchasing power of $1000 increased over the years). But isn't all this leading to a healthier economy? Prudent spending and responsible use of credit. A society that does not nurture rampant debt-fueled consumption.

I believe a lot of our social problems can be helped by a reduction in the wealth gap. A lot of problems arise from not being able to maintain your livelihood, so a redistributed wealth would mean more people being able to maintain their livelihood, reducing their dissatisfaction to society.

I digress. What am I getting at? The current monetary system is corrupt. It gets me angry thinking about how the rich are legally taxing the poor (double-dip: inflation + taxation), and the poor remain largely clueless. Maybe you're some investing-savvy middle class guy and you made some double digit gains last year, but everyone knows the rich made much more than you did. In a relative scale, you still lost. And you also partook in perpetuating the corrupt system. Do you want to keep living in this kind of world or do you want a change?

History taught us with enough people behind a cause, we can make a change. I wonder how many of you have the same thoughts as I do and want an end to this corrupt monetary system. I don't know what the answer is. How do we get out of this mess? Do we start boycotting the USD and start accumulating gold / decentralized currencies? How do we make a smooth transition to a new monetary system? What even is the new monetary system? One thing I am certain about is that we can only make our voices heard by allocating our power in what we believe in. In government that's through votes, in economy that's through money. Let's put our money somewhere where our voices can be heard.

Disclaimer: You might look through my profile and see that I invest in blockchain/cryptocurrency. That is just a result of my distrust of the US monetary system. I am not writing this post to promote a pump in any particular asset. I just want us to recognize this problem and discuss what we can do.",finance

https://preview.redd.it/cura00g8kug61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb178c80fc0596df86d8f85f82bb7b75e0586cef

***(updated analytics*** [***Germany‚Äôs gas dilemma: democratic values or commercial profit?***](https://democratic-europe.eu/2021/02/01/germanys-gas-dilemma-democratic-values-or-commercial-profit/) ***of February 1,2021)***

After  the proclamation of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949,  German  intellectuals tried to explain to the whole world in general and  their  nationals, in particular, how, in principle, all the horrors  associated  with the World War Two became possible in a highly cultured  and  developed country. As a result, the old theory about the ‚Äúspecial  path  of Germany‚Äù (Deutscher Sonderweg) received a fresh impetus,  allegedly  due to the unique features of the German history. Some  accepted this  explanation, others rejected, however, in any case, some  part of German  politicians, businessmen and public opinion leaders are  guided for  real by the thesis about a ‚Äúspecial path‚Äù in their life.

At  least, one gets the impression that it is precisely the conviction  of  the special role of Germany on the European continent that drives  those  German politicians in the parliament, in the federal government  and  among the leaders of the federal state of Mecklenburg-Western   Pomerania, who stubbornly promote the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline   project, fiercely refusing to reckon with the position of the European   Parliament, many of the European Union member states, France (the main   partner in the EU) and the United States (the main partner in NATO).

The  eventual launch of NS2 will create a situation on the European  gas  market that will raise a question for any EU citizen. That is, due  to  NS2, Germany will be able to receive gas volume amounting to 395   billion cubic meters per year into its system, while the entire EU   consumes about 400 b.c.m. per year, with the Germany‚Äôs part for the   domestic consumption amounting to 90 b.c.m. Thus, the question cannot   but arise ‚Äì why does Germany seek to receive such huge volumes of ‚Äúblue   fuel‚Äù?

The answer to this  question exists and it sounds like the  implementation of the concept of  the ‚Äúenergy turn‚Äù (Energiewende) by the  German government. This  concept assumes the gradual Germany‚Äôs shifting  away from the use of  fossil fuels and nuclear power with a transition to  the use of  renewable energy sources (RES) solely.

Thus,  Germany expects to increase the share of electricity obtained  from RES  up to 50% by 2030, up to 65% by 2040 and up to 80% by 2050.  Also, this  concept provides for the rapid shutdown of all coal-fired  power  plants, gradual shutdown of nuclear power plants, development of  new  technologies related to the use of synthetic gases and hydrogen, as   well as general intensification of investments in green energy sources.

Moreover,  taking advantage of the position of the EU leader country,  and,  possibly, also being guided by the thesis about Deutscher  Sonderweg,  Germany rigidly imposes its Energiewende on the entire  European Union.  Berlin does not hide the fact that they are trying to  ensure that the  long-term German climate policy and energy strategy are  fully copied  and adopted by the European Commission in Brussels,  becoming generally  binding for all EU member states.

At  the same time, a plan for the successful implementation of ‚Äúenergy   turn‚Äù has some economic, technical and temporal nuances. Germany shuts   down operating coal-fired power plants right today, nuclear power plants   ‚Äì tomorrow, while the era of complete domination of renewable energy   sources is expected‚Ä¶ somewhere the day after tomorrow. Naturally,   practical and prudent German politicians need to provide the country   with some kind of energy for future. They found a way out in a sharp   increase in natural gas supplies. That is, gas is intended to serve as a   kind of bridge between coal and nuclear power and the widespread use  of  renewable energy sources. That is why Germany does not want to scrap   the joint NS2 project with Russia so stubbornly!

Basically,  the fact that Frau A. Merkel is driving the German people  (and the  entire EU ‚Äì in the long term) to a ‚Äúgreen paradise‚Äù is simply  amazing.  However, this movement takes place over the bridge built by   Mephistopheles, and, for some reason, this fact does not bother anyone   in Germany!

At the same time,  Berlin, while discussing NS2 with Paris, Warsaw,  Kyiv and Washington,  overtly twists facts, since it pursues strictly  personal goals in the  geopolitical and geoeconomic areas. Sheltering  behind the calls for the  creation of an environmentally friendly ‚Äúgreen‚Äù  Europe, Germany is  striving to rise above all other EU countries due to  huge supplies of  cheap gas from Russia. The latter has already promised  Germany  significant and long-term discounts on ‚Äúblue fuel‚Äù pumped  through NS2.

Berlin  convinces everyone around that it is Russia only which can  provide the  required volumes of natural gas at reasonable prices. In  this regard,  German politicians and businessmen, without turning an  eyelash ask  Europeans (especially Poles and Ukrainians) and Americans to  ‚Äúclose  their eyes‚Äù to the expansionist foreign policy and authoritarian   domestic policy of the Russian Federation.

Actually,  German politicians are frankly lying! Germany can receive  additional  volumes of gas not only from Russia, which is an undemocratic  and  explicitly confrontational country to NATO. Thus, investors  (German,  Dutch, Belgian and others) have been offering to the federal  government  for several years to provide funding to construction projects  of four  terminals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Germany, as well  as to  recover the costs of connecting these terminals to the national  gas  distribution network. The following facilities are expected to be   constructed:

* Brunsb√ºttel  (Schleswig-Holstein) ‚Äì a terminal shall be  constructed with a  regasification capacity of up to 8 b.c.m. per year.  The terminal will  be launched in 2023;
* Wilhelmshaven  (Lower  Saxony) ‚Äì a terminal in the form of a Floating Storage  Regasification  Unit (FSRU) with a regasification capacity of 10 b.c.m.  per year. The  works will start in 2022;
* Stade  (Lower Saxony) (near Hamburg) ‚Äì  the terminal will have a  regasification capacity of 12 b.c.m. per year  (with the possible  increasing capacity up to 15 b.c.m.). Commissioning  is scheduled for  2025;
* Rostock  (Mecklenburg- Western Pomerania) ‚Äì  a small LNG transfer terminal with a  capacity of 300 thousand cubic  meters per year is planned.

Berlin  does not stand against the construction of the above mentioned   facilities, however it is in no hurry to help their early construction   using federal funds. In fact, the real LNG supply through these   terminals may well allow the federal government to close the NS2 project   and successfully decarbonize the German economy. An additional bonus  of  the operation of LNG terminals will be a real diversification of the   ‚Äúblue fuel‚Äù supply to Germany, since even now 50% of natural gas  enters  the country from Russia (24% from Norway, another 20% from the   Netherlands and about 6% is produced on the territory of Germany). Well,   in the case of launching NS2, Germany‚Äôs dependence on Russia will   naturally increase even more.

In  addition, abandoning of the NS2 project will allow Germany  maintain  relations with its partners both in the European Union and  NATO.  Perhaps the Germans should remember their outstanding intellectual   Reinhart Koselleck, who argued that the effective political capacity of   the European Community can be ensured only provided that two basic   principles are observed ‚Äì equality of the unequals (that is, taking into   account those who are in the minority) and the ability to compromise.

stocks,MSOS ‚Äì Regarding having a chunk of its holdings in a liquidity trust,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of people post about being wary of MSOS and YOLO because a certain percentage of their holdings are in a liquidity trust. This is confusing and I wanted to set the record straight on why this is.

A little background for those who are unfamiliar, MSOS is the only actively managed cannabis fund with only US exposure. YOLO is essentially the same but includes Canadian exposure and a bit of UK. Dan Ahrens, manager of both of these funds, was a guest on ‚ÄúThe Cannabis Investing Podcast‚Äù and spoke to this holding. I typed out what he said below. Keep in mind this was recorded in August 2019 so some of the details with companies may be a little dated, but the main concept and investment strategy is still 100% relevant. There is a TL;DR below if you‚Äôd prefer.

‚ÄúOur fund, YOLO, is really the only fund out there so far that is getting exposure to some of these MSOs (multi-state operators). A great example is Curaleaf with the acquisition that was just announced is going to be the largest cannabis company in the world by sales. We have companies operating in the US but they‚Äôre listed on the Canadian stock exchange and can‚Äôt get listed on the Toronto yet or NASDAQ or NYSE because of these very complicated murkey federal laws. In our fund, you know it‚Äôs very prominent in our principle investment strategies that we aren‚Äôt only going to invest directly in stocks that are listed as federally legal and listed on certain exchanges. We‚Äôre also going to use derivatives, futures, options, swaps, to gain exposure to stocks with similar characteristics. So we have a third party that buys the stocks, gives us back the return of those in a total return swap. Because it‚Äôs very important that we have exposure to companies like Curaleaf, and Harvest Health, and Green Thumb Industries. Very sizeable companies operating in the US, because the US market, as you said, it‚Äôs not just bigger than Canada. It‚Äôs many, many, many times bigger than Canada. Everyone got excited about Canada because that‚Äôs where the public stocks that we could invest are, and they passed recreational use, but we have to remember it‚Äôs a tiny market compared to the United States and the worldwide market.‚Äù

When asked about these swaps appearing as trusts and funds in the holdings:

‚Äúthat‚Äôs the amount of cash to cover the swap. So we are getting into the weeds here a little bit, **but I want to point out that what we‚Äôre doing is virtually the same as if you owned the stock. We aren‚Äôt going to lever it up or have leverage. That‚Äôs the amount of cash that‚Äôs being held and is always going to be equal to the amount that we own in a stock swap.**‚Äù

**TL;DR**: the trust privately invests in certain companies that cannot legally be listed on an exchange yet, and YOLO and MSOS hold the trust. It all balances out in the end.

Side note, at the time of this recording MSOS wasn‚Äôt in existence yet, so you can now get purely US exposure with that one. I‚Äôve held these two for some time now, and I was admittedly getting a bit of FOMO when they underperformed some of the other weed ETFs this week, but I still think these have more upside potential as they are investing in US companies that are currently difficult to invest in. Once they get the greenlight to be on a common exchange, I think we will see a similar surge with YOLO and MSOS that we saw this week with the global weed ETFs. In fact, some of the companies mentioned above ARE listed now, and they‚Äôve been soaring with the rest of them.",finance

&gt; # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday‚Äôs record high close

&gt; * Dow futures rose Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average hit an intraday all-time high in a volatile session and closed at a record. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday were unable to hold on to their all-time intraday highs and closed slightly lower.

&gt; * The Labor Department is out at 8:30 a.m. ET with its weekly report on new jobless claims. Economists expect 760,000 filings for new unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 19,000 from the prior week, which at 779,000 was the lowest initial claims reading since late November.

&gt; * Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday monetary policy needs to stay ‚Äúpatiently accommodative‚Äù to support the economy that still faces challenges in the labor market. The employment picture is ‚Äúa long way‚Äù from where it needs to be, the central bank chief told the Economic Club of New York.

&gt; # 2. PepsiCo beats expectations; Uber delivers mixed results

&gt; * Earnings were once again a focus for investors. Disney leads the list of major companies reporting quarterly results after Thursday‚Äôs closing bell. Before the market opening, PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 per share, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, also exceeding expectations. PepsiCo shares fell slightly in the premarket.

&gt; * Uber shares dropped 4% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket, the morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 54 cents per share in the fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 16% to a lower-than-expected $3.17 billion. Uber‚Äôs ride-hailing business slowly recovered, while its delivery business boomed.

*****

&gt; # 3. Cannabis stocks jump in a Reddit-fueled trade reminiscent of GameStop

&gt; * Cannabis stocks were soaring as the Reddit crowd that spiked GameStop jumped in. Tilray shares surged nearly 51% on Wednesday, pushing the stock to a year-to-date gain of more than 670%. Not nearly as bet-against as GameStop, Tilray‚Äôs short interest was still equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet as of the end of January. Tilary added another 10% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket. Tilray is no stranger to a short-squeeze rally. The stock spiked more than 1,400% between July and September 2018, but those gains did not last.

&gt; # 4. Dating app firm Bumble set to begin trading after pricing IPO

&gt; * When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her dating app company public Thursday, she‚Äôll be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her firm to an IPO. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women, priced its offering Wednesday evening at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion and valuing Bumble at around $8 billion. The stock market response will act as a litmus test for companies founded by women, who account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs. That‚Äôs an all-time high but still a staggeringly low.

&gt; # 5. House impeachment managers to continue their case against Trump

&gt; * House managers on Thursday are set to continue to lay out their case against former President Donald Trump at his second impeachment trial. Trump‚Äôs lawyers are expected to launch their defense by the end of the week. Chilling security video of last month‚Äôs deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, including scenes of rioters searching for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, was introduced Wednesday as a key exhibit by Democratic lawmakers prosecuting the case for why Trump should be convicted of inciting the siege.

I made a mistake of investing my $25k of EF.

What would be the best approach for this?

With the $35k, $6k is cash and the other $29k are in stocks. Some long term and some short term. I would definitely pay taxes this year since I sold some stocks with $3k capital gains (mixed ST and LT gains). I was thinking of waiting for each investment to reach LT status to eventually sell them completely or sell them partially as the # of shares reach LT status.

I understand that this time there are far more institutional investors and even whole countries interested in the space so it makes sense that this bull run be bigger than 2017's.

## New phishing attack uses Morse code to hide malicious URLs

A novel new phishing approach uses a fake invoice email complete with an HTML spreadsheet attachment that includes the victim company‚Äôs name in the file name for greater credibility. The malicious script, written in Morse code is located within the HTML code of the spreadsheet along with a decodeMorse() instruction that converts it back into JavaScript. This then generates a realistic looking Microsoft session time-out screen, complete with the victim company‚Äôs logo, retrieved from logo.clearbit. Once a user enters their password, the form will submit the password to a remote site where the attackers can collect the login credentials. According to Bleeping Computer, this is the first recorded instance of the use of Morse code in this fashion.

## Florida water treatment plant hacked to distribute harmful chemicals/Used TeamViewer

Pinellas County Florida sheriff Bob Gualtieri said Monday that someone gained remote access to the Oldsmar, Florida water treatment plant at 8 AM February 5th, attempting to increase sodium hydroxide, otherwise known as lye, to a dangerous level. A plant operator first thought a supervisor had accessed the system from home. After the intruder raised the lye level, a monitoring operator immediately reduced it, with the remote access system now disabled. The Sheriff noted other fail-safes and alarm systems would have also prevented the dangerous adjustment had the operator not noticed.¬†

## Office 365 will help admins find impersonation attack targets

In addition to the nation state warning we mentioned on yesterday‚Äôs podcast, Microsoft is also going to make it easier for Defender for Office 365 customers to identify impersonation-based phishing attacks including intentionally misspelled email addresses and domain names. Security admins will be able to use new filters dubbed *Impersonated user* and *Impersonated domain* together with the Threat Explorer and real-time detections to detect organization users and domains targeted in impersonation attacks. The new information will be available for security team admins via the Impersonation insight pages as well as on a newly added Email Entity page and will be more widely available to end users by the end of February.

## Mount Sinai study finds Apple Watch can predict COVID-19 diagnosis up to a week before testing

The study, published in the peer-reviewed *Journal of Medical Internet Research* found that wearable hardware like the Apple Watch can effectively predict a positive COVID-19 diagnosis up to a week before current PCR-based nasal swab tests. The researchers focused on heart rate variability (HRV), which is a key indicator of strain on a person‚Äôs nervous system and combined this with patients‚Äô self-reported symptoms. The study is ongoing and will expand to examine what else wearables like the Apple Watch can tell about other impacts of COVID-19 including the relationships between sleep and physical activity and the disease.

## Activists complain of weakened voting security standard

The US federal agency overseeing election administration has quietly tweaked a key element of proposed security standards for voting systems, removing language that would ban any voting machines that had wireless modems or chips. This has raised concern among voting-integrity experts and computer security specialists who suggest the mere presence of such wireless hardware poses risks. The election administration officials state that their rules require manufacturers disable wireless functions present in any machines, although the wireless hardware can remain.

[The CME Group provides us a free heat map of the option positioning of the large player. As you can see we have heavy calls on the price level of 1.385. The smart money refuses to trade the price over this level. Think of it like no one wants to buy at prices where other buyer would get an advantage of a cheap price. The opposite counts for heavy put option strikes which function as a support level. Now what can we say from this situation? We have 1790 options against us. In comparison to all other data its one of the highest. What we also see is that these 1790 options expire tomorrow at 11:59 a.m. EST. since the runtime of these kind of currencies are one week and you can read the days until expirations beneath the DTE \(days to expiration\).  That means if the upside pressure of the British pound persists until expiration, we might see a break through that level. Until then we have to accept it as the next major resistance level. Don't get me wrong, there are times where the buying or selling price is so high that it will break though any strong strike levels.](https://preview.redd.it/6m8bpixfbug61.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2955f650a72e9161ca061ce28f5aa0de74294b3)

This method is very effective when price is moving to new highs or lows with no prior volume profile to get an orientation what is the next ""fair price"".

personalfinance,Lowering your interest rate on current credit cards. Who‚Äôs done this before!?,"Hi there,

New to the community so I hope this is the right place for this post. 

I‚Äôve been reading about people being able to call their Credit Card companies and ask for a lower interest rate in regards to being a loyal customer, having no missed payment, good credit etc.

Anyone here done this before? I‚Äôm thinking of doing it and figured the worst I get is a No. m

I have a handful of CC with balances. All are paid on time with no late payments, paying more than the minimum. Some apr (like my discover is 16.99%) and Amex is 24.99%, pretty steep.

personalfinance,Pay off large predatory loan with absurdly high interest rate or start with smaller debts via snowball technique?,"Hello,

Quick question. I've been working on budgeting and am headed in the right direction (limiting frivolous spending, eating out, etc.). I now want to attack some debt I have (admittedly small) but can't decide which to attack first. I have a goal to move into my own place by end year, which would be a huge accomplishment for me.

Now to the question:

I have 3 outstanding debts:

One large loan from a predatory quickcash loan place:

Total payment: $211.26 ($55.92 to principal, $144.78 towards interest) with $5,156.79

Two smaller: 

PayPal Credit: $761.98, monthly payment of $30ish. 

NFM Credit: $ 969.70 total balance ($ 866.52 interest bearing), monthly payment of $22. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I dumb to consider the smaller payments because I heard about the snowball technique, even if the large loan has crazy interest.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Social Security Income Tax Cliff Implications,"Last year was my first year making significant money, and I noticed that the Social Security tax seems to have implications on whether you should contribute to a traditional vs roth IRA/401k. Once you pass the Social Security tax income limit ($142,800 in 2021) your Marginal tax rate drops from 31.65% (Federal 24% + FICA 7.65%) to 25.45% (Federal 24% + FICA 1.45%). 

So am I understanding this right, that if I'm in the tax bracket above $142,800 and below $164,926 I should be contributing to roth 401k/ira rather than traditional? Seems like I could be missing something, but I'm not sure. Thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,What's your strategy for cashing out when the time comes?,"Let's say you have made enough gains in crypto and would like to cash out to fund your early retirement, how would you do it?

I'm currently thinking of a few:

**Convert all holdings to USDC and leave it in Celsius for a year or two.**

* Pros: High enough interest rate. Should the stock market finally crash, I can cash out to load up on index funds.
* Cons: Risk of USD tanking further (I'm not in the US). Not your keys, not your coins. Celsius could get hacked or cease to exist.

**Convert all holdings to BTC and leave it in BlockFi long term.**

* Pros: BTC has proven to be the safest bet in crypto and will more than likely go up even further. High enough interest rate considering the potential upside. I would also still be fully invested in crypto and that'll keep be entertained until the bear market hits again.
* Cons: Price tanking by more than 50% would mean I will have just enough to get by on passive income. BlockFi could cut interest rate. BlockFi could get hacked or cease to exist.

**Cash out and dump it all into index funds.**

* Pros: Least risky option. More potential gains compared to Celsius.
* Cons: The stock market bubble's been said to burst for many years now. I would have to bank on it to go up another year or two just so I could be at ChubbyFI level.

Of course the smarter option is to go with a mix of all three but it's just fun to think about going all in on just one of the options.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Advice on Roth IRA Account for Immigrant worker,"I am currently on a work visa in US and have applied for a Green Card but I am not sure if I would actually get the green card anytime soon due to huge backlog with respect to my country quota. Can anyone help me in addressing some queries I had with respect to opening an IRA account.

* I intend to retire in US but given the uncertainty over Green Card there is a chance I might be very well retiring in my home country. Is Roth IRA still better for people like me who want to protect their retirement if at all they are able to retire in US?

* If by any chance I have to move back to my home country, is there a safe way for me to get my IRA distributions sent to my address in home country? When I looked up information on this, it states that financial institutions would withhold around 30% in such scenario. 

 &gt; Keep in mind that IRA distributions sent to an address outside of the U.S. are subject to mandatory federal¬†withholding¬†of 10%.4Ôªø However, some¬†financial institutions¬†will allow you to waive this withholding by filing special documents. If you choose to take this route, your distribution will be subject to the¬†treaty¬†rate of your current country. The treaty rate ranges from zero to 30%.

* So, even though I have a Roth IRA account where I am putting post tax dollars, they will still withhold 30% even if I withdraw after 60 years? Does it mean for every distribution, they will withhold 30% which I can't get refunded unless the tax treaty between the countries is less?

* Is the only requirement to get full amount post 60 years without withholding a valid US address? If so, can I visit US on a visitor visa after retirement, get the entire amount from my IRA withdrawn and then transfer it back to my home country (*I am not sure what would be the taxation law in my home country if I do this*).

personalfinance,Pay stubs vs. W-2 from small business employer don't match - what does this mean for us?,"My husband worked for a very small business for years and years. No professional payroll company, it was all done in-house. The business closed down at the end of March due to Covid. 

We just received his W-2, and it's short two paychecks/four weeks worth of work for paychecks cut in April because of how they had them staggered. Per the employer, with all the Covid shutdown drama last year they did not submit federal or state taxes for those last two paychecks at the beginning of the second quarter, even though they deducted them. So with the W-2 they also included a check to my husband for the total amount of taxes that were deducted but not sent to the feds/state.

What implications does this have for us? Does this have him basically being paid under the table for that last month of employment? I think it will short him one month worth of Social Security credit, which isn't a huge deal I guess. 

Can we cash this check for the refund of unsubmitted taxes? He's still claiming unemployment as of the last date of actual employment, not this one month earlier date, is that going to be something that bites us in the future?

1. The e-commerce and cloud giant has had a $5 billion share repurchase program in place since February 2016, the last time Amazon bought back any of its stock was the first quarter of 2012, so the streak is 33 quarters of no stock buyback. But with the new ceo coming, he might change and start to repurchase the stock, remember before tim cook take over apple, apple did not give out any dividend, and then it changed. 

2. Prime member engagement keep increasing and prime membership is still growing yoy. All major product categories demand continue to raise across globally. 

3. Amazon high growing aws and advertising revenue streams are getting more profitable, the advertising division could keep growing and getting some market share from fb and google.  

4. Amazon bottom line is improving much better compared to analysts predictions, the last few quarters it beats expectations by a lot. With the covid situation getting more under control, the covid related expenses will mitigate, and amazon will be more profitable. 

5. Amazon delivery fleet is growing, I have seen my packages constantly delivered by amazon vans and contractors. In the future, amazon will be less dependent on USPS, fedex and UPS, and might even able to compete with UPS and Fedex. 

6. Finally the stock split, with the new ceo coming, this might become possible as well, this will be a positive catalyst that all investors want to see.

I will be keep holding my amazon stock, if it really dip further, I will buy more, I will hold amazon stock until I retire.",finance

To be completely clear, not all of today‚Äôs cryptocurrencies will be supported on our network. While stablecoins are more regulated and reliable than in the recent past, many of the hundreds of digital assets in circulation still need to tighten their compliance measures, so they won‚Äôt meet our requirements. We expect consumers and the ecosystem as a whole will start to rally around the crypto assets that offer reliability and security. It‚Äôs those very same stablecoins that we expect to bring into our network.  


**What are we looking for? Four key items.**  


**First and foremost we need consumer protections, including privacy and security of consumers‚Äô information ‚Äî the same level of security people have come to expect in their credit cards. Next, strict compliance protocols will be needed, including Know Your Customer, a requirement meant to snuff out illegal activity and deception in payment networks. Also, these digital assets must follow local laws and regulations in the regions they are used.**  


**Lastly, people will want to use these digital assets for payments, so that is one of our criteria too. To reach our network, crypto assets will need to offer the stability people need in a vehicle for spending, not investment.**",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,What is cryptocurrency? Everything you need to know in 2021,"**What is cryptocurrency? Everything you need to know in 2021**


Cryptocurrency, shorthand crypto, refers to digital currencies or tokens that are secured by cryptography. It is akin to digital assets that represent certain rights, such as ownership towards a network, digital collectibles, spendable currency within the system, or even as a proof of ownership of physical items.¬†
¬†


**What is bitcoin? - The birth of the first cryptocurrency**


[Bitcoin](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin)¬†was first released by Satoshi Nakamoto on 3rd Jan 2009 as a new form of money. It is a novel invention that has given birth to the technology we call blockchain today. Little did people know that it will have an impact wider than just reinventing the antiquated financial system. It has in fact, gone on to inspire a whole generation of developers towards building a decentralized Internet.
¬†


**What is the blockchain?**


Blockchain is the key infrastructure that powers the whole crypto industry. Let‚Äôs see what problems blockchain is aiming to solve. Ever wonder why in this modern age we are still relying on paper based documents for important matters? Examples of these documents include physical copies of our passports, identification documents, and certifications.¬†

That's because we have yet to find a good way to make sure that information shown digitally is not tamper-proof, until the advent of blockchain. Blockchains basically ensure that the information depicted is accurate and that the data is not compromised.¬†

Historically, it has been costly to prove ownership to an asset because of all the regulatory red tapes, middlemen, and processes involved in recording who owns what at a specific time. With blockchain, anyone can launch a network and distribute ownership of that network to millions of people globally with a fraction of the cost. This is a bit abstract but imagine owning a part of the Internet where value is accrued to the owners - this would be pretty impressive.¬†

With cryptocurrencies, people can imbue ownership rights in the form of digital tokens that can be easily transferable. As such, multiple projects chose to fundraise globally, distribute tokens as rewards to early adopters, and as a token of commemoration. Thousands of tokens have been released since then. Even though most of them fell into oblivion, some of them managed to capture enough value that they are now worth billions of dollars.¬†
¬†


**Cryptocurrency prices and market cap**


The cryptocurrency market has grown significantly since Bitcoin was first released in January 2009. As of January 2021, there are more than 6,000 tokens being tracked on CoinGecko with¬†[total crypto market capitalization](https://www.coingecko.com/en/global_charts)¬†breaching $1 trillion.¬†
¬†


**Why is cryptocurrency so popular today?**


Bitcoin is increasingly being mentioned in the mainstream media after its price reached $40,000 at the time of writing in January 2021 with a valuation of roughly $840 billion. Along with it, other crypto tokens also mimic similar price increases as more attention is being paid to the space. Bull runs have a way to capture people‚Äôs attention, attracting hordes of speculators into the field, feeding into a market frenzy.¬†

There are several factors contributing to the rapid rise in price. One of them is the increasing accessibility to buy crypto assets, with Paypal announcing support for cryptocurrencies, combined with the rise of fintech apps that support crypto trading such as Robinhood, Square Cash and Etoro.¬†

Another one is the institutional adoption of investing in Bitcoin as a hedge against the structural weaknesses of the US Dollar due to the loose monetary policies by the Federal Reserve. Some of the public companies that did that include Microstrategy and Square.¬†
¬†


**Is it good to invest in cryptocurrency?**


Unlike common asset classes such as stocks and bonds, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and¬†[Ethereum](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum)¬†do not produce any cash flows. As such, it did not receive good remarks from value investors. Warren Buffet famously made public remarks referring to Bitcoin as ‚Äò[rat poison](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/warren-buffett-best-quotes-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-investing-rat-poison-squared-2021-1-1029974898)‚Äô.¬†

Bitcoin actually has characteristics more akin to commodities such as Gold. The fact that it is the first fixed-supply digital asset in the world makes it a good store of value. Therefore Bitcoin is more appealing towards macro investors that are looking to hedge against the weakness of the US Dollar.¬†Paul Tudor Jones,¬†Druckenmiller, and¬†Raoul Pal¬†are some high-profile investors that have made positive remarks about Bitcoin.¬†

Owning Ethereum in the meantime is like owning a portion of the new Internet. The hype surrounding Decentralised Finance ([DeFi](https://www.coingecko.com/en/defi)) applications built on Ethereum are not just smoke and mirrors. These DeFi applications have been seeing skyrocketing user numbers, attracting billions of dollars of capital, and seeing more brilliant builders go into the space. Currently there are no concrete methods on how to value these assets, but this is normal for a new asset class. Valuation methodologies will become more mature as these assets gain more adoption over time.¬†

Investing in crypto now is similar to investing in Internet stocks back in the year 2000 - the possibilities are vast but the road ahead is still uncertain. As the analogy goes, humans have a tendency to overestimate the impact of technology in the short-term and underestimate its effect in the long run. We are still in the early innings of crypto revolutions and there will be lots of ups and downs before we see the mass population benefiting from this technology.

As such, please exercise caution when investing as crypto is still pretty much a high risk investment. The price can be very volatile and it is definitely not for the faint-hearted. For beginners, what you can do is to start learning more about the technology, its ethos and its use cases.¬†

¬†

**How does cryptocurrency have value?**


Very few people actually question where money comes from. It is actually quite a complicated topic involving politics, history, finance, economy, sociology, and human psychology. Ultimately it is a tool of human coordination.¬†

Few people realise that the current system has only been in place for roughly 50 years, starting from the US Dollar depegging from gold in 1971. We are still very much experimenting with it, with the banks bailout in 2008, Quantitative Easing, and negative interest rates in recent years. As such, the current monetary system that we have, where most call it the fiat regime, might not be the best.¬†

Therefore, it's actually not surprising that someone may invent something better. Throughout human history, we have been transitioning our currency from seashells to rocks, metals, and most recently papers in search of the best form of money. Bitcoin, as the first verifiable fixed-supply digital token that is secured by computers globally has the potential to become the first non-sovereign digital currency (not controlled by the governments) that can be used by anyone across the world.¬†

The ability to transfer value across the Internet without having any restrictions is in itself a strong value proposition. Part of the allure of democratization of value is to give back the power of money in the hands of people rather than the institutions. Money also follows the rule of network effect, as a currency that receives more recognition will attract more people to use it and therefore initiating a flywheel of adoption.¬†

Once the network is big enough, it is very hard for any competitors to topple it. Gold used to have a dominant market share in the world of currencies. Now we might be witnessing the rise of ‚ÄòDigital Gold‚Äô. If Bitcoin is to become the base layer of all economic transactions in the future, coupled with its fixed-supply nature, the price will go up as demand exceeds supply.¬†

Other than Bitcoin, there are actually increasing adoptions in the use of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) applications, creating a parallel financial market that allows lending/borrowing, capital raising, exchange, derivatives trading and even betting, operational 24/7 globally. With total capital locked inside the system breaching $25 billion as of writing, we believe it has found its product market fit. ¬†

All these tokens might look absurd in the eyes of common people as most would not even know that these tokens exist, but for those that actually spend the time understanding the space, they would recognise how big this transformation is. The Internet is said to have democratized information, crypto is here to democratize value.¬†

These applications are mainly hosted in Ethereum. Any transaction costs made inside Ethereum will have to be paid in its native currency, ETH. When more transactions need to be made, demand for ETH will increase and thus its price. DeFi applications in the meantime also released their own native tokens, accruing cash flows to the token holders, similar to how a company functions. It's now increasingly possible to estimate their future cash flows and come up with a valuation based on the discounted cash flows model.¬†
¬†


**How to buy and invest in cryptocurrency?**


There are various ways to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. In many countries, fintech applications such as Square Cash, Robinhood, Revolut,¬†Coinbase, Kraken, Binance and¬†Gemini¬†are gaining significant traction.¬†

There are currently over 424¬†[cryptocurrency exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges)¬†globally. If you have a specific coin or token in mind, you can search it up on¬†[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en)¬†on where to buy it under the markets tab.
¬†


**Should you buy cryptocurrency?**


If you are still here after the long read, it means that you are intrigued enough to learn more. You do not have to allocate a big portion of your wealth into crypto straightaway. You can start by investing a small amount, be excited about the technology, and try to use it.¬†

Do be aware of the price volatility and the inherent risk of dabbling with new technology. Only invest money that you can afford to lose. We believe that the more you learn about crypto, the more you will be dazzled by the beauty of this creation.¬†

You have reached the end of the article! Congrats for being one of the few that understand what is cryptocurrency.¬†

My dad has offered a few options. One of which is to help with a down payment to get me to 20% down. I can not do 3% down because the monthly payment would be way to high unless I wanted what would essentially be a trailer so 20% down is the best option. 

He also offered to purchase the house of our choosing within my own budget as we would also save on the interest rate as he would be approved for about 2ish% less in terms of interest rate. I would then purchase the house from him on contract. I would be putting about 15% down and he would cover the other 5% which I would not have to pay back. My grandfather did the same for my dads first home and my dad was very happy with the way it worked.

I 25\[M\], have been debating whether I should continue contributing 7% of my pay to my 401K or if I should contribute only up to my employer match (3%) and use the rest to pay off my debt. **I am in no way struggling to pay any of my bills/debt**, but I would like to start paying off my debt faster and sooner.

A break down of my income/contributions is as follows:

* **Salary**: 93K
* **401K Contribution**: 7% (**Employer Match**: 3%) (Traditional IRA)
* **Current Vested 401K Balance:** 20K
* **Savings:** 5K (working on getting this up)
* **Checking:** 5K
* **Investments:** 16K

A break down of my debt (Im not behind on any payments, i'm actually ahead on all of these)

* **Total Debt**: 50K
   * **Federal Student Loan**: 18K (3% interest rate pre-covid) (this isn't accruing interest until 9/2021 due to covid)
   * **Parent Plus Loan:** 16K (6.9% interest rate pre-covid) (this isn't accruing interest until 9/2021 due to covid)
   * **Auto Loan:** 16K (2.2% interest rate) (I was dumb, should have bought cheap and used)
   * **No CC debt**

personalfinance,Is giving up an extra $950 in income tax refunds the right choice?,"My wife and I plan to buy a single-family home soon. Because of employer residency requirements, and the fact that we want a yard instead of shared walls with rude neighbors, we are committed to this. We *might* get help from family, but can't count on it. So the down payment could very well eat up most of our e-fund. 

(I know, I know! I hate the idea of spending our e-fund, too! But renting is awful in our area; you get very little space for a lot of money. Everywhere we live, we worry ""Will rent go up again?"" and ""Will the landlord sell the place to someone else?"" Plus the neighbors who party till 3 am on weeknights, take our parking spot, trash the mail room, leave dog poop on the sidewalk.... It's become a mental health issue.)

I've been working on our taxes, and we'll be getting \~$4,050 between Fed + State. (It's usually much lower.) I played with the numbers, and if we commit to putting $5,000 in my wife's IRA FTY 2020, the refund will bump up to \~$5,000. Please correct me if I'm wrong; that feels like a free $950, just for being responsible retirement planners.

So on one hand - *Hey! Free money!* But on the other hand, I worry that we need the refund for the down payment. And if I put that money in the IRA just to take it back out, I'll eat away at the $10,000 lifetime limit on IRA withdrawals for the purpose of home buying. (I also feel like we might consider dipping into the IRA a little bit anyway, just so that our e-fund isn't totally depleted after we finish buying and moving into the new home.)

So right now, I'm planning on **NOT** contributing that $5,000 to the IRA, and kissing the $950 of ""free money"" goodbye. Am I missing something here?

Data:

* Income: $77,250/yr
* Target house price: $200,000 - $275,000
* Debt:  

$220/mo student loans  

$240/mo auto loan  

$70/mo minimum CC payments (we actually pay in full every month, but that's how it shows on the credit reports)

I want to share one strategy for making vast amounts of üí∞üí∞ relatively safely from taking long positions on BTC


&amp;nbsp;


**IMPORTANT** This strategy is contingent on the assumption that Bitcoin will continuously rise in market cap in the long run! If you do not believe this, then this strategy is not for you!


&amp;nbsp;


If you do believe the above, then in order to safely margin trade you just need to:

1. Figure out for yourself what price you believe that BTC will never drop below again! (For myself, I usually take the current price x 0.75)

2. Use [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yYif_AUuX9glAHE-EyLUE2F1VSrnyZaCExT6c1E_HG4/edit?usp=sharing) to figure out how big a long position you can open safely. [Instructions here](https://imgur.com/a/vAbVtS3)


3. Hold your positions to the moon! üöÄüöÄüöÄ (or at least until you think the % increase of BTC price is lower than the % interest rate you pay for keeping your position open)

4. When your old positions are in a safe zone, open up more positions!!

The car is probably only worth about $17k.

I called the lender today to find out how we can make payments directly to principal.  They stated that it's not possible.  I asked what is the balance on the loan and they said $44k.  I requested a payoff amount and it's $44k.

How is this legal/possible and is there anything that we can do about it?

personalfinance,Ways to minimize interest while paying down large debt?,"Backstory: Spent a lot more time than expected out of the job market. Depleted savings and used credit cards to live, making use of sites that allow you to pay rent/etc via CC. Eventually ended up with about $45,000 in CC debt, at an average of about 25% APR. Did the balance transfer shuffle for almost two years to keep things in check.

Fast forward to now. I've had a job that pays well ($165k) for about six months now and I'm not at a high risk of losing it any time soon. I moved to a relatively low cost of living area (neither coast). I'm able to put about $6,000 per month towards that debt, which means even paying the full interest rate I should be debt free in about another eight months.

But I'm paying almost a thousand a month in interest. Less each month of course but it still stings. My ideal situation would be a large balance transfer card but none of my cards have any BT offers available, and I'm not sure I could get a new one with my current utilization being so high.

Given my income and the large base amount of debt, are there any alternatives out there that might help with consolidating these into something that isn't burning as much cash each month, that also won't hurt me in the long run when it comes to credit score? For example, is this a situation where a 401k loan might be a positive move, since I could pay it back quickly but the interest would be going to me?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrencies and the Post Modern World,"Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain architecture is often hailed as a disruptive player in the financial scene. The fact that distributed ledger technology enables us everyday plebs to realize decentralized and democratized networks and come to force contention against centralized entities that have been running the game for far too long is definitely something that needs to be discussed. So its not surprising that the political implications of Bitcoin and its subsequent followers is often expounded as anti establishment, anti centralization and anti government. Back when the United States government was still being formed in the 1700s we talked about the separation of Church and State. Now we dare talk about the separation between money and state.

Whether these claims have any validity remains to be seen in the long run, and it does seem very forward to claim that everyone affiliated to the blockchain revolution approves of the same political ideologies. Do we all want to destroy centralized government because of certain inadequacies and imperfections? Probably not...  Still there is definitely a trend, a movement per se,  that is being formed in relation to this cryptocurrency stuff and that deserves to be examined. So my point here isn‚Äôt to make any political statements nor implications in regards to the potential of blockchain but rather to highlight a more general cultural shift that distributed ledger technology is enabling and helping us achieve as members of modern civilization. And my claim here is quite simple; cryptocurrencies are the child prodigy of the post modern thought and the best implementation of this philosophy we have ever seen. It is said that you can philosophize just about anything so why not do cryptocurrencies?!

Before I can explain my very bold claim, we need to go back and understand what Post Modern thought is and how it is historically linked to modernity. Full disclaimer, the word post modernism (and modernism as well for that matter) is a heavy one that is often used in many different ways and has a lot of historical baggage which I won‚Äôt be addressing here. This is a very broad and generalized undertaking of historical events that might not be fully accurate, so as always do your own research!

**Modernity**:

In some ways, Modernity came hand in hand with the Age of the Enlightenment (*l‚ÄôAge des Lumieres*) which overtook European thought during the 17th and 18th Century.

Modernity happened as a direct consequence of scientific prowess which was becoming more and more prevalent in every day society.  One of theses consequences was the proliferation of knowledge and the birth of mass culture directly tied to specific inventions, such as that of the printing press. With these technologies in hand, the average person was gifted with a much larger access to general knowledge and was exposed to much more prolific networks of information. For instance; the bible became a mass produced commodity and could be read by any one individual who so chose to without having to depend on the clergy reading it out to them on Sunday Mass. You could read it from the comfort of your own home but most importantly you could examine it closely and you could question its inconsistencies without having a religious authority guide your opinions for you. So with this direct distribution of knowledge and with the advent of modern technology to push it out came the opportunity for individual thought.

This was the age of humanism. The rise of science, the rise of technological advancement and the rise of globalization was coupled with an entrenched want for rationality and individualism in a world that seemed to be in urgent need for it. Materialist and reductionist discourse became very popular and human reason was hailed as the catalyst for a utopian world. With our reason, our rationality and with this push for scientific discoveries, we would create a modern world, that would solve the tribalistic problems of the past.

**Post-Modernity:**

And then the Great Depression happened, quickly followed by World War I; the birth of modern warfare which gave us more than 10 million dead. And after that World War 2, more than 60 million dead. The very first use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The cold war. All of these things which pushed us towards the society we live in today which is often referred to as the era of ‚Äúlate stage capitalism.‚Äù

These atrocities created some sort of schism in the ideologies pushed forward by modernist thought.  Something was fundamentally wrong and the violence and irrationality of the olden times had never gone away, it was still here all along but with new more dangerous toys to play with.

So if the age of modernity was highlighted as an age humanism where truths and anthropocentric ideologies were hailed, the age of of Post Modernity was a direct reaction to that. It was a complete disillusionment with these so called modern values and a birthplace for huge movements of skepticism, mistrust and downright hatred towards any form of authority, be it a government or a philosophy. During modernity we declared the truth, during post modernity we questioned any insinuation to a truth. This is the broad mentality of what we currently refer as late stage capitalism

**Post Modernism and Cryptocurrency:**

The problem with this ‚Äúpost modern thought‚Äù that is supposedly in full occurrence today is that it never amounted to anything besides a hefty criticism of the world hidden within the confines of literary and artistic works. It never translated to any real societal change and remains a whiny afterthought while the enthrallment for the modern world and its uncontrollable growth remains as unhinged and as dangerous as ever.

We are today blessed with the existence of big government, big pharma, big tech, big banks, big corporations, mass surveillance, mass corruption, too big to fail institutions, not to mention proxy wars between abstract entities fighting for land and resources all the while the purchasing power of the average joe steadily declines and a dystopic landscape slowly molds into the new normal.

\*Takes a deep breath\*

Basically a lot of words to say society isn't perfect and we don't seem to have a lot of recourse when it comes to changing it. All we can do is hope that the big boys on top do the right thing.

So although technology has evidently brought about countless positive changes to society, it seems that these occurrences have always been guided by the hand of new age oligarchies in order to further asset consolidation in the hands of the few. All of this thanks to, of course, modern day financial institutions. In other words, money makes the world go round and the powerful control the flow.

So what am I saying here? Am I saying we should all put on our Chinese-made Karl Marx shirts and go eat the rich? No, not at all. I am simply observing that there seems to be a pretty big disparity between the culture of post modernist thought with its cynical temperament and the contrast with  reality where it seems that any one normal individual is being granted less and less power to have any form of meaningful change on the world. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much we criticize if we can‚Äôt act on that criticism.

This is where I truly believe cryptocurrency can reverse the trend. Why is that? Because if these decentralized networks prove to be successful at what they are trying to achieve, they will change the way we view monetary policy and general economics in a way that we have never seen before. They could change the world. The point of crypto isn‚Äôt just to help you transfer money across the globe without the help of a big institution. It is also about providing the security and freedom FROM that authority when it comes to your own money and your own digital assets without the need to rely on ANY financial institutions. Better yet, it gives you the choice to reposition and redefine these assets in a way that conforms to your particular perception of monetary value.

Simply by existing and offering their services, cryptocurrencies are  making us witness a new battle of the fittest, a new evolutionary contention. At the heart of that battle? The economic propositions regarding how money operates on a global scale. Some coins will want to be inflationary, some will want to be deflationary, some will want to be both, and some will want to be something entirely different. Heck, I‚Äôm sure somewhere along the line we will have some cryptocurrencies where the governance protocol isn‚Äôt even invented by humans but by some sort of AI. The point being, this is the very first opportunity in human history that technology has given us a chance to redefine economic theory without depending on the petrodollar or any other state controlled currency and literally anyone can participate in the conversation. If post modern though wants to criticize and move away from all of these big corporations, this is literally the best opportunity that we have.

This is why cryptocurrency is important and this is why it has the potential to be the highlight of post modernity. Will this actually happen? I don‚Äôt know, but I sure do like to dream.",cryptocurrency

defi,DeFi is the Future of Banking that Humanity Deserves,"I recently found this informative article that does a great job explaining DeFi and its ability to disrupt the banking industry as we know it. It specifically mentions Polkadot‚Äôs focus and potential to become the leader of the DeFi market which I think is very exciting.

I wanted to start a discussion about a few possible barriers I see and questions I have not mentioned in this article regarding the future and utility of DeFi and their platforms.

The incentive behind DeFi projects is the ability to stake and borrow assets at more beneficial rates to consumers. The DeFi project I‚Äôm specifically involved in is Mantra Dao (OM). I‚Äôm currently earning a whopping annual interest rate of 30% by staking. 

My question is: with most of these projects having a supply cap (Mantra Dao‚Äôs being 888,888,888), what happens to supply in future years as we get closer to the supply cap being reached? Is the interest rate reduced as more people stake? How do DeFi projects ensure sustainability as they gain adoption and have a larger amount of tokens being staked?

Also, I‚Äôd like to hear about some other up-and-coming DeFi projects out there. I stumbled upon Mantra Dao a few weeks ago and fell in love with some of its features like the Mantra Pool, their exchange swapping, and its promising management team. What other exciting projects are out there?

Im looking to seek advice if I should apply for a bank statement loan or a conventional loan. Credit score is 760. I have only have $80k to put down on a $400k house (20%).

My issue is picking between these two scenarios:

**Scenario 1 - Conventional 30yr Loan**

&amp;#x200B;

* **GOOD:** 3% Interest Rate  
 
* **BAD:** Pay $25k in taxes which brings my down payment down to 10% (and incur PMI)  
 

**Scenario 2 - Bank Statement Loan**

&amp;#x200B;

* **GOOD:** Write off most of my taxes and pay minimum taxes (Able to put full 20% down payment)  
 
* **BAD: 5.5%** Interest Rate (would refinance in 2 years)  
 

I know conventional loans with lower interest rates are better and ideally I would like to have it. Bank statement loans help me because I can write off my taxes and not pay too much taxes which I can use to my down payment. I would refinance later.

Which is better scenario - bank statement vs conventional?",finance

computers,What do you do with a dead pixel on laptop screen?,"I'm saying this with experience. I had a Windows 8 Toshiba laptop, which was never used before. Suddenly, when I went internet while I was reading an ebook, kind of brown like stain/mark appeared in my laptop. I touched the screen and found out it wasn't from outside of the screen but inside the screen. Meant an internal error. I surfed internet frantically to solve this. They told me to apply a little pressure to mark, with a wet cloth slightly. But it only made worse and now my Toshiba screen is all over with giant Black spots. DO NOT DO THAT AT ALL THE COST! 

I learned that stain was called as a ""dead pixel error"" Apparently, your laptop screen is made up of billions of little pixels, same like how your body is made up of billions of atoms. Due to a hardware error or over usage or dropping of water into screen, dead pixel error can happen. But, what do you do with it? You only have one option. Live with it or replace it. You can replace the screen of the laptop (it's gonna cost some amount of money) or don't do anything. Just reject its presence and go on with your work. Thanks for reading!",technology

Also is there anything I'm missing that might add or reduce costs? I heard about certain tax benefits that if factored in would reduce the monthly cost but I don't know much about that so I didn't include it. Maybe there are other things I'm overlooking

   * Mortgage insurance
   * Property tax rate
   * Home insurance

CryptoCurrency,Are we in a Crypto Bubble (like the Dot Com bubble) -- thoughts?,"First, I'm very bullish on crypto, decentralized finance, and Bitcoin as a store of value. Second, I have a portfolio heavy in crypto and I'm loving how it's been taking off this whole year and especially this past week. However, I'm always thinking about downside. This is important because if there is a heavy downside, it'll be important to make a strategy there as well and do research to see what cryptos are future friendly.

**This is my hypothesis: we are in a cryptocurrency bubble. This bubble will be similar to the dot com bubble (around 2000) where all cryptos go way up, the bubble bursts, we go into a bear market, but the cryptos that remain will be the ones that developers, investors, and consumers will rally around to forge the future of currency/finance/business/investment.** 

Here are some thoughts:

* This recent boom in cryptocurrency has happened just as /r/Wallstreetbets and $GME has dwindled. Perhaps the greed, excess capital, and high risk appetite has spilled into crypto.
* For various reasons, people are putting money in appreciating assets. This is due to stimulus packages, low interest rates, being at home, and anticipation of inflation. We can see this in the stock market as well, which has reached ATH despite goods and services output being down. 
* Mentions by celebrities like Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, Snoop Dogg
* Even DOGECOIN and XRP are going up. This is even after their telegram pump and dump phases. DOGECOIN is at 7 cents people! Even in the crypto-sphere, it'll be hard to defend it or buy it over something like Cardano, XRP, Algorand.  
* I'm starting to think that I can put a blindfold on, go to coinmarket cap, and point to a crypto and it will go up at least 50% in a week. This is pretty much what the dot com bubble sounded like, where any company people invested in went up if it was related to the internet.  
* The ease of access to secure, legitimate, reputable exchanges is high, leading to an ease for everyday retail investors (also meaning casual crypto investors and people who don't understand crypto). I can't access Dogecoin, but apparently, Robinhood can!

investing,Castor Maritime ($CTRM) to buy two LR2 tankers for $27MM. Market Cap jumps $250MM.,"That title is  worse than it sounds.  We need to talk about shipping:

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who hasn't looked at a maritime shipping/bulker/tanker company:  A) Good choice! B) The value of these companies is almost all assets.  This is one of the few places you'll still see companies trade at/below book value.  Star Bulker Carriers, for example, has $2.9 billion in ships, $1.5 billion in net equity, and a $1.2 Billion market cap.  Frontline has $1.5 Billion in equity, $1.3 billion market cap.  That doesn't mean you should go out and buy $SBLK or $FRO.  The business is an asset heavy, miserably unprofitable commodity service.  Everyone in the shipping industry waits around cutting their teeth until a shipping supercycle hits and they can actually profit.  They have extreme sensitivity to interest rates, and extreme sensitivity to economic downturns.

&amp;#x200B;

You aren't getting $1 for $.90 buying these stocks.  You're getting the expected future cashflows from $1 of net merchant ship, which the market ascribes an NPV of  &lt;$1.

&amp;#x200B;

I digress.  Castor, as of 9/30, has $30 million in ships.  Six 75,000 DWT bulkers, to be exact.  A tiny fleet. They've now bought a Capesize and 2 LR2 tankers.  Lets call that an extra $80 million.  $110MM in ships.  Their market cap, as of close, is $880MM.  8x price/assets for merchant ships!  WHAT?  It's not uncommon for this company's peers to trade at .3x price/assets!

&amp;#x200B;

That's... a bad investment.  Quite possibly the worst investment opportunity I've ever seen.  At least most bubbles have some ""moonshot"" potential; these guys buy boats.  Sell.  Run.  This is the dumbest bubble I've ever seen.

Bitcoin,Taking a loan against my bitcoin,"Often hear Michael saylor say how the rich just live off loans against their assets instead of selling. Im curious how this would work for bitcoin.

So far the only services I see that provide crypto backed loans are blockfi and celcius. The interest rates seem pretty steep though, and the amount of collateral they require you to deposit with them starts at 50% loan to value, which means for a 50k loan you'd need to deposit around 2btc to be held as collateral.


That's not getting into the interest rate which ranges, but for a 50% LTV, it's a pretty steep ~12% on blockfi.

So my problems here are 2 fold.. Isn't there some inherent counterparty risk letting blockfi/celcius hold your btc, and aren't these interest rates way too steep?

I understand you can just refinance your loan at the end of the term, but that means you have to keep paying 12% APY, where does that cash come from if all your NW is in btc?",cryptocurrency
gaming,Waiting game (A PS5 STORY),"I‚Äôve seen the PS5 get compared to gold dust and other such hard to find items over the last few days and a major questions comes to mind, why?. 

I‚Äôm a massive PlayStation fan and I‚Äôm really eager to get a PS5 but I‚Äôm happy to wait until later in the year when the situation resolves itself and stock is more easily available. That‚Äôs mainly for the following reasons:

- Better choice of bundle options (No rush to checkout and able to shop for the best deal) 
- Currently the games out on the system equate to nothing more than revamped PS4 games, with very few PS5 games actually out at the moment.
- Lastly why would I pay ¬£700 plus for a console that sells for ¬£450 ?

I honestly can‚Äôt understand why people are so desperate to have something that right now isn‚Äôt really worth it, just to play your PS4 games on a newer system. I also understand that parents are trying to buy for their kids and being a father myself I can sympathise, at the same time this audience seems to be the Likely targets for the scalpers and surely your kid can wait right? 

Whilst we‚Äôre on that subject I saw an article about scalpers getting a bad rep, how they didn‚Äôt think they were doing anything wrong and other businesses operate the same way. I‚Äôm sorry but using bots to bypass site security and exploit flaws in a website for financial gain, doesn‚Äôt exact scream humble small business. Not only that but do scalpers understand the pressure they are putting on the demand? It would be hard for people to get a PS5 under normal circumstances, due to supply lines. Having bots bypass checkout queues and other customers is an unfair advantage, if we were in a store and you walked to the front desk ahead of the queue would people just accept it?.

Now what has been great through this whole thing is people seem to realise how feeding these scalpers is not helping the situation, finding an alternative method or just waiting it out, second hand prices are staring to decrease. This could also be down to a bill the UK will soon be passing to make scalping illegal, it will be interesting to see how many consoles remain on sites such as Ebay and if the scalpers decide to rapidly resale and decrease their prices. 

Hats off to those who have stuffed the scalpers and bid their auctions up, found a console themselves or just waited it out. I hope the situation improves soon nevertheless I‚Äôll be ready to get one when I‚Äôm able to do so.",technology

MachineLearning,[D] Inductive biases for audio spectrogram data.,"Convolutional layers in deep neural nets tend to work well on images because of particular assumptions that can be made about images:

* Pixels that are closer together are more likely to be related (have mutual information?) For example: if you see a pattern that looks like the surface of a basketball in a small region, you can reasonably expect there to be a lot more basketball in neighbouring regions
* Images of the world are usually taken kind of arbitrarily wrt the things in the frame. For example: A face in the top right of an image and a face in the centre of the frame are the same kind of thing.

I'm sure there are many more assumptions and rephrasings of them. Convolutions exploit these assumptions by extracting more info from an image with less computation (or at least that's my intuition).

Then there's audio data. Audio waveforms are commonly converted into ""spectrograms"" where the waveform has been split up into lots of different sine waves of different frequencies (Fourier transform). Here's a [cool site](https://borismus.github.io/spectrogram/) I saw recently that shows you the spectrograms generated by your computer microphone.

**AFAIK** the current best and standard way of ingesting audio data for deep learning is to take the raw waveform, run a Fourier transform on it (STFT) to get a spectrogram and then run convolutions over the spectrogram, like it was an image. The low-level outputs of these convolutions can then be fed into a recurrent neural net to better model sequential stuff or a fully convolutional network if you only want to look at a fixed slice of audio. This is really fucking cool imo - I was really surprised when I first saw this done.

As cool as they are, it seems kind of weird and limiting (to me) to be treating these spectrograms like they're images. They are *kind of like images* but also they're not. Images have 3 dimensions (space, space, magnitude for greyscale) while spectral audio data has \~3 dimensions (time, frequency, magnitude). I'd be very surprised if (time, frequency) had all the same expoitable properties as (space, space). Like, maybe they do! I don't know, but it doesn't seem settled to me.

This leads me to ask: **what special tricks can we use on audio data**? I'd be keen to know if any new practices have emerged in the past few years. In addition does what I said above make any sense, or is it nonsense?

One example of a ""special trick"" I've seen is instead of using square convolutions, we should use rectangular convolutions with a mixture of longer ones in the time dimension and longer ones in the frequency dimension. The idea was that they would seperately learn to capture long term effects in each dimension,which would have different characteristics. I don't know if this pariticular trick actually works or if it is just a nice sounding idea.

Another one, which I mentioned above, is to chop the audio spectrogram up into really thin and tall slices (entire audible frequency spectrum 20-20kHz, \~30ms of time), run convolutions on those, and then pass the latent vector into a RNN. I think this better models that the frequency dimension is ""more spatial"" but the time dimension is ""more sequential"" over longer distances. I'd be keen to know if anyone has tried applying transformers to this data instead of RNNs.",technology

personalfinance,Using equity to buy new home - HELOC vs Mortgage?,"Planning to move into a larger house. Wife and I both work and own our current house outright. Our old home will show much better without furniture, so we've decided we want to buy and move first, then sell the old house. Based on our new home budget, we could buy with cash (no mortgage), using our savings combined with perhaps 50% of the equity in our current home. The question is how to best access our current equity.

1) We could use a HELOC on our current home, and use that (combined with our savings) to pay for the new home with cash. Then turn around and sell the old house, thus closing out the HELOC.

2) We could just get a mortgage on the new house and then pay it off early, after selling the old house. Our local credit union charges no early payment fees. I am a first-time home buyer (the old house is in wife's name only) which technically qualifies us for something like $500-$800 in reduced closing costs through my credit union - they confirmed.

The credit union suggested a HELOC was a better fit for us. A historical search of this sub-reddit seemed to lean the same direction, but I can't find ""Why?"". If a mortgage has lower interest rates, and I get a discount on closing fees, why would it be the worse option? Is a mortgage more paperwork? Or are HELOC's cheaper in terms of closing fees? The credit union estimated mortgage closing fees on a new house in our price range would be something like $1700, and that's before my first-time-buyer discount.

investing,Forgotten lessons of 2008 that are even more relevant today,"In 2010 legendary investor and founder of the Baupost Group Seth Klarman described in his annual letter 20 lessons from the financial crisis which were either never learned or else immediately forgotten by most market participants. With him at the helm the Baupost Group has averaged around 18% and that since 1982 -  a spectacular return. Some of these lessons are even more relevant today. I took the most important ones and updated it for the current market.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Things that have never happened before are bound to occur with some regularity. You must always be prepared for the unexpected, including sudden, sharp downward swings in markets and the economy. Whatever adverse scenario you can contemplate, reality can be far worse.

Nassim Taleb calls these ‚ÄúBlack Swans‚Äù:  an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight)hindsight. Examples would be the Internet, the personal Computer, World War I, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 9/11 and of course the Coronavirus.

These all changed countries or continents for decades.  With shutdown still in place in several countries in the world the economy‚Äôs output is much lower than it was at the end of 2019 -  yet we reached an all time high in the stock market. New Mutations are evolving and there might be a sharp downturn in the future or there might not. History taught us that market crashes are much more common than we think. So it is important to be diversified in different asset classes, industries and countries to be protected against those changes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When excesses such as lax lending standards become widespread and persist for some time, people are lulled into a false sense of security, creating an even more dangerous situation. In some cases, excesses migrate beyond regional or national borders, raising the ante for investors and governments. These excesses will eventually end, triggering a crisis at least in proportion to the degree of the excesses. Correlations between asset classes may be surprisingly high when leverage rapidly unwinds.

With interest rates in Europe being partly negative and extremely low in the US, people are lulled into borrowing to get onto the Party of rising stocks, and that on margin. Margin on Portfolio reached an all time high in December of 2020 and the number of retail traders thanks to Robin Hood exploded even with the recent controversy. In addition - central banks in Europe and the US are printing money like there is no tomorrow. These money policies have driven stocks to a new high. And the excess of government debt mirrored that progression. Action always have consequences - but however harsh they may be one thing is certain: If the current price is higher, the returns won‚Äôt be as great in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nowhere does it say that investors should strive to make every last dollar of potential profit; consideration of risk must never take a backseat to return. Conservative positioning entering a crisis is crucial: it enables one to maintain long-term oriented, clear thinking, and to focus on new opportunities while others are distracted or even forced to sell. Portfolio hedges must be in place before a crisis hits. One cannot reliably or affordably increase or replace hedges that are rolling off during a financial crisis.

We all chase profits, that is just how it is. However conservative positioning and a long-term oriented perspective is crucial. Most people in 2000 thought they would buy the dip when their favourite stocks started to decline, however the decline didn‚Äôt stop. The Nasdaq posted a loss of 77%, which would take 15 years to regain the dotcom bubble. During the financial crisis many couldn‚Äôt sell their stock because there were no buyers - even retail investors that thought they could get out couldn‚Äôt.

During it Janus Funds were similar to ARK today. Investing in modern technology companies and industry they were one of the top cutting edge technologies. Janus were lauded as great money managers but the end of the bubble resulted in brutal loses. Cathie Wood is one of the smartest investors today, but one has to keep in mind the inherent risk that comes with her investment strategy.

Similarly we saw extreme loses in GME. Chasing after returns purely on performance will not result in great results.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Risk is not inherent in an investment; it is always relative to the price paid. Uncertainty is not the same as risk. Indeed, when great uncertainty ‚Äì such as in the fall of 2008 ‚Äì drives securities prices to especially low levels, they often become less risky investments.

This is the quintessential art of investing. Your returns will entirely depend on what price you paid. Microsoft was a great company, but buying it during the dotcom bubble would leave you 15 years with no returns and several other well known companies like Cisco or Intel never reached their dot-com peak. Your returns are entirely dependent on the price you pay and so is the risk factor.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do not trust financial market risk models. Reality is always too complex to be accurately modeled. Attention to risk must be a 24/7/365 obsession, with people ‚Äì not computers ‚Äì assessing and reassessing the risk environment in real time. Despite the predilection of some analysts to model the financial markets using sophisticated mathematics, the markets are governed by behavioral science, not physical science.

Because of this behavior we see certain securities being extremely highly valued like Zoom at the moment and certain sectors being very depressed like oil until recently. Yet oil is seen as extremely risky, even though the projected use of oil will increase in the next 10 years. That means that you can find bargains all the time. Those bargains are declared risky -  while the overvalued stocks are declared safe. Microsoft after the dotcom bubble only recovered in 2016. 15 years of no gains at all -  yet now Microsoft is treated like a company that will be a great stock forever. It is a great company, but the same was thought about companies like Polaroid or Kodak - we saw how it turned out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do not accept principal risk while investing short-term cash: the greedy effort to earn a few extra basis points of yield inevitably leads to the incurrence of greater risk, which increases the likelihood of losses and severe illiquidity at precisely the moment when cash is needed to cover expenses, to meet commitments, or to make compelling long-term investments.

This can be highly dangerous and I see it all the time here on reddit. Someone wants to use the money in 3-5 years to buy a house, yet instead of proposing a portfolio that is safe and diversified in several asset classes, most propose a stock only portfolio and sometimes even sector or ARK ETFs. Research has shown that a stock only portfolio will beat pretty much every other asset allocation -  that is over the long term. Due to the ups and downs of the market it doesn‚Äôt guarantee returns in 3-5 years or even worse can lead to loses. From 1929-1954,1973-1982 and from 2000-2013 the S&amp;P 500 has shown long stretches of no absolute return. Investing before a correction that you cannot foresee would result in either big loses or in the inability to purchase that house -  often both. So be conservative when you need the money.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The latest trade of a security creates a dangerous illusion that its market price approximates its true value. This mirage is especially dangerous during periods of market exuberance. The concept of ""private market value"" as an anchor to the proper valuation of a business can also be greatly skewed during ebullient times and should always be considered with a healthy degree of skepticism.

This is especially true today. Many stocks are currently at outrageous prices. I don‚Äôt talk about the FANGMAN stocks -  these have great growth and while still being historically overvalued not outrageously so. Several EV/Green/Biotech/Weed/Technology stocks are seen as the next big Google without decent cash flows and while competing in the same space.

This is especially true for unprofitable companies at the moment. According to Joel Greenblatt:  If you bought every company that lost money in 2019 that had a market cap over $1 billion, and so they‚Äôre about 261 companies, you‚Äôll be up 85 percent so far until today. Something like that won‚Äôt be sustainable.Looking at the fundamentals behind the business often makes it clear how unreasonable some of these numbers are - and what returns should be expected of them (often negative)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You must buy on the way down. There is far more volume on the way down than on the way back up, and far less competition among buyers. It is almost always better to be too early than too late, but you must be prepared for price markdowns on what you buy.

We saw that during the financial crisis and also again in 2020. Those that bought on the way down were generously rewarded. You never know when the bottom will hit especially since everyone will run around in panic like a beheaded henn. Researching the fundamentals of a company one can score great businesses for cheap. However they might go down a bit in the short term due to market panic.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Financial innovation can be highly dangerous, though almost no one will tell you this. New financial products are typically created for sunny days and are almost never stress-tested for stormy weather. Securitization is an area that almost perfectly fits this description; markets for securitized assets such as subprime mortgages completely collapsed in 2008 and have not fully recovered. Ironically, the government is eager to restore the securitization markets back to their pre-collapse stature.

As SPACs and Bitcoin dominate the current market this warning is very important. SPACs and the companies behind them haven‚Äôt had the greatest return over the long term. With the explosion of SPACs going public, chances are high that those financial products can be very dangerous. Add the risk that SPAC managers often get big compensation packages and try to hide information to increase the price (DOJ Investigation from Clover), these investments should be taken with the utmost caution. Not only that but they also compete in the same space.

The same applies to bitcoin. While I believe that cryptocurrencies will have a bright future, they have yet to be tested during prolonged market downturn where the market was negative not just a few week but several months or even years. No one know what the price will be then and some investors might wake up to a bad surprise. It is important to know these risks.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ratings agencies are highly conflicted, unimaginative dupes. They are blissfully unaware of adverse selection and moral hazard. Investors should never trust them.

That what makes short seller research so important. While there are a lot of crocks in the financial market (both on the long and the short side), these people often find what the rating agencies or investment banks ignore. If you invest into a company and there is a short report don‚Äôt dismiss it - often they include information that was previously overlooked.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Be sure that you are well compensated for illiquidity ‚Äì especially illiquidity without control ‚Äì because it can create particularly high opportunity costs.

The OTC market absolutely exploded in 2020. Many of these are highly illiquid. Be prepared for the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Beware leverage in all its forms. Borrowers ‚Äì individual, corporate, or government ‚Äì should always match fund their liabilities against the duration of their assets. Borrowers must always remember that capital markets can be extremely fickle, and that it is never safe to assume a maturing loan can be rolled over. Even if you are unleveraged, the leverage employed by others can drive dramatic price and valuation swings; sudden unavailability of leverage in the economy may trigger an economic downturn.

Everyone takes debt at the moment. It is so cheap that many companies use debt to do buybacks or otherwise increase their price. Other people trade on margin and governments don't seem to care about debt. That can be highly dangerous. No one can control interests rates over the long run and bankruptcy is the most surefire way to delete any investment returns. Peter Lynch said: ‚ÄúIf you have no debt it is very hard to go bankrupt‚Äù. While businesses with little or no debt might not rise to the same degree, they will reduce the chance of a wipeout significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When a government official says a problem has been ""contained,"" pay no attention.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The government ‚Äì the ultimate short-term-oriented player ‚Äì cannot withstand much pain in the economy or the financial markets. Bailouts and rescues are likely to occur, though not with sufficient predictability for investors to comfortably take advantage. The government will take enormous risks in such interventions, especially if the expenses can be conveniently deferred to the future. Some of the price-tag is in the form of back- stops and guarantees, whose cost is almost impossible to determine.

We saw that in March the Fed stepped in and bailed out the market. A decrease in interest rates and intense money printing. However the question is: How long can it continue and what will happen to those expenses in the future? All action has consequences and we saw that some of them can end quite bad.

Seth Klarman also added some false lessons, that are relevant without commentary.

**False Lessons**

1. There are no long-term lessons ‚Äì ever.
2. Bad things happen, but really bad things do not. Do buy the dips, especially the lowest quality securities when they come under pressure, because declines will quickly be
3. There is no amount of bad news that the markets cannot see past.
4. If you‚Äôve just stared into the abyss, quickly forget it: the lessons of history can only hold you back.
5. Excess capacity in people, machines, or property will be quickly absorbed.
6. Markets need not be in sync with one another. Simultaneously, the bond market can be priced for sustained tough times, the equity market for a strong recovery, and gold for high inflation. Such an apparent disconnect is indefinitely sustainable.
7. In a crisis, stocks of financial companies are great investments, because the tide is bound to turn. Massive losses on bad loans and soured investments are irrelevant to value; improving trends and future prospects are what matter, regardless of whether profits will have to be used to cover loan losses and equity shortfalls for years to come.
8. The government can reasonably rely on debt ratings when it forms programs to lend money to buyers of otherwise unattractive debt instruments.
9. The government can indefinitely control both short-term and long-term interest rates.
10. The government can always rescue the markets or interfere with contract law whenever it deems convenient with little or no apparent cost. (Investors believe this now and, worse still, the government believes it as well. We are probably doomed to a lasting legacy of government tampering with financial markets and the economy, which is likely to create the mother of all moral hazards. The government is blissfully unaware of the wisdom of Friedrich Hayek: ‚ÄúThe curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.‚Äù)

ROI,"US Month: US authorities have a long history of murdering striking workers fighting for better conditions, dating back to the 1800s, up to the present day. According to a study in 1969, the United States has had the bloodiest and most violent labour history of any industrial nation in the world.","US conservatives and authorities have systematically dismantled labor unions over the past few decades, and by 2011 fewer than 7% of employees in the private sector belong to unions. The number of major work stoppages fell by 97% from 381 in 1970 to 187 in 1980 to only 11 in 2010. The accumulating weaknesses were exposed when President Ronald Reagan‚Äîa former union president‚Äîbroke the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) strike in 1981, dealing a major blow to unions. Union membership among workers in private industry shrank dramatically, though after 1970 there was growth in employees unions of federal, state and local governments. The intellectual mood in the 1970s and 1980s favored deregulation and free competition. Numerous industries were deregulated, including airlines, trucking, railroads and telephones, over the objections of the unions involved. Republicans, using conservative think tanks as idea farms, began to push through legislative blueprints to curb the power of public employee unions as well as eliminate business regulations. Union weakness in the Southern United States undermined unionization and social reform throughout the nation, and such weakness is largely responsible for the anaemic U.S. welfare state.

CryptoCurrency,What are key Valuation concepts when looking at crypto?,"Hi kind strangers of reddit,  
I'm relatively new to the crypto world, but have experience in traditional finance and the valuation techniques that would typically be used to value companies (listed/ transaction multiples, DCF, DDM etc.). I also understand how fiat currency trading pairs are influenced by monetary policy decisions etc.  


My understanding is that a cryptocurrency's inherit value is, at its core, based on supply vs demand (scarcity) of that cryptocurrency. The core concept which ""should"" be looked at in determining scarcity is the utility that the cryptocurrency provides its users and therefore its use case (apart from maybe BTC which can be seen as a store of value). So, depending on the scarcity of the cryptocurrency we have a price per coin which either rises or falls over time.

We can then use this price to compute a market cap for the cryptocurrency based on the outstanding coins. Is there any way to then use this market cap to work out comparable valuations of cruptocurrencies? My understanding is concepts like earnings, EBITDA etc. don't exist as you don't have any ""real"" revenues so to speak, so how can we come up with a way to see if a specific currency is under or overvalued using the concept of market cap (I assume that a network can't issue debt so we never have to think about EV?)?  

Also as a side question, how do the devs who develop these (often open source) projects remunerate themselves over the long-term? Do they just allocate themselves a certain number of coins over time? Also when we hear about VCs who invest in cryptocurrency, I assume they are investing in stuff like exchanges, wallets etc. rather than networks themselves, or do they invest via some kind of equity-token convertible instrument?

TLDR -  I was wondering if anyone could explain to me how they look at fundamental cryptocurrency valuation and how to compare valuations of cryptocurrencies?

Apologies if this is a stupid question and I am missing something fundamental here.   
Thanks alot!",cryptocurrency
wallstreet,The seasonal trend was right,"I just noticed during last few days of February that the seasonal tendencies that ICT teach are real and they respond indeed to specific interests related to the purposes of a fiat currency, I mean it I true that we‚Äôve seen some sort of a medical war in the last year because of the vaccine and as well we have seen people die around the globe, so what would everybody be like to be covered with in case some other catastrophe appears in the next decade, FOOD. What do the world use in order to buy the food in big quantities and guarantee a part of the harvest within 6 or 12 months in advance ?? BUCKS. Dollar still king, that‚Äôs a fact, that is not debatable at all so, tracking dollar as a trader is one of the most important things you gotta do, definitely if you do it well it‚Äôll be something very profitable to use. 

My thoughts on the DXY is that the price has carried the full effect of the pandemic year and all of the speculations around markets and the uncertainties of the business in America, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs got so low. But if you look at the lowest low of two years ago it even got to 80 points this year we just got into the 88 level and no lower. So the syntax of what I‚Äôm trying to explain is this, the globe will buy contracts for food, for grains, for resources and even for water, Wall Street has gained the right to price things and thoughts and the have done it using the dollar, with the help of course of the FED and the FOMC specifically.

personalfinance,How to save for a house I don't need,"Hello!

My wife and I would like to move to a different house sometime in the next 5 years. We'd like to pay more in a down payment than last time and I'm wondering how best to save for that.

1. Investing

I remember being told that you shouldn't put money into the market that you want back in five years, but we don't really NEED a house. It would just be much preferred for having kids.

My thought was to put it into aggressive small cap index funds but someone told me that would be tax inefficient? What would I put it into? ETFs are more tax efficient?

If the market turned down we just wouldn't buy a house right then.

2. Pay down current mortgage.

I'm not sure if this makes sense, but we could start paying extra on our mortgage. Currently 4.125 interest rate, but I think extra payments go straight to the principle? I read that this would cause a liquidity issue when we want to buy and would have to have our offer contingent on sale.

3. Savings account.

Could just dump money into a savings account.

No other debts and we max out IRAs. No PMI on current mortgage. Would really appreciate some advice and guidance. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Airline Employee Recall With Back Pay,"I am/was an airline employee that was laid off after Oct 1 as a result of the expiration of the CARES Act. Fast forward to last week and I received a FedEx parcel with a notice from my former employer that I'm being recalled, effective Feb 16. My recall isn't due to them needing me at work, rather congress mandated these terms in the stimulus package that was enacted at the end of December. The terms of that bill also state that I will receive getting back pay to Dec 1 and  my recall (with full benefits) is guaranteed through Mar 31.

These terms sound pretty sweet. I intend to accept them. However, I understand there are a whole host of consequences of doing so. First, I'll need to pay back my unemployment benefits to Dec 1. Second, my health benefits will be reinstated. I have the option to reinstate back to Jan 1 or Feb 1. At the beginning of the year I enrolled in a subsidized health insurance plan (Medical Assistance).

My questions are this. I will have a pile of cash coming my way when my back pay is deposited. How soon do I need to pay my unemployment back? Is that something that will get fixed in tax season 2021? If so, my plan is to dump it into a HYSA account.

Health insurance: I have state subsidized health insurance. I will need to report my change of income to the state and will lose the subsidy. Should I back-date my insurance to Jan 1 or Feb 1? I didn't have any medical expenses in Jan, but due to the back pay I now have/had insurance I should have never been eligible for in the first place.

Beyond these two things is there anything else I should keep in mind? I am a resident of Minnesota.

Once institutions realize what is going on, Providers like blockfi will need to increase interest rates for bitcoin interest accounts to 15%+ to satisfy the demand for bitcoin cash and carry because bitcoin is absolutely scarce.  At those rates, no one will sell bitcoin and it will just be locked up in overcollateralized escrow forever. This will create the mother of all scarcity feedback loops.

investing,Full Diligence Post on Palantir (PLTR) - Earnings Next Monday (2/16) &amp; Lockup Expiration (2/19),"Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Palantir ahead of its earnings next TUESDAY (Edit: sorry I got the day wrong in the title but the date 2/16 is correct). Lockup expiration is also 2/18*** (didn‚Äôt realize palantir was reporting before market open). Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom.

**Palantir Business Overview**

* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization‚Äôs various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making
* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir
* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**
* **Gotham (government side)**
   * Gotham is Palantir‚Äôs software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments
   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations
   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and¬†rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011
* **Foundry (commercial side)**
   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue
   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data
   * For example, one of Palantir‚Äôs customers is Skywise, an¬†aviation platform that has become the central operating¬†system for the airline industry
* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**
   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon
   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020
* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side

**The Palantir Business Model**

* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry
   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector
* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company‚Äôs value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company‚Äôs total headcount
* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir‚Äôs business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale
* **Acquire**
   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir‚Äôs expense and therefore operate at a loss
* **Expand**
   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer‚Äôs key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results
* **Scale**
   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially¬†using Palantir‚Äôs software for its operations and Palantir can also¬†upsell to the customer by continually¬†offering new services with minimal extra cost
* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase,¬†In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase

**The Bull Case**

* **Section 2377**
   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what‚Äôs known as Decision 2377
   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir‚Äôs rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently
   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market. Since then, Palantir's revenue from the US Army and US government has skyrocketed
* **Sticky, Best-in-Class Product**
   * Simply put, there is nothing that offers what Palantir is offering. Its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system
   * Palantir‚Äôs Gotham and Foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more it‚Äôs used, the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system
   * Palantir‚Äôs platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time, with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from 6 to 18 months
   * To further prove this point, Palantir‚Äôs top 20 customers have been with the company for an average of 7 years and as of October 2020, 93% of revenue was generated by existing customers
   * In addition to this, in the latest quarterly earnings, Palantir was selected out of 999 bids by the US Army for a 2-year $91 million contract to build AI and machine learning capabilities
* **Positive Secular Trends and Growing, Achievable TAM**
   * I think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and Palantir has spent $1.5 billion in the past 11 years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day
   * The company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected to¬†grow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 5 years
   * And with just about $1 billion dollars in revenue over the past 12 months, Palantir has less than 1% market share and has plenty of room for growth
   * But perhaps most importantly, Palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its TAM
      * In the latest earnings call, management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success
      * And among other improvements, the Apollo platform has helped the¬†company greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running
   * Being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best-in-class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for Palantir

**The Bear Case**

* **Double-Edged Business Model**
   * While Palantir‚Äôs differentiated services and business model is one of the company‚Äôs key strengths, there are also several downsides as well
   * First, due to the custom-built solutions Palantir offers, the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum 6 month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing
   * Second, even if a customer jumps on board, contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of 3-6 months
   * Third, the deep history it has with customers results in a very top-heavy concentration
      * As of the third quarter of 2020, the top 20 customers represented 61% of the company‚Äôs revenue, which notably is down from 73% from the year prior
   * Lastly, the deal-by-deal nature of Palantir‚Äôs business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict, which can be a cause of¬†concern for investors
* **Biden Administration and Negative Headline Risk**
   * First, Peter Thiel was an outspoken supporter of Trump, who increased defense spending 5% a year while Obama decreased spending 3% a year.
      * While I don‚Äôt think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir‚Äôs growth with Gotham
      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn‚Äôt foresee this to be a problem
   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future
      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.
* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**
   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space
   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for
   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies
   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125
   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir‚Äôs management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system
      * This also allows the¬†company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be¬†more competitive in the market
      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption
* **Lock-up Expiration**
   * Because this is a short-term risk, I‚Äôm adding this as a bonus bearish reason
   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade (edit, thx for pointing this out!) for employees and stakeholders, (NOT all available shares outstanding)
   * This remaining 80% (roughly 30-40% of shares outstanding) is available to trade starting February 18th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty

**Financials and Valuation**

* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the¬†company
   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a¬†company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue¬†growth is a great sign
   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average¬†revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and¬†government revenue by 68%
   * With all this¬†said, one piece of concern in Palantir‚Äôs income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation
* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is¬†that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially¬†near break-even
   * However, the company‚Äôs free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior
* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**
   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth
* **Regarding the company‚Äôs valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market
   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?

**What I‚Äôm Doing**

* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there
* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)
* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then

**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies. I am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities.

stocks,Full Diligence Post on Palantir (PLTR) - Earnings Next Monday (2/16) &amp; Lockup Expiration (2/19),"Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Palantir ahead of its earnings next TUESDAY (Edit: sorry this is wrong in the title). Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom. Would love to know all your thoughts as well.

**What Does Palantir Do?**

* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization‚Äôs various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making
* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir
* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**
* **Gotham (government side)**
   * Gotham is Palantir‚Äôs software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments
   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations
   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and¬†rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011
* **Foundry (commercial side)**
   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue
   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data
   * For example, one of Palantir‚Äôs customers is Skywise, an¬†aviation platform that has become the central operating¬†system for the airline industry
* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**
   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon
   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020
* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side

**The Palantir Business Model**

* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry
   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector
* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company‚Äôs value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company‚Äôs total headcount
* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir‚Äôs business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale
* **Acquire**
   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir‚Äôs expense and therefore operate at a loss
* **Expand**
   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer‚Äôs key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results
* **Scale**
   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially¬†using Palantir‚Äôs software for its operations and Palantir can also¬†upsell to the customer by continually¬†offering new services with minimal extra cost
* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase,¬†In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase

**The Bull Case**

* **Section 2377**
   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what‚Äôs known as Decision 2377
   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir‚Äôs rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently
   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market.

personalfinance,"In USA, Where do I find the best HELOC rates?","HI all!  First time post.  
I'm looking at getting a HELOC, but it's a product I'm not at all familiar with. 
My home is 200K, I have 85k left on 10 year mortgage with 5 years till payoff. I'm actually happy with my interest rate, and don't think I'll beat it with a refi.  (Caught a local bank in a good mood.)
I want to use the HELOC for another 40k.  This will still put me well below 70% of home's appraisal from 5 years ago. 
I expect to pay off the HELOC on the same schedule as the mortgage - so within 5 years.  I am very new to this kind of loan though, so I had a few questions. 
What should I expect to pay for fees?  Will I need a new appraisal?  Home values in the area have gone up significantly, and I've done some significant improvements since purchase.  
Is there a downside to early payoff on a HELOC if I'm happy with the introductory interest rate?  
I think I could achieve the same goals with a home equity loan, but that appears to have higher fees and closing costs than a HELOC, is that the case?",finance
personalfinance,"Wife's (foreign) parents are gifting us the down payment for our first home. How much info about the money's origin must be mentioned to a potential mortgage lender, if any?","TL;DR: How much information about funds gifted for a down payment am I *required* to share with a potential mortgage lender? Is any/all information, beyond what I am required to share, in my interest to withhold?
/tldr

As the gift is in excess of $100k, I know we will need to fill out a form 5320 to report the gift to the IRS, though, as the donors are not US citizens nor green card holders, we will not need to pay taxes on it.

As the situation of parents helping their children with a down payment is common enough, I've found several articles discussing complications such gifts can cause. Among them, I've read that lenders asking for previous months' bank statements from potential ""mortgagors"" will spot the arrival of the gifted funds, will ask about them, and may want a message, in writing, from the donor that the funds were given freely as a gift (and are not a loan), may want to see details of the wire transfer, and may even want to see the donor's bank statements. As my in-laws don't speak, read, or write in English, and their bank statements would be from a foreign bank and also not in English, I can see the potential for this to end up being a major complication. Some sites suggest ""seasoning"" any gift money, which means letting it sit in the account for an amount of time greater than the period a lender is likely to request past bank statements. If the money arrived prior to the oldest statement given, a lender isn't likely to be concerned about where the funds came from.

Is any of the above likely to affect the interest *rate* I and my wife are offered on a 30-year, 20% down payment mortgage? Or is it only likely to affect whether or not we are pre-qualified at all, and/or the timing of pre-qualification?",finance

Bitcoin,Funny Math...what am I missing?,"Hello there! So I was playing around with Blockfi interest rates and came up with this scenario in my mind:

&amp;#x200B;

Say someone has 2 BTC and this cycle BTC hits $150K a coin, so that individual has $300K in BTC.

Then that individual converts it to USD coin...if you give Blockfi $300K in USD coin and have them keep it for 30 YEARS, they will pay you a yearly interest rate of $108,837.45!!?? For a total of $3.2+ million over the life of the 30 year period. 

Certainly this individual could retire and live on this amount of yearly interest rate.

So if we do see a $150K bitcoin in the next couple years, should this individual start looking at condos off the coast of Thailand and planning an early retirement? Or is this scammy/unrealistic?

Please share your thoughts?

Background: 35m, single, high cost of living area, 125k income with stable job and yearly increase in income expected.

Debt: 115k in federally held student loans @ 6% (currently paused but typical monthly is $1050) and car note for 31k at 1.9%. No other debt of any kind.

Got a commision payment coming my way for 30k by the end of the week and trying to figure out whether its best to sock it away in a HYSA pending what congress does with forgiveness. (Also planning on refinancing the loans with a private lender at 3% post Sept 30.)

OR 

go ahead and wipe out the car loan and own it free and clear. Bought the car used and have had it about a year. Car is in perfect running order.  Then between now and Sept 30. when forbearance expires continue to put away 1K a month into a HYSA to make a lump sum of what i have saved. 

Either way, I plan on aggressively paying down whatever the left over sum of the loan is as of Sept. 30 regardless of either option taken.

Bitcoin,How to Bitcoin long-term leverage?,"Hi,

with interest rates near zero, leverage should be cheap. And we all know that Bitcoin is volatile, but unlikely to take another &gt; -50% decline in the near future. So a small 2x leverage on the way to 100k makes sense. On Binance, however, interest rates for USDT rose to 0.15% per day, so 50% per year for your margin account. Another option would their leveraged token, but it goes negative during times of high volatility or side-ways action even when Bitcoin isn't loosing. The Binance option have super high implied volatility (=high premium) and have near expiration dates and low strikes. So where can I still get 2x crypto exposure without 50% interest rates?

There is also the option to buy a mini-future (ISIN: DE000VQ17JF1) but leverage is only 1,2 and steadily decreasing with higher price.",cryptocurrency

Then I got a second *very* part time job, and then COVID hit and both my real job schedule and my caregiver schedule fluctuated wildly, so I was making anywhere from $200 per week to $700 per week, i.e. working anywhere from ten hours a week to over 50 hours per week. My husband was also laid off and received Unemployment for several months, though he only made about $35 more per week than when he was working - but he didn't elect to have his taxes taken out automatically.

Because my income was so variable, and because of all the chaos of COVID and my dad's separate but severe health &amp; behavioral problems, I never got around to updating our income with the Healthcare Marketplace. I figured when I did our taxes I would have to pay a small, proportionate penalty for having my average weekly income be closer to $500 than $200, but nothing I couldn't manage.

Well, I did my taxes on TurboTax the other day and discovered they want me to pay back the *entire* tax credit we received, to the tune of over $8,000 (plus the taxes on his Unemployment &amp; the usual ""you didn't pay enough payroll tax""). 

Is there anything I can do here? We are, thankfully, getting $4,000 back from our state but if we use that to pay the feds we still owe $6,800 and it will take YEARS to pay that off, especially since my dad is now in a long term care facility and I no longer have the income from caring for him full time.

investing,A threat to our real estate investments: Climate Change and Insurance,"While this sub mostly discusses trading in the stock market, many of us are also invested in the real estate market, so this article may interest you.

**TL;DR**: Risks to real estate from increasing natural disaster frequency are not not priced in. Mechanics behind how risk is spread out could mean rapidly spreading economic harm.

Some of you may remember 2008, the tumult of the housing bubble, and subsequent collapse in prices. Today housing prices are again at an all time high, outpacing inflation in a similar fashion to 2008. This has many folks who have money in real estate on edge. However, there are significant differences between today's market and that of 2008 in that the [demand appears to be real and the supply constrains appear to be real](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/NationalSummary_3Q20.pdf). But I am always on the lookout for weakness in this space since the housing market accounted for [15% of GDP in 2018](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF11327.pdf) (and is probably more in 2021). Weakness here tends to spread through the economy and affects all investments in one way or another.

Therefore, I present to you a very interesting threat to the housing market: **climate change**. In the following Harvard Business Review interview with John Macomber (a senior lecture in Harvard Business School) he lays out this threat as manifesting itself through the insurance sector.

[https://hbr.org/2020/12/are-we-on-the-verge-of-another-financial-crisis](https://hbr.org/2020/12/are-we-on-the-verge-of-another-financial-crisis)

**For those who don't want to read the whole thing, I'll summarize as best I can**: Climate change is rapidly increasing the rate of natural disasters from hurricanes to flooding to wild fires. Insurance premiums are yet to express this primarily due to government intervention (IE states providing disaster relief and mandates to insurers). The risks to real estate as an investment are increasing rapidly, yet society appears unaware and the market is not pricing this risk in. When state governments and the federal government realize they can no longer to afford to subsidize the rebuilding/repairs to homes there is risk of the system snapping as insurers go bottom up and premiums shoot through the roof.

What's more insurers are actually insured themselves by ""re-insurers"" (bet you never heard of them before right) who then slice off some of the risk by providing insurance-linked securities called ""catastrophe bonds."" These are bought by investors who essentially get paid to take on some of the underlying risk. So the risk is spread out multiple steps away from the actual asset: your home. Sound familiar? This is eerily similar to the way mortgages were packaged and sold in the years leading up to 2008 (mortgage-backed securities). It is difficult to say how spread out and linked with the rest of the economy these catastrophe bonds are.

The fear is that housing prices are getting overinflated because the physical risk to the property are hidden from public view. Govt funds dry up. Insurers suddenly feel the full brunt of the increasing frequency of natural disasters. Premiums go sky high. Catastrophe bonds become worthless. Perceived wealth suddenly dries up and the contagion spreads through the whole economy. *Pop.*

There is more to the interview and if your interest is piqued I'll let you read the rest, but this is the point I want to discuss with you all.

**My Take:**

I was reminded about this hypothesis after Reuters did this article today about huge insurance rate hikes in Florida: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-insurance-florida/florida-consumers-flabbergasted-as-property-insurers-push-for-double-digit-rate-hikes-idUSKBN2AC111](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-insurance-florida/florida-consumers-flabbergasted-as-property-insurers-push-for-double-digit-rate-hikes-idUSKBN2AC111)

Now, I'm no expert in real estate or insurance, I'm just a guy who owns some property. But like any investor I want to make sure my investment is worth the value its assigned and that potential risks are mitigated. What concerns me about this scenario is how the very real risks caused by climate change to real estate are *not being talked about in the public sphere*. What else would climate change and the subsequent increase in natural disasters have a direct impact on except for real estate.

It is really hard to say if this situation could actually lead to a massive collapse of the housing market and subsequent economic recession. As John Macomber states the ideal situation is that these risks become more apparent over time and the risks get priced in. If so, it would provide mainly a downward pressure on the real estate market rather than trigger a collapse. I actually think this is the more likely situation when the market is taken as a whole. Surely certain pockets will experience higher risk than others.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts.

My discord group of over 100 people have grouped together the majority of the most asked questioned and misunderstandings regarding Dogecoin, into the following 20 key points. Even if you know the answers to some of these please read the entire post. Please read them below. 

1. Question: What is Dogecoin?

Answer: Dogecoin (/Ààdo äd ík…î…™n/ DOHJ-koyn, code: DOGE, symbol: √ê) is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system that is instant, fun, and free from traditional banking fees. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the popular ""Doge"" meme as its logo and namesake. It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community reaching a market capitalization of US $5,382,875,000 on January 28, 2021. [Wikipedia, 20210203]

2.  Question: Why Dogecoin?

Answer: For the Lolz. Well, not quite. Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!
		
1/2 - second perspective) Question: What Is Dogecoin? And why Dogecoin?

Answer: Back a few years ago, some crazy people banded together in support of a cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin, the people's crypto, finds itself with the support of hundreds if not thousands of individuals pushing for this currency to succeed. But why is that? Unless you have been absent from every social bubble, you may have heard of Bitcoin. For the purpose of this explanation, you will find that Bitcoin is not exactly an easy thing to equate to Dogecoin, but lets think about the criteria of a Cryptocurrency.Bitcoin did not find its foothold overnight. In fact, it took several years. A lot of people fought tooth and nail for their belief in the coin. Crypto, in a nutshell, is a decentralized form of currency that finds its value in a combination of individual asset involvement, ease or difficulty in security of an exchange, creating a method of reliable, secure, trustworthy exchange, and other reasons. 

Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me.Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, insteal of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down. In essence, in 50 years, Dogecoin will still be around, still be mined, still be traded. Bitcoin will cease to be created, hoarded, and become the digital currency of the affluent.

3. Question: Places to buy dogecoin places where you can spend Dogecoin? 

Answer: Refer to r/dogecoin posts by the moderators for a list of businesses that accept doge as payment. 

4. Question: Cryptocurrencies vs stocks. The main differences between them. 
		
Answer:  
A stock is a type of investment that represents an ownership share in a company. Investors buy stocks that they think will go up in value over time. ... A stock is an investment. When you purchase a company's stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, called a share. 

A cryptocurrency:  (crypto for short) is a digital a sset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.

When comparing crypto to stocks, the main thing to keep in mind is that cryptocurrencies have few if any regulations applied to them. It is still the ""wild west"" of trading. You can be scammed, skimmed, pumped-dumped, as so forth, much more often and more easily than with stocks. Terminology is similar to exact between the two, but both require a certain mindset. Crypto is almost always a long-haul game, where stocks can be short play or long haul. Cryptocurrency is literally money. Cryptocurrencies intended purpose is to use it to exchange goods and services. The way paper money is. 

5. Question: Is Dogecoin a product of the Wallstreet Bets movement? What differentiates dogecoin from GME/AMC?

Answer: no. The rest of this article explains why. 
6. Question: Difference between cold storage, internet wallets and Robinhood

Answer: 
Coldstorage - in the cryptocurrency world cold storage refers to physical objects/devices that contain your cryptocurrency. 

Wallets are an electronic program of service that stores your cryptocurrency. There a number of different wallets - but I personally use Dogecoin.info

Robhinhood- as of right now robinhood does not actually give you cryptocurrency when purchased through them. From Robhinhood‚Äôs cryptocurrency page: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt currently provide you with access to your wallet or your wallet address.
You own the cryptocurrency assets in your account, and you can buy or sell them at any time. We‚Äôre evaluating features to allow you to safely transfer coins to and from Robinhood, and we‚Äôll update you when these features are available.‚Äù If you would
Like to use your Dogecoin or cryptocurrency in general for exchange of goods and services - it is recommended to either ask Robinhood who to give us access to our wallets or find another exchange. 


7. Question: Dogecoin vs Bitcoin - their competitive advantages and disadvantages. Answer: information explaining the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin vs Dogecoin will be explained throughout this article. 
8. Question: Is Dogecoin a meme or should it be taken seriously? 

Answer: We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of ‚Äúwidespread information‚Äù. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying ‚ÄúDogecoin is the people‚Äôs coin‚Äù comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn‚Äôt matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald‚Äôs makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald‚Äôs make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald‚Äôs have ‚Äúvalue‚Äù in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald‚Äôs do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

9. Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. Is there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let‚Äôs compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let‚Äôs compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That‚Äôs without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn‚Äôt an actual number. You can‚Äôt mine ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù dogecoin because infinity isn‚Äôt a number. It‚Äôs a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn‚Äôt have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn‚Äôt matter. In fact it‚Äôs actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is 40,000 dollars and the price per Dogecoin is .07 with a realistic possibility of only reaching $288.60 at current market conditions. That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That‚Äôs why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different. More will be covered on this topic on another section of this article. 

10. Question: Does Dogecoin have value? How does Dogecoin increase in price or decrease in price? 

Answer: Yes. Dogecoin has value. It is currently valued at between .06 and .08 as of writing this. If didn‚Äôt have value then it wouldn‚Äôt be bought or sold at all. Anything can have value as long as enough people assign it value and agree to it. The value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market.  That‚Äôs why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin, so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn‚Äôt just one person. It‚Äôs the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers ‚Äúvalue‚Äù Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .49. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that‚Äôs only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of the currency in the long run is by eventually by exchanging your coins for goods, services, or just by tipping and trading with other Dogecoin holders. This gives Dogecoin utility. Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying Dogecoin at .05 and selling it .06. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. If legitimatize Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services. 


8. Question: Circulation of currencies. The importance of buying, selling, and holding - and the differences between them. 
		
Answer: To briefly explain this, a lot of people have been saying ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never selling!‚Äù - which in itself is great start. But there remains a lot of misinformation around the topic, for example that simply ""buying and holding Doge"" will drive up the price indefinitely. Unfortunately, that is just not true. Buying, holding, and selling are all intricately connected with each other. ALL of those three states are essential for a (digital) currency to flourish. Holding does neither hurt or raise the value of the asset, but rather it helps to establish a baseline, which is also called ""setting a floor"". Those who have diligently kept on holding their coins, have allowed Dogecoin to stabilize at roughly 0.07 USD cents for the past few days. Remember, this remains a huge gain from where Dogecoin has been just weeks ago. The reason the price is not changing much from this baseline right now is because few are buying and few are selling their Dogecoin, specifically due to topics which will be covered in other sections here. However, an active circulation of a currency is critical to establishing it as an effective means of exchanging goods and setting it up for long term growth. More on the value of Dogecoin in another section. 
	9. Question: Establishing a floor or a baseline.

Answer: The day to day trends of Dogecoin may appear strange at first sight, but those who continue holding onto their Doge are affecting or rather creating the floor. The floor is essentially the lowest value Dogecoin will drop to at current market conditions. The floor is currently 0.07 USD cents. Which is up from 0.008 USD cents just a few months ago.

10. Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. Inflation and deflation Infinite supply / no cap vs cap in regarding to cryptocurrency.

Answer: First of all - the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they‚Äôre just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: ‚ÄúThe interest was already built by people trying to trick others in buying an asset they themselves do not understand and your link is to a petition that tricks people into asserting social pressure towards changing the core parameters of an asset that have been there since its launch.
We believe that what you're really doing is trying to get rich at the cost of others and when that failed because you ran out of victims and money, you come here asking us to bail you out. However, we will not bail you out, as with great freedom comes great responsibility. We take ours seriously and we hope that you will too in the future.
We have now closed this topic. Request denied.‚Äù - Patrick lodder Dogecoin developer. 

Second response
‚ÄúA, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure.
Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins.
The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.‚Äù 

You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1674

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. Her

Here‚Äôs some
Basic economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or ‚Äúworth‚Äù as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.
		
10a) What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin? 
		
		Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets - covered in other section. What gets misunderstood is which one is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or rather ""the lesser evil"".10b)	Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. If Bitcoin wants to become a real global currency with buying power, not just a speculation tool to exchange it for a few thousand debt based USD, when it hits a new record high every few months or years, its supply will have to grow inevitably. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. 
         Dogecoin is different. Dogecoin has a set amount of coins entering the market by the minute. There are plenty of spreadsheets out there showcasing exactly how much many Dogecoin will be in circulation at any given moment of time. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.

Currencies have inflation - commodities don‚Äôt. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold.

11. Question: Financial aspects of Dogecoin. Who will profit from it? What will happen if Dogecoin has exponential growth? A zero- sum game. Explaining that you only realize a loss or profit at then time of sell.

Answer: To clear things up - cryptocurrency is essentially what economist call a Zero Sum Game. A zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. What this means is that across a group of people who engage in selling and buying Dogecoin, if one person gains another person loses. For example if you bought at 0.08 and sold at 0.03 someone made a profit of 0.05 cents per Dogecoin while you lost 0.05 cents per Dogecoin. The important thing to understand is that in these situations the only way you truly lose or gain anything is when you sell. You don‚Äôt realize your gains or losses until you complete that transaction. What this means is that if Dogecoin does increase exponentially the people who have been holding since the price has been low will gain astronomical returns on their investment, while others who joined late will not.
12. Question: Stability vs Volatility
Answer: This describes basically how stable something is over a set period of time. Volatility is how much prices change over time. Stabilization of Dogecoin is important for the overall health, however, cryptocurrencies are known to and will likely remain very volatile for the foreseeable future.

13a) Question: Pump and dump vs long term growth and the difference between them.

Answer: ""Pump and dump"" is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Pump and dumps are illegal. While a subset of people are trying to pump and dump Dogecoin, the legitimate community is focused its long term growth and stability which is achieved through the rest of the topics addressed here

13b - second perspective)
Essentially many people are just coming onto DOGE because it has low barrier to entry, and enticed by the idea of coming in low, selling what they have and running with the profits short term. This has lead to pumps and dips, and a lot of misinformation being thrown around. I should clarify some points for those who are coming in, instead of repeating the HODL and diamond hands rhetoric.
Planned pumps are not what Doge needs.
Pumps of this nature usually have an attached implication, which is that people will plan on selling, capitalising on the hype and then buying low to wait for the next pump. This leads to money being taken out of the coin, resulting in the lower price we now see. This means that planned pumps are essentially feeding sellers. We are not doing this in secret. This is a public forum and people with the intention have the information needed to drain us dry if we let them.
Essentially, if we want Doge to grow, planned pumps need to stop being openly advertised, or they need to die altogether. Of the two, the latter is the easiest, and it is what this post will be focusing on.
Sustainable Growth is now the way.
Pumps are fine when they're unpredicted - Elon Musk is living proof of that. However, planned pumps will result in our good boy coin shooting down to the dips, where sellers can reinvest and wait to harvest our money again at the next pump.
If however, we grow the price slowly, the floor will increase in a much more stable fashion, resulting in smaller dips. This will mean that the insane dips where sellers truly farm their coin at become very inhospitable to them, as they'd need to put more and more money to receive less and less profit. Essentially, by slowly growing the coin with organic 'food' instead of steroids, we can slowly choke out those parasites who are ruining the growth of the coin by making every dip a horrible investment for their time and efforts.
Sure, buy at the dips. Sure, hold the coin. But don't plan any more pumps. The less room you give to the sellers, the doubters and the paper hands, the more coin you can collect and the more profit that awaits you in the future.
Conclusion
If we come together as a community, Doge will truly live up to the hype - the people's currency. If we choose to continue listening to planned pumps, we have a very difficult, long and risky road ahead of us. Sustainable growth will beat large planned spikes any day.
14. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: Elon Musk, Mark Cuban
As many may know, Elon is highly involved when it comes to ‚Äúmeme culture.‚Äù we can see Elon has tweeted several times concerning ‚Äúdoge,‚Äù reposting memes found from Reddit, as well as concerning himself with the ripples of the recent stock news. Mark Cuban, another notable wealthy, down-to-earth, community-involved individual, has recently mentioned ‚Äú#dogecoin‚Äù specifically. Regardless of whether these people have positive intentions towards $DOGE or not, their mention carries weight and public opinion and is a good assumption that new eyes are looking at us as a result. It should be noted that they have tweeted neutrally to positively towards $DOGE, not indicating a full-send support but they clearly are not talking down the possibilities.

Big business allowing Dogecoin to be supported as means of exchanging goods, and people like Elon musk supporting and backing this cryptocurrency are important to proving its value and legitimacy. 

However, it is important to remember that this is not the sole determining factor in the price. The price is determined by everything covered above. 

15. Question: Is getting Dogecoin to increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Can and will it really happen? What will change if it does happen? How high can Dogecoin realistically rise in price? Market cap explanation and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. 
	
Answer: Yes, despite not having a fixed or capped supply, the value of the currency can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.

Market cap = price x supply. Price is determined by supply and demand (buying snd selling of Dogecoin. Supply is determined by mining Dogecoin. 

The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is 9,000,000,000 (9 billion). if Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of 128 billion dollars. Since the current supply of Dogecoin Is 128 billion in circulation. Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency currently has a market cap of approximately 700,000,000,000 (700 billion dollars). This means that at $1 the total supply of Dogecoin would be ‚Äúworth‚Äù about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is 2,000,000,000 (2 trillion) since 1 dollar = 1 dollar (LOLZ) the market cap of the US currency is 2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach this market cap - the price can be calculated through dividing the market cap (2 trillion) by the supply (128 billion). This means that dogecoin would equal the entire US currency‚Äôs (M0 money supply in economics) at $15.60. This is definitely not impossible but highly highly improbable to ever reach this value any time soon. As in like 3-10 years away minimum. Now the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (paper) currency is 37 trillion dollars. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value would be $288.60 This is the theoretical limit to how much Dogecoin can be worth due simply to the fact that if it was valued at anymore than that amount it would be ‚Äúworth‚Äù more than the entire world‚Äôs paper currencies combined which is not possible without adding more supply. It‚Äôs important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change. 

17. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?
Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly¬†bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let‚Äôs do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

18. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. 

The long answer is this: Given the recent surge in Altcoins, both from a financial perspective and media coverage, there is now a very good chance that new developers will come back to Dogecoin in time. There are plenty of people with coding experience, also those who have already worked on cryptocurrency concepts in general.

As of early 2021, there are around 4000 cryptocurrencies in existance, probably several thousand more hidden as drafts or stealth projects. These days, there are well-paid positions in the up-and-coming cryptocurrency space.  There is, as always, a shortage of developers.  Thus, how can Dogecoin compete with the wider market and successfully attract developers? Well, there are a number of different reasons Dogecoin will be able to attract good developers. 
Basically, why does anyone work on anything? Why did the original Dogecoin developers even create Dogecoin in the first place? For fun, because it was interesting, because Bitcoin got the ball rolling, to be part of something exciting. 

Remember - when Bitcoin was created were those developers simply looking for short-term financial gain? No, they were likely not. Bitcoin took a while to take off. And so did Dogecoin. Bitcoin has inherent limitations for day-to-day use, while Dogecoin has received too little attention over the past few years in terms of development. But, the idea that developers will not work on Dogecoin is just a big misconception. Dogecoin is becoming too popular for developers to stay away. 

Also, once Dogecoin legitimatizes itself more widely, working on the project as a developer will become inherently more valuable, both financially and non-financially, due to the fact that it will make its way back in the top tier cryptocurrencies. 

19. Question: if all of the above information is true why the r/cryptocurrency full of people who are trying to discredit Dogecoin as legitimate cryptocurrency.  

Answer: The r/cryptocurrency is horribly misinformed. R/cryptocurrency is a specific subset of society who has an extremely knowledgeable background in computer science and computer coding.  They may have a solid understanding of the technology aspect of cryptocurrency but the reason why Dogecoin will be successful is based on economics, mathematics, social theory and statistics as WELL as the underlying technology. Each of these topics is extremely intricate and each field requires years to fully master. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won‚Äôt be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It‚Äôs been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. r/cryptocurrency is full of gatekeepers who horde their knowledge while the Dogecoin community is focused on explaining and educating new people. R/cryptocurrency is notorious for being extremely serious and feel threatened that something that started at as a joke/meme has the potential to be at cryptocurrencies intended purpose - exchanging goods and services - than Bitcoin or any other popular cryptocurrency which is deflationary in nature.

20. Question: Will cryptocurrency replace fiat currency. Will cryptocurrency be the next world currency. Will the next world currency be Dogecoin?
Answer: 
People don‚Äôt realize the worldwide paradigm that is taking place right in front of our eyes. People are starting to see that traditional fiat (paper) currency back by centralized governments and debt are flawed and can be improved upon. Cryptocurrency is the future whether the people who can‚Äôt see it or try to disagree believe it or not. It‚Äôs inevitable. I knew it was inevitable in 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency will replace fiat currency in the future. Will it be Bitcoin? ETH? Dogecoin? Some other cryptocurrency that doesn‚Äôt exist yet? I don‚Äôt know. What I do know is that the only cryptocurrency that has inflationary tendencies that line up with traditional fiat currency very very well, allowing for an ease in the transition, a community dedicated to its success regardless of the cost, a mascot that allows for ease for spread of information to the masses thereby assisting with mass adoption is Dogecoin.

stocks,Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,"TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. (This post has a lot of sources but in order to push this through I've had to remove most of the link, you can pm me for sources if you'd like)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist. Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is covering using synthetic long shares or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I‚Äôm an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started withreading SEC Regulation SHO which deals with naked short selling. ‚ÄúFailures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from ‚Äúnaked‚Äù short selling**.‚Äù

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, ‚ÄúAbusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago‚Ä¶ Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**‚Ä¶ We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**.

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market ‚Äì it is undermining it.‚Äù** Mr Cox also ‚Äúreferred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales‚Äù as ‚Äú**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**""

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**.

I also read ‚Äò**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price‚Äô**‚Äù. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"".

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when RHood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at RHood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between RHoodand Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of RHoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to RHood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars. So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye‚Ä¶ DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, ‚ÄúDepository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.‚Äù

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal ‚Äú**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.‚Äù

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**.

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn‚Äôt it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn‚Äôt get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would‚Äôve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: ‚ÄúThe Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**‚Ä¶ Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply‚Ä¶ Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.‚Äù**

From everything I‚Äôve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122%
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs and using those to ‚Äúcover‚Äù their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may‚Äôve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the GameStop hearings coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment a Redditor brought up: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**",finance

**What is Dogecoin?** \- A crypto currency. (If you don't know that, you might want to look into other investments) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency)

**Should I buy/sell Dogecoin?** \- This strongly depends on why you are choosing to invest in cryptocurrencies. If you are looking for a quick buck, Dogecoin isn't for you my friend. You are better off with other short term investments. The truth behind the coin is that it is a long-term investment just like bitcoin was for the first few years it was available.

**Terms you need to familiarize yourself with before we begin -**

**Wallet** \- The place where your Dogecoin is stored. This can be a Physical Wallet (Hardware/Cold Wallet) or a Digital Wallet (online/Hot Wallet). More on that below.

**Address** \- Think of this as your Dogecoin bank account number.

**Receiving/Public Address** \- An encrypted key string that you use to get Dogecoin into your wallet.  (Explained more in step 3 and 4)

**Sending/Withdrawal Address** \- An encrypted key string that you use to send Dogecoin out of your wallet. (Explained more in step 3 and 4)

**Faucet** \- This is generally a website that says that they will pay you to play games, take surveys, click links, and or do other small tasks in order to earn cryptocurrencies. Most of these sites are not legit ways of earning Dogecoin because either they do not pay out or they pay out such small amounts (Fractions of a whole coin), that they just aren't worth the hassle. If you do choose to try and earn some side coin this way, I will have to say it is best to do your own research on whether or not the faucet is legit and actually pays out.

**Exchange** \- A place (Website) that allows the buy, sell, and trade of currencies or stocks.

**Transaction/Trading Fee** \- A percentage that you pay to complete most transactions with cryptocurrency. Some exchanges have no fees.

**TAX PURPOSES IN THE UNITED STATES** \- This isn't a term, but it something you should be made aware of lest you get in trouble with the IRS.

\[If Dogecoin is held as a capital asset, you must treat them as property for tax purposes. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply. Like stocks or bonds, any gain or loss from the sale or exchange of the asset is taxed as a capital gain or loss. Otherwise, the investor realizes ordinary gain or loss on an exchange.\] This means you need to keep track of all transactions involving your Dogecoin, down to the day, and the price at the time of the transaction. (Example: Bought 100 Dogecoin at $0.008 USD each on December 12th, 2020) Keep a ledger or something to keep track of this info for your taxes.

**Ok, I think I am ready to invest. What now?** \- Time to get to the fun part! Let's set up our wallet and get some Doge!

&amp;#x200B;

**STEP 1. (This is technically optional since most exchanges have a built-in wallet but having your own wallet is more secure)**

First we need to get a *Wallet*. This wallet can be a physical piece of hardware that you keep in the real world (Cold Wallet), or it can be a virtual wallet that you keep on the internet (Hot Wallet). In terms of security, a physical wallet is always best, never let anyone convince you otherwise. The downside to having a physical wallet is that you may pay more in transaction/trading fees because you have to move your Dogecoin around a bit in order to buy/sell. If you are looking to hold on for the long haul then this is what you want overall.

\#1 Rated Physical Wallet based on cost and support is the Nano Ledger (latest model) [https://shop.ledger.com/](https://shop.ledger.com/)

If you are going for a virtual wallet, which I personally never had an issue with, then you have many options. The downside to having a Virtual Wallet is people will try to trick you into giving them your *Private Address/Key* or if your PC gets compromised (virus or something) the hackers could potentially get your *Private Address/Key*, compromising your wallet.

These are the best online wallets I have found:

[Multidoge Wallet](https://multidoge.org/) \- MultiDoge is the most traditional Dogecoin wallet available on the market. This is an open source virtual wallet. With a simple but functional interface, MultiDoge wallet allows you to store your funds and send your DOGEs anywhere safely. Its desktop version is available on Windows, OS X, and Linux.

[Dogecoin Wallet](https://dogecoin.com/getting-started/) \- This Dogecoin Wallet is a good choice for users who intend to store Dogecoins on a smartphone or desktop. The downside to this wallet is that is is severely depreciated and the network takes forever to sync on the desktop version. You can speed this up by downloading the entire blockchain first. This will be worked on again since the developers are fixing the network with the recent hype. This is available on Windows, OS X, Linux, and Android.

[Dogechain](https://my.dogechain.info/#/overview) \- An online wallet made for the storage of Dogecoins. It has a light and functional interface that allows sending and receiving DOGEs in a simple way. For those who do not want to store Dogecoins on hardware, desktop, or smartphone, this wallet is the best option. As the data is stored on the cloud, you can access your funds anywhere in the world with only your password.

**\*But be careful!\*** Cloud wallets are more vulnerable to hacker attacks. Many cloud wallet services have been stolen in the past. Hackers can explore a security failure or a bug in the system to steal funds from hundreds of users.

[Exodus Wallet](https://www.exodus.com/) \- Exodus Wallet is a multi-crypto wallet that supports more than one hundred kinds of cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. It offers 24/7 support plus live graphs and real-time crypto prices. Exodus is a desktop wallet.

[Jaxx Liberty](https://jaxx.io/) \- This wallet became famous for being one of the first wallets to give support to more than one kind of crypto. Nowadays, it‚Äôs possible to store a hundred kinds of them on it. Jaxx is available on both desktop and mobile. You can have it on your Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, or iOS device. It also offers a Chrome Extension version.

[Atomic Wallet](https://atomicwallet.io/) \- A powerful multi-crypto wallet that supports DOGE and more than one hundred other cryptocurrencies. It‚Äôs useful for users who want to store more than one kind of crypto in the same place. Also, Atomic Wallet allows easy swaps between coins, although the conversion rates sometimes aren‚Äôt that good. This wallet is available on Windows, MacOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Android, and iOS.

**\*HONORABLE MENTION\***

Robinhood - This is not a wallet and therefor not on the list of wallets. Yes you can buy and sell Dogecoin on Robinhood, but since it is not an actual wallet, you are not supplied with any addresses to send and withdrawal from. Robinhood holds the majority of your coins in cold storage, entirely disconnected from the internet. This gives you an additional layer of protection. They also carry crime insurance that protects a portion of the assets held across our storage systems against losses from theft, including cybersecurity breaches. The policy is underwritten by certain underwriters at Lloyd‚Äôs, the world‚Äôs leading insurance marketplace, and placed by Lloyd‚Äôs registered broker, Aon.

Once you have set up your wallet, you should now have a *Receiving/Public Address* and a *Sending/Withdrawal Address* and you can now get started with your trades!

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 2.**

Now it is time to find an Exchange! There are several exchanges to choose from and you can even support multiple if that is what you desire.

**Here are some of the best known exchanges on the market right now:**

Binance - Binance is one of the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. The benefits of purchasing Dogecoin here is that you benefit from the lower exchange fees than competing exchanges, and the increased liquidity enables you to buy and sell quickly to take advantage of market moving news. Binance is currently the largest cryptocurrency market in terms of market cap. The platform has a large volume of DOGE, with DOGE/USDT, DOGE/BTC, and DOGE/ETH accounting for a substantial volume of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs total market cap. DOGE/BTC is the most popular pair on Binance.

CoinEx - CoinEx has the most substantial trading volume of Dogecoin amongst crypto exchanges. The platform is responsible for roughly 26% of the daily trading volume of Dogecoin. The DOGE/USDT, DOGE/BTC, and DOGE/BCH trading pairs account for 16.3%, 5.1%, and 4.9% of the total trading volume of Dogecoin. Due to its high liquidity of Dogecoin and an excellent trading platform, CoinEx is one of the best platforms to trade DOGE. The substantial trading volume means you can buy, trade, and withdraw your Dogecoin on this platform with ease.

Coinsbit - Coinsbit is another cryptocurrency platform that has a large trading volume of DOGE. It accounts for 17% of the total Dogecoin trading volume. The DOGE/USD, DOGE/BTC, and DOGE/ETH trading pairs make up the 17% of Coinsbit‚Äôs Dogecoin trading volume. The total Dogecoin trading volume on this platform is almost $3 million, making it quite substantial for those willing to buy and trade cryptocurrency. Coinsbit has other smaller trading pairs of Dogecoin including that of EUR. The availability of purchase with fiat currencies could be the appeal of Dogecoin on Coinsbit.

Coinbase - Coinbase is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and offers an extensive range of options and tools. The platform offers a stand alone wallet called Coinbase Wallet, but you don‚Äôt need to have this in order to store your currency directly on the exchange. Coinbase is suitable for both new and experienced traders. It only offers a handful of different cryptos, so you might seek a Coinbase alternative if you are looking for a specific and less popular coin.

P2PB2B - The third best platform to trade Dogecoin is P2PB2B. The cryptocurrency exchange has a large volume of DOGE, accounting for over 12% of the crypto‚Äôs total market volume. Similar to Coinsbit, P2PB2B allows users to purchase the cryptocurrency using fiat currencies as the DOGE/USD pair is ahead of the other trading pairs on the platform. With substantial liquidity and a vibrant trading platform, P2PB2B is an excellent cryptocurrency exchange to buy, trade, and sell Dogecoin.

Kraken - Kraken is one of the longstanding names when it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the industry. The trading costs are competitive with other exchanges and they have continued to evolve now offering both futures and margin trading.

Changelly - Changelly is one of the few places that will allow you to buy Dogecoin with almost any currency (fiat or crypto). Changelly is a conversion service that works relatively quick and doesn‚Äôt require anything more than an email to sign up. The downside is that it can take up a lot in fees (especially if you buy Doge with your credit card).

Bittrex - Bittrex is a US based cryptocurrency exchange that has grown in popularity in recent years. It offers a DOGE/BTC pair similar to Kraken. This means that you will need to either buy Bitcoin or deposit Bitcoin in order to exchange it for Doge.

**\*HONORABLE MENTION\***

This goes to Robinhood again! - While Robinhood is a great platform to buy and sell Dogecoin, it just does not have the support nor financial backing that most of these other platform have. If you ever have a problem on Robinhood make sure to set aside 3 weeks before you get help. Robinhood also is seen as distasteful in the eyes of the majority of the community because of the limitations they put on certain stocks during the GME short squeeze. I think Robinhood is a fantastic app but it is mainly for beginners who aren't as vested in the project.

**\*It should also be noted that several** ***Exchanges*** **allow you to buy other currencies and convert them into doge. Some of the aforementioned** ***Exchanges*** **do not allow the direct purchase of Dogecoin and solely rely on you trading one currency for actual Dogecoin.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 2 1/2.**

Most *Exchanges* have a built-in *Wallet* and you do not need to transfer your Dogecoin to another *Wallet* if you are comfortable with this. I definitely suggest using a more secure wallet as explained in Steps 1, 3, and 4.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 3. (Optional)**

Now that you have an exchange picked out you can start buying your Dogecoin! Once you have your Dogecoin, depending on the Exchange you chose, you need to find your *Exchange's Wallet*. From there you will need to initiate a Send/Withdrawal. Your exchange should have a *Sending/Withdrawal Address*. You will need to open your wallet of choice and find the *Receiving/Public Address* you would like to use. Go back to your *Exchange's Wallet* and put in the *Receiving/Public Address*. Finish your trade and you should now have your Doge safely tucked away, never to see the light of day, until we reach the moon.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 4. (Optional)**

There is no step 4, you should pretty much be able to send Dogecoin to your wallet once you have the process down. Taking your Dogecoin out of your wallet is just the opposite of putting it in. You will need to open your *Wallet*, start a send/withdrawal, open your *Exchange's Wallet* and find your *Receiving/Public Address*, then go back to your *Wallet* of choice and put in *Receiving/Public Address*. Complete trade and done!

**Miscellaneous Terms related to** [r/dogecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/) \-

**What are Diamond Hands and Paper Hands?** \- In short, Diamond hands are people referring to others who refuse to sell their Dogecoin even through the high volatility of the market (Diamond Willpower). You can already guess what the Paper Hands are at this point! You guessed it. It refers to the people who tear like paper when the stress of dips rears its ugly face and sell their Dogecoin in hopes of cutting loses before they become too great.

**Why the moon? What does it mean?** \- Because Elon Musk hasn't colonized Mars yet. It just means to drive up the price.

**What are Whales?** \- This is a term used to refer to people who have hoards of Dogecoin just laying around. They control the majority of the capital and when a Whale sells their Dogecoin, it impacts the market price heavily.

**What is Hodl?** \- Just another way to say ""Hold"". Someone is telling you to not give into the presser of a dip in price and hold onto your Dogecoin and do not sell.

I had about 4k in debt which is now down to $1400 after about 10 months of paying on it. The interest rate is really high at 24%. I'm also paying on student loans.

I have a relatively stable job that I'm not concerned about losing from a pandemic perspective (although obviously anything could happen).

I'm starting to worry that I may deplete my medical fund quickly (maybe even the moment I get my bill?)  and I'm questioning if I should flip back to minimum payment on my cc. It would feel sad to lose momentum on my debt pay-down but it's better to have a larger emergency fund, right?

 45% now, 1.8B investment w/ABILITY TO SPEND 1B MORE TO GET 10%.  They had 4-yr window to close...tick-tock.  Altria already planted board members...and will close deal likely after the announcement by Chuckster.  [He signaled it here n Feb 1](https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/-booker-wyden-schumer-joint-statement-on-cannabis-reform-legislation).  

Zero doubt at all....Altria and the PM (PhilipMorris) lobbying machine are hard at work.  [Confirmed here in this CEO interview from Jan 22, 2021](https://ir.thecronosgroup.com/events/event-details/cronos-group-24th-annual-cibc-western-institutional-investor-conference)

 ""Cronos Group has no U.S. operations, and cannabis remains illegal at the federal level."" - it claims in the press release.  Altria/Cronos Group are planning as one unit, but giving the appearance of 'nothing to see here' while they know it's a sweetheart deal

Altria distancing themselves, but w/1.8B already invested, board members seated, Marlboro lawyers fighting in Washington.....and guess who has all the distribution across the USA?  PM/Marlboro Guys.  In every convenience store.  Those reps have all the areas covered, distribution in place...I bet all of that is being planned while the lawyers help Chuckie and his pals craft a bill.  And those remaining Republicans that are too old-school to want it legal?  Bankrupt governments everywhere to consider.  Businesses paying taxes??  Balanced budgets were a thing of the past - they need $$$.  Excise tax on weed.  The public pressure after SchumSchum bill announcement will sway them.  And they'll paint a rosy picture.  Pros, them cigarette guys.    

Drafted, passed, &amp; then signed by Biden. All Dem controlled (they do need a couple Republicans still!)  Altria spends the remaining $1B - Plug and play, now it's weed and they are going to DOMINATE. 

And if your brand is popular locally...they go buy out the owner, make them rich and streamline ops and now it's them and not the OG.  Consumer is none the wiser, now that's Kools, or is it Winston?  They've been buying up the brands everywhere,  they have the distribution, THEY KNOW HOW TO MARKET ADDICTION......all they need is the law changed - then with $1B more investment - Altria-controlled money-maker JUGGERNAUT.

My bet is on the experienced and the money.  Gotham is back.  [Altria's website says ""MOVING BEYOND SMOKING"" - they know](https://www.altria.com/)

Also consider the [exclusive partnership w/Ginkgo Bioworks, a private and leading 'Biology by design' company](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/) - that will streamline extractions like CBD and others, they are working on advanced means to scale production. In the interview above, CEO of Cronos talks about Gingko and what it means.

personalfinance,Trying to get a hold of my finances. Looking for advice on what I can do better.,"Hi all,

So I'm 30, having graduated college in 2016. I have about $54,000 in student loan debt that my parents are graciously paying off. However I am looking into refinancing through Sofi and paying an extra amount to get rid of my loan debt within 5 years.

I earn about $64,440 before tax from my job. I am hourly so I do have opportunities to work overtime.

I have just opened a Vanguard Account and for the first time moved my money from their Money Market Fund into investing into the Retirement for 2055 fund. I was told by friends that they have better interest rates. The amount there currently is around $19,000 and I just began maxing out what I put.

I was late to 401K game. My first job I didn't partake in my company's 401K match because I stupidly figured out that if I'm leaving I might as well not do it. I am currently enlisted into my Oakland, CA company's 401K plan and have around $10,000 in their OneAmerica account.

I have an online savings account through Ally after reading through threads here. It's been working well and I have around $22,000 in my savings account. Every month I put somewhere between $500 to $800 in that account from my paycheck.

I keep my Bank of America Checking account which my mom opened up for me when I was younger at a minimum of $2,000. I also have the Chase Sapphire Reserve and Chase Freedom Credit Card which have manageable credit card debt, around $400.

My wife and I have 1 shared account through Capitol One. I forget if its Savings or Checkings but it holds all of our Wedding Gift money and extra change to about $8,000. This is our Travel fund and in some cases an emergency fund.

I don't have any auto payments and only rent. Rent may be higher since my wife and I might move back to the Bay Area but we do not have any other payments. I don't think we will be getting a new car, hoping for EV's to get cheaper. We might get a dog but I don't know how much they are to maintain.

So my main concern is that I feel like I'm late and I can be doing more. I feel like I'm late because I graduated college when I was 26. My friends all graduated on time in 2012, when we were 22. They all have been pretty good with money management and even with investing and stocks. I don't know if I'm in a good place regarding my age or if I'm in a bad place and what more I can do to make my money grow. I was looking at the Ally High CD account and thought that I can put a chunk of money there for a year and get a few extra bucks that way.",finance
personalfinance,Lump sum from Roth 401k clarification,"I am in the process of switching jobs and was informed by my current employer that I have the option of taking a lump sum out of my Roth IRA.
I want to preface that, I am not super crazy about having an IRA (i'm 24), and my preference is to save money for investment in a home first. I initially signed up for the 401k because my employer matches 6% of my income, and I read that the penalty for early withdrawal is only 10%, so if I ever needed the cash (such as for a downpayment) I would still net more than just having the money upfront on my paycheck without the match. 
Then I came to find that my account only allows up to 50% withdrawal of my assets, so it kind of blew my plan. 
Now that I have the option of lump-sum, I'm wondering if I should take it. I am planning to buy a home this summer since interest rates are so low, but would only have about 5% for the downpayment. If I'm able to take out a lump sum for close to the full amount, that could give me the push I need to make 20% down and avoid paying PMI for years, not to mention less interest. 
The main questions I have are: what taxes/penalties should I expect from receiving a lump sum on employment termination? On some sources I'm reading 20% withholding + 10% penalty, but it's not clear if that's on a non-Roth and/or with hardship. My understanding is that since Roth contributions are already taxed, there will be no 20% withholding, and since it is not for hardship, there is no 10% penalty, correct?
Does anybody also know about whether the CARES act distribution exceptions are still in effect, and if it sounds like I could be elgible?

Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Advice for a first time home buyer in a hot market,"So I am 24 y/o and my partner and I are looking to buy our first home and move my parents and little sister in. We are in Phoenix and the housing market is one of the hottest in the country right now. The inventory is low and the prices are climbing. We don‚Äôt have a huge budget and every home we come across is flooded with bids within days, or even hours. Most homes are selling for 10-25k over the asking price. 

I‚Äôm having a lot of anxiety trying to find a house that my partner and my parents love, that‚Äôs big enough for 5 people, all for ~$275k. My family has never owned a home before and this is very intimidating to me. The stress makes me feel like I might not be making the right decision and I shouldn‚Äôt buy at all. But home prices are going to keep skyrocketing and the interest rates are at an all time low. Continuing to rent doesn‚Äôt sound like a good option either, especially since rental prices are also quickly rising and if we hold off it‚Äôll only get harder to find a place in our budget. I just want to make sure my family is safe and housed and I don‚Äôt know what to do if we get priced out of the only place I‚Äôve ever lived. 

Any advice on how to feel confident I‚Äôm making prudent choices would be really appreciated. In a market where I obviously need to make compromises, what should the priorities be? Should I try to increase my budget to get a nicer place and know my family will be happy because all the homes are expensive anyway? Should I try and stay low and get myself a fixer upper to invest in over time? Should I be picky about location or buy in a rougher neighborhood to stretch my dollar? Do I just bid on everything and see what sticks because of how scarce the supply is?

I hate making financial decisions! This feels like one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done. How do  I deal with the pressure of partner and I‚Äôs hopes for the future, my aging parents‚Äô security, and comfort and stability for my adopted little sisters‚Äô high school years?",finance

personalfinance,Third Federal HELOCs - what's the catch? Seems too good to be true.,"I've been shopping around for a new HELOC lender to refinance an existing home equity line that was taken out pre-COVID with a high rate floor, and I came across Third Federal that's offering prime - 1.01% (full term, no teaser rates), no closing costs or origination charges of any kind, no prepayment penalties... at today's rates, this is 2.24% (!!), even lower than my first mortgage at 2.75%. This is hard to believe for a second lien on a property.

What's the catch? If this is legit, they're far and beyond the best HELOC lender in the nation in terms of rates. Are they just being ultracompetitive, or is there something that I'm missing here? The only difference I've seen compared to my existing line is that there's no interest-only period (the balance is amortized right from the start, so you're paying principal payments immediately), but other than that it looks just like any other HELOC.

In this interview, he  explains why, discusses the futility of Federal Reserve policy,  criticizes the state of American capitalism, and shares his thoughts on  gold, Bitcoin, emerging markets and climate change""

He  mentions Emerging Markets as a good place to decant some wealth, but he doesn't specify any names.

personalfinance,Help Understanding my Car Loan,"I have an auto loan with my local credit union and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what the hell is going on with my principal and interest payments. Shame on me for being in this boat but I don‚Äôt want to make any mistakes in the future so I‚Äôm trying to learn now. The balance on the loan is $13,318.66. Way below are some additional details. For a while I was paying the monthly payment of $342.82. I could afford more so lately I‚Äôve been paying $400 a month. Here‚Äôs an example. In April of 2020, I paid the monthly payment. I like to pay it in 2 installments per month. 

Payment 1
Principal Amt: $175.24, Finance Charge: $24.76

Payment 2
Principal Amt: $175.50, Finance Charge: $24.50

Total interest of $49.26 for that month. 

Now let‚Äôs take January of 2021. An example of where I‚Äôve upped my payment to $400 a month. 

Payment 1
Principal Amt: $173.61, Finance Charge: $26.39

Payment 2
Principal Amt: $173.95, Finance Charge: $26.05

Total interest of $52.44. 

Am I paying more interest because this is a pre computed loan? If so am I correct in the only positive of paying more would be paying the loan off early and not saving on any interest at all?

personalfinance,Rate my budget and help me plan?,"Long-time lurker on this sub and recently have made some big changes in my life to try and get back on track financially. Was hoping that y'all could help me identify any potential holes in my budget, or if you think that I've got a decent plan ahead of me.

For some background, I'm a 31 year-old male in a very HCOL area (northeast US). I live with my wife and our dog. Annual salary of $120k paid bi-weekly with a $10k bonus, subject to fluctuation as I've been over-achieving at this new job and am going to try making a case for at least $130k with 10% bonus based on performance when it's time. My wife doesn't work. I know it's not a choice for everyone, but we've had several discussions about it and are happy with this decision. I have my office job and she handles the house work. A bit traditional and old-school, but it works for us.

Budget amounts are below and on a monthly basis. I won't become eligible for the 401k until next month so there's a little bit of guess-work as far as exactly how much will be taken in taxes, but I'm assuming a 22% rate. I usually wind up with a refund.

**Income - $6,789**

* Gross - $10,000
* 401k - $600 (6% plus 4% ER match will get me 10% / month)
* Insurance - $678
* Taxes: $1,933

**Expenses - $4,133**

* Rent - $2,055
* Groceries - $475
* Utilities - $250
* Fun spending - $250
* Car payment - $210
* Doctor - $200
* Gas - $150
* Health &amp; fitness - $140
* Insurance - $105 (renters + auto; 2 cars)
* Dog - $100 (sinking fund for possible vet appts)
* Phones - $55
* Subscriptions - $53 (streaming, Costco, a few others)
* Clothing - $50
* Internet - $40

**Monthly net savings - $2,656**

My dilemma here, and one of the primary reasons that I'm posting, is that I struggle to decide on what to do with the excess cash. I still owe around $43k in student loans at a weighted average interest rate of 4.45% (highest is 5.96%, lowest is 3.15%, all federal), and I only have \~$40k saved up for retirement right now in my previous employer's 401k (looking to roll that once eligible for new employer plan). Got a bit of a late start to the whole ""having a real job"" thing. I hate the thought of being in debt and am very eager to get these loans paid off, but realize that average market returns will likely exceed 4.45% in the long-term. Given that, the most efficient use of funds seems to be to make minimum payments on student loans (once COVID forbearance is over), probably ramp up my 401k contribution a bit, and start maxing an IRA.

Will it make that much of a difference if I just pay down these student loans as fast as possible and then do what I can to catch up on retirement? I know part of this decision comes down to personal preference, and debt is not something that sits well with me. But I also don't want to risk setting myself further behind for retirement. I would like to retire in my early 50s, if possible.

Bit of a long read, but I appreciate any advice y'all are able to provide. I know my situation is better than a lot of people so I don't mean to imply that I'm in some kind of trouble. I just come from a family where we had to scrape by to get anything we wanted, and sometimes I have a difficult time making decisions with my money. I feel like a bit of a dragon in that I just want to hoard as much of it as I possibly can.

Edit: We only have around $6,000 saved up in our emergency fund. I'll be taking the next few months to build that back up to 3 months of expenses before I do anything else.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Dollar liquidity and cryptocurrency.,"So, I am firmly of the mind we are in a liquidity trap, plenty of supporting data (see Steven Van Meter [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFTWzNEZ7Zg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFTWzNEZ7Zg)). My question is, how is crypto going to do in the event of a sharp spike of deflation. As the dollar rises we'll of course lose relative value for a time, but a strong dollar messes up too many other things so the fed will intervene. It could also  accelerate cypto adoption in the west. Does anyone have any plans in the event we get a repeat of last March? Where are your stops?

personalfinance,Which payment method is best?,"Recently refinanced a $112k private loan so it now has 3.92% interest (15 year plan, $825 per month payment). I also have $12k in federal loans I did not refinance. Currently live at home (and likely will for one more year), making $60k gross annually (will increase to $64k later this year) and $22k in savings. 

Feel like I don‚Äôt need $22k in my savings with the US dollar being debased. With such a low interest rate on my loan, should I put some of my savings into student loans, or invest in the market? Or just hold onto my savings since I need an emergency fund? Since I can easily beat 3.92% by putting money in index funds. What option is best?

personalfinance,Looking for advice about dealing with loans after school,"As graduation approaches so does the reality of my debt situation. So I'll be finishing school with about 110k in student loans. 80ish K non federal loans with a 7.6% interest rate. I also have a new car that puts me an additional 30k in the hole (terrible financial decision yes but it's my dream car that I have no problem paying for). 

Luckily I landed a decent job paying 96k salary plus bonus starting in September. I also have about 20k saved up and plan to refinance asap after school or around when I start working to get those interest rates down. I'm looking to get some advice on how to tackle the situation.

Some initial thoughts I had were to use most of my savings a little bit after starting work to pay off my car quickly before I have to start making student loan payments. I'm not sure whether I should make minimum payments and save money, then maybe every 6months pay a large chunk of the loans or just make larger payments. Is there a point where I should start putting my money into investing to earn more than what I need to pay for loans? 

Yes I plan to heavily budget my lifestyle to work off these loans. I would like to pay off these loans or make them not a burden sooner than later so that I can begin to work on investing and broadening my income flows. 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks folks!",finance

If you're anything like me you have a family and responsibility and make enough to live comfortable. A little above check to check but not struggling.....

Either decide to hold and delete the app

Or sell at a profit and wait for the dip and buy again. WAIT even if it is a week to buy at under 6.5 or 5 a 1cent increase at 300 dollars is like 30 bucks! Which the next time you buy at the dip is going to increase everytime! Because you are adding to you investment. (Guesstimate)

 Yes there is a tax on gains everytime you make a sell for profit. Yes it does add up especially if you trade frequently. But will it break you? Most likely not because if your profit is 30 bucks the most you would pay is your federal income tax rate..and I am guessing if your stressing your 300 dollars like me then your not in the higher tax brackets lol. 

I guess the point is stop freaking out by investing money you CANT lose. 

Stop letting the people who went in at 0.002 make you feel the pressure. Just have fun with it and if nothing else you make 50 bucks and walk away. That's an easy dinner day for the family and now you've learned a bit from the chaos of crypto so when your money is right you can take what you learned and apply it for the future!

I double checked paystubs from this year and last year, and they're maybe a few dollars different on similar sized checks.

My question is, did something go wrong behind the scenes or is that normal?

personalfinance,"22, recently graduated. Need review, advice, and suggestions for short them financial plan.","To give context to the situation, I graduated Summer 2020 (guess it's not so recent) as an international student. Currently on OPT with about 5 months left. I have the option for STEM OPT extension but right now there's no guarantee I can get it so right now I'm assuming I won't.
  
My financial situation:
  
* I work 40 hrs/wk @ 23/hr, and they're pretty generous when it comes to allowing overtime. I get paid weekly and bring in around $750 a week after tax.
  
* Rent and utilities: $700 for rent all inclusive (water, gas, electricity, internet included). Living with a family and they're too damn kind.
  
* Student loan: ~$14k from a private loan, interest rate at 12.99%, and I think I still qualify for another .5% discount.
  
* Groceries and food: between $200 to $300 per month
  
* Other expenses: $87 for a storage place I rent, about $90 every 3 months for mobile plan, and about a over $60 in different subscriptions (patreon, discord, amazon prime, youtube memberships, etc.).
  
* No car so no expenses here.
  
* $4.4k in savings.
  
Basic budget I have in mind right now is just taking my weekly paycheck and allocate it to the different expenses. So first week for rent, 2nd week for groceries, recreational funds, and other misc, 3rd week for the loan, and 4th for savings. Given my (possibly) limited time here in the US I'm feeling a bit lost. I've started some research about getting a car. Right now I'm able to walk to my work but that takes 30-45 mins, and a car would cut it down to less than 10 (it's about 1.5 miles away). But I'm not sure I can make car payments without sacrificing loan payments, and that's currently my top priority. What do you guys think? I'm doing everything I can right now to ensure I can get that OPT extension and possibly stay in the US even longer than what OPT allows. But until I know what's going to happen in July I'm holding off any long term planning. I've looked at other budgeting and planning posts, and right now the only thing that I can't do is starting to save for retirement, I think.
  
Right now my short term plan is to focus paying down my loan payments as much as possible, maybe cutting into the amount of money I save every month. Do you think there are a few things that I've overlooked?

Bitcoin,BTC borrowing math question...straining my brain here,"This is straining my IQ; can you help with a bit of math? Related to these bitcoin-collateralized loans and a good strategy for me in a lucky year.

I have been putting my monthly home taxes and insurance savings in BTC (at a rate where if I was just saving cash I would have enough after the 12 months...I save it myself because my mortgage is paid off) and obviously have done quite well this year.

Last year I sold from this account for what I paid for the coin as the price had not changed much from my average buy price --- **however, this year as you might guess, has been a bit different!**

I obviously have quite a multiple of what I put into it, and now I am hearing about bitcoin-collateral loans. About how ""the rich borrow money against assets instead of selling it"" to not owe capital gains -- and moreover take a deduction from interest paid.

That said, I read the terms from, for example, [unchained-capital.com](https://unchained-capital.com) (as it seems one of the only that does not risk your coins lending them, despite the higher interest rate...ok by me) it seems to me I would need to do the following:

On a 10,000 loan --

Pay out \~$91 dollars per month in interest payments. I would pay out of my own monthly income.

Balloon payment of the $10,000 after lets say 12 months.

And now -- this is what I don't get...I don't want to pay capital gains. So I would just hold back the $10k/12 = $833 per month **in cash (?)** and pay them the cash when the loan is due, hold onto the original bitcoin...

...**but NOT buy more bitcoin with that monthly $833 (?)** as I have been doing? Because at that point I would need the cash to pay them, but selling Bitcoin to pay the balloon would incur the tax event I was looking to avoid in the first place.

I'd hate to miss more sweet gains not buying -- but I wish to understand the strategy here, and this quickly gets out of hand for me. Any tips or math to offer here? A good plan?

CryptoCurrency,Mark Cuban is right - Ethereum is a better store of value and it has no real competition anymore,"**Why Ethereum is a better store of value and has no serious competition (not advice - just observation)**

**(consolidated/paraphrased from various amazing contributors)**

* Ethereum does much more than Bitcoin (not trashing papa Bitcoin, but Ethereum does more. Much Much more). The lack of innovation in Bitcoin may not be bad. Being more conservative, less innovative, has perks. There's plenty of discussion on this theme I'll mention below.
* Ethereum's network effects as the dominant smart contract platform are overwhelming. All the things that make smart-blockchains cool are being done on Ethereum. There's no serious competition anymore; the evidence overwhelming:
   * Ethereum's momentum as the primary platform where crypto-assets are issued has grown over the last three years, with the share of the total token market cap constituted by Ethereum based tokens rising from 73.81% in July 2017, to 98.40% in July 2020 [(source)](https://medium.com/@amincad/ethereum-achieves-absolute-dominance-of-token-market-f7ef9c26ede). The entire market has steadily converged on Ethereum as the settlement layer for crypto-assets and Ethereum's ERC20 token interface as its technology standard for digital assets.
   * Ethereum is the most utilized crypto platform in the world, with more fees being paid to Ethereum miners than any other project's. The dominance extends beyond just Ethereum, to Ethereum-based dApps, with seven of the next nine largest revenue earning crypto projects in the world being based on Ethereum, as this charts shows with all the projects highlighted in pink being Ethereum-based: [https://cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)
   * All major DeFi applications operate on Ethereum. [Tracked by DefiPulse](https://defipulse.com/). These DeFi apps are all interacting to create an increasingly sophisticated open financial system on Ethereum that gives the platform an increasingly insurmountable advantage over potential competitors.
   * All of the major stablecoins; Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), True USD (TUSD), Binance USD (BUSD), and Paxos Standard (PAX), use the ERC20 standard.
* Beyond market adoption, the Ethereum development community is by far the largest in the cryptocurrency space, and its advantage over all other smart contract platforms has rapidly grown over the last three years:
   * Ethereum has an overwhelming lead over all other cryptocurrency and blockchain projects in the number of developers working on it according to the recently released [Electric Capital Developer Report (2020)](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444). This lead is accelerating, with a 215% increase in the number of developers working on Ethereum since 2017, and with the number of monthly developers increasing by 300+ between Q3 2019 and Q3 2020, which bucked the downward trend seen in the rest of the cryptocurrency market. [(source)](https://i.imgur.com/Hfo9rTP.jpg)
   * The overwhelming majority of Research and Development on blockchain scalability is being done on Ethereum-based projects [(source)](https://github.com/Awesome-Layer-2/awesome-layer-2). Groundbreaking scalability solutions that have recently launched on Ethereum Mainnet include Loopring and zkSync, which use zkRollUp technology to enable thousands of transactions per second to be processed on Ethereum layer 1: [(source)](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum-770d35213408) The misinformation you'll hear too much
   * Ethereum's [developer tool list](https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethereum-developer-tools-list) outshines everything out there. Getting smart contract to work properly is complex, and there is no magic port that will can do that realistically (no matter what others might shill). These are years of tools from thousands of developers. Having smart contract functionality means little compared to the tool list needed to use it effectively.
   * Every other project still needs years to have all these tools, for what? A blockchain that has some trivial perk (assuming it's a perk). By the time they have these tools (years away) ETH 2.0 and a whole new paradigm of functionally will be in place. [Again, there are thousands and thousand of ethereum developers, no other project comes close.](https://i.imgur.com/Hfo9rTP.jpg)
   * Note, there's some that think moving tokens (ERC20) from one blockchain to another is a big deal. It's not. There are no simple converters for the broader blockchain functionality. This is not a push button process. An ERC20 token is not the real world application being converted, it's just a simple token. Nothing special.
* ETH 2.0 model outshines all in the areas of decentralization. There's a lot of discussion about types of ""Proof-of-Stake"" (a validation method of the blockchain ledger). ETH 2.0 allows individuals to stake (validate) the ledger. Projects that claim to be cheaper/faster use delegators (cartels), often calling their method ""Delegated"" or ""Dynamic"" Proof-of-Stake (or other names), which essentially forces control of the chain in to groups, so for example, exchanges could assume control. ETH 2.0 stakers can opt in to join pools, but pools are not required. Got 32 ETH? You can stake as a individual.

**Ethereum's supply (a common new-person question about ethereum)**

* ETH is not capped, but restricted, capped is unlikely to be secure. Ethereum's monetary policy is best described as ""minimum issuance to secure the network""
* ETH issuance and burn is more sophisticated than Bitcoin. Under EIP-1559, some ETH get's burned (removed), which is projected to be greater than issuance (created). Everything is about creating a stable network, rather than and arbitrary cap. Bitcoin IS inflationary, and will be until we're all dead. Ethereum has a true deflationary mechanism
* What I see - anyone saying that ETH isn't scarce or anyone saying a ""hard cap"" is healthy for blockchains:
   * doesn't understand math and securing blockchain systems
   * is purposely deceitful
   * trying to pitch their corpo-coin
* What about ""eth-killer"" (enter whatever) doing such and such?
   * The graveyard of ""eth-killers"" is VAST:  ICX. QTUM. VET. ZIL. EOS. ONT. XTZ. IOTA. NEO. STRAT. AION, Rootstock, ETC (to name a few). We have a new wave of them now. My advice. Stop pretending you can ""kill"" ethereum and starting thinking how you can contribute to the world ethereum is creating.
   * But the gas-fees are too high... Yes, they are. Because the chain is being used. But L2 (above chain) solutions are already out ([an example](https://blog.synthetix.io/l2-mainnet-launch/)) for developers to start using. Plus other updates coming in a few months, such as  EIP-1559 and the GETH client this summer (which makes a lot of upgrades). FUDing gas costs now though is justified, but don't think untested/unused projects have any edge, especially with upgrades on a functioning chain (ethereum) are here, with more coming.

**More opinion, not advice**

* The order of importance is Ethereum, Bitcoin than any of the players trying to innovate the space, which are overwhelmingly building on Ethereum.
* I no longer see any other independent blockchain as relevant compared to Ethereum. I did a few years ago, but many of those projects failed their vision, some disappointed greatly
* Ethereum 2.0 will easily cover my prior concerns. So to me, it's done - if blockchains have a future, it's Ethereum's future. (mostly)
* I do see plenty of interesting defi projects (on Ethereum, of course). They are all MUCH higher risk than Ethereum. itself.
* I have a minority opinion, it seems Bitcoin is irrelevant compared to Ethereum. It's more just name recognition.
   * Ethereum already does more than Bitcoin, including more transactions, but that's not the reason I see Bitcoin as irrelevant
   * The major valid argument supporting Bitcoin (compared to ETH) is that it is a simple blockchain. It remains a powerful upgrade to gold, a better store of value. Ethereum, while more capable, involves innovations, which adds potential risks. AND ETH 2.0 is not fully here yet
   * I do, somewhat, agree with the above argument, in the short term, but if ETH 2.0 works (and it seems it will) and it fully becomes a computer-ledger for the world (a bigger ""what if"" for all crypto), then ETH becomes a more fundamental resource to society than Bitcoin. ETH, then, is a better store of value. Bitcoin is irrelevant.
* Working together - I see it. Other chains (yes, which ever one you're holding bags for) may still be around in a couple of years. Maybe, they'll even be relevant. If they are, I suspect it's because they've begun to work with Ethereum rather than pretending they're some ""killer"". To Kill Ethereum, you need to do something absolutely unexpected, like turning a phone into a camera. Turning gold digital. Turning digital gold into an app store (Ethereum). What's next? Something HUGE, I suspect some day, but NOTHING I see now in this space is anything other than just a shadow/subordinate of Ethereum (in my opinion).",cryptocurrency
stocks,Quarterly Tax Payments on Gains - When Are They Required?,"Hello! This is probably best for tax representatives, however this subreddit is FULL of people whom this applies to, so surely there will be good advice here as well. I started more trading actively Sept 22, sold portions of a long term holding on Sept 30, about $500. The remaining short term gains were all Oct/Nov/Dec (so quarter 4). I played small at first, only making about $150 in short term gains NET, over those three months. My bigger plays have been in 2021, but those quarterly estimates aren't due for some time.  
Speaking DIRECTLY about the gains on Sept 30 (long term) and the short term gains from Oct-Dec (only $145-150) how am I supposed to do this. Will there be any penalty for the late filing (both short and/or long), given the relatively LOW amounts (and maybe given the Covid relief stuff?  
At play would be the feds/IRS of course, and the state of residency/work is NY.

Advice is appreciated! Thank you!

EDIT: If it‚Äôs not clear, I know the amounts, I know where to find them.

personalfinance,Bonds vs. Inflation?,"Hi, this is my first day researching bonds since my main field is Cryptocurrency.

After looking into bonds further, I understand that there are treasury bonds (I-Bond nd EE Bonds) and Corporate bonds. Also, the longer than bond mature time, the greater the annual interest.  Treasury bonds essentially have no risk whereas corporate bonds risks are due to defaulting.

But ultimately, all comparisons I made of bonds show that everything is moot.

I've concluded that bonds are the stupidest and most useless type of investing possible.

You've essentially bought a 30+ year treasury bond that STILL CAN'T KEEP UP WITH INFLATION. US Treasury bond interest rate is 2% at 30 years. OMFG. You're getting NOTHING for locking up your money! It can't even keep up with the 3% inflation!!

And then if you're playing corporate bonds, now you have risk- so you might as well then play mutual funds.

What is your take on bonds? I see no security in bonds whatsoever. If you fear a bear stock market, just convert your money into fiat (take the inflation hit), and then buy back after the crash.",finance
personalfinance,"So I'm might be 90k in student loans after I graduate, can I pay it off in two years?","So I'm graduating from grad school after this semester and starting to work for an accounting firm in the fall. Looking at my student loans, I'll be graduating with 90k in federal student loans(62 from me, 27 from parent plus loan).

The plan was that I live for my parents, so housing and groceries, while I pay off my loans, my starting salary without bonuses is around 60k, after-tax 46k. My goal is to get it down to pay it off within two years, or at the very least get it down between 20k-to-30k so that I can move out of my parent's house without too much financial debt. My payments don't start until Dec 2022 and the Parent Plus loans aren't till May 2022, so I do have time to start paying off the principal early before mandatory payments and interest starts accruing.

Wondering if you guys have thought if my goal is realistic or have any tips?

EDIT:

My grad(16k) plus loan is at 3.76%, while my undergrad loans(46k) are between 4.3% to 5%, parent plus loan I believed is 6.31%.

phone bill is $70 a month

Healthcare with dental and vision in my industry averages around 130 per month(quick google, probably wrong)

Car Insurance just got my license this year at 21(slow I know ToT), and my dad is paying for my insurance until I start my job, and by the time we hit the year thresmark we hope that will lower my would be car insurance monthly payment. So Im gonna assume $200.

Streaming and Spotify $22

Gym $20

Parents and I agreed that if I paid the Parent Plus Loan, that would be my form of rent as technically students of the parents don't have the legal responsibility to pay the Parent Plus Loan if the student refuses to. Liability falls under the parents. My parents have the ability pay for the parent plus loan, but they (more my mom) kinda want me to live with them as long as possible(like forever) soooo......

Ideally, I am in a pretty good situation, at least getting it down to 40000 in two years is plausible, my goal is to move out by the age of 25 so in three years.

personalfinance,Desperate for advice on mortgage,"My boyfriend and I live in a house owned by his parents and pay $1,300 in rent, which is the cost of the monthly mortgage payments.  The house is owned by my boyfriends parents because way back in 05 he got married and they had to have this house, but their credit was bad so his parents bought it for my bf and his ex and kept it in their name. Once the house is paid off, they will put it in his name (this is in their will).


They bought the house in 2005 for 110k, owe 80k STILL.     They obviously bought the house during peak interest rates but never refinanced.   Parents will not refinance because their excuses have been: they had credit lien against their own house, they took a loan for my boyfriends car, they sold their house and had to buy a new house in Florida.  All of that has been taken care of and they still refuse to finance.


We've been wanting to purchase the house from them, but my boyfriend has been in between good jobs the past 5 years, but none of them have been long enough to apply for a loan.  We have 3 kids, so I worked part time (6 year job) and only make 25k. My credit is 660, only because my amount of credit isn't high enough (I get declined for more credit because of this) and my time of credit is only 3.5 years, aside from that and 60k in student debt (offset due to finances) I'm good.  Because of COVID,  we've both lost our jobs and been unemployed almost a year.


He opened a restaurant with his brother in December that is doing well.  But my boyfriend just got served with a 20k bill for back taxes which is now in the court system.  Paired with past credit card bills from previous divorce, he's filing bankruptcy.


We should only be paying $800/month and pay $1300, which is killing us.  His parents consider the house his even though its in their name. Either one of us wants to buy the house to get the lower rates and tax credits. What are our options?  I'm completely clueless and desperate at this point.


Any and all help is appreciated.  I've said we should go to an apartment for a while and he refuses. Also the house is 100 years old and needs everything updated.   It doesn't even have insulation, which we could afford if we could refinance at these amazing rates.",finance

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:

&gt;‚ÄúImagine you‚Äôre the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  
&gt;  
&gt;Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...¬†¬†you‚Äôre going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter‚Äù

Seriously, this is cool, and it‚Äôs only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what‚Äôs going to help them into a powerhouse is this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Over the coming months, we‚Äôll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It‚Äôll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we‚Äôll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won‚Äôt just be your frontend, it‚Äôll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare‚Äôs network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they‚Äôll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you‚Äôre not a developer, you probably didn‚Äôt understand most of that, but essentially, they‚Äôre making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it‚Äôs profitability... üöÄüöÄüöÄ

(And even if it doesn‚Äôt, and stays at 50%, it will still üöÄ but slower. Regardless, it‚Äôs going up)

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren‚Äôt long. Plus it‚Äôs hardly a tank when it‚Äôs at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven‚Äôt read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock‚Äôs immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

&gt;Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

&amp;#x200B;

Revenue right now is $125 million **per quarter**  or $431 million for 2020. Doesn‚Äôt sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that‚Äôs $1 billion a a quarter or 4 million a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion/quarter or 12 billion a year

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn‚Äôt the impressive part. The margins are

&gt;GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they‚Äôre going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn‚Äôt profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they‚Äôve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn‚Äôt stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here‚Äôs why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‚Äò22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare‚Äôs network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äî-

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I‚Äôm a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there‚Äôs no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don‚Äôt matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild a Better Internet‚Äù shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare‚Äôs already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren‚Äôt in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I‚Äôm trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I‚Äôve been playing NET since 37. It‚Äôs a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn‚Äôt done its 30% move. I‚Äôm completely assured that it will soon

*****
&gt; The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.
*****
&gt; Walmart‚Äôs earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government‚Äôs retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank‚Äôs view on inflation.

&gt; # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects
&gt; Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It‚Äôs going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.
*****
&gt; Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThere is less pushback to President Biden‚Äôs proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,‚Äù noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.
*****
&gt; They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.
*****
&gt; Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.
*****
&gt; It has also increased concerns about inflation.
*****
&gt; # Inflation and rising yields
In the past week, the 10-year yield ‚Äî a key benchmark ‚Äî touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.
*****
&gt; Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf you think about the big drivers, they‚Äôre related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,‚Äù said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.
*****
&gt; At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.
*****
&gt; Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúBecause there‚Äôs such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we‚Äôll see if that has eased,‚Äù she said.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúObviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,‚Äù said Krosby.
*****
&gt; Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.
*****
&gt; # Housing statistics
Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.
*****
&gt; The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.
*****
&gt; Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes
Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.
*****
&gt; There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.
*****
&gt; Robinhood‚Äôs CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.
*****
&gt; The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market‚Äôs advance is intact.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúOverall, it‚Äôs a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,‚Äù Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there‚Äôs cyclical leadership.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,‚Äù said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.
*****
&gt; The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.

&gt; # Presidents' Day Seasonality

&gt; The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&amp;P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&amp;P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**

&gt; In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&amp;P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&amp;P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&amp;P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&amp;P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.

&gt; # Trading After Presidents‚Äô Day Weekend Continues to be Weak

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**

&gt; In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents‚Äô Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents‚Äô Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of ‚Äì0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of ‚Äì0.49% and a median loss of ‚Äì0.11%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents‚Äô Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of ‚Äì0.07% and a median decline of ‚Äì0.10%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 31, average ‚Äì0.02%, median ‚Äì0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average ‚Äì0.01%, median ‚Äì0.09%.

&gt; # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox

&gt; ‚ÄúBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.‚Äù Old Wall Street saying.

&gt; The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs‚Äîit is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!

&gt; Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn‚Äôt you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; ‚ÄúThe year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,‚Äù explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here‚Äôs hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!

&gt; # Short Interest Update

&gt; Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.

&gt; On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**

&gt; Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three‚ÄînCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)‚Äînow have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**

&gt; Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**

&gt; Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.

personalfinance,2020 Tax - 1099-INT causes me to owe?,"Good morning,

I was trying to file my taxes this morning. I'm filing my W-2, 1099-G, and 1099-INT. My W-2 and *every single* unemployment payment had taxes withheld. I made sure to tick the box for tax withholding *every time* I certified my unemployment benefits for last year.

So, the numbers I'm providing are rough(within $5-10) from what I remember over coffee. What happened was this:

* Input my W-2 and 1099-G, HR Block free shows $1300 return. 
* Input 1099-INT in the amount of $220, no taxes were withheld from this. My bank doesn't withhold taxes on interest. I was expecting the return amount to drop, what, $20-30?
* My $1300 return drops to -$350
* What the hell is causing this??

Mind you, this is only the federal part of it. I continued through to take the standard deduction. No change. I got as far as it asking me about the stimulus credit, then I saved the process and had to leave for work.

How does a $220 interest income drop my return from $1300 to -$350? What sort of black magic, voodoo chicanery is *this???*

Thanks, friends.",finance

personalfinance,"Pros and cons of points, credit vs. interest rate on home loan","I was wondering what the point of home loan point is.  It sounds like game.  You pay up front or get money up front in exchange for lowering or raising the interest rate.  It's kind of like a bet on whether you way +/- money up front, the interest rate, and whether you think you'll pay the home loan off earlier (if it's allowed).  Is that right?  Is there any angle I'm missing?

Do I want to not pay a little more up front and stick with the normal interest rate?

Do I want to pay more up front and save a little on the interest rate?

Do I want to get a discount up front and pay at a higher interest rate?



I suppose it depends on whether a lender will offer changes on points too.  I found that -- One deal, take it or leave it.  And it might matter on whether you think the interest rates might change, and you'll refinance later.",finance
personalfinance,Question on Adjusting W4 withholdings,"This year we are getting a $5400 tax refund and I want to make sure we adjust our W4 so we don't overpay that much this year. 

I went to the IRS calculator and filled out all the info, but when we gave the printed sheet to HR, they told us it needed to be filled out in ADP, and the form is not the same as the IRS printout. 

This asks for: 



Expected child tax credit (2000)

Estimated full year non-wage income not subject to withholding (0)

Estimated full year deductions above standard amount (12000 for both IRAs, but the amount for 401k does not go in here, correct?)

Additional amount, if any, to be withheld (0)  



Also if it matters, income is estimated $80k with standard deduction+ 2 person IRA deduction + child credit deduction + 6400 401k deduction (the remainder of the 401k is in a Roth so IIRC that doesn't count toward lowering our taxable liability?) and this year we have already paid just over $1k in federal taxes. 



So what I'm really looking to clarify is 1. what goes in the estimated full year deduction box (whether it's just 12000 for IRAs or 12000+6400 401k) and 2. Does $38000 for our taxable liability seem correct?  

Math: (80k base - 12k IRA - 2k child credit - 6400 401k - 21500 standard deduction = 38000) so we would owe roughly $4162 in taxes (19900 * .10 + 18100 * .12)



Thanks for any help. I'd hoped I could just hand off the w4 printed page but, of course, nothing in life is easy!",finance

dogecoin,Dogecoin does NOT have an unlimited supply,"After reading a lot of news articles and social media posts, it is clear that people don't understand Doge's supply. The main argument people have against Doge is its ""unlimited"" supply. It's not unlimited. There is a limited amount created per unit time. Time is a constraint on the supply of dogecoins: only about 5 billion new coins can be created per year. That's not that many, not even 1 new coin per person on the planet. With fiat currency, a central regulator can increase the supply unconstrained by time. The U.S. Federal Reserve created over $3 TRILLION in 2020 in response to the pandemic. At 5 billion coins per year, it would take 600 years to create 3 trillion coins. Unlike Dogecoin, there is no cap per unit time on the amount of USD that can be created.

Doge's capped inflationary nature is an asset. It is better suited to be used as currency that people buy and sell with rather than hoard. Bitcoin is deflationary to a fault, encouraging hoarding. 

Furthermore, Doge's inflationary percentage falls over time. The total number of coins in circulation rises while the number of new coins created per unit time remains fixed. Since people are so confused by this, a more detailed post should be pinned to this sub.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,(US-NJ) Can someone help check my numbers? Trying to determine if solar panels are a good investment.,"I own a ~2200sqft. home in southern NJ.  My wife and I have a decent chunk of cash sitting in a high-yield savings account that we'd like to use to get some better return on investment, but are hesitant to put any more money into the stock market.  We currently have ~60% of our savings in index funds, ~30% in an HYSA, and ~10% in a checking account.  We are willing to use up to $30k from our HYSA to invest in solar.

I've been shopping around to different solar vendors/installers and have gotten about 5 quotes.  Four of the quotes were in the ~$30k-$33k range, but they were all from ""big"" solar installers and they honestly seemed overpriced.  What surprised me the most was how little the out-the-door price changed considering we are paying with cash, so I feel like there's probably some room for negotiation.  However, one of the quotes - offered by Public Service Solar (a much smaller, ""botique"" solar installer) - provided a quote for $23k.  All of the quotes I got are using similar quality and quantity panels and inverters (27x LG 355/360/365 with Enphase microinverters).

I'm trying to decide two things:

1. Is this quote I got from Public Service Solar a ""too good to be true"" type of situation?  Or can they really offer much lower prices because they are a smaller company?  

2.  Is getting solar actually a good use of my money?

Here's how I figure the math works out:

**Assumptions:** 

* $0 maintenance cost.  Obviously not a valid assumption, but not sure how to account for this.  The company offers a 25-year warranty on roof penetration points, panels, and inverters...  but it's a relatively young company and I'm sure there are still costs associated.  Very difficult to estimate, and could be a gamechanger in my analysis.

* Additional cost to remove/store/reinstall solar panels in the event of a roof replacement would occur well after the breakeven point, and would not significantly offset lifetime savings.  Note: roof is currently ~10 years old.

* Money would otherwise be sitting in a HYSA with interest rate of ~1%.

* Solar generation models provided by vendors are accurate.  All vendors' models produce similar solar generation estimates.  These estimates also match third-party websites that I've tried.  One vendor was actually offering a guarantee on solar production, so it seems like the estimates are probably accurate.

**Figures:**

- Total upfront cost (parts, labor, permits, etc.): $23,159

- Tax credit (26% of total cost): $6,021

- TREC credits ($92/mWh of solar generated, for next 15 yrs): $77/mo

- Average electric bill (calculated from historical data - 12 months): $189/mo

- Average electric bill post-solar (estimate): $7/mo

**ROI calculation:**

This is more of a back-of-the-napkin calculation since I don't know how to do all of the math perfectly...  but I figured that if I leave my $17k (cost after tax credit) in the HYSA for the next 6 years (estimating this is the approx break-even timeframe) it will be worth ~$18k...  so that's the number I'm trying to beat.

- ""Real"" cost (total upfront costs minus tax credit): $23,159 - $6,021 = $17,138

- Savings (TREC credits plus old electric bill minus new electric bill): $77 + $189 - $7 = $259/mo

- ROI paypack period (break-even cost divided by savings): $18,000 / $259/mo = 69 months = 5.8 years


This seems like a no-brainer investment, right?  Assuming the panels last at least 25 years and electric prices continue to increase with inflation - going solar is scheduled to save me over $50,000 over their lifetime.  It seems like those savings would far outweigh any maintenance costs.  I trust Reddit's (normally) unbiased opinion much more so than salespeople and websites that make their livings selling solar.  Has anyone else come to similar conclusions regarding solar?  Are there any big costs I'm forgetting to take into account?  Am I thinking about this ""investment"" correctly?",finance
Bitcoin,Everything I own is in Robinhood and I‚Äôm terrified for my Crypto holdings üò©,"I started investing in August, 2019 and had no guidance on where to begin. Being broke as I was at the time, I heard Robinhood was fee-less and with the appealing interface, I decided to start investing with them.

My biggest worry now after investing and building my position is that I have all of my Crypto in Robinhood and have held an amount that I assume will one day be of great benefit to my portfolio.

I worry about my holdings because of the fact that I don‚Äôt actually have the coin in my wallet but through an institution like Robinhood.

If I sell, I‚Äôll have the tax liability and won‚Äôt be able to purchase on another platform at the position I currently have. It just makes no sense to sell and try to move it because it‚Äôll never get to the price that I am initially invested in. 

I am praying that one day Robinhood updates their platform to be able to transfer to an external wallet and that I don‚Äôt get f***ed over. 

Not sure what to do from here, other than continue to invest to build my position because what other choice do I really have?

personalfinance,Using Roth IRA for home savings,"Hello all, I know I know it sounds dumb. Let me explain then say if it seems like a good idea at all?

I make 75,000 per year, am married but single income household.

I have a car debt at 0% interest, costing 411 / month until May 2026. I know that's a lot of money, but its an SUV and planning on kids next two or so years, so wanted to be prepared. 

I currently put in 4,500 into 401k per year (6%) and my company matches, for a total of 12% of salary saved. They also put 1000/year into HSA so I put the other 6200 in. This comes out to a total of 21.6% of salary saved for retirement, between my contributions and company match. Thats before profit sharing etc. 

Well, I have a 0% credit card with 4400 in debt, 0% ends in December so I'm paying 409 a month to it right now to zero it out right before end of 0% interest. No other credit debt (well technically one other credit card has debt on it but its paid off at end of month between bonus and tax refund). I do have 21,000 in student loans all federal so 0% right now.  I have 4 months emergency savings as well. 

My question is, instead of going straight to 6% emergency savings, then saving for a house in a HYS account, can I do half my savings into emergency and half into Roth IRA? By the time federal loan forbearance is back, my emergency savings will be st 6%, so I could move a portion of that payment to fed loans and rest to Roth.

I would be investing Roth even though I plan on home purchase in two or so years.

I know I know don't invest if money is planned to be used in 5 years or less, but I don't need a house in the next 5 years, just would like one to start building equity. If market collapses I would hold off.

I would take out 100% of contributions plus the 10% I think it is of tax free gains for first home purchase, which should amount to around 15-20,000 in 2 years. Is this smart or not? I know Roth IRA is meant for retirement but I already have that covered in other accounts, this allows me to save more for the home purchase through the tax advantage. I know I could invest it separately and use all of the gains but not sure if it's really worth it with the fact half would be stcg and the other would be ltcg, it feels like this way is better, plus gives a bit more buffer for retirement savings.

For reference ages are 22m/22f.

Edit:

Assuming no raises ever and whatnot with 7% returns YoY, I have enough for FIRE @ age 50, which is when I want to retire. This will not hurt my retirement in any way.",finance
stocks,"Found some articles dated back to the dot-com bust, and they are eerily similar","I was very interested in finding the rhetoric and overall feel of the dot com bubble so I searched by date before 2000 and here what I found.

""**Not long ago I asked the officer of a regional investment banking firm why the price-earnings ratio for a small publicly held company was so high. ‚ÄúAfter all,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthis company has the potential to grow since it‚Äôs in the dental equipment industry. It seems to me it warrants a high ratio.‚Äù Don‚Äôt you know,‚Äù my friend replied, somewhat puzzled, ‚Äúthat that company is mainly a machine shop? That puts it into a low-growth industry classification.‚Äù** this is so eerily similar to tesla, not only does the guy say a p/e ratio is obsolete when it's not, but he also tries to make an argument that a dental shop is not a low growth industry when it is, very similar to how people say Tesla isn't a car company and price it differently because of that.

another interesting quote that I found was

**""It was once the job of analysts to tell investors at what price a stock should trade. But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots, even when it comes to big stocks with predictable earnings growth. Sure, the fine art of rationalizing high stock prices has long been on display for tiny, unproven Internet ventures without earnings. After all, it's hard to value a new company using traditional methods when it has no earnings.""** even after reading this I still could be fooled that this was written today, the way he says that traditional metrics don't matter or don't work anymore is strikingly similar, also the phrase ""**But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots""** is also ringing some bells in my head after this whole retail revolution.

and the final one I have is also the most striking

**""For day traders armed with Power E\*trade accounts and limitless optimism, the Internet is a revolution that has blown away all the old rules about how the stock market works.""** this is just so striking to what I hear today, replace e-trade with Robin and boom I would say this was written right now. and also how they say all of the old rules are obsolete the next paragraph also very eerie ""**For more seasoned investors, however, the Internet rally looks suspiciously like a beast they've seen rear its head time and again in an overripe bull market: a stock market bubble, fed by young, greedy investors for whom a 20% annual return on investments is a mark of defeat."".** this is almost an exact repeat of the dot com bubble, I never thought it was this similar but wow, I think I will begin to hedge my portfolio and I would caution against saying this times is different.

In March 2020 I filed my taxes on turbotax. I didn't get any sort of warning like I did this year about my 1095-A form regarding my health insurance, so I didn't end up doing it.

As April comes, the Covid-wave starts coming in full swing and for reasons I have to move to a different state to live with my parents. **The issue becomes that the IRS attempts to tell me I need to amend my tax or something because they need my 1095-A form faxed in, but they mailed my old address.**

So I'm living the year and some time in November I find out in a long call with the IRS that they mailed my old address and that I need to fax in the 1095-A, so I do, and they say it could take several weeks.

Despite attempts, I can never speak with an agent and every sign on the planet tells me I need to talk with an IRS Agent

Come February I did my taxes the first day I got my W2. I'd finally get my returns and my covid relief, but **my 2020 tax return was rejected because my 2019 taxes were considered non-filed by the IRS.**

So I need my 2019 AGI which apparently does not exist, and without it my 2020 Federal and state return won't be accepted, which I can only imagine means I won't be able to properly file for 2021 next year too.

stocks,Playing Devils Advocate: Why I'm already bearish on the THC market,"In the last week or two we've all seen a lot of unbridled optimism for the future of weed, THC, and CBD products.  For good reason too, it's a yet untapped market that could very well rival that of alcohol in the next decade or two with plenty of potential in the medical field as well.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I don't think the money is going to flow how people are hoping it's going to flow.  I've made a few examples with some of the issues I foresee.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  We have a great Canadian company showing strong growth and revenue.  First, lets assume that they decide there isn't too much more room for growth in Canada and they'll be better off selling to America.  First problem I see is that imports are going to be a nightmare.  Whatever the taxes and tariffs that are decided on are going to be heavily in favor of domestic production.  It's going to be at least a decade before America has much interest in exporting THC so the normal check and balance of retaliatory tariffs just wont be there.  The only way I see this not being the case is if there is some major player I'm unaware of who, for some reason, is unable to sell in Europe and decides to lobby against it.  They might as well start up a domestic production in America.
2. A ""start up"" in America who has lots of experience and a record of success in America (despite totally not having any since it would be against the law of course).  Finally things are really starting to look up!  Traditional loans are now an option, credit cards can be used, investors are beating down your door!  Only step you have to do now is get licensed!  No problem, you've been trough this before.  Only this time things are a bit different.  You resubmit all of the forms you completed before, but two are new, FDA approval and ATF approval.  The FDA approval is mercifully short, but you could tell it would be an absolute nightmare if you were trying to sell anything other than a joint; potential years of drug trials, QA certifications, licensing fees for specific strains, rigorous standards for ensuring THC and CBD content is as advertised, the list goes on and on.  Even the ATF form wasn't too bad, a few fees and such here and there.  Only one checkbox remains ""have you or anyone in your company that you know of consumed, sold, or had business dealings with others involving marijuana prior to legalization"".  It is clear that checking this box triggers and investigation, not checking it stops approval.
3. The Canadian company is 1. was lucky, the only Americans they knew before legalization were on hockey teams, so they can check this box without worry.  After a brief two month investigation, they are approved to begin growing.  They find some farmers that never grew marijuana before legalization (since most of the experience ones have been arrested or fined into bankruptcy) give them the tools and the training.  Only thing now are the seeds.  Before you can even ship them the farmer tells you ""don't worry, we'll order them from Monplanto, I have a contract with them and am only allowed to plant their seeds.""  After a while they find someone new who can plant the seeds you want, mercifully just before new regulations on seed imports are released.  Finally, all the hoops have been jumped and fees payed and through no small miracle, finally get your product to market.  There is a just one final obstacle to success, a punishing 30% tax.  Both the state and the feds now have a high tax, and you see your profit margins dwindle.  Thankfully they are still there, and you sell your pack of 5 joints for $80.  One more problem, there's a pack of 20 spliffs (have weed half tobacco) sold for $30.  You see, their product is being taxed at almost half the rate yours is since the tax is based on TCH/CBD concentration, and they are happy to sell at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

All three of the situations have something in common that I think we can count on.  The deck is heavily stacked against new companies.  We've already seen this happening to a lesser extent in states with partial legalization and when congress gets involved, I doubt that it will get better.  You might be asking ""If there are no real current THC businesses, who would want to prevent new businesses from starting?"".  Tobacco.  That's who.  

They all know they are in a slowly dying industry and need to get out.  What better way to get out than to give yourself a competitive advantage in a brand new industry that's basically identical to your current industry.  What I would do in their shoes is use my well established team of lobbyists to get the bar set so high that it costs at least 10 million just to play in the game while stacking the deck in my favor against those who can.  Then, use my connections to ensure that I am the first one on the field.  Once I'm there, I'm going to sell at a loss.  I'm already rolling in cash from big investors so 5 years of missed profits? not an issue.  Tobacco is still covering the losses.  Get the people used to the price and then the only competition is people selling ""luxury"" products.  Prices can be raised over time once the market is cornered for you and yours.

If I were to invest in weed, I wouldn't be looking at foreign companies or legally gray American ones.  I would be looking at the major players who have billions to gain and almost nothing to lose.  The ones with money.  My personal pick is  Altria Group (owner of Marlboro amongst others).  We know they are very interested in marijuana and are actually a proponent for legalization.  Rather curious, since it would most likely hurt sales in most of their subsidiaries.  They would only be there if they felt they had a lot to gain.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  I don't think anyone selling somewhat legal weed in America will survive federal regulation, I don't think anyone outside of the US will be able to sell to the US, I don't think any new company with a market cap under 1 billion will survive the first 5-10 years of being forced to sell at a loss to compete.

personalfinance,What do you think about my financial plan after graduation?,"I‚Äôm a 20YO graduating in a few months from a four year institution with a undergraduate degree in a STEM field. I went to school in a HCOL area and somehow managed to scrape by while paying for my own living and transportation expenses, but only because I had to move away from my family support system. 

I was lucky enough to secure a new grad position with high salary and great benefits in my hometown and my folks have offered to house me after graduation rent free. I see myself building a great nest egg and aggressively paying off my 25K student loan debt within a year.

For context, my folks are both retired seniors who sustain themselves off of city pensions. 

We have been in several discussions about wealth building, inheritance and trust/will agreements but more recently buying a new family home on a mortgage.  Our current home has gainfully appreciated to about $1M with only 100K left on the loan. In fact, several agencies are trying to buy out homeowners in our area due to gentrification and increased value in surrounding areas. 

Anyways, I noticed that 30-Year home loan interest rates are at new low at around 3% so this could potentially be a great opportunity to secure two homes that I will eventually inherit and possibly rent out for property income. 

I‚Äôve tentatively agreed to pay half of the note on both properties with them because I see it as an opportunity to build generational wealth and help establish myself early on in my professional career.

Are there any other considerations I should think about or make after graduation?

tl;dr: parents offered to house me rent free, I will aggressively pay off my 25K loan within a year, we are looking to buy another house, my only responsibility being half of the note on both homes.",finance

personalfinance,Owning a home for only two years - can this by financially smart?,"Hi folks!

Not sure where else I can ask this question, as most of my family consists of long-time renters (myself included). Me (27F) and husband (29M) are thinking about buying a home. I'm currently a medical student that has two years left of school (I graduate June 2023), and with the way the ""matching"" process goes in the US, I will have absolutely no idea where I will be placed after graduation. My husband and I have been long distance for the first two years of my medical training, but he recently got a job local to me and will be moving here in June.

Homes are cheap here in Buffalo NY, and with the kind of apartment we are looking for, the prices range from $2000-$2500 per month, which is quite high. At that point, we figured a $200K house would be better in terms of monthly payments, but the fact that we are only staying in Buffalo for two years makes it a harder decision in terms of losses. Now we could stay in Buffalo for longer, but there is no guarantee really. Both of us have never owned homes. Husband is eligible for physician home loans that require no down payment + good interest rates. We want to keep the home small, but ideally in a desirable neighborhood for re-selling purposes (? I'm ignorant regarding this process). 

What I'm asking is - is this a financially smart decision? What more information would you guys need to guide us? What sources can I use to be better equipped and gain more knowledge on this process?",finance
personalfinance,"I got a car loan when my credit was much worse, so the interest rate is really high. Refinancing is unlikely. Can I take out a personal loan at a lower interest to pay it off?","2 years ago (almost to the day), I got a car loan for a 2011 Ford Ranger with 70K miles on it. At the time, my credit was much worse than it is now. Part of the reason I got the loan was to improve my credit. After 2 years of flawless payments and other efforts to improve my credit, I‚Äôm doing a lot better (Equifax 724 / TransUnion 672). My interest rate is still insanely high though (15.01% APR) and I want to get my partner off the hook as the co-signer. I have called Capital One, my lender, and they refuse to re-negotiate. I have called a couple local credit unions asking about refinancing, but because my car is 10 years old and now has over 100K miles (which seems to be some kind of cut off for most lenders) I would have to pay a ton of money for them to even consider it.

So one idea I‚Äôve come across is taking out a personal loan at a lower interest rate, then paying off my car with that and hopefully ending up with a lower payment on the personal loan.

Other than that, I‚Äôm not sure if there is some person or service I can go to who could sift through realistic refinancing options because part of the hold up is me not having all damn day to talk to banks just to hear them tell me they need $7,000 or they won‚Äôt do it.

I hope this isn‚Äôt a stupid question, but I‚Äôm just curious about the feasibility of using the personal loan to pay off the higher interest car loan.",finance

personalfinance,The neverending discussion over house vs student loans,"I've browsed through previous posts on this thread so I know this is a fairly common topic, but everyone's situation is unique and I didn't come across situations that were very similar to mine; most have vastly different debt/interest/income variables.

I will be finishing grad school Spring 2021, and other than finally getting into my true career my next Life Goal, like many, is home ownership. I am getting married this summer, but all wedding-associated costs are covered so no concerns or additional debt there. If it means anything to the discussion, my fiance and I are 27/28.

After I graduate our annual gross household income will be \~100k, maybe a little more depending on my salary offer (basing my initial estimate on the offer a current student a year ahead of me in my program just received for a job in the same area we plan to move to).

My fiance has &lt;$4k of credit card debt from when we hit a rough financial patch a couple years ago. He's making slow progress on it, but we won't have the financial ability to knock it out until I graduate and increase income. I plan to knock this out first in about 2 months after my new salary kicks in.

We both have car loans at 3.5% interest or less; his will have 1 year left on it when I graduate and mine will have 2. Payments are less than $500/month combined, I don't plan to be aggressive about this debt. Both our cars are fairly new (2015, 2018), and we don't plan to replace any time soon.

I will have \~25k total in student loans when I graduate, about $5k of it 4-4.25%, the rest &lt;4%.

This is where I'm a little stuck. I know this is fairly low debt, but not low enough where I can knock it out in just a couple months. It also has fairly low interest rate on it (the wiki says attack anything 4-5%, but a majority of mine is less than that. I could either be aggressive with the SL debt and pay it off in about a year and then start saving for a house down payment, but I have been renting for nearly 10 years and I despise throwing my money away and not building equity or getting anything in return for it. I would prefer to save up a larger down payment for a house to 1) avoid PMI and 2) have a lower mortgage for the long run of home ownership/not be house poor. We'd likely be looking in the $300-350k range, so a 20% down payment would be $60-70k. We could be mildly aggressive and do this in 2ish years, and I could be aggressive with my student loans after that.

For the record, rent for a decent place in the area we plan to go to once I graduate is around the $1200-1400/month range.

I've also been thinking about the ""porque no los dos?"" option and getting a ""starter"" aka cheaper/smaller house that would require a smaller down payment and allow us to stop renting sooner and then upgrade to a nicer home in a few years but I also don't want to 'waste' the first time homebuyer benefits.

What is preventing them from creating their own digital currency and use the block chain just like bitcoin? Then what if they confiscate all the gold (USA) again. Then back it with Gold.

I was very interested in finding the rhetoric and overall feel of the dot com bubble so I searched by date before 2000 and here what I found.

""**Not long ago I asked the officer of a regional investment banking firm why the price-earnings ratio for a small publicly held company was so high. ‚ÄúAfter all,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthis company has the potential to grow since it‚Äôs in the dental equipment industry. It seems to me it warrants a high ratio.‚Äù Don‚Äôt you know,‚Äù my friend replied, somewhat puzzled, ‚Äúthat that company is mainly a machine shop? That puts it into a low-growth industry classification.‚Äù** this is so eerily similar to tesla, not only does the guy say a p/e ratio is obsolete when it's not, but he also tries to make an argument that a dental shop is not a low growth industry when it is, very similar to how people say Tesla isn't a car company and price it differently because of that.

another interesting quote that I found was

**""It was once the job of analysts to tell investors at what price a stock should trade. But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots, even when it comes to big stocks with predictable earnings growth. Sure, the fine art of rationalizing high stock prices has long been on display for tiny, unproven Internet ventures without earnings. After all, it's hard to value a new company using traditional methods when it has no earnings.""** even after reading this I still could be fooled that this was written today, the way he says that traditional metrics don't matter or don't work anymore is strikingly similar, also the phrase ""**But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots""** is also bringing some bells in my head after this whole retail revolution.

and the final one I have is also the most striking

**""For day traders armed with Power E\*trade accounts and limitless optimism, the Internet is a revolution that has blown away all the old rules about how the stock market works.""** this is just so striking to what I hear today, replace e-trade with Robin and boom I would say this was written right now. and also how they say all of the old rules are obsolete the next paragraph also very eerie ""**For more seasoned investors, however, the Internet rally looks suspiciously like a beast they've seen rear its head time and again in an overripe bull market: a stock market bubble, fed by young, greedy investors for whom a 20% annual return on investments is a mark of defeat."".** this is almost an exact repeat of the dot com bubble, I never thought it was this similar but wow, I think I will begin to hedge my portfolio and I would caution against saying this times is different.

personalfinance,Car loan balance discrepancy between myself and the bank,"I have a question regarding my car loan and the bank branch won't help me. In late Nov. 2020, I signed on a 48 month car loan at a fixed 3.54% APR. The principal balance at the beginning was $18,187. My monthly payment is $406.91.

Initially after signing the loan, I noticed the loan was increasing in value at rates much higher than what my interest rate should be. So far I have made the following payments.

Dec 2020: $406.91 monthly payment + $1000 payment applied to principal

Jan 2021: $406.91 monthly payment + $1200 payment applied to principal

Feb 2021: $406.91 monthly payment + $3000 payment applied to principal

I called the bank and asked them why my loan balance was \~$140 over what my homemade and online amortization schedule spreadsheet. In the bank's online portal, they only tell me the payments I have made and not what interest rate changes are being applied to the loan. The bank branch also told me they couldn't tell me why it was higher, but they could tell me the following figures.

2020 Total incurred interest: $52.77

2021 Total incurred interest: $50.53

Interest per day: $1.84

Currently my loan balance is $12,415.32 on the bank online portal. If you take my beginning balance ($18,187) minus my monthly payments ($813.82), minus my principal payments ($5200) plus my total interest incurred to date ($103.3), the loan balance comes out to $12,276.48. I don't understand why my balance is $138.84 higher. Am I being screwed by my bank or can I not do math? I just want to understand my loan!

My APR is 27.24% and its the only cars I use at this point and I do pay it off monthly in full which is usually about $800-$1200 a month. I also have a Chase Slate card which I‚Äôve had for roughly 14 years that now has a balance of ~$900 and a APR of 20.74%. I called Chase and asked them if they could lower the APR on my Freedom card since I pay it off every month and they said no. I only use it because of the 5% cash back on select stores and the 1% on other purchases. Would it be unwise of me to close this card (Freedom) and switch to another, possibly non Chase, with a lower interest rate? If so which cards would be a better option?",finance

personalfinance,Refinance Analysis - Seeking Input,"Hi All,  
   
I did the following analysis to compare the outcomes of staying with my current mortgage vs refinancing.¬† I‚Äôd appreciate it if I could get some feedback on whether it looks like a sound analysis or not.¬† Please let me know if you agree with the findings and my decision based on the analysis.  
   
Notes: ¬†  
1.  I believe I may have made a mistake in going with a 15-year fixed re-fi 15 months ago.  
2.  The numbers used below may not make for an entirely fair comparison since the current mortgage is already 15 months in.¬† Even so, I don‚Äôt believe it impacts the validity of the findings.¬†  
3.  Break-even point for the new mortgage is about 9 months.¬† Even considering the fees from the current mortgage and the new mortgage, it still seems worth it to re-fi to the 30-year fixed @ 3.15%.

\* Also, the new mortgage‚Äôs interest rate could be better, as I‚Äôve been seeing 2.6-2.8%.¬† Even with the rate used for this analysis, the difference in outcomes is clear.  
   
**AFTER 15 YEARS (Current vs New Mortgage):**  
   
CURRENT MORTGAGE:  
\-  $345,000.00 (100% equity) = **$345,000.00** TOTAL GAINED  
   
NEW MORTGAGE:  
\-  $109,753.00 remaining mortgage balance (based on amortization schedule)  
\-  $235,247.00 in equity (based on amortization schedule)  
\-  $187,087.88 ($549/mo invested in index fund w/ 8% annual return over 15 years)  
= ¬†¬†¬†¬†$235,247.00 ¬†equity + $187,087.88 from index fund = **$422,334.88** TOTAL GAINED  
   
$422,334.88 - $345,000.00 = **$77,334.88** MORE BY GOING WITH NEW MORTGAGE  
   
After year 15, if I were to stay with the current mortgage, I would need to find other sources to further increase net worth.¬† One idea is to rent out one bedroom for like $850/mo and live in the other myself, investing the $850/mo in an index fund for 15 years with an 8% return.  
   
   
**AFTER 30 YEARS (Current vs New Mortgage):**  
   
CURRENT MORTGAGE:  
\-  $345,000.00 (100% equity)  
\-  $289,661.70 ($850/mo invested in index fund for 15 years with 8% return)  
=¬†¬†¬†¬† **$634,661.70** TOTAL GAINED  
   
NEW MORTGAGE:  
\-  $ 345,000.00 (100% equity)  
\-  $ 778,818.67 ($549/mo mortgage payment savings by re-fi, invested into index fund w/ 8% annual return for 30 years)  
=¬†¬† **$1,123,818.67** TOTAL GAINED  
   
$1,123,818.67 (total gained from new mortgage) - $634,661.70 (total gained staying with current mortgage) =**$489,156.97** MORE BY GOING WITH NEW MORTGAGE  
   
\*The reason calculations only include renting a room in my condo after year 15 is that is when I anticipate I‚Äôd have a free room to rent out, if I had to.¬† By going with the new 30-year fixed mortgage, I would make significantly more over 30 years AND wouldn‚Äôt have to rent out a room to anyone.  
   
**CONCLUSION:¬† Refinancing to a 30-year fixed @ 3.15% or lower, even with the re-fi fees and already being 15 months into the current 15-year fixed @ 3.15%, would still result in a significantly better outcome over the next 15 and 30 years.**",finance

Just wondering how long I am gonna resist.

Some people know bsc and autofarm. I am using it on bnb with a current rate of 66.7% apy (0.17% by day).

Bsc make defi cheap. 0.20c for smart contracts. Hundreds on ethereum. 

The only drawback is you need a  [binance](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ZRPBNR4Y) account. 
Some great video explain binance smart chain. Bsc. üîó

Autofarm farm auto token on dot. Bnb rewards on bnb mostly. 
So you may need use pancake swap to buy dot with the auto reward. Or you can hold auto if you believe in the project. 

Bnb is burning a lot. So market cap will decrease with burn but price will increase to keep market cap and even increase a lot. Ranking will go higher.

Maybe I will buy more dot. Maybe I should buy more bnb that dot ü§î. Of course I am not gonna sell dot. This project is too hot babe. But bsc and bnb is damm pretty hot üî• for defi !!!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"529 for three teens, one in college already","Wanted to get opinions. Currently have 3 teens, and just starting 529s with them at ages 14, 17 and 19. 19 year old is in year 2 of college. 17 year old will be starting in the fall. 14 year old is a freshman in HS, so will start college in the Fall of 2024.

I opened 3 different 529s for them earlier this year. My plan was to put in 10K, which is the max deduction for the state I am in (CT). I believe with a 6-6.5% tax rate this might save $600 or so per year, in addition of course to any gains made in the 529. I assume there are also some account opening fees (too late for that, sunken cost now), maybe annual fee and expense ratios of course.

We have been maxing our 401k retirement, and until this year we have always made OUR financial future the priority, not the kids college, but with a second entering college this year, the bills will be pretty heavy. Even though our kids did great and received 4 year merit awards, we're still looking at roughly 30K or more per year net cost per kid. Our income level since we live in a wealthy part of CT makes us look ""rich"" on the federal level for the FAFSA, even though we are not, with the cost of living here being so high.

My questions were around:

1. Do the 529k's make sense, at least for the small state tax break?
2. Should we try to put a lot in, with ""conservative"" target portfolios since they are so close to school?
3. Trying to decide whether I fund as much as possible into youngest (8 years away from graduating college, more time to gain), or more of an even distribution.
4. Is it easy and possible to use any of the 3 kids funds to pay for any of the kids colleges?

Another potential option is to use an IRA withdrawal approach instead, since I think these are exempt from penalty if used for education. We would have to pay taxes on it.

The other fear is the FAFSA and CSS showing we have 529s and that counting against us when it comes time for awards.",finance

Bitcoin,Here's how it will (likely) play out...,"If we think about the 2008 financial crisis, many think of the Investment Bankers.

*Why didn't any bankers go to jail?*

Well, they just followed their incentive structures, they didn't do anything illegal.

Yes, all of this technical language - credit default swaps on subprime mortgage bonds.

Subprime mortgage bond - crappy mortgages were packaged together by Investment Banks and sold in the form of bonds.

Credit default swap - essentially an *insurance policy* with periodic premium payments and a fixed term.

For example, let's say Michael Burry bought a 30-year credit default swap on $100 million in subprime mortgage bonds.

Triple B-rated tranches - really grotesque stuff - 200 basis points (i.e. 2% interest).

So $2 million interest per year.

The most he could lose, if he was incorrect, would be $60 million ($2 million for 30 years).

The most he could make, if he was correct, would be $100 million.

He would be correct if the underlying mortgage pool for the tranche lost just 7%.

It was a zero-sum bet: if Burry $100 million, the party who had sold him the credit-default swap lost $100 million.

Sure, many Investment Banks had massive exposure via credit default swaps on subprime mortgage bonds.

Sure, many Investment Bankers operated in an amoral way.

**BUT the landscape was crafted by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan!**

*The Central Banks create the conditions for this nonsense to occur.*

**Encouraging more and more credit creation for asset transactions.**

This creates an asset bubble.

When this bubble pops, they blame some other party.

They then demand more power.

They then get more power.

What is the next phase?

**Well, Central Banks are currently expanding their powers.**

They want to eliminate their competition - cash and bank credit.

How?

Well, cash is dangerous now...

Moreover, Central Banks implement negative interest rates not for 'muh economic stimulation', but rather to drive both cash and bank credit out of business.

ethereum,On Ethereum's Dominance - Consolidated Common Content from Contributors,"Consolidated/paraphrased from various amazing contributors - this is not advice, but observation **- If Passing On, No Need for Attribution, just happy to help as others have helped me**

* Ethereum does much more than Bitcoin (not trashing papa Bitcoin, but Ethereum does more. Much Much more). This may not be bad. Being more conservative, less innovative, has perks. There's plenty of discussion on this theme I'll mention below.
* Ethereum's network effects as the dominant smart contract platform are overwhelming. All the things that make smart-blockchains cool are being done on Ethereum. There's no serious competition anymore; the evidence overwhelming:
   * Ethereum's momentum as the primary platform where crypto-assets are issued has grown over the last three years, with the share of the total token market cap constituted by Ethereum based tokens rising from 73.81% in July 2017, to 98.40% in July 2020 [(source)](https://medium.com/@amincad/ethereum-achieves-absolute-dominance-of-token-market-f7ef9c26ede). The entire market has steadily converged on Ethereum as the settlement layer for crypto-assets and Ethereum's ERC20 token interface as its technology standard for digital assets.
   * Ethereum is the most utilized crypto platform in the world, with more fees being paid to Ethereum miners than any other project's. The dominance extends beyond just Ethereum, to Ethereum-based dApps, with seven of the next nine largest revenue earning crypto projects in the world being based on Ethereum, as this charts shows with all the projects highlighted in pink being Ethereum-based: [https://cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)
   * All major DeFi applications operate on Ethereum. [Tracked by DefiPulse](https://defipulse.com/). These DeFi apps are all interacting to create an increasingly sophisticated open financial system on Ethereum that gives the platform an increasingly insurmountable advantage over potential competitors.
   * All of the major stablecoins; Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), True USD (TUSD), Binance USD (BUSD), and Paxos Standard (PAX), use the ERC20 standard.
* Beyond market adoption, the Ethereum development community is by far the largest in the cryptocurrency space, and its advantage over all other smart contract platforms has rapidly grown over the last three years:
   * Ethereum has an overwhelming lead over all other cryptocurrency and blockchain projects in the number of developers working on it according to the recently released [Electric Capital Developer Report (2020)](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444). This lead is accelerating, with a 215% increase in the number of developers working on Ethereum since 2017, and with the number of monthly developers increasing by 300+ between Q3 2019 and Q3 2020, which bucked the downward trend seen in the rest of the cryptocurrency market. [(source)](https://i.imgur.com/Hfo9rTP.jpg)
   * The overwhelming majority of Research and Development on blockchain scalability is being done on Ethereum-based projects [(source)](https://github.com/Awesome-Layer-2/awesome-layer-2). Groundbreaking scalability solutions that have recently launched on Ethereum Mainnet include Loopring and zkSync, which use zkRollUp technology to enable thousands of transactions per second to be processed on Ethereum layer 1: [(source)](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum-770d35213408) The misinformation you'll hear too much
   * Ethereum's [developer tool list](https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethereum-developer-tools-list) outshines everything out there. Getting smart contract to work properly is complex, and there is no magic port that will can do that realistically (no matter what others might shill). These are years of tools from thousands of developers. Having smart contract functionality means little compared to the tool list needed to use it effectively.
   * Every other project still needs years to have all these tools, for what? A blockchain that has some trivial perk (assuming it's a perk). By the time they have these tools (years away) ETH 2.0 and a whole new paradigm of functionally will be in place. [Again, there are thousands and thousand of ethereum developers, no other project comes close.](https://i.imgur.com/Hfo9rTP.jpg)
   * Note, there's some that think moving tokens (ERC20) from one blockchain to another is a big deal. It's not. There are no simple converters for the broader blockchain functionality. This is not a push button process. An ERC20 token is not the real world application being converted, it's just a simple token. Nothing special.
* ETH 2.0 model outshines all in the areas of decentralization. There's a lot of discussion about types of ""Proof-of-Stake"" (a validation method of the blockchain ledger). ETH 2.0 allows individuals to stake (validate) the ledger. Projects that claim to be cheaper/faster use delegators (cartels), often calling their method ""Delegated"" or ""Dynamic"" Proof-of-Stake (or other names), which essentially forces control of the chain in to groups, so for example, exchanges could assume control. ETH 2.0 stakers can opt in to join pools, but pools are not required. Got 32 ETH? You can stake as a individual.

**Ethereum's supply (and other common new-person questions about ethereum)**

* ETH is not capped, but restricted, capped is unlikely to be secure. Ethereum's monetary policy is best described as ""minimum issuance to secure the network""
* ETH issuance and burn is more sophisticated than Bitcoin. Under EIP-1559, some ETH get's burned (removed), which is projected to be greater than issuance (created). Everything is about creating a stable network, rather than and arbitrary cap. Bitcoin IS inflationary, and will be until we're all dead. Ethereum has a true deflationary mechanism
* What I see - anyone saying that ETH isn't scarce or anyone saying a ""hard cap"" is healthy for blockchains:
   * doesn't understand math and securing blockchain systems
   * is purposely deceitful
   * trying to pitch their corpo-coin
* You might hear someone say ""immutable"" or ""code is law"" or similar topics, in references to Ethereum's early history. Young blockchains are technologies that often have issues that need sorted out to build trust. Bitcoin had a really bad event that had to be fixed (lots of bitcoins were generated by an exploit). But it got repaired. Ethereum had a similar event, and some will try to split hairs about how Ethereum's event was different. In the end, blockchains require trust or they will not be validated. In the end, Ethereum has garnered that trust, by devs, by investors, and just starting, industry.
* What about ""eth-killer"" (enter whatever) doing such and such?
   * The graveyard of ""eth-killers"" is VAST:  ICX. QTUM. VET. ZIL. EOS. ONT. XTZ. IOTA. NEO. STRAT. AION, Rootstock, ETC (to name a few). We have a new wave of them now. My advice. Stop pretending you can ""kill"" Ethereum and starting thinking how you can contribute to the world Ethereum is creating.
   * But the gas-fees are too high... Yes, they are. Because the chain is being used. But L2 (above chain) solutions are already out ([an example](https://blog.synthetix.io/l2-mainnet-launch/)) for developers to start using. Plus other updates coming in a few months, such as  EIP-1559, clients... this summer. FUDing gas costs now is justified, but don't think untested/unused projects have any edge, especially with upgrades on a functioning chain (Ethereum) are already here, with more coming.

**More opinion, not advice**

* The order of importance is Ethereum, Bitcoin than any of the players trying to innovate the space, which are overwhelmingly building on Ethereum.
* I no longer see any other independent blockchain as relevant compared to Ethereum. I did a few years ago, but many of those projects failed their vision, some disappointed greatly
* Ethereum 2.0 will easily cover my prior concerns. So to me, it's done - if blockchains have a future, it's Ethereum's future. (mostly)
* I do see plenty of interesting defi projects (on Ethereum, of course). They are all MUCH higher risk than Ethereum. itself.
* I have a minority opinion, it seems Bitcoin is irrelevant compared to Ethereum. It's more just name recognition.
   * Ethereum already does more than Bitcoin, including more transactions, but that's not the reason I see Bitcoin as irrelevant
   * The major valid argument supporting Bitcoin (compared to ETH) is that it is a simple blockchain. It remains a powerful upgrade to gold, a better store of value. Ethereum, while more capable, involves innovations, which adds potential risks. AND ETH 2.0 is not fully here yet
   * I do, somewhat, agree with the above argument, in the short term, but if ETH 2.0 works (and it seems it will) and it fully becomes a computer-ledger for the world (a bigger ""what if"" for all crypto), then ETH becomes a more fundamental resource to society than Bitcoin. ETH, then, is a better store of value. Bitcoin is irrelevant.
* **Working together** \- I see it. Other chains will still be around in a couple of years. But to dethrone Ethereum, you need to do something absolutely unexpected, like turning a phone into a camera. Turning gold digital. Turning digital gold into an app store (Ethereum). What's next? Something HUGE, I suspect some day, but NOTHING I see now in this space is anything other than just a shadow/subordinate of Ethereum (in my opinion).",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Thoughts on a cash out refi to use as down payment on new home?,"I'm looking to relocate to another state. 

I currently owe 27k on my home with an interest rate of 2.75. Value would be around 230-250k, so I have plenty of equity in the home. 

I'm looking to take out 40-50k to add towards a down payment on the next house. Lower payment and avoid PMI being the goal. 

I would be renting out my current home, my neighbor rents for around 1200. Property is smaller with less upgrades, so potentially I could get more than 1200 out of it. Which should cover the added cost to this mortgage. 

I could save up 80k to avoid adding to my current mortgage but it will take time and I really don't want to miss out on the low rates we have at the moment. I could also pay off the current mortgage completely but that would set me back on my move drastically and as the loan sits, only 60 a month is going towards interest. 

The biggest issue I see right away would be that I've read that certain refis include a clause that you can not change primary residence for a year after taking out the loan to use on another property. I could float both properties for a year. But that's a year's worth of loss rental income.

As much as I'm looking forward for the move, I don't want to jump the gun and affect my financial situation in a negative manner. Thoughts?",finance

Bitcoin,Is bitcoin buying late now?,"Bitcoin exchange rate hit a new historical peak. The price of the world's first cryptocurrency has reached 48,000 U.S. dollars. Its background is that MasterCard and Bank of New York Mellon will use digital assets. Starting in October 2020, Bitcoin has risen more than 3 times. So what is the reason for the crazy rally of cryptocurrency and what are your expectations in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is the first and most popular decentralized cryptocurrency. At present, there are hundreds of various types of cryptocurrencies in the world, some of which are rising exponentially. But the main focus is still on Bitcoin. First, it is the most expensive cryptocurrency. Second, more than 100 million people in the world are Bitcoin holders. In December 2017, when the cryptocurrency was raging, the price of Bitcoin suddenly rose to 20,000 U.S. dollars. Everyone invested heavily in not only buying cryptocurrency, but also mining Bitcoin, building a huge ""mine"", and installing With mining equipment, electricity consumption is almost equivalent to that of small cities. Some entrepreneurs invested hundreds of millions of dollars in setting up mines. The business of mining equipment manufacturers is also quite good. For example, a special reference integrated circuit Ant miner S9 mining machine from Bitmain sells for US$6,500.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, a new related industry has been formed around cryptocurrency, bringing huge profits. But soon ushered in the ""cryptocurrency winter"". The exchange rate of Bitcoin and other digital assets fell, and the entire industry depreciated with it. The continuous adjustment of this scale stems from the following aspects. First, Bitcoin cannot enter widespread circulation due to turbulence and a series of technical restrictions. For example, the Bitcoin algorithm cannot exceed 7 transactions per second, which is trivial for the massive use of cryptocurrencies worldwide. In addition, some countries have begun to regulate the circulation of digital financial assets. China is the world's leading country in mining and cryptocurrency circulation, but it bans cryptocurrency exchanges and ICOs. Later, mining was also restricted to a certain extent. Therefore, the field has to adapt to new conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

But in 2020, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will start to grow wildly. For example, in March 2020, the price of Bitcoin was about $4,000, but now, a year has not passed, the price has risen 10 times. When the price of Bitcoin rose to $47,000, analysts began to scramble to believe that this year's price will rise to $100,000, and some even predict that it will rise to $300,000. From a practical point of view, no one can predict what the future market price will be, but afterwards, we can try to analyze the reasons for its surge.

&amp;#x200B;

There are both instantaneous and fundamental factors that affect the exchange rate of Bitcoin. The transient factor is the demand for cryptocurrency by large investment institutions. In 2020, every rising wave of Bitcoin begins with the entry of professional investors. In May, Paul Tudor, founder of the hedge fund Tudor Investment, invested $50 million in Bitcoin. In September, Microstrategy invested $250 million. Later, Square purchased $50 million in Bitcoin. In October, PayPal announced the introduction of digital currency into its own payment system, which can be paid in stores. In 2021, Tesla announced that it had invested 1.5 billion US dollars in Bitcoin. Since then, the cryptocurrency has risen by 10% almost instantly, setting its own price record. Now, MasterCard and the Bank of New York have also announced that they will use digital assets, thereby stimulating the price of Bitcoin to soar.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also fundamental factors. Bitcoin is a scarce asset. According to the algorithm, the total number of Bitcoin mining in the world will not exceed 21 million. Therefore, the algorithm stipulates the mining cycle: the income of miners is halved every four years. In May 2020, there was a halving, and the miners' mining dropped to 6.25 bitcoins. As the actual harvest and sales of miners decreased, the pressure on prices also decreased, and the exchange rate rose accordingly. In addition, in the context of the crisis, the demand for scarce resources has traditionally increased. For example, gold will not depreciate in the long run, but it will also be affected by instantaneous factors in the market. Furthermore, in response to the crisis, many countries have begun to implement monetary stimulus policies and introduced ultra-low interest rates. Traditional assets have begun to depreciate and investment income has begun to decline. Therefore, people began to choose investment tools such as gold and bitcoin to provide protection for themselves in the current market situation. It is worth mentioning that Bitcoin appeared in 2009 precisely in response to the financial crisis and market turmoil.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and unpredictable assets with extreme characteristics. Therefore, the investment for it is either an optimist or a professional investor who has no way out. Due to the unstable exchange rate, it is difficult for Bitcoin to become a means of payment and storage tool. Therefore, cryptocurrency cannot enter widespread circulation. If the world economy begins to stabilize, investment tools with predictable incomes will emerge. In the long run, turbulence will drive in different directions, but according to the natural nature of Bitcoin's scarcity, the overall upward trend will not change. Well, now some will say that it is too late to buy Bitcoin and they have not seized the opportunity. In fact, the first stage that is only a preliminary improvement is not the final craze. According to the recent moves of the big money bosses, they will raise the investment so don't worry about it is not too late.",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,We don't do this for the MONEY! We do it because it is FUNNY!,"Do you remember the episode of Black Mirror about the politicians and Waldo? What started as a joke eventually became serious, much bigger than the joke. That is what Dogecoin is. Sure we would like to make money from this cute little coin that could. But ultimately, it's a joke. It has the potential to be history's greatest joke. Started out by YOLOing into doge several days ago, but since then I've taken a more stable approach to investing. Dogecoin is now my class favorite in my portfolio and I think, while we wait for it to mature into the dynamo coin it can be we can do our part by keep working the meme machine. Weather it be a little time a day or nearly full time we should focus, not entirely on the financial aspects of the coin, but in the philosopy of the joke that is dogecoin. HISTORY'S GREATEST JOKE will be to convince the world that the only logical entity to label money with as oppsed to any one country or small group of countries deciding who's leaders or historical figures, will be dog. Think about it, if the Galactic Federation is real and Earth is some backwater speck in space. Deciding on a dog as the currency label will demonstrate a moment of self-awareness; an acknowledgement to the Federation that we as a species can democratically decide a currency label better than the glorification of any one country's leaders, yet pays tribute to one of humanity's greatest allies, the dog. THE STRUCTURE OF A JOKE is setup, punchline, setup, punchline. The greatest jokes are the ones you never see the punchline coming; doge is history's greatest punchline. Stay making the memes! don't just keep posting the same things over and over ""Hodle, to the moon, stop selling guys, Elon save us."" Come up with original ideas, stop looking at doge like its just another coin to get rich off of; the money will come if the joke if funny enough. Doge has a leg up on all the other coins; its logo, its mascot. It can be brought to life. THE RECENT INTEREST in Doge has come from the recent spike in interest in GME. We may be waiting a while for Doge to spike to ATH again. While you wait, contribute to the meme machine, branch out into other platforms like tiktok. Come up with more innovative ways of telling the story of Doge, how its and underdog and everyone loves an underdog story. Especially when its a literal dog underdog story. Learn the photo editing software, video editing. The meme machine is made up of all of us. That is the doge propaganda machine; its a meme machine and just like blockchain, its decentralized. No one is directing it, orchestrating it. You just take part, take steps, write, design, edit and post your first meme.

I have no debt other than my mortgage ($88K left with 3.875% interest rate, 20 yrs left of a 30 yr loan). The mortgage and house is only in my name. I contribute $100 extra each month to the principal.

I am contributing a little over 15% of my annual salary to retirement accounts (maxing out Vanguard Roth IRA investing in  VFIFX Vanguard Target Retirement Fund 2050, maxing out my HSA and investing in VFIFX Vanguard Target Retirement Fund 2050, and contributing 6% (just to get the employer match) to my 401K in Russell 3000 Index (65%), International Equity (26%), and Intermediate Bond (9%)).

I have never invested in account that wasn't specifically a retirement account, so I would like this to be the next step to make the most out of my money for the long term (10+ years).

Combined we easily could clear $550,000 qualifying (couldn‚Äôt afford that amount obviously) but now I think I qualify for like $300k max on my own.. which really doesn‚Äôt go far at all. Obviously we are considering cheaper markets or waiting for a housing downturn- however unlikely that may seem- but in the meantime I just want to see any options for programs that could assist us. We have considered a condo as well which are cheaper, probably a nice one for around $350k..

personalfinance,Can you take advantage of 401(k) loans to get around contribution limits?,"Suppose you‚Äôre self-employed and completely in control your own 401(k). Could you deliberately give yourself a 401(k) loan at a high interest rate?

For example, suppose I have $200 in my 401(k) and that my account returns, on average, 9% a year. If I don‚Äôt take out a 401(k) loan and get a 9% return for the next 5 years, I‚Äôd have a total of $307.72 in my account at the end.

Now suppose I take out a 5-year 401(k) loan at 20% interest on $100, to be repaid as a single lump sum. Assuming I successfully repay myself, and that my remaining $100 gets a 9% return per year, I‚Äôd have a total of $402.69 in my account.

Obviously, I haven‚Äôt created money out of thin air. I‚Äôve just taken more money from my non-retirement savings and put it into my retirement savings.

But now suppose I‚Äôm putting the maximum every year into my 401(k) and IRA. By lending myself money from the 401(k) at an interest rate higher than the stock market‚Äôs average return, I could stuff even more money into my tax-advantaged account, which will be good for the long-term growth of the money.

personalfinance,Taking Advantage of 0% Interest on Student Loans - Should I Put It In a Savings Account or Invest It Short Term?,"I graduated in December 2019 with about \~120K in student loan debt. Since March 2020, my federal loans have been at 0% (and at this point, will continue to be 0% until September 30, 2021). I started paying on my loans in September 2020, and if I keep paying the same amount, I should have them paid off by December of this year. I'm 29, married, financially stable with an emergency fund. My question is this - is it worth investing this money temporarily or keeping it in a ""higher yield"" savings account? (I have one that will give me 0.55% APY)

I want this debt paid off with minimal interest - so if payments/interest resume come October 1st, I will definitely make sure those loans are paid off by December. However, if the government extends the 0% interest rates/payments even further (which I think they may, but who knows), I wouldn't mind having the money sit in some stable investments. Then, whenever it's time to pay off my loans, I could just pull the money out of either my savings or investments and dump it on the loans. However, could the return even be worth the headache of investing for something this short term? I have a 401K and that's about the extent of my knowledge on investing so I'm really not certain what's the best move. I'd end up either saving or investing between $8K-9K/month.

investing,Using options to play APHA/TLRY arbitrage,"For those of you who aren‚Äôt familiar with this situation I will outline a brief summary here. On Dec 16th, it was announced APHA would acquire TLRY through a reverse merger, with the new company trading under the TLRY name. Through this merger, each share of APHA will be converted to 0.8381 shares of the new TLRY ticker. However, there is currently a price dislocation in the market, as APHA closed Friday at 16.94 compared to 29.00 for TLRY. This represents a 30% discount from fair value on APHA.

The obvious trade to take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity is to put on a long/short pair trade. I‚Äôve seen a few posts outlining this idea already. Basically, it would entail going long 1 share of APHA and short 0.8381 shares of TLRY. Theoretically this would capture the entire 30% dislocation as both companies trend towards their fair conversion ratio. There are, however, a few flaws/risks with this trade that should be considered. 

1. Borrow rates. In order to short TLRY you will need to pay interest to borrow the stock. This interest rate is quoted daily, and has fluctuated between 8-22% this past week (annualized). Assuming the holding period for this trade is 4 months - based on the merger occurring in Q2 - you would be paying 2.5-7.5% in interest at today‚Äôs rates. Now this doesn‚Äôt sound like a big deal because we‚Äôre capturing a 30% return right? Sure, assuming rates and share price remain at these levels. Now let‚Äôs assume TLRY continues to squeeze up to 100, now you‚Äôve tripled your short position and need to pay triple the interest. Furthermore, the borrow rate will likely increase with price, and we‚Äôve seen extreme borrow rates before, sometimes even in excess of 100% (GameStop topped 150% for a short period last summer). Very quickly you can see that interest rates have the potential to eat away at your returns.

2. Margin requirements. Along the same lines as my first point, if TLRY squeezes back up to ATHs your broker is going to require significant margin to hold your position. Remember, even though this is theoretically a delta neutral play with the impending merger, your broker won‚Äôt recognize your long APHA position as a hedge against your TLRY short. There could come a point where the margin balance required to hold the trade won‚Äôt justify the max profit potential.

Okay - so how do we play this then?

I‚Äôm suggesting a play that involves going long APHA shares and hedges with ITM TLRY puts. Specifically, let‚Äôs look at the June 100p. It would look something like this using Friday close numbers:

Long 100/0.8381 = 119.32 shares of APHA
Long 1 Jun 100p on TLRY

Premium on the puts is 75.525. 

If, at expiry TLRY trades at or below below 100, then the profit will be:

APHA
(P-16.94)*119.32*0.8381

TLRY
(100-P)*100 - 75.525*100

= 426.26

Essentially what we‚Äôre doing here is paying a slight premium on the put to lock in the short interest rate on TLRY and remove margin risk (we are essentially locking in the margin required for the trade - eliminating the risk of getting margin called if TLRY squeezes). 

Now the beauty of this trade is that you are now also delta positive. Assuming price dislocation does not increase, you are poised to capture another spike in APHA‚Äôs share price, profiting disproportionately on your long shares (because the delta of your TLRY put will trend down). Therefore there could be an opportunity to close the trade early for a profit - but if not you are secured by the fundamentals of the merger conversion ratio at expiry.


I believe using this strategy is at least lower risk than the long/short pair trade. This being said, there is still risk - and that is if for some reason the merger does not go through. This is unlikely, but possible. If this is the case, it is my speculative opinion that APHA will still outperform TLRY. My evidence for this that APHA traded at a higher per share value than TLRY pre-merger announcement in December. Upon announcing the deal, APHA sold off - indicating that the street saw the merger as an over pay for APHA. This assumption could be distorted by the political events that have ensued since that merger (it could be argued that the blue senate disproportionately benefits the American based TLRY compared to the Canadian based APHA). However, it is still my biased opinion that APHA is the better company absence of the merger.

TLDR:

Long 119.32 shares APHA
Long 1 Jun 100p TLRY

This is not investment advice, just my opinion.",finance

stocks,"Reliable Mediocrity: ""Uncertainty You Can Trust"" - Trading Week Ending 2/19/2021","Dear Member,¬†

Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Reliable Mediocrity newsletter for the trading week ending on February 19th? We hope that this email finds you well and not completely dead from last week's weed stock boom. For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, don't go in on a stock when it is already massively outside its moving averages. While we are on that note: I would not (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE) pulling out gains from C C the Fourth, MARA, and RIOT to balance your earnings. While all three may continue to rise, always know how much of your unrealized gains that you are willing to lose.¬† I note this because last week was an absolute smoke show. If you believe in the long-term adoption of Voldemort, keep your RIOT and MARA because they will likely dominate the next couple years. From last week, if you followed along and pulled your plays, you definitely cashed in big time.¬†

* RIOT +76%
* MARA¬†+44%¬†
* C C the Fourth¬†+15%¬†
* CVS¬†+4.31%

This week, we are going to be looking into some of our earnings plays that could give us a solid pop leading into announcements. Personally, I believe the meme stocks are dead and that earnings are going to be our plays for the next few weeks until there is notable news coming out of new sectors. If you don't want to get off the meme stock bandwagon, be prepared for some massive roadblocks. Large institutions are riding the waves of meme stocks to cash in. Do you really think that retail investors have the money to move TLRY from $28 - $64 in one week? Of course they don't! Big money hops in with major cash looking to get a quick buck. They buy at $32, it pumps, and then they dump it all for a fast guaranteed profit. Are marijuana stocks going to rise through the Biden presidency? YES! But there won't be any movement that fast (time) and significant (% change) in an organic way.¬†

* ACB Long Hold 1/21/2022 ($25 Strike)  

   * I believe in weed stocks for real. I do NOT believe that last week was anything to realistically expect in the future. If you want to make big bucks in weed, you need to pay for the Theta! There is no guarantee on when federal legalization will occur, but we all know it's coming with so many states already legalizing recreational marijuana. I chose ACB because they're a stable business who has an extremely volatile stock. If they can return to their 2018 highs, we are going to cash in massively.¬†
   * NOTE: The TLRY¬†+ APHA merger is tempting, but buying APHA in hopes of cashing in on the arbitrage (83-86% of TLRY depending on who you believe). The risk for APHA is obviously that the TLRY price drops near merger and absolutely screws your play. That being said, APHA is currently trading at 58.49% of TLRY so the numbers are on your side if the merger happens in the near future. I have a feeling the merger won't happen until 4/20 at the earliest. You think I'm joking, but imagine the news that would create; ""Weed stonks merge on the most sacred of all days!""
* ARKF (Yes, specifically Fintech)  

   * RIOT and MARA have been crushing lately, but they're just one component of the financial technology¬†future. The real financial future will be diversified between ""normal"" fiat currency technology becoming more simplified through cloud based payment systems and digital wallets in general. The digital wallet market has just opened up and this can be seen through the success of Square, Apple Pay, Shopify, etc. When the general population as a whole transitions to these, which will happen, the fintech market will absolutely explode. Is ARKF a one week play, absolutely not, but it's almost guaranteed to continue its meteoric rise.¬†
   * My play is HEAVY in shares. The premiums for 1/21/2022 options are about¬†+$10/share ATM and¬†+$5/share OTM at¬†+43% of current trading price. Depending on what your goal here is, I'm going to say that shares are probably both safe AND a good investment for the future.¬†
   * Worth noting: ARKF is up 44% in the last 3-months. If you're willing to gamble on that to continue, those 1/21/2022 $85 strikes are gold.¬†
* CCL 3/12 ($24.5 Strike)  

   * Carnival Cruise Lines is boring as hell, there is no denying this. It's time that we finally admit that we all want to be in on the return of cruise lines. Where are they going? Up. When is the question. I'm going a month out and here is why. Dr. Genius Fauci says it will be ""open season"" for vaccinations of the general public by April. The reason I'm looking at 3/12 is because people are going to start hopping on the stock given the future expectations. If Fauci's promise is delivered in April, it will be open season for cruises again this summer. Can we make another play leading into June/August, for sure, but the cost of Theta right now looks a bit steep.¬†
   * Next, why $24.50? I'm shooting here because CCL hit $23.50 for absolutely no reason in early December and only pulled back to around¬†$20. We were heading into all time highs for cases in the US and we all knew it was only going to go up through the holidays. Next, if you've been watching the news, you have seen the MASSIVE decline in new cases occurring throughout the US. This is a massively huge moment for all travel and leisure related companies. But most of all, massive for cruise lines. This makes it VERY likely that CCL will ""cruise"" its way back up to $23-$24. If you want to be safe, hit that $23.5 mark.¬†
   * As always, don't exercise your options. Also, if you're up 50%+ just cash out and move on to the next play. Know your numbers and risk accordingly.¬†
* ZNGA (Just hear me out!) 1/21/2022 $20 Strike  

   * ZNGA has been recommended as a ""Best Buy"" through MF on multiple occasions. The hype of that alone is enough to keep it rolling for months to come. The MF followers buy and hold for long periods of time.¬† ZNGA is a massively successful mobile gaming company that is up 76.82% on the year. They recently announced they would be moving into multi-platform gaming to diversify their gaming experiences. ZNGA makes most of their money from micro-transactions that are small and frequent. They have shown that they are going to control the majority of the mobile gaming market.¬†
   * For the record, this might hit, it might not hit, but the cost is only $0.40 at current position. I'm looking to play a bunch of these and pull out around +75-100%, just keeping a few in hopes of a big OTM - ITM play.¬†
* Notable Mentions (More dangerous given their recent success)  

   * C C the Fourth - This guy is still a total toss up. I'm pulling some of my shares because if the acquisition doesn't happen, I'm not willing to risk it all. That being said, I'm going to hold 20-ish on the off chance of a meteoric rise post-acquisition.¬†
   * RIOT &amp; MARA - I truly believe in the technology here and I will continue to hold unless there is¬†some sort of massive ban on their technology. Also, multiple large institutions have stated their interest in acquiring large sums of Voldemort for free cash holdings, similar to Tesla's action last week. If this occurs, RIOT and MARA will continue to explode.¬†

Sincerely,¬†

Bitcoin,Why does Bitcoin rise and rise all the way?,"Bitcoin exchange rate hit a new historical peak. The price of the world's first cryptocurrency has reached 48,000 U.S. dollars. Its background is that MasterCard and Bank of New York Mellon will use digital assets. Starting in October 2020, Bitcoin has risen more than 3 times. So what is the reason for the crazy rally of cryptocurrency and what are your expectations in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is the first and most popular decentralized cryptocurrency. At present, there are hundreds of various types of cryptocurrencies in the world, some of which are rising exponentially. But the main focus is still on Bitcoin. First, it is the most expensive cryptocurrency. Second, more than 100 million people in the world are Bitcoin holders. In December 2017, when the cryptocurrency was raging, the price of Bitcoin suddenly rose to 20,000 U.S. dollars. Everyone invested heavily in not only buying cryptocurrency, but also mining Bitcoin, building a huge ""mine"", and installing With mining equipment, electricity consumption is almost equivalent to that of small cities. Some entrepreneurs invested hundreds of millions of dollars in setting up mines. The business of mining equipment manufacturers is also quite good. For example, a special reference integrated circuit Ant miner S9 mining machine from Bitmain sells for US$6,500.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, a new related industry has been formed around cryptocurrency, bringing huge profits. But soon ushered in the ""cryptocurrency winter"". The exchange rate of Bitcoin and other digital assets fell, and the entire industry depreciated with it. The continuous adjustment of this scale stems from the following aspects. First, Bitcoin cannot enter widespread circulation due to turbulence and a series of technical restrictions. For example, the Bitcoin algorithm cannot exceed 7 transactions per second, which is trivial for the massive use of cryptocurrencies worldwide. In addition, some countries have begun to regulate the circulation of digital financial assets. China is the world's leading country in mining and cryptocurrency circulation, but it bans cryptocurrency exchanges and ICOs. Later, mining was also restricted to a certain extent. Therefore, the field has to adapt to new conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

But in 2020, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will start to grow wildly. For example, in March 2020, the price of Bitcoin was about $4,000, but now, a year has not passed, the price has risen 10 times. When the price of Bitcoin rose to $47,000, analysts began to scramble to believe that this year's price will rise to $100,000, and some even predict that it will rise to $300,000. From a practical point of view, no one can predict what the future market price will be, but afterwards, we can try to analyze the reasons for its surge.

&amp;#x200B;

There are both instantaneous and fundamental factors that affect the exchange rate of Bitcoin. The transient factor is the demand for cryptocurrency by large investment institutions. In 2020, every rising wave of Bitcoin begins with the entry of professional investors. In May, Paul Tudor, founder of the hedge fund Tudor Investment, invested $50 million in Bitcoin. In September, Microstrategy invested $250 million. Later, Square purchased $50 million in Bitcoin. In October, PayPal announced the introduction of digital currency into its own payment system, which can be paid in stores. In 2021, Tesla announced that it had invested 1.5 billion US dollars in Bitcoin. Since then, the cryptocurrency has risen by 10% almost instantly, setting its own price record. Now, MasterCard and the Bank of New York have also announced that they will use digital assets, thereby stimulating the price of Bitcoin to soar.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also fundamental factors. Bitcoin is a scarce asset. According to the algorithm, the total number of Bitcoin mining in the world will not exceed 21 million. Therefore, the algorithm stipulates the mining cycle: the income of miners is halved every four years. In May 2020, there was a halving, and the miners' mining dropped to 6.25 bitcoins. As the actual harvest and sales of miners decreased, the pressure on prices also decreased, and the exchange rate rose accordingly. In addition, in the context of the crisis, the demand for scarce resources has traditionally increased. For example, gold will not depreciate in the long run, but it will also be affected by instantaneous factors in the market. Furthermore, in response to the crisis, many countries have begun to implement monetary stimulus policies and introduced ultra-low interest rates. Traditional assets have begun to depreciate and investment income has begun to decline. Therefore, people began to choose investment tools such as gold and bitcoin to provide protection for themselves in the current market situation. It is worth mentioning that Bitcoin appeared in 2009 precisely in response to the financial crisis and market turmoil.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and unpredictable assets with extreme characteristics. Therefore, the investment for it is either an optimist or a professional investor who has no way out. Due to the unstable exchange rate, it is difficult for Bitcoin to become a means of payment and storage tool. Therefore, cryptocurrency cannot enter widespread circulation. If the world economy begins to stabilize, investment tools with predictable incomes will emerge. In the long run, turbulence will drive in different directions, but according to the natural nature of Bitcoin's scarcity, the overall upward trend will not change. So, what will happen to the current Bitcoin mining if it ends? Will there be new bitcoins? There are no clear answers to these questions. This unpredictability is why conservative investors stay away from Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency
cardano,Thoughts on newcomers,"There have been some grumbles about the way the sub has changed and I share a lot of them. However, this isn't a one-off event; prices are volatile, and any big upward move is going to draw in the crowds. Those of us who have been here longer have an obligation to mentor the rest. I don't begrudge anyone's frustration, but I reckon the goal of our interactions should be, ""how do we cultivate an engaged, curious and sustainable community?"" 

Before I continue, I think we already do an amazing job of this - there's already an extensive set of self-education materials for anyone sufficiently motivated, and by-and-large our community is welcoming, patient and helpful. I also totally agree with the earlier thread that we don't want ""moonboy hype post garbage"". I just don't want us to lose sight of the opportunity we've got.

Every new member who buys ADA is another potential proposer, debater, voter when Voltaire hits. Even now, every one of them could contribute ideas and kudos on the Cardano Ideascale. I definitely don't want elections where a significant voting stake is controlled by moonboys looking at next month's pump. The best safeguard against that is a massive, educated, resilient community.

IO Global could build the best ever blockchain democracy, but if it's not matched by the community then I honestly believe it'll be for naught. If we stay a cult of 100K true believers, what's to stop massive institutional money from buying up an influential stake and skewing our elections? Decentralization is the best form of insurance, but that means community.

We have just been flooded with tens of thousands of new community members, excited by the project and looking to learn more. This is an incredible opportunity. If we get this right, we can build the foundations of the massive, effective voting population Cardano needs.

To new members reading this - we need you! We need you in our community, we need you learning and thinking about the platform, we need you to bring your ideas and designs to help us build a better Cardano.

stocks,Why are people not more concerned about deflation?,"The only tools available to escape deflation are to lower interest rates and print money to stimulate the economy. Interest rates are near zero already so that only leaves printing money.  So far this money printing appears to just be inflating equities and driving up stock prices.  I.e. not circulating or stimulating the economy. If this continues to fail then deflation would take hold. 

If money printing does in fact stimulate the economy and leads to inflation then they will have to subdue it by raising interest rates.  This will cause unprofitable and debt ridden companies to go bankrupt.  People may then get spooked and withdraw cash crashing the stock market. Alternatively the stock market may just stagnate which would lead to the same result but more slowly.  Companies would then struggle under debt combined with the lack of investment.
This seems to move us towards deflation. 

The government would then be pinned between printing limitless money to prevent deflation and raising interest rates to prevent runaway currency inflation.

Alternatively they could step back and allow the bankruptcies to happen, stock market crash and ride through the deflation cycle.

I mean either options is awful but the second option seems more likely.  

Ultimately the rich and powerful will see it as:
1. Option A Inflation - All my money is destroyed and worthless.
2. Option B Deflation - My cash money is fine and will appreciate but some of my assets could be destroyed. 

I guess truly profitable and essential companies paying dividends would remain good investment even in deflation.",finance

personalfinance,Contribute to traditional or Roth IRA after being unemployed last year?,"Last year, I was self-employed for the first three months and unemployed the rest of the year due to COVID; my pre-IRA AGI ended up around $34k.

I'd like to put $6k of that signing bonus toward an IRA and have that contribution count toward 2020. The question is traditional or Roth? Here are the key facts:

* Any 2020 traditional IRA contribution would be tax deductible due to my AGI.
* If I put $6k toward a traditional IRA, I would pay about $1800 less in 2020 taxes: \~$600 less federal tax, \~$900 larger Premium Tax Credit, and \~$300 less state tax\*. Of course, I'd have to eventually pay the federal and state taxes when I withdraw the money.
* I'm making enough that my future Roth IRA contributions could be limited due to my income. This could be the last time I can contribute the full amount without backdooring it.
* I have a rollover traditional IRA, so any backdoor Roth IRA I'd try in the future would already be complicated by that.

So it's a matter of paying $1800 now or an indeterminate amount later. Since I was unemployed most of last year, that $1800 would certainly help replenish my savings account, but it's not strictly necessary as I'll be saving plenty of money from my new job.

Do you really think you will only be worth $1000 by the time you need to retire in 40-50 years? No.

 So just buy bitcoin, if it goes to $0, who cares. Or the more likely outcome is bitcoin is worth millions of dollars (if dollars exist) and you are set for retirement. Just buy the bitcoin ticket and keep it somewhere safe(don't lose your keys) and don't touch it. Don't day-trade it.

Whenever you sell, whales are buying your sats and will be holding them forever and you're going to have to buy less for more later. Do you want to holds your sats forever or do you want to let the whales hold it for themselves?

personalfinance,Buy now? Or wait until we have a bigger down payment in a hot US real estate market. Feedback appreciated!,"I will preface this by saying I know there‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù answer here necessarily, but i am looking for some perspective.

Details:

Who: Unmarried, long-term committed couple, renting

Annual pretax income: $210k (can fluctuate 20% up or down due to commission)

Cash on hand: $110k (not including retirement)

Debt: $5k on a car loan

Where: top tier housing market in a major city. Record prices and increasing rapidly

Current monthly expenses: $4,500

We have enough currently for ~10% down plus closing/moving expenses while keeping 4-5 months savings as emergency funds. Because we are able to aggressively save we expect to have enough for close to a ~20% down payment by end of year (thus avoiding PMI).Primary income earner‚Äôs credit took a multiple hits years ago that are just starting to fall off due to time. Our market‚Äôs housing costs are also skyrocketing and are now in the top 5 in the US.

My question is, should we wait until we have a larger down payment which would could also mean we receive a slightly better interest rate due to improved credit scores? (Assuming rates stay this low which is a huge ‚Äúif‚Äù)

I‚Äôm weighing if the delay, which would reduce our buying power in a market like ours, outweighs not having to pay PMI by putting more down, which lowers our monthly payment.

Any feedback would be appreciated!",finance

Currently it's parked in my no-frills Wells Fargo Checking account I've had since I was 15 or so. The account type isn't even offered anymore; no interest rate on the account, and current Wells Fargo offerings have .01% interest. I have mixed feelings about Wells Fargo, I've tripped their security several times and unintentionally had my cards frozen.I use fidelity for all my retirement accounts, and I've been pretty happy with them.

Is it worth the trouble to look at parking it somewhere else, or are the interest rates so paltry it doesn't matter? Are there any credit implications of closing and moving a 20 year-old checking account?

There is a Preferred and Reserve version but it has an annual fee, I have the one that no longer exists that has no annual fee. I use it for everything as I get 1% back on all purchases and 2% on all dining, and over the last 14 years I have accumulated thousands of dollars in cash back. I usually take 1 international trip a year, but other than that I live a pretty cheap life in terms of spending habits.

I currently have a bank account with Navy Federal, USAA, Ally, Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Synchrony, but I guess with a credit card it may not be a requirement to have a bank account with them, but I would be fine opening a new account.

investing,Heuristics and Research for Speculative Investing,"I think many people have benefited from the stock market rally and may confuse luck with skill, however, I created a method that has been successful and I'm curious to how it could be stressed tested.

I read in another post that [https://whalewisdomalpha.com](https://whalewisdomalpha.com/) is a good way to research 13F filings to understand what institutional investors are doing. I was wondering if anyone has other references to trend or weigh what institutional investors are doing?

Below are a few of the main lessons that I've learned after losing money investing in biofuel stock when I was fresh out of college (2012). 

¬∑ Discovered over time, more success with index funds that individual stocks. Concede that index funds outperform managed funds and Institutional investors have more resources to outperform retail investors. Always dollar cost average into and out of investments.

¬∑ Disclaimer that this is for long term (5+ years holding) investors and that have at least 80% of their investments in uncorrelated highly ranked index funds. 

7 Steps to Finding High Alpha Stocks:

1. Research consumer and social psychology trends. Millennial‚Äôs interest in health and wellness, travel, finding new online services to more efficiently do work and are conscious of company‚Äôs impact on the environment.

2. Research economic trends like spending habits and interest rates.  

3. Research top exclusive performing growth funds over time. Included a link in the description.

4. Identify similar holdings.

5. Learn about what the companies do and if that aligns with the consumer trends you identified in Step 1.

6. Identify which companies have the largest addressable market and competitive advantage (moat). (winner take all or winner take most)

7. Evaluate % Revenue Growth over last 3 years (demand), Price/Earnings, Value/EBITDA relative to other companies in the same sector.

**Optional:** Rebalance every quarter by taking approximately 20% from the winners and allocate to losers.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin as a threat to US global dominance...,"As I learn more about the amazing opportunities that something like bitcoin presents to the global economy, as well as things like increased individual sovereignty in general, I can't escape the nagging in my brain that says there's no way the powers that be in the United States, be it in the federal reserve or other government bodies, will allow bitcoin to disrupt the systems of power that they have built over many years and now weild. More specifically, the real threat of any potential currency dominating the global market besides the dollar would be catastrophic to US global dominance (perceived or otherwise). Basically, the way I see it, the US government and federal reserve have a serious vested interest in ensuring something like bitcoin fails, not prospers, so I'm curious if anyone has any insightful takes on what government intervention would look like in regards to bitcoin, or if anyone knows any good resources that exist out there to learn more about the possibilities of what may happen if the us government decides to view bitcoin as a real threat to it's power.

stocks,Advanced Micro Devices DD,"**TLDR: AMD has gained market share in every sector and is the market leader in Desktop CPU‚Äôs. Lisa Su can do no wrong. They will keep growing while Intel is stagnating for a least 2 years waiting on 7 nm processors. Nvidia is a monster and I hope the EU crushes their ARM deal. AMD is in a really good place to dominate the Desktop CPU sector, gain significant market share in laptops and servers, and take points off of Nvidia in GPU‚Äôs. AMD to $120 I think \*shrug**

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm just a college student who got bored and wanted to find the fastest way to through away my loans. GME afforded me that opportunity, so now I‚Äôm going to try my hand at making money. Or at least analysis. I‚Äôve been following AMD since they released Ryzen Gen 2. Intel had been sitting comfortable in the throne, barely improving chips (how long did they use 10 nm nodes lol?) each generation and hoarding cash because they didn‚Äôt have a competitor. Ryzen 2 changed that, Ryzen 3 made AMD the market leader, and I believe Ryzen 4 will solidify it. The difference is even though AMD is at the top, they haven‚Äôt slowed down improving their product. Intel got complacent and now they‚Äôre paying for it. Pigs.

Fundamentals:

EPS: 20.7

Market Capital: 113.6 Billion

Profit Margin: 25.5%

Operating Margin: 14.02%

Revenue: 9.763 Billion

Total Debt: 572 Million

Free Cash Flow: 777 Million

Let's start off with the easy part. AMD is raking in money. Their margins are growing and their finally feeling comfortable. At the beginning of 2016 AMD's already meager revenue was down 20% to 4.3 Billion, Intel controlled 82% of the CPU market, and Nvidia controlled near 80% of the GPU market. Fast forward to 2021, their revenue for 2020 is 9.8 billion and AMD controls 50.8% of the CPU [market](https://macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/revenue). Which is more than Intel if you can't do math. That's a remarkable turnaround, and I think the trend will continue. There's still nobody who wants their gpu's, but that's okay. CPU's are their forte, GPU's are just extra cash. For the most part I will compare AMD, INTC, and NVDA because those two are AMD‚Äôs biggest competitors. I‚Äôll start with P/E, it goes Intel last w/ 12.5, AMD middle at 45.5, and Nvidia way ahead at 132. No one has been able to challenge Nvda for Market leader in something like two and a half decades, so this is not surprising. However, AMD‚Äôs revenue has increased 45% in the last year compared to Nvda‚Äôs going down nearly 7%. Intel‚Äôs margin is still slightly higher at 55% and AMD at 45, but AMD just began pricing at a higher cost than Intel, so I expect that to change. There is a large discrepancy in the P/B ratio: INTC at 2.36%, NVDA at 12.56% and coming in at the top, AMD at 19.05%. However, we are in a historic bull run, and [Jerome Powell](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00n6xPgB2VSYgvh3QW6B6IjOz0sUQ:1613338536956&amp;q=Jerome+Powell&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3yIo3LjK1fMRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uJC08Sxi5fVKLcrPTVUIyC9PzckBAK_YEhRWAAAA) said don‚Äôt worry about the interest rates, so I won't. Every stock looks overvalued, yet they keep going up, so I think AMD is still undervalued relatively. They beat earning predictions by 10% last quarter, and projected that they grow by 37% vs the consensus of 27% this year. AMD has a measly 113 Billion market cap contrasted to 250 billion for Intel and 370 billion for Nvidia. Yet AMD is still taking market share away in both the CPU and GPU sector. Every time I‚Äôve bet against Elon Musk or Lisa Su I‚Äôve lost, so now I‚Äôll ride her coattail to $110. The stock has been flirting with the all-time high for the last week, and I think it‚Äôll jump to $110ish, retreat back to high 90‚Äôs, then climb back to $120 where it will settle. Let's go over the good and bad. In 2016

We all know about the supply issues. It's a widespread issue and no one knows really when it will end. One good sign is Biden committed to signing an executive order to conduct a supply chain review and develop a long-term strategy to avoid future shortages. I‚Äôm not sure if it will have any tangible short-term effects on either the stock price, or the supply but I do believe it will increase investor confidence. If the government backs it, it literally can‚Äôt go tits up. (To be clear, the government is backing the semiconductor supply chain, not AMD. They could go tits up, but I really doubt it.) Another good sign was at the CES keynote, Lisa Su said they‚Äôre expecting ‚Äútightness in the first half of the year,‚Äù meaning supply will be back to normal in the second half of the year? But take this with a grain of salt because back in early 2020, she said supply would be back to normal by Q4 2020. It‚Äôs entirely possible supply will return since covid is receding everywhere except the US. There‚Äôs a lot of money on the table right now for whoever can get hardware out. She also said they‚Äôre investing in new facilities to avoid this problem so hopefully between the new factories and government intervention their supply chain will be future proof for a while.

I‚Äôm not sure where what paragraph to talk about this under, so it‚Äôs getting its own. Up until their exemption expired two months ago, AMD was paying 7% tariff rates on certain good from China that most other people had to pay 25%. Biden didn‚Äôt extend the discount and he hasn‚Äôt committed to repealing or leaving the taxes in place. This will impact their margins significantly.

I think the supply issues are overplayed. Obviously it‚Äôs a large issue, but it‚Äôs not entirely because the supply has gone dry. There was a perfect storm in 2020 between COVID, the PS5, Xbox, AMD/Nvidia GPU‚Äôs, Intel/AMD CPU‚Äôs, automobile manufacturers, and the tech industry booming. Covid added on to that. Covid simultaneously caused a significant boom in demand for electronics and disrupted supply.

The Semiconductor Industry Association said sales for semiconductors would rise 8.4 percent in 2021, which is 164% the growth rate in 2020 ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)). A notable jump when there were 433 billion semiconductors sold in 2020. I‚Äôll do the math for you. That‚Äôs 710 billion semiconductors being sold during a ‚Äòsupply shortage‚Äô this year. Imagine how many would have been sold if supply kept up with demand. Every device has multiple chips. Chips to control the display, manage power, operate connections, or pick up location. And demand is only going to skyrocket as more electronics/sensors are put into more things. On top of that, short supply is a better problem to have than exorbitant excess of quickly depreciating assets. Trying to guess how much of a product you need is tricky, then when companies realized there weren‚Äôt going to be enough semiconductors to go around they all tried to get theirs, and in turn increased the discrepancy between supply and demand. The last cause I felt worthwhile to put in here is the tariff war Trump had with China. Trump bared the biggest foundry in China from getting advanced chip manufacturing gear and barred US companies from dealing with them. This also decreased the supply of semiconductors substantially. China still may have an impact though, they announced that semiconductors will make up a substantial portion of its ‚ÄúMade in China 2025‚Äù plan. They are currently aiming to produce 70% of the conductors used in China, the majority through SMIC, and have backed their statements up with billions of dollars. However, they‚Äôre still far behind private companies though and SMIC has been successfully sued for intellectual property theft on two separate occasions, the first for $135 million, the second for 200 million, 8% of shares to TSMC with the option to obtain around 10% should they think about stealing again. So, I wouldn‚Äôt count on this. Should SMIC find a way to make 7nm chips while it‚Äôs still the standard, and get around US restrictions, they could provide relief to a thin supply chain right now and make a lot of money. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely it‚Äôll happen soon enough to take advantage of the shortage, but I‚Äôve learned to never count China out when it comes to making money. I‚Äôll keep it here because of the possible impact given they figure it out.

Let‚Äôs move on to AMD‚Äôs near Future. They just released new chips and GPUs in the second half on 2020, so I wouldn‚Äôt expect any largely impactful releases soon. I expect them to finish out their product line with midrange GPU‚Äôs/CPU‚Äôs. Meh, whatever. What I‚Äôm excited about is Zen 4.It was scheduled to release late 2021, and in December 2020 they said they were still on schedule, then early this year it changed to sometime in 2022. I expect it to be early 2022 based on leadership sticking to the late 2021 timeline up until Dec 2020, but this is pure speculation. Leaks have Zen 4 forty percent faster than Zen 3. It‚Äôll probably be closer to twenty-five percent, but I‚Äôm welcome to AMD surprising me. Even at twenty-five percent, Zen 4 will once again outclass anything Intel is putting out. Also, this will be the first release where AMD is already established as the market leader. Zen 2 let everyone know they were back, Zen 3 showed that it wasn‚Äôt a fluke, Zen 4 should cement that and farther sway market share. It‚Äôs being built on a 5 nm process node, something Intel hasn‚Äôt dreamed of yet. Intel will be outclassed for at least 2 years, likely closer to 5. They haven‚Äôt had to compete in so long they forgot what it was like. [Here](https://wccftech.com/amd-5nm-next-generation-zen-4-ryzen-epyc-cpus-to-feature-over-25-ipc-increase/) is a more detailed map of AMD‚Äôs releases in the next two ish years. A lot is unknown about Zen 4 now, but hopefully I‚Äôll make enough money from AMD to get one and I‚Äôll let y‚Äôall know how it is. They‚Äôve also bought Xilinx for $35 Billion. Xilinx is a market leader in chips with logic gates. They are entirely different from chips we are familiar with today. They can be altered after leaving the factory. People can use this to specialize their CPU for a task. This show where AMD thinks the future of processors is and by having the market leader in that sector, AMD is already ahead. Not much has been said outside of there being a merger.

AMD has some stiff competition. I‚Äôll focus on the CPU market then move to GPU‚Äôs, then smaller markets. There has been a shift toward ARM based processors recently: Apple M1, Qualcomm chips, Microsoft building one currently, and AMD had it in their plans but nothing else has been mentioned. They gave a window from 2017 ‚Äì 2022, so It didn‚Äôt seem that important to them. I don‚Äôt see this affecting them or forcing them to switch over. Lisa Su was asked about it and she believes the x86 is still the future, so I‚Äôll take her word for it. Who is Apple anyways? Anyways, arm powers the vast majority of mobile devices and high-powered embedded systems. Arm makes money selling the license to design chips based on their intellectual property. They have tech giants like Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Nvidia all paying for the right, it‚Äôs undisclosed how much they are paying though. Maybe if we all pool our money we‚Äôll have enough to partake in the fun. While not too important to AMD currently, it could be in the future. Nvidia announced they were buying ARM late 2020. If they succeed it will allow them not pay licensing fees anymore! In addition, they‚Äôre flirting with anti-competitive laws, aka a monopoly. All the companies currently leasing the ARM architecture are under strict guidelines restricting how much can be changes, and thereby restricting innovation. This hasn‚Äôt been a problem because everyone one had the sameish rules. Nvidia owning arm would give them control over those restrictions and handicap all other competitors. Should they desire to get into the smartphone market, they could innovate freely while restricting or just outright block others access to arm. Objections have been made based on anti-competitiveness by Qualcomm and Microsoft (lol). The deal is also being investigated by the UK, EU, and probably others. The US congress is on a well-deserved vacation for a while after doing nothing for the past 4 years so we‚Äôre sitting this one out it seems. Nvidia owning arm could have some scary repercussions. Since we‚Äôre focusing on AMD, if the deal goes through just assume AMD will have 0% market share in the mobile industry. Here‚Äôs some quick Nvidia DD, if deal = success: Buy.

On to Intel. According to [techspot](https://www.techspot.com/news/88507-intel-grabs-cpu-market-share-back-amd-first.html), AMD‚Äôs x86 market share fell from 20.1% to 19.3% even though the X86 market grew 20.1%. I attributed this to lack of supply. To back this up, consider Intel sales jumped the day after AMD said shortage will last at least several months.(10 minutes, maybe more!) I think people were waiting for AMD to resupply, then when they found out there wouldn‚Äôt be stock for a few months, they bought Intel. As a whole AMD‚Äôs market share declined .7% in Q4 but was up 6.2% for 2020. Now let's walk through what Intel‚Äôs up to. They got a new CEO finally. It was going to be another sears if that didn‚Äôt happen. Pat Gelsinger, the new CEO, seems pretty solid. I‚Äôm seeing comparisons to Steve Jobs returning to Apple. Pat didn‚Äôt start Intel, it‚Äôs not his child, so I don‚Äôt see how that works. But he could reinvigorate some life. He began as an Intel quality-control tech when he was 18. He got his bachelors from Santa Clara, then his masters from Stanford, all while moving up the ranks at Intel. Not bad. He ended up working at Intel for 30 years, which happens to be how long Intel will be using 10nm processors. Also he was the first ever Chief of Technology Officer for Intel from 2000-2005. I‚Äôm not sure what that is and I don‚Äôt have the energy to look, but most positions with a C in front are important, or at least well paid. He was the CEO for VMware up until a few days ago, and they seem to being doing well, current stock price of $145, no massive amounts of debt or anything. Nothing wild, stable growth. [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/patgelsinger?challengeId=AQEEh2JtIcpqrgAAAXei0TxLObNVwusIH5OQIEz5fQ0IhjxFtNNGjXVQUjKWuSrCf6Ys6H8bh0Apq1z-FXymHtqn4g3dC1A4Xg&amp;submissionId=611eae20-25c0-6316-847c-037cbaa1386a) is his LinkedIn if you want to check it out. He takes over Intel on the 15th of February (the day after I‚Äôm writing this). The stock went up 11% after the announcement came out, giving a necessary break from the constant stream of bad news out of Intel recently. Pat Gelsinger hasn‚Äôt said anything of his plans for Intel outside of ‚Äúmake better products‚Äù 4head. I‚Äôve read a few articles that claimed he would pretty much stick to Intel status quo, but I disagree. What‚Äôs interesting is he has been offered high positions by Intel between when he left and when he comes back tomorrow but he supposedly he turned them down because he couldn‚Äôt change things. Which goes directly against sticking to the status quo. Even still, he‚Äôs not God and he can‚Äôt make 7nm chips out of bread and water so while he might be the catalyst in an upward trend for Intel on the long long haul, they aren‚Äôt doing well now.

Intel plans to release their 11th-generation Rocket Lake Processors as early as mid-March (unconfirmed by Intel, subject to change). This seems positive as AMD can‚Äôt supply enough processors so ideally Intel fills this gap. Unfortunately, the chips still suck. Benchmarks have been leaked, [here](https://premiumbuilds.com/comparisons/intel-i9-11900k-vs-i9-10900k-vs-ryzen-9-5900x/) is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù comparison to AMD. I‚Äôll summarize for those that don‚Äôt want to read. Do your own research people, I could spout some bs right now and you wouldn‚Äôt know any better. Anyways, Intel‚Äôs best 11th gen is about 20% better than their best 10th gen if the benchmarks are to be trusted. I expect they‚Äôre cherry picking which specific CPU they‚Äôre benching and giving it every possible advantage. A lot of the system info given on the benchmark is blurred out. I suspect they blurred everything other than the speed, socket, and chip to hide that they blew their budget on their cpu and couldn‚Äôt afford a good gpu. Ta da, both me and Intel are using a 1070. (: If you scroll a little bit on the link above you‚Äôll see a ‚Äúgood‚Äù comparison to AMD‚Äôs last gen chips, I‚Äôve been writing for around five hours and can‚Äôt be bothered to summarize, to I‚Äôll just quote it.

Even when it comes to competing with AMD‚Äôs Ryzen 9 5900X, which is priced in the range of the i9-10900K, the i9-11900K is about 9% faster in single core speeds. Of course, the i9-11900K will severely lack in multi core speeds, as it is missing four cores and eight threads. Also, if the leaked clock speeds are to be trusted, the i9-11900K will have a significantly faster boost clock speed, reaching 5.3 GHz, versus the 4.8 GHz of the Ryzen 9 5900X. But if we are to compare the i9-11900K with a Ryzen CPU that has an equivalent number of cores and threads ‚Äì which in this case is the Ryzen 7 5800X ‚Äì we see that it has a 12% faster single-core speeds, and just about the same multi-core scores.‚Äù

I put quotations around good because this is bad. Intel‚Äôs next gen chips should not be competing with AMD‚Äôs last gen chips. To give an easier frame of reference, here‚Äôs an example of how next gen chips should measure up at minimum. I compared last gen i9-9900K (Intel's Best 9th gen chip released Oct 2018) vs Ryzen 7 1800X (AMD‚Äôs best 1‚Äôst gen Ryzen released March 2017) \*I‚Äôm ignoring the Threadripper line because they are targeted at a different, smaller audience. [Results](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-Ryzen-7-1800X-vs-Intel-i9-9900K/2966vs3334). As you can see, the i9 beats the 1800x in every category except thread/core count because Intel refuses to move into the future. And this is pretty much Intel‚Äôs best processer they will be releasing until 2023. Pat has stated that Intel is figuring out how to make 7nm chips much quicker now but what is he supposed to say? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how tf Bob Swan managed to lose this much market share in 2 years when Intel was so far ahead of AMD.‚Äù No, he needs to say something that inspires confidence in new leadership. When Bob Swan was Ceo 7nm chips were pushed back until 2023, and I‚Äôm not sure Pat has the power to advance a timeline that quickly. They‚Äôre taking a backseat until they cough up 7nm processors or tap a different market. To show how confident AMD is in their position, they priced chips above their intel counterpart after making Intel slash prices one-two years ago. They have the superior product and finally have the recognition to act like it. Intel has been relegated to the budge chip for a few years minimum. Because if you think Zen 4 won‚Äôt blow whatever Intel is about to release, you‚Äôre wrong. Intel will also be releasing Alder Lake in the 4th quarter of 2021. I couldn‚Äôt find any leaks or information about it but I assume it‚Äôll be 10nm just like the rest of their chips. For those that don‚Äôt know, the smaller you can make the processor the faster clock speeds you‚Äôll get, manufacturing cost go down, and quality improves. A quick example is: Say you have a wafer with 3 defects on it, but you can fit 100 processors on it, because they‚Äôre so small. You have 97 usable processors from this single wafer. While if you were Intel you could only fit one processor per wafer, and it‚Äôs unusable because there‚Äôs 3 defects on your processor. Exaggerated, but gets the point across I think.

One thing Intel has going for them is brand recognition. They were the market leader for more than a decade and did well to establish that. AMD was a great value brand. It will take a while for that sentiment to change, especially with those that don‚Äôt keep up with tech.

Last paragraph about Intel. I promise. Last fall Pat said if their factories can‚Äôt reliably deliver on processors, he‚Äôd consider outsourcing. The only suppliers realistically big enough for this are TSM or Samsung. TSM already makes chips for self-driving cars on behalf of Intel, so advantage TSM. I suspect circumstances have changed though because Pat Gelsinger stated during an earning call on 1/21/2021 that he was ‚Äúconfident the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally.‚Äù Given that they haven't started outsourcing, it‚Äôs possible. If they do outsource it was result in the loss of at least 30,000 jobs. I don‚Äôt know if they care about that though. Extra DD again, if the deal goes through, buy whoever gets it. Maybe buy TSM anyways. Bloomberg [reported](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-may-outsource-production-of-some-top-chips-to-samsung-tsmc-report) that Intel was in discussions w/ both companies to outsource products starting 2023. (I don‚Äôt' have a Bloomberg subscription, so I‚Äôm taking crn‚Äôs word for it.) Additionally, Intel was awarded a huge defense contract by the US government. Whoever managed that should get a raise. They‚Äôve also entered a three-year collaboration with Sandia National Labs to fight nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Not sure if that‚Äôll make them money or what.

The server market represents a lot of potential for AMD. Intel dominates the market with like 90% market share, but amd‚Äôs share increased from 5% to 8% in 2019 and is double digits in midway through 2020. This is the most recent accurate data I could [find](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/16/amd-is-about-to-double-down-on-a-huge-opportunity/). Their current market share doesn‚Äôt matter anyways. It‚Äôs not about where they‚Äôre at right now, it‚Äôs about where Lisa Su is going to take them. AMD showcased their 3rd gen server processors named ‚ÄúMilan‚Äù by pitching them in a weather prediction simulation against Intel‚Äôs Xeon Gold 6258R. The Milan was 68% faster in single-socket performance and 46% faster in dual socket. Now, I know, I know. ‚ÄúWtf you just bitched about Intel comparing their top-of-the-line next gen cpu with old hardware. Yes I did. I think this is different because AMD blew them out of the water. The presentation was given by AMD, so everything was hand-picked in their favor, but it‚Äôs still impressive. If you‚Äôre skeptical about it, good. Wait until Intel releases their server chip and see how the two compare. But guess what. The Milan is based on a 7 nm node. It was pitted against a 14 nm node, and Intel‚Äôs new server cpu will be ‚Ä¶.......10 nm. Morons. If they can take away a significant portion of the server, Intel could start to lose their hold as the staple processor. Who knows what will happen then? Rain upwards? Walk on your hands? Me passing CS? Doubt it.

We can run though laptops quickly. AMD is releasing their 4000 series sometime this year, hopefully it‚Äôll be good. Intel is still entrenched in this market and they have a lot of support from people like Dell and HP who keep putting overpriced underperforming Intel chips in their best computers and limiting AMD processors w/ weaker hardware. But again, AMD market share here went up 10%, so we might be seeing the shift happen. I looked up the best laptops to buy because that what I imagine people who don‚Äôt understand tech do. The top 3 on nearly all websites are Mac‚Äôs or Intel driven. I think that just shows mainstream sentiment hasn‚Äôt changed much. Or maybe I was looking up all my Intel data before then, so then they recommended all Intel. The mobile market followed a similar trend, just imagine everywhere I put laptops it says mobile.

Lastly, the graphics card market. Their 10-K doesn‚Äôt say a lot about it or what they plan to do. Just that they are competing with Nvidia, Intel is developing their own high-end gpus. Of topic, but both Nvidia and Intel are trying to break into each other's respective markets. Nothing serious has come out about Intel‚Äôs GPU‚Äôs so I can‚Äôt tell you much about that. Nvidia is the market leader, there is no question in this market. AMD was in the same position vs Intel five years ago, so it‚Äôs possible, but hard. Intel slowed down innovating, Nvidia has not. AMD cards also have a bad reputation of being buggy and having bad drivers. Nvidia has a nice program in Gforce and GSync. I don‚Äôt see AMD leading this market unless Nvidia hands it to them. However, they have a few things going for them. Competition is good for the industry and I think people realize that after Intel didn't innovate until they were forced to. There's also a large entry barrier, so it's unlikely they'll have to compete with anyone outside of Nvidia and Intel. And I'd give Intel at least a few generations to work out the kinks. It ends up being Nvidia vs AMD for a few years minimum and I believe AMD will take some market share. Not lead, but hold their own.

Consoles were a big win for AMD in 2020. They won contracts to provide chips for both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Sales between the two equate to 9-10 billion dollars. However, both console sales have been trending down while Switch sales have been trending up for the past three [years](https://www.vgchartz.com/article/442352/switch-vs-ps4-vs-xbox-one-global-lifetime-salesjanuary-2020/). Particularly the Xbox. I‚Äôve the argument that as consoles catch up to PC performance they will take market share [away](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/290387-report-20-million-pc-gamers-could-switch-to-consoles-by-2022). I don‚Äôt agree with this analysis but I put it in here so you can choose for yourself. My reasoning is:

1. Cross play is becoming common, don‚Äôt have to get a console to play w/ console friends,
2. PC has a higher entry barrier usually, but last longer, and can upgrade one or two things at a time for a few hundred dollars instead of getting an entire new system
3. Not that many must-have exclusives anymore (Microsoft punching the air right now)
4. I‚Äôm not sure how the Switch fits in, Nintendo is always a wild card to me. Also, the KFC console hasn‚Äôt set a release date, but if it does drop I can see the market shifting on its head and going 100% toward KFC. It will be powered by Intel. I‚Äôm not actually sure I would want my brand associated with KFC, but Intel didn‚Äôt ask me for some reason. That sounds like something a 60 year old guy names Bob Swan would do.

In conclusion, I think AMD will be the market leader in CPU‚Äôs for at least 8 years. I think their stock will keep bouncing for a while until the supply squeeze goes away, then earning will come out, Intel will be broke, and AMD will laugh all the way to the bank. There are a few big ifs, the supply chain being fixed, the ARM deal, and figuring out what Intel's new CEO is up to.

if you read all this way I‚Äôm impressed. You are very dedicated and I appreciate you because I don‚Äôt have anyone else to share all my research with. My roommates eyes glaze over after 30 seconds. It might not flow very well because it was all bullet points before hand. I've put all the sources I could find again in here. I'd love to hear anything I didn't bring up, or contest my points. It's all imaginary money anyways.

Last week, Nigeria‚Äôs central bank (CBN) [ordered banks](https://www.coindesk.com/nigerias-central-bank-orders-banks-to-close-accounts-of-all-crypto-users) to close the accounts of cryptocurrency users. In response to the ensuing outcry, the CBN issued [a press statement](https://www.coindesk.com/nigerian-central-bank-says-its-ban-on-crypto-accounts-is-nothing-new) reminding the public that the rule was not new, and that it was for their own good.

The notable thing here is that the CBN felt the need to respond to social protest. This is possibly because of the still-fresh memory of the [\#EndSARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_SARS) movement which rocked the country late last year, in which mass protests combined with global online support [achieved the dissolution](https://www.ft.com/content/558ef7b0-1c21-4726-bfd1-4a9af57f093f) of a federal police unit with a reputation for fierce brutality.

This week, a court ordered the CBN [to unblock the accounts](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/11/africa/nigeria-protests-acounts-unblocked-intl/index.html) of 20 people who had been involved in the movement. The fact that the accounts were [frozen in the first place](https://nairametrics.com/2020/07/16/explained-cbns-powers-to-seize-bank-account-of-criminals/) is one of the many reasons seizure-resistant cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining in popularity amongst Nigeria‚Äôs young.

Another reason is the country‚Äôs reputation as [Africa‚Äôs ‚ÄúSilicon Valley.‚Äù](https://www.ft.com/content/3382e58e-c32d-11e8-84cd-9e601db069b8) Lagos is the largest city in the continent, with a [rapidly growing](https://www.ft.com/content/3382e58e-c32d-11e8-84cd-9e601db069b8) [tech community](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/04/africa/marketplace-africa-facebook-nunu-ntshingila-spc-intl/index.html). It is also a country with inflation of [over 12%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/383132/inflation-rate-in-nigeria/) and almost [30% unemployment](https://qz.com/africa/1892237/nigerias-unemployment-rate-tripled-in-five-years/), where the young account for [70% of the workforce](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/12/nigeria-endsars-police-brutality-protest/) and where trading crypto assets is a [way of life](https://www.coindesk.com/trading-bitcoin-escaping-poverty-africa-nigeria) for many. A [report this week](https://www.statista.com/chart/18345/crypto-currency-adoption/) showed that almost a third of Nigerians say they own cryptocurrency, making it the most invested country in Statista‚Äôs Global Consumer Survey.¬†

The CBN‚Äôs actions are being presented on social media as a generational [call to arms](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeWantOurCryptoBack?src=hashtag_click) where the young, tech-savvy army has new tools in its arsenal and a deepening disrespect for institutions. Sound familiar?¬†

They‚Äôre also not giving up on crypto. Exchanges [such as Binance](https://www.coindesk.com/binance-suspends-deposits-in-nigeria-following-central-bank-directive) have been affected because local payment partners are no longer willing to deal with them due to the directive. But [sources confirm](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cant-be-stopped-nigerians-look-to-p2p-exchanges-after-crypto-ban) that trading is moving to peer-to-peer channels.

What‚Äôs more, the [\#EndSARS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/EndSARS?src=hashtag_click) movement [has not gone away](https://twitter.com/amnesty/status/1359085718333755394?s=20) even after its victory. It is now attacking what it sees as repression more broadly, and could end up uniting with the [\#WeWantOurCryptoBack](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeWantOurCryptoBack?src=hashtag_click) movement to push for ‚Äì and probably achieve ‚Äì radical change in Africa‚Äôs largest democracy.

The politicians have noticed. The Nigerian senate [has invited](https://www.coindesk.com/nigerias-senate-summons-central-bank-chief-to-explain-crypto-ban) the governor of the central bank and the director general of the securities regulator to testify on the matter, with one senator coming out as ‚Äú[strongly against](https://twitter.com/NGRSenate/status/1359835309643620357)‚Äù the ban.

Other countries thinking of banning [bitcoin (BTC, -0.37%)](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin) will no doubt be watching how this plays out. They will also be taking note that rules can make it harder to transact in cryptocurrencies, and could certainly dampen investor enthusiasm, but ‚Äì just as the Dogecoin community could not care less about what the network‚Äôs founders think ‚Äì they can‚Äôt make it go away.",cryptocurrency

investing,Weighting asset allocations based on future withdrawal tax rates,"I've read a decent amount recently about spreading assets between tax advantaged and taxable accounts.

My question: Is it reasonable to factor in future tax  rates at withdrawal to weight assets in accounts when setting asset allocations?

For example: Say I have 100k in my 401k and 50K in my Roth IRA. I expect my total tax rate in retirement (federal and state) to be about 20%. Normally, if I were doing a 60/40 stock/bond split, I might do a 40 stock/60 bond split in the 401k, and a full 50k in stocks in the Roth. However, only 80% of the money in the 401k will actually be mine (because of future 20% tax rate), so to achieve a full 60/40 split I should instead do a 35/65 split in the 401k. Math below:
401k: 100k in assets * 80% actual withdrawal, real assets are 80k
Roth: 50k, with no taxes at withdrawal, so full 50k
80k + 50k = 130k real assets. 40%*130k = 52k in bonds. To hold in 401k, divide by 80% to get actual allocation of 65k bonds in 401k.

The above is intended to eliminate accidental real overweighting to asset categories that are held in accounts with lower tax withdrawal rates, and ensure the desired allocation is reflected in reality.

Please feel free to ask any clarification questions, as I'm sure I've laid this out in a pretty confusing way. I realize the impact may not be huge, but I'd like to understand if I'm completely wrong to be looking at things this way.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"No, there won't be a crypto crash ala 2018, (valuations vs equities)","Too many paper handed bitches here, you'll deeply regret if you miss the current rocket.

Let's compare crypto valuations vs equities, like paypal for example.

Paypal serves a similar subset of purposes like most cryptos which is facilitating cross border value transfer.

PYPL metrics in 01/15/18 :

MarketCap : 99B, Revenue   : 13.8B

PYPL metrics in 02/15/21 :

MarketCap : 316B, Revenue   : 21B

So an increase of revenues by 52% corresponds to 319% increase in market cap

Compare with cryptos, 01/15/18

Total Market cap  : 717B, Total Volume	  :35B

02/15/21

Total Market Cap : 1.45T, Total Volume     : 190B

Here an increase of 542% in trading volume only corresponds with 202% increase in market cap

See the difference ? So no crypto hasn't gone up relative to tech equities, it is merely starting to recover to past levels vs the FED's balance sheet. I laugh when people get spooked seeing ETH at 200B Market cap, while ZOOM a company that loses money, has no moat and doomed to oblivion when GOOG and FB finish copying it feature set is valued at 126B, with P/E ratio of 301. The point is every other asset class has inflated well BEFORE crypto started it's run.

There won't be any crash whatsoever  in all asset classes for years to come(except for highly volatile commodities like Natural Gas and Softs), our Central Bankers overlord will make sure of it. Wild price swings will be heavily mitigated and controlled by interest policy and direct bond buying.

My Target for next 3 months, as % of total market cap

BTC : 50%

ETH : 30%

Defi : 10%

Economics,Fed Risks Financial Stability To Redefine Employment Mandate,,finance
dogecoin,Dogecoin is a currency backed by Physics... if we want it to be.,"**TLDR; Energy is the core commodity in the economy, and Dogecoin is the ideal currency to serve as its medium of exchange. It offers a means to decentralize the value in capturing and storing energy, and of truly creating an economy dependent on a tangible physical resource - energy.**

**Intro:**

Ok this is going to be a long one... and it's going to go all over the place, but I guarantee, it will make sense in the end. ***Full disclosure***: I'm a hodler of much doge; I hodl about 4 of my paychecks worth, so yes, a decent amount for me, but not so much that it'll cut deep if dogecoin falls into the abyss. I'm in it for the long term, and as you read, you'll realize I believe in the ""REALLY long term"". Also, I'm a trained physicist, and the crypto world has fascinated me ever since it first arrived. It has sparked ideas in me of connecting economics into something tangible in the physical world in ways I never thought of before. So hear me out...

**Energy and Civilization**

Folks who have heard of the Kardashev scale, know it as a system to categorize civilizations by their ability to capture, store and utilize energy. Mostly applied to the topic of planetary, multi-planetary or galactic civilizations. Type I being those who can capture energy at a planetary scale, Type II being those at the star-system scale, and Type III the galactic scale.

Humans are barely a Type I civilization as we're only now learning to efficiently harness the biggest energy source we have access to -- namely the sun. (Papa Elon: ""The Big Fusion Reactor in the Sky""). But we've been using it for millennia, just in very different and inefficient ways. A brief tour of our solar energy use:

*Pre-agriculture*: We ate animals who ate plants, who had devised ways to convert solar energy into sugars (energy) and other materials we need. So, basic human needs were met indirectly by solar energy.

*Agriculture*: Large scale farming of plant-based solar energy storage. We utilized the seasonal water cycle, like river flooding and monsoons, to scale up indirect solar energy consumption. The water cycle also ultimately being powered by the sun's energy.

*Industrial*: Coal, Oil, and Natural gas. This is basically, solar energy converted millions of years ago by animals and plants into organics. With a little help from Earth's geology, this energy was trapped and converted into a form that we'd eventually figure out how to use. To move things faster (steam engine), sail faster (coal, internal combustion engine), fly (jet engines), and even go into orbit. Ultimately still all solar energy.

*Modern*: SolarPV, Hydroelectric, Tidal, Wind farms (and Nuclear/geothermal). Except for nuclear/geothermal everything else is solar. Nuclear and geothermal, you could argue comes from other suns, since all fissile sources for nuclear reactors, or the isotopes that heat the interior of the earth formed in Supernova shock waves that seeded the interstellar cloud out of which our solar system formed. Hydro, Tidal, and Wind are just ways of extracting the energy injected by the sun into our atmosphere and hydrosphere that drive weather cycles. And solar PV is basically solar energy extraction, nothing fancy there.

I hope I've made the point that the economy ***is energy***. It has always been energy, and it will always be energy. Everything we do, as living, breathing, sentient, creative, emotional creatures, is converting energy to make life worth living. Entertainment, luxury, art, music, culture etc... all important things, are basically the lush surface layer of the human endeavor to transform our sun's (and the universe's) energy. The engine of our economy is energy. That's just physics.

**Decentralized Currency Tied to Energy**

So what's dogecoin got to do with this?

At least since agricultural times, economies have been controlled by central authorities. Kings issued coinage, often based on a precious stable commodity they controlled, like gold or silver. Thus we had the gold-standard. Bags of grain/food (our biochemical energy source) were exchanged with a value tied to these precious commodities that the Kings/Central authorities controlled and that the people agreed had value (or were forced to agree to at the tip of a sword). All the while we never realized that it was the grain/food that contained the actual value, and the gold was just a means to control and manipulate the productive output of the people, in exchange for security and stability (mostly). This system basically didn't change until we were about 80-100 years into the industrial revolution, and the gold standard basically showed its weakness when the European economies had to fund their war efforts. And they realized that it takes A LOT of energy to run your wars. Exchanging a locked-in commodity, with a more-or-less fixed supply was not great when you had to spend rapidly on war.

The end of the gold-standard saw the rise of the post-war era system of ""fiat"" currency, where the currency isn't really tied to any single commodity. But in reality, the currency is still in full control by a central authority, who can issue and hoard it at will, thus driving its value up or down at their whim. But in addition to this seemingly untethered currency, it is also an unsaid agreement between the various governments that we're in the era of OIL. No surprises, our current dominant proxy for economic health is the dominant means of consumption energy. The oil crash of 1976 and the slump from the second Iraq war are just more proof that the economy is pretty much an energy economy when a precious metal standard is removed. The problem is that central authorities still control how currency is valued, and how it relates to energy prices.

This is where dogecoin comes in. When we spend or earn USD (or any other currency), we are implicitly agreeing that ""*yes, I agree, with you oh great \[BLANK\], X commodity is worth Y currency*"".

BLANK = &lt;insert name of king&gt;, &lt;your central bank&gt;, &lt;your federal authority&gt;, &lt;your international coaliation of oil producing exporting countries&gt; etc...

So, nothing has changed since the bloody f\*\*\*\*n bronze age. Crypto, in general, offers us a way to break out of this ancient system of manipulation, and adopt a method that allows us, the people, to decide ""1DOGE = 1DOGE"". And here is the key part, 1 DOGE = A reasonable unit of energy captured.

The people deciding that 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE simply depends on more adoption of dogecoin for transactions, and purchase of goods. In addition to people simply buying and hodling the coin, we must scream from the hilltops that more businesses, retailers, simply start accepting this as a valid transaction. That's it.

Great! Screw the central authorities we'll go crypto! So why dogecoin and not something like BTC?

Well, the answer is simple, and it's the slowly increasing supply of dogecoin and energy capture. Folks have been scaring shibes and newbie doge adopters by talking about the inflationary demon that will apparently devalue the currency. This is a fallacy, and I wrote about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lgqy7j/dogecoin_really_is_the_peoples_crypto_tldr_but/).

BTC with its cap of 21M coins is akin to a limited commodity... sort of like a precious metal like gold, or oil. Once we get closer to mining or extracting everything it'll become harder and harder to find more, and eventually, it'll all be gone. We'll basically enter a closed economy, where those with control over the standard commodity set the rules and growth will fail -- sort of like what we saw in the early twentieth century. It'll be the end of the gold standard all over again. What's worse, is that when the oil runs out it'll be an out and out collapse of our way of life unless we adopt other methods of energy capture. Which in turn might very well make something like BTC utterly worthless as no new supply arrives, and the key energy commodity, which provides utility, is scarce or absent.

This is where Dogecoin's fixed, yet slowly increasing supply is better. It is actually aligned with the fact that the Energy we receive on earth is not fixed and is ever-present (at least for another 5 billion years). The sun isn't going to stop shining. We're not going to get worse (hopefully) at extracting energy from wind, and hydro, or tidal. All signs are that we'll use less and less oil and switch to a more electrified energy expenditure system, and thus making the link between the sun and our way of life much more direct. So it makes total sense that the currency we'd use in such a future world ought to reflect the ever-present supply of new solar energy, by having an ever-present supply of new coins.

At the current extraction rates, we receive about 4380kWh per year, with today's efficient we can extract [300-400 kWh per year](https://www.quora.com/How-many-kWh-will-1-sq-meter-of-solar-panel-produce-in-1-year) on a square meter of the surface of the planet. Think about that, there is 300 kWh per year just appearing for free for the rest of eternity. And this is just assuming current efficiencies for extracting energy. For comparison, the average US resident consumes 11,000 kWh per year, and would require just 37 Square-meters (400 sq-ft) of solar panels to fund. So that's a small yard of solar panels to support, arguably the most expensive lifestyle on the planet today, with current technology. The sun gifts us everyday. (George Carlin: ""I've begun worshipping the sun for a number of reasons... It's there for me everyday"").

So what is wrong with 5B dogecoin being added every year? Nothing! I feel this is a proxy for our annual gift of energy from the sun, and will simply let us do more as a species. The sun adds 4380kWh on every square meter on Earth every year, and we add 5B dogecoins every year. Boom! an economy backed by the purest energy source we have, with a built-in increment for value-added. It is simply up to us as a species to find better ways to access and distribute that value.

If anything this is a system that makes total sense. A lot more sense than capped coins, and definitely more than precious metals and limited fossil fuels.

**Call to Action**

Our mission is simple, we work to solve the issues with doge, which basically boil down to:

(1) Getting the whales to dilute their share and spur growth by making more doge available for your average investor. This will counter-intuitively lead to more profits for them. The whales are sort of like CEOs/Founders at IPOs, they have the early adopter advantage, being the folks who started something, and fueled its early rise. However, after IPO, it makes little sense for them to hoard their stocks. Typically CEOs or companies, in general, sell periodically and improve the liquidity in the market for their stock, and this, in turn, spurs buying from a larger base who find value in it, which leads to price increases. This is what they should start doing.

(2) Campaign like hell to increase dogecoin adoption in the everyday economy. Buying and Hodling isn't enough, we need to be able to spend it as well. Start accepting doge at your businesses, patronize more places that accept doge. Convince everyone you know to own a little bit of doge. $1, $5, $10 whatever makes sense for them. And when the momentum gathers on everyday use, there will be no stopping this juggernaut.

(3) Remember what we're creating here, a currency standard that makes sense from the point of view of the G-dDamn universe we live in, by tying it to how our civilization captures and consumes energy. The dogecoin system makes the best sense. There is no better crypto (decentralized), that reflects this paradigm (constant and ever-improving energy supply) than dogecoin.

Check the Web address. Just because the address looks OK, don't assume you're on a legitimate site. Look in your browser's URL bar for these signs that you may be on a phishing site:¬†

Incorrect company name. Often the web address of a phishing site looks correct but actually contains a common misspelling of the company name or a character or symbol before or after the company name. Look for tricks such as substituting the number ""1"" for the letter ""i"" in a Web address (for example, www.b1nance.com instead of www.binace.com).


2. Privacy. 
-------------------
The next thing I want to talk about is privacy. 
I know most people wants to brag about how much they have made in crypto. But it's your death warrant you are signing. 
Don't disclose how much you have made in crypto or else you will be a target for people to scam you. 
In real world do you see people walking about with millions of dollars and telling everybody ""hey watch this bag, it's full of money. I have 1 million dollars in this bag"" . 
Becareful, don't expose your investment online any how. 


Hope this is helpful.

CryptoCurrency,Another great way to earn passive income on your crypto...,"I read a post on the front page about how to earn passive income on your crypto.  

One of the best ways is with the Voyager app (investvoyager.com).  

You don't have to stake anything or lock up your tokens, you simply have to hold the tokens on their app.  

They release monthly interest rates and the VGX token (the token of the app) gives you boosts to those rates the more you hold.  

So when the VLP drops you could earn:  

9.75% on USDC  
6.75% on BTC  
5.25% on ETH  
7% on VGX  
4.25% on ADA  

And loads more. They support over 55 cryptos and the Voyager token does loads more than just boost interest. You get cash back every time you buy and sell, cashback on the Voyager debit card and lots of other perks too.  

It's an absolute no brainer for me, especially as you can buy and sell the tokens whenever you want, they're not locked for any period of time.  

Hope this helps some of you!",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Basic Guide to Defi,"I saw the post [yesterday](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lk2rtw/the_ultimate_guide_to_earning_passive_income_with/) about some basics in crypto, but also saw people mentioning in the comments about how they were missing a few good points like yield and liquidity farming. I just wanted to make a small TLDR of stuff

#**Terms ^In ^no ^specific ^order**
**Liquidity Pools (LP)** --&gt; LP  are used to enable traders to transfer funds from one coin to another in a decentralized way. Generally speaking, one would put 2 or more coins into a pool contract where it will collect a small percent of fees spent from transitioning from 1 coin to another. An example would be, if I wanted to trade between Ethereum and Dai, I would be putting in my Ethereum and pulling out some Dai from the pool, minus a small percentage that goes to the people who are supplying liquidity to the pool

**Automated Market Makers (AMM)**--&gt;Most DEFI applications run on an AMM . These are any application where people interact with smart contracts instead of interacting with a centralized company. An exchange like Binance matches buyers and sellers to make a trade, while Uniswap uses their liquidity pools  

**Governance Tokens** --&gt;Because most DEFI applications, are well decentralized, they use a token as a form of voting power. If you own 5 UNI tokens, you have 5 votes power in the network. This allows for the community to decide the direction of the protocol instead of a central company managing it

**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** --&gt; For the same reason above. It allows a group of people to run an organization in a decentralized way where everything is open source that can be viewed\

**Oracles** --&gt; Oracles are third-party information service providers that send external real-world data to a blockchain protocol. Oracles can be decentralized and rely on numerous data sets, or centralized and controlled by a single entity

**Lending** --&gt; I don't believe there is a cool name for this, but to summarize. You stake your coins into a protocol which people can lend out from. You gain a portion of the interest they are paying to borrow your crypto (They are paying 10% interest to borrow and you gain 8%, with the remaining 2% going back to the protocol). These rates vary depending on multiple factors, such as volume, liquidity, volatility, etc.  This works in a trustless manner, because to do this, the borrower must deposit collateral to obtain a loan equal to a % of what they deposited. If they deposited 1000 USD in ETH, they may be only able borrow up to 750 DAI. If what they borrowed went up, their ratio may go down with the chance for their deposit to get liquidated as to protect the loaners.  While it seems silly at first to basically deposit 1000 USD to only receive 750 back, one could use it to hedge themselves, save money by not participating in a taxable event, or simply withdraw money from the crypto space without actually selling their investment. 


#**Liquidity Mining**
The short and dirty of liquidity mining is, by depositing a token, you gain more of the token back. This gain is either from participating in a LP and receiving the portion of the trading fees, loaning out your money to others and collecting the interest
#**Yield Mining/ Yield Farming**
Now this is more . . . complicated? The TLDR of it is by participating in a LP, you may get a token back showing your stake in the pool. You could then put THAT token into another LP, adding another layer to you providing liquidity. The best way would be to give an example. 

Say you first start off with 1000 Dai and you put it into Curve (an AMM). Depending on which pool you put it in, you will get a curve token back (for the sake of it, I'm using the Y pool so ima call it yCrv) while gaining APY (lets just say 10%). You then take the yCrv and could deposit it into yearn.finance, gaining another 10% APY. Finally, you could then supply liquidity on uniswap by putting your yearn tokens you got for depositing yCrv into a LP for another 10%. You have now leveraged your initial token 3 times across 3 different protocols for a bigger yield. 

Another form of this is simply getting governance tokens in addition to your APY reward. Example being Curve gives  10% APY for staking, but also gives you an additional 10% in Curves DAO or Governance token. 

#**Now for some DEFI Applications**^^^^Please ^^^^don't ^^^^be ^^^^mad ^^^^at ^^^^me ^^^^if ^^^^I ^^^^didn't ^^^^mention ^^^^your ^^^^favorite

**AMM** 

* Uniswap (UNI)--&gt; bread and butter. Trade this coin for that. Their LP are 50/50 split between 2 tokens

* Balancer (BAL)--&gt; Similar to uniswap, but their LP allow for up to 8 different tokens without requiring a 50/50 split

* Curve (CRV)--&gt; AMM that specializes in only stablecoins and provides incentive to trade the stable coin the pool is low on to self balance

* 1Inch (1INCH)--&gt; Another AMM, but they focus on aggregating the prices from all AMM to try and match you with the best one. *Tends to be uniswap or itself*

**Lending Protocols**

* Aave (AAVE, used to be called LEND)--&gt; Put coin in, get interest rate that varies

* Compound (COMP) --&gt; Same as above but less assets locked into protocol and less coins offering to be borrowed or loaned

* Oasis/Maker (MKR and DAI) --&gt; I put these both here because while they are different, they are run by the same organization. You can deposit any asset voted on by the maker DAO into a vault, and generate DAI from it, which is how DAI is able to maintain its stable price without being explicitly tied to USD. You can then pay back the DAI you borrowed to retrieve what you stored in the vault. 

#**Cool shit that I couldn't find somewhere else to put**

* Augur --&gt; It is betting. What it really is a prediction market. Someone could put a bet saying the weather will be 0 tomorrow and it would generate 2 tokens. A yes it is, or No it isn't. When the duration is over, the money staked from the loosing side will go to the wining side. You could also buy a bet and sell it because it is all tokenized. 
 
* Flash Loans --&gt; Out of everything on this list, I have NEVER touched this. The basic summary is you can borrow almost any amount of money without collateral, but it has to be returned in the same block. If I saw eth was worth 2k on Uniswap but 1950 on 1inch, I could borrow as much as I want to buy as much ETH from 1inch as I could, then sell it all on Uniswap for a 5% profit, then return the money back to the flash loan provider in the same transaction. Its cool, but I have not found opportunities to do it myself

* Nexus Mutual --&gt; Similar to Augur but more focused on ""Will x event happen"". You can buy insurance policies on certain events happening to cover X amount of crypto, and if that event happens, you will be payed out after a vote by their DAO. The cool thing about this, is you don't NEED to have whatever you are insuring. If you are insuring that the Curve contract will fail for 5 ETH, it doesn't matter if you never used Curve or not, you will still get your payout since you bought a policy. 

* PoolTogether --&gt; This is my literal favorite project and it is so small tiny and cute. You basically can buy lottery tickets with whatever pool currency is (1 ticket= 1 Dai), and you hope to win. But the great thing about this is **you cannot lose your money**. All of the winnings are generated by the interest gained from all the lottery tickets in the pool, so if you buy 1 ticket, that ticket remains in the pool until YOU take it out yourself, giving you a chance to win every single week. It is just a no loss lottery, great for gambling addicts like myself. 

* Synthetix --&gt; Synthetic assets on the blockchain. Their sGold token could give you exposure to the gold market without actually buying a traditional index for it

**Wallets cause I forgot until the end**

* Personally, I use argent because my friend got me on it and I don't feel like paying over 200 in gas to move all my holdings to another wallet, but its pretty nice with its built in DEFI features. 
* Another one I think is good is Math Wallet, which holds multiple chains and allows you to interact with DEFI applications not just on the ETH blockchain
* I use Zerion as a layer 2 to my wallet. I don't actually bother opening it that often unless I need to use walletconnect to initialize a connection to a DEFI application. Zerions interface is pretty nice and does the price tracking for you so you can see your gains and loss in different coins while also tracking historical trade prices you preformed. Anyone can check theirs now by using their addres or ENS

#**Closure**
None of this was financial advise. I have used every single application or term mentioned here (except flash loans), and my current holdings are as followed

* XOR, XRT, ETH, DIA, AKRO, RING, MKR, COMP, RWS
* Providing liquidity to the UNI/ETH pool on Uniswap
* Providing liquidity for UNI on Compound
* Providing liquidity from Curve on Yearn because I am poor and am not going to pay the gas fee to move it

#**BIG EDIT SIGN**
* By depositing collateral into a lending protocol so you can borrow, you are also GAINING APY on whatever you deposited. If you deposit ETH to withdraw DAI, you are gaining an APY on your ETH, while paying a APR on DAI
* While you may see there are high APR for borrowing, most lending protocols also allow users to accumulate governance tokens for borrowing, since they are taking part in the ecosystem. Using [Compounds Distribution] (https://compound.finance/governance/comp) as an example, users gain about 4% for either lending or borrowing back in the form of COMP governance tokens, which have their own value. Looking at from that perspective, loaning DAI will reward 10% APY with an additional 4% APY in the form of COMP, while borrowing will cost 13% APR, but 4% of their debt is returned to them in COMP",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Trying to understand filing with RSUs,"Hi there - I've tried searching around and reading but I'm still a bit confused.

I had 1 RSU vest last year, and same day sold-to-cover that 1 stock that vested.

Some taxes were withheld as the stock was sold for around 3k but only around 2k was deposited into my checking account.

I received a 1099-B from Fidelity that shows the ""proceeds"" section as 3,047.84, cost basis 0, and federal tax withheld as 0, so I'm assuming  my employer withheld the tax. My W-2 does not show any line items for this but from what I've read it is just added to my federal income tax withheld box in the W-2.

There is also a supplemental information form from fidelity that shows the RSU sale with proceeds as 3,047.84 and adjusted cost or other basis as 3,047.91 and then Adjusted Gain/Loss and -00.07 cents.

Does this mean when the stock vested, the value was 3047.91 and then by the time it sold the same day it was 7 cents lower? Do I need to fill anything out additional for this?

So far I've filled out the 1099-B form indicating the 3,047.84 from the share sold but I'm not sure if that's all I need to do. I'm confused because it's my understanding that the value of the stock at vest is taxed as ordinary income (then any gains from holding it is taxed as capital gains), but on the 1099-B this sale is labeled as Short-Term Realized Gains and I'm not sure how that's offset.

The federal reserve uses monetary, with limited effect, to prevent the economy from getting worse. Its believed these tools lower unemployment, and give the stock market confidence in the economy. But its pretty clear the Federal Reserve's monetary policies are no substitute for the actual structural changes needed to grow jobs and that is government spending and sound fiscal policy. Putting off real economic reforms and substituting them with transient monetary policy merely gives the Federal Reserve 'something to do' in order to justify its existence. It creates a situation where the federal reserve is seen as a necessity along with a for-profit banking system, when technology could easily replace every single banker in the country.",finance
personalfinance,TurboTax vs TaxSlayer,"I used TurboTax and it determined a federal refund of $2150 and state refund of $850. 
Same information inputted into TaxSlayer and now I'm getting a federal refund of $2210 and state of $835.  Very basic return: jointly filed, income from W2 and interest from a savings account. Deductions are student loan interest, mortgage interest, property tax, and a small donation. My wife and I also did not receive the last stimulus check ($1200 credit)

Looking at the summaries, TurboTax had more adjustments to income which lowered my AGI. TaxSlayer itemized my deductions ($25300) which lowered total taxes. 

TurboTax is less of a refund and costs $150 to file, but my priority is not being audited. What raises flags lower AGI or itemized deductions?

Who would you file with?

Edit: So TurboTax took my donations to charity and applied $300 towards adjustment to income instead of itemizing my charitable contribution and other deductions. I'm guessing it is just a glitch in the TurboTax program.",finance

I have 5 credit cards (never carry a balance on any), but the average age of the accounts is only about 3 years (oldest is 5 years).  FICO score is around 760, according to my BofA account.

Unfortunately we also have a number of debts.  Right now we are still paying:

CC refinance loans (850/mo, ending June next year) - these were from unhealthy spending habits we have fixed, mostly before I graduated and got my new job.


Car Loans - 650/mo ending in 3-5 years


Student Loans - 650/mo - 10 years still...

Rent - 2k/month.  This one hurts as we could downsize but it would mean adding to an already sizable commute for me or going to a less safe area.

I'm really not sure what to do right now financially.  Renting at this cost stings and seeing home prices soaring (up almost 20% per Redfin over the last year) and low interest rates makes us really want to try to get a house now.  Reasonable houses for us in this area look to be about 350k which would mean a similar overall rent if we put 5% down even with PMI... but doing this would wipe out our savings unless we tapped 401ks.

Right now we are saving about 1k/month and it will jump again once those cc loans fall off next year.

I think the original W2 I received via mail was that it was my specific division whose HQ was located different city, but obviously the new W2 states its parent company as employer. Again, both of their EIN is the same (The only difference is address part in Box C). 

In this case, do I need to say that new W2 is updated when approving W2? Because the new W2 does ***not*** have W2-C (to indicate it's updated)? 

My main concern is that since IRS receives the same 2 identical W2 from the employer, and will assume that I make twice of what I made, which is clearly wrong, (because they receive 2 W2 that has exactly the same wages and taxes except the box C about address).

personalfinance,Cost Analysis of 2 years at Community College,"**Introduction:**

Hi all, as I finish my associates degree at community college I thought it would be fun to break down my expenses over the last two years. Obviously some of the costs associated with my education have been altered by the pandemic, and I will attempt to note where this occurs.¬†

I started community college in fall of 2019 and will graduate with an associates degree for transfer in spring 2021. I did not receive any state or federal financial aid, but did participate in several school-specific programs that significantly reduced my expenses. I also recognize that I am in a position of privilege, because my parents pay for bills associated with me living at home throughout college. This breakdown will account for all major expenses associated with college from my first semester through the end of my (current) last semester.¬†

**Tuition:**

I am fortunate to be part of a scholarship program through my school that played for about 87% of my tuition expenses. This program required I maintained full time status, a gpa of 2.5+, and participated in school related events in exchange for greatly reduced tuition costs. I took a total of 70 units worth of classes over my two years at cc. Under the category of ‚Äútuition‚Äù I am including class costs, enrollment fees, and student services fees.¬†

Total Tuition Cost: $3359

Amount Paid for by Scholarship Program: -$2938

Amount I Payed: $421

**Books &amp; Supplies:**

A majority of my textbooks were bought used, or rented physically or digitally. In the case that I purchased a textbook and resold it after the class, I will be only counting the ‚Äúnet‚Äù price after resale. Some of my textbook costs were paid for by vouchers through my school bookstore. The most I ever paid for a textbook was $106.72, and the least was $4.42. I am also including online programs that I was required to purchase in this category. ‚ÄúSupplies‚Äù is a catch all term for scantrons, notebooks, pencils etc.¬†

Textbooks Cost: $880.02

Online Programs: $32.50

Supplies: $30

Amount Paid for with Book Vouchers: -$137.04

Amount I Payed: $805.48

**Transportation:**

This is where covid really changed things. For my first semester and part of my second semester at cc, I commuted to school. Since March of 2020 my school has been online and will continue to be through my graduation. While the expenses below reflect all school related transportation costs for 2 years of schooling, most of the expenses were accumulated the first 6 months. For simplicity's sake I am not going to count vehicle depreciation or maintenance. I drive a 25 year old car that is worth about $1000 and gets combined 20 mpg.¬†

Parking Permits: $112

Gas: $417.41

Covid Parking Refund: -$46

Amount I Payed: $483.41

**Other Expenses:**

I am privileged to be able to live at home with minimal expenses and no bills. Thus I do not have any college related living expenses. I also packed a lunch every day, so food expenses are also zero. I am choosing to disclude all living expenses from this breakdown because they are not directly related to my educational expenses.¬†¬†

**Refunds &amp; Scholarships:**

In addition to the various refunds included in categories above I received:

Covid Student Aid: $500

Scholarship Winnings: $500

**Conclusions:**¬†

**Tuition Expense ($421) + Books &amp; Supplies Expenses ($805.48)**

**+Transportation Expenses ($483.41) - Refunds &amp; Scholarships ($1000) = $709.88**

For a grand total of $709.88 out of pocket costs, I will receive an associates degree for transfer to a four year university. I am so grateful I made the decision to attend a cc, even though my high school grades were sufficient to attend a USC or UC for all four years. I experienced a great deal of pressure from friends, counsellors, teachers, and family to attend a four year university because I was ‚Äútoo smart‚Äù for community college. This was absolutely false, and I am completely satisfied with the quality of education I have received at cc. I hope that my perspective can help address the stigma surrounding community college, and highlight the economic benefits of attending cc.¬†

TLDR: Total cost for an associates degree at community college while living at home was $709.88. This includes tuition, books, and transportation but excludes living expenses. Some expenses were significantly reduced due to school aid and coronavirus. Community college for the win!",finance

btc,Mr. Musk: Will You Just Trade For Me?,"This was an interesting article from today  this morning;

Dear Mr. Musk,
I‚Äôve been wrong about a few things. Well, more than a few things if you consider my marriage and some of my career choices (look up¬†Bigger Like Me¬†and you‚Äôll see what I mean). But, for the purposes of this article, I‚Äôm going to narrow my trading follies to the realm of equities trading.
You see, I have had it all wrong all these years. Most of my stock picks have been predicated on silly things like P/E ratios and EBITDA and other anachronistic metrics to which I have hitherto stubbornly adhered.

But no more.

True, I have deviated from my financials-focused investing parameters in the past. In 2018, I jumped on the weed stock bandwagon. And like most investors, I got high on seeing the stock rise only to fall to new lows when reality struck. But as a fellow weed connoisseur, I ask you: Is this time different? Some say it‚Äôs 2018 all over again, when Bitcoin and cannabis enthusiasm drove weed stocks and the crypto to new heights before the crash. Cannabis¬†will never, become legal on the federal level, they say. Are they right? Should I avoid weed stocks? Or buy on the dip?
And what about Bitcoin? So far, I have made money on it. And DogeCoin? Are you joking or half-joking when you seem to endorse it? I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter. Either way, I will just trade on your tweets and disregard any analysis including from the top banks.¬† I mean, Snoop Dogg‚Äôs portfolio likely performed better than mine just based on Doge  alone.
How many times, after all, have you proved the naysayers wrong? How many short sellers have you buried in their own skepticism? Mr. Musk, I have recognized the error of my ways and I bow down to you.

personalfinance,Selling first home,"Single 25yo dude. No kids. No debt besides 10k for my vehicle at a good interest rate. 

I bought my first home cheap three years ago in an area that was primed to see heavy revitalization. I am now selling my home and stand to make approximately 65k all costs and taxes considered. 

My question is two parts, 

Where should I park this money in the interim period of me looking for the next good deal on a house?

Is it worth it to take a year or so living with parents on the cheap to save even more money towards the house / pay off my truck (last remaining debt) or is a 20% down payment (which I can afford) and a good interest rate (which I qualify for) really all I need to worry about?",finance
personalfinance,"I owe taxes for 2020, but IRS Calculator says I will have a giant refund for 2021, with no changes?","Hi PF, I didn‚Äôt see a pinned post about tax Q‚Äôs so I‚Äôll ask here, but please let me know if there‚Äôs a better place to ask. 

I owe money on my taxes this year, for the first time in my life. My AGI was $59k and I paid $5.5k, so I now owe $500. I understand that the W-4 changed this year, and I looked at the W-4 I filled out with my employer‚Äî it is indeed the new version, where I answered Q‚Äôs about dependents etc and it came out to all 0‚Äôs. 


So a few questions:

EDIT: I realized I made an error in the calculator by entering ALL my withholdings, not just my Fed Income Tax. HOWEVER, it says I will get a $340 return, which is more realistic but still leaves me wondering how I owe in 2020 but not in 2021.


1. I went to the IRS Tax withholding calculator and punched in my applicable numbers for 2021 estimates, thinking I should get a jump on changing my contributions so I don‚Äôt owe next year. According to the calculator (with information from my latest paycheck,) SEE EDIT (~~) I will pay ~$11k in taxes and receive a $5,000 refund in 2021, which sounds BONKERS, I do not want that. Is there anything unique policy-wise that would cause such a giant swing from owing $500 one year to receiving $5k the next, while nothing has changed? (~~)

2. Regarding this year: I only contributed $4k to my 401k this year‚Äî I was reading you can max out to $6000 before April to an IRA for 2020. If I make that extra $2k contribution, would it potentially lower how much I owe?",finance

What I am curious about is, how the COVID-19 recovery packages in developed countries, have led to increased foreign inflows in India?

Is it like counter-cyclical policies across the world has made it easier for investors to access cheap money and they find India a preferred investment haven? Also, interest rates across the world are much lower than that in India and maybe once the rates begin to rise, we may see a taper-tantrum of sorts in the emerging economies, like the one in 2013.

When I filed my taxes for that TY, I filed a Form 8606 (Non-deductible IRA) and indicated that I made the $3500 excess contribution.  I assume that by doing so, the IRS knows that I made a contribution in excess.

I just learned that I need to (should have already) contact the bank to let them know. This will count as a distribution of the $3500, correct?

1. Do I also need to file Form 5329 for TY2018 and a 1040-X?
2. I have earned some interest for the IRA - the interest rate is 0.5% so it may not be a whole lot, but I will need to pay tax on that interest, correct? Will the bank issue me a 1099 of some sort this year or is too late for them to send me something?
3. Do I need to do anything for my tax returns in 2019 or 2020? (I have not filed yet for 2020).
4. What penalties am I looking at here? The 10% early IRA distribution (I am under 59.5 years old)? The 6% excise tax for every year I didn't correct the excess contribution?

investing,Huge DD on Electric Last Mile Solutions. Only Class 1 EV in the US,"Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,   who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant   transposition of truck plans ready for production.

FIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV companies. So what  gives?

After doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite ‚Äì something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.

# I.  The Team

First,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.

‚Äã

&amp;#x200B;

***The Allstars*** ***-***

**James (Jim) Taylor** ‚Äì 35+ years experience ‚Äì CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company‚Äôs focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as ‚ÄúThe Great One‚Äù when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim ‚ÄúThe EV Man‚Äù Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.

**Jason Luo** ‚Äì 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company‚Äôs acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.

**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google‚Äôs automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers‚Äô new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called ‚ÄúHigh-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments‚Äù. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop ‚Äì one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.

**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company‚Äôs international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS‚Äôs IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.

**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.   Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving  company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign  from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an  employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!  Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go  to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help  with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on  board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).

**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs ‚Äì Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.

**David Boris ‚Äì**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being one company that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for  FIII.

‚Äã

***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***

***Jerry Hu***  ‚Äì 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**

***Justin Prann*** ‚Äì 15+ years ‚Äì CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.

***Kev Adjemian*** **‚Äì** 20+ years ‚Äì CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**

***Albert Li*** ‚Äì 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.

***Benjamin Wu***  ‚Äì 15+ years ‚Äì GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head for  Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&amp;A and international  corporate transactions for both  private and public companies.

So  as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent   connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and other   places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.

# II. What Does ELMS Do?

Now  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:

‚ñ™First and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.

‚ñ™Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production

‚ñ™Cars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later

‚ñ™Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1

‚ñ™Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China

Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note ‚Äì this is from December so it may have changed some since.

‚Äã

The  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.

A cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :

‚ñ™ \~25% reduction time from order to delivery

‚ñ™ One warranty single point of contact for customer

‚ñ™  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.

I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.

‚Äã

Next,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :

‚ñ™Productivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles

‚ñ™Optimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance

‚ñ™Compliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports

‚ñ™Expandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins

Some  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.

&amp;#x200B;

# III. Sales and Financials

The  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.

ELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.

The ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. ‚ÄúOur team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.‚Äù

I  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being ‚Äúcontingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.‚Äù As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.

‚Äã

‚Äã

**\*\*\*\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\*\*\***\*

*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas. And as a matter of fact, Pete Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.

*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County ‚Äì it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that ‚ÄúOne-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.‚Äù  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated ‚ÄúFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.‚Äù Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.

‚Äã

Speaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state‚Äôs   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company‚Äôs job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company‚Äôs planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.

Another  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, ‚ÄúRivian‚Äôs becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,‚Äù Taylor said.  ‚ÄúIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That‚Äôs really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \[U.S.  safety requirements\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. ‚ÄúComing  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,‚Äù Taylor said.  ‚ÄúSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.‚Äù  Well, that's a  bargain.

The institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:

‚ñ™Alpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.

‚ñ™BNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\~$20million) ‚ñ™Phoenix Holdings Ltd ‚Äì 1,103,741 shares (\~$12million)

‚ñ™Bank of America ‚Äì 70k shares (\~$1mill)

‚ñ™Toronto Dominion Bank ‚Äì 15k shares (\~$203k)

‚ñ™STA Wealth Management ‚Äì 13k shares (\~$176k)

‚ñ™UBS Group ‚Äì Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\~$200k)

We also have in the past month:

‚ñ™Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.

‚ñ™P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.

‚ñ™Gabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.

‚ñ™Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.

I  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.

As  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.

Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :

‚ñ™No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches

‚ñ™Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022

‚ñ™Estimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \~5% of U.S. Market

‚ñ™Revenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025

# IV. The Indiana Factory

‚Äã

Another **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says ‚ÄúELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.‚Äù The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.

Another  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production ‚Äì workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.

In  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world‚Äôs best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    ‚ÄúIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering ‚Äì from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  ‚Äì and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,‚Äù said  James Taylor.

ELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs‚ÄúELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.‚Äù

Did you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.

# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection

Ok,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.

**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**

This  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors!

One thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding ‚Äúbad reviews‚Äù from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.

Seres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.

**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**

Well,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.

# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?

The  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: ‚ÄúIs this a Chinese company or not?‚Äù

**The short and easy answer is NO.**

**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**

**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**

Sokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. ‚ÄúHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it‚Äôs  American,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \[Michigan\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I‚Äôd say  there‚Äôs a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúBut  after we‚Äôre finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we‚Äôre like  everybody else. I‚Äôm not sure we  can hang onto that price point.‚Äù  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.

# VII. Technical Analysis

Had  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.

&amp;#x200B;

# VIII. Conclusion

If  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing  new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this  looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and  seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out  the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but  they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.

Come, watch this tree grow with me, friend.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  1st and only Class 1 EV in the US with no competition. Has an  amazing  team and management. Has an EV kitted factory ready for  production by Q3  of this year in Indiana. Has 30,000 preorders already  and expects  30-60k more by next year. NOT a Chinese company, will just  be using  Sokon's already successful model and improving on it.",finance
stocks,Huge DD on Electric Last Mile Solutions. Only Class 1 EV in the US!,"Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,  who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant  transposition of truck plans ready for production.

FIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV companies. So what  gives?

After doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite ‚Äì something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.

# I.  The Team

First,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Allstars*** ***-***

**James (Jim) Taylor** ‚Äì 35+ years experience ‚Äì CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company‚Äôs focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as ‚ÄúThe Great One‚Äù when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim ‚ÄúThe EV Man‚Äù Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.

**Jason Luo** ‚Äì 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company‚Äôs acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.

**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google‚Äôs automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers‚Äô new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called ‚ÄúHigh-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments‚Äù. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop ‚Äì one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.

**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company‚Äôs international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS‚Äôs IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.

**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.   Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving  company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign  from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an  employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!  Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go  to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help  with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on  board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).

**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs ‚Äì Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.

**David Boris ‚Äì**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being one company that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for  FIII.

‚Äã

***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***

***Jerry Hu***  ‚Äì 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**

***Justin Prann*** ‚Äì 15+ years ‚Äì CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.

***Kev Adjemian*** **‚Äì** 20+ years ‚Äì CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**

***Albert Li*** ‚Äì 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.

***Benjamin Wu***  ‚Äì 15+ years ‚Äì GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head for  Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&amp;A and international  corporate transactions for both  private and public companies.

So  as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent   connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and other   places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.

# II. What Does ELMS Do?

Now  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:

‚ñ™First and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.

‚ñ™Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production

‚ñ™Cars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later

‚ñ™Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1

‚ñ™Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China

Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note ‚Äì this is from December so it may have changed some since.

‚Äã

The  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.

A cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :

‚ñ™ \~25% reduction time from order to delivery

‚ñ™ One warranty single point of contact for customer

‚ñ™  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.

I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.

‚Äã

Next,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :

‚ñ™Productivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles

‚ñ™Optimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance

‚ñ™Compliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports

‚ñ™Expandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins

Some  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.

&amp;#x200B;

# III. Sales and Financials

The  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.

ELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.

The ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. ‚ÄúOur team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.‚Äù

I  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being ‚Äúcontingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.‚Äù As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.

‚Äã

‚Äã

**\*\*\*\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\*\*\***\*

*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas. And as a matter of fact, Pete Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.

*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County ‚Äì it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that ‚ÄúOne-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.‚Äù  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated ‚ÄúFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.‚Äù Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.

‚Äã

Speaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state‚Äôs   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company‚Äôs job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company‚Äôs planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.

Another  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, ‚ÄúRivian‚Äôs becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,‚Äù Taylor said.  ‚ÄúIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That‚Äôs really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \[U.S.  safety requirements\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. ‚ÄúComing  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,‚Äù Taylor said.  ‚ÄúSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.‚Äù  Well, that's a  bargain.

The institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:

‚ñ™Alpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.

‚ñ™BNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\~$20million) ‚ñ™Phoenix Holdings Ltd ‚Äì 1,103,741 shares (\~$12million)

‚ñ™Bank of America ‚Äì 70k shares (\~$1mill)

‚ñ™Toronto Dominion Bank ‚Äì 15k shares (\~$203k)

‚ñ™STA Wealth Management ‚Äì 13k shares (\~$176k)

‚ñ™UBS Group ‚Äì Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\~$200k)

We also have in the past month:

‚ñ™Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.

‚ñ™P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.

‚ñ™Gabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.

‚ñ™Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.

I  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.

As  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.

Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :

‚ñ™No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches

‚ñ™Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022

‚ñ™Estimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \~5% of U.S. Market

‚ñ™Revenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025

# IV. The Indiana Factory

‚Äã

Another **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says ‚ÄúELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.‚Äù The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.

Another  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production ‚Äì workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.

In  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world‚Äôs best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    ‚ÄúIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering ‚Äì from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  ‚Äì and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,‚Äù said  James Taylor.

ELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs‚ÄúELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.‚Äù

Did you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.

# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection

Ok,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.

**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**

This  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors!

One thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding ‚Äúbad reviews‚Äù from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.

Seres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.

**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**

Well,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.

# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?

The  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: ‚ÄúIs this a Chinese company or not?‚Äù

**The short and easy answer is NO.**

**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**

**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**

Sokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. ‚ÄúHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it‚Äôs  American,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \[Michigan\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I‚Äôd say  there‚Äôs a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúBut  after we‚Äôre finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we‚Äôre like  everybody else. I‚Äôm not sure we  can hang onto that price point.‚Äù  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.

# VII. Technical Analysis

Had  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.

&amp;#x200B;

# VIII. Conclusion

If  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing  new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this  looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and  seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out  the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but  they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.

Come, watch this tree grow with me, friend.

personalfinance,Should I move my investments to a Roth 401k or 529?,"I am 30yo without near-term plans for a family. 

I make the maximum annual contribution possible to my 401k and HSA. Emergency fund is taken care. I don't penny pinch my monthly budget so I have more than enough to live comfortably and can go on a few vacations or make other &lt;1k purchases without much planning.

I have a sizeable 100+k student loan that I'm diligently paying off. Since the loan interest rates rates are low (between 1-3%), I just pay the minimum and I have been putting away extra money into a regular brokerage account. That's grown to a sizable amount now.

401k is roughly 50K. Brokerage is now also \~50K.

I tend to value the flexibility that the brokerage offers me. I guess I'm somehow planning for an uber-emergency, that if for whatever reason I have some major catastrophe or have to move countries, I can easily liquidate my brokerage account.

My company offers 401K and roth401K.

personalfinance,HSA excess contributions,"Hello everyone so I'm in the process of doing my federal taxes through FreeTaxUSA for tax year 2020. I performed an HSA rollover in the amount of $3754.

Because I performed an HSA rollover and I also withdrew the excess HSA contributions, I've received 1099-SA HSA distribution forms, one for $3754 for the rollover and another for $209 for the excess HSA contributions. This totals in the amount of $3963 which I'm inputting into the total HSA distributions section however I believe this is throwing off the calculation and incorrectly taxing me.

I'm a single filer and taking into account the excess HSA contributions removal, my HSA for tax year 2020 totals $3550 which is the max HSA contribution for tax year 2020 for single filers. How should I go about fixing this? Should I just input $3754 into the total HSA distributions? Any help is appreciated thanks.",finance

investing,A more complete look at crashes/bubbles,"There's a lot of talk of a bubble or crash. Much of this conversation focuses on valuation.  While important, high valuations are a necessary but not sufficient conditions for a bubble.  Said another way, high valuations are one side effect of a complex disease. We can't diagnosis or understand the severity of the disease without knowing more.  Here's a list of other important bubble related issues.  What do you think?  What did I miss?  Do you think we're in a bubble?

* Animal Spirits matter and they're the hardest to measure.  Especially since we're all biased.  I'm a pessimist when it comes to the market I tacitlly believe people think like me. When I see these valuations, my first thought is BUBBLE.  Remember, there's alot of optimists out there thinking FREE MONEY.  Know which you are, correct your view and try to be objective. Also know that optimists will turn into pessimists (vice versa), but it takes time/data to change someone's mind.
* No binary thinking.  Nothing in the world is black or white; the market is not up or down.  I see a lot of comparison to the dot com bubble.  No one seems to bring up the fact that prices climbed and then hung at or around record highs for the better part of a year.  Yes we're probably in a bubble, but its reasonable to think we'll hang here for a while. The upcoming year has brighter prospects than the previous one.
* Most times there isn't a catalyst for a crash, even in hindsight.  Don't drive yourself crazy looking for one.
* Know the story. While it's true it's hard to find the catalyst, know the story of your potential bubble.  IMO, it's interest rates in our current case. COVID caused many people to look to the future and writeoff the present.  They were enabled by low interest rates.  Investors funneled into future looking companies which, by definition, were less harmed by COVID and relatively more attractive in a low rate environment.  We all must watch the rates and the yield curve.  This may not be the catalyst, i.e. not likely to have one large rate increase/yield curve steepening that will crash the market.  But inflation will grow, rates will grow slowly and then eventually, the story may unwind.

A lot of my thoughts stem from Robert Shiller's work. He's got great short books on these subjects.  Recommend Animal Spirits to start.

Finally, stay sane and solvent.  If you're going short, use options ... When you buy a put you at least have defined risk bounds ... Same is not automatically true for shorting.",finance

Through a combination of living outside by means, keeping up with the jones, etc- I stacked up a decent bit of Credit card debt in addition to the student loan from my 5 years at undergrad (worked 9-5 and did night school most of the time). Just under 40k in Student loan debt and a little over 15k in Credit Card Debt.

My original goal was to take my tax return, hopefully the stimulus and my robinhood funds (about $5500) and pay off the MasterCard and Chase Visa- allowing me to ‚ÄúSnowball‚Äù, as Dave Ramsay says, and focus my full credit card down payment efforts on the Amex. But looking at that $250 monthly interest charge on the AMEX, the idea of being able to pay down over a third of that balance is very tempting.

I have started a Mint Account and have been trying to get my day to day and monthly payment under control, I would appreciate advice there but really the point of this post is how to best us this 5k or so, as well as the 30% or so increase in salary, to start my debt elimination journey.

personalfinance,Help Minimizing Tax Withholdings W-4,"Let me start by saying I'm a long time lurker here and this sub has helped me greatly on my personal journey towards financial stability! I was hoping some of you more knowledgeable than I could offer some insight on my current situation.

I am trying to minimize the amount of federal taxes withheld from my weekly paychecks but due to variable income (hourly employee) and pandemic uncertainty, I am having a hard time feeling confidant about the numbers I am getting from the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator. For the 2020 tax year and previous years I have received around $1500-$1700 in federal tax return. I would like to get this as close to zero as possible without ending up owing at the end of the year.

I am an hourly employee in an industry with varying hours based on need (weekly hours vary from 35 to 45+) so my yearly ""salary"" fluctuates and to make matters more confusing, I expect to be temporarily laid off for about 12 weeks of this year. Here is some more background information:

\- Estimated Yearly Gross Income: 36k to 44k

\- 401k Contributions: 6% pre-tax

I have not updated my W-4 since they have changed the form but previously I had been claiming 0 allowances. My employer never discussed the change to the new W-4 with me so I am not sure how they changed my withholdings when the W-4's changed (will be talking with HR tomorrow about it).

Bitcoin,Something big will happen after Bitcoin stabilizes,"My friend was telling me some things that warrant some real discussion. 

First of all, Bitcoin was created by DARPA. In the early 2000s, they were working on a project called LifeLog. You can look this up, and it was supposed to be a system that could track important events in people's lives. Apparently development of LifeLog never completed but they did have a working currency tracker aka Bitcoin. 

In 2008, when the financial crisis hit, the FED created massive amounts of US dollars to keep the financial sector from caving in. They printed well in excess of the public figures and they destroyed the dollar but this information could not be leaked. Today people talk all the time about how the dollar is trash and this and that and the FED does almost nothing to counter this kind of talk because they already know.

In 2009, shortly after the crisis. The FED anonymously released Bitcoin and played it off like an indie developer created it, Satoshi Nakamoto. Even though the dollar was toast, they knew they couldn't just switch over to a new currency without jeopardizing the integrity of the United States. Releasing Bitcoin the way they did allowed for both currencies to coexist and allowed time for an ecosystem to build up around Bitcoin. 

Now, as Bitcoin has matured and is beginning to stabilize. How will the next series of events unfold? The FED might express its support for Bitcoin signaling the end of the dollar. Or are they going to usher in an official US crypto and exert their power to force out Bitcoin and other cryptos?",cryptocurrency

stocks,On the prospects of Cannabis trade across North American borders: A Bearish perspective on LP‚Äôs,"**Disclosure**: 21.5 TLRY 2/27 Put, 14.5 APHA 2/27 Put, Long APHA

**Introduction**

There‚Äôs much discussion in some posts regarding the distinction between MSO‚Äôs and LP‚Äôs commanding market share post legalization, with compelling arguments on each side of the aisle. 

The bull argument is a home run play. Entry and transition from [approximately $7 Billion CAD](https://cannabusinessplans.com/canadian-cannabis-market/)
forecasted market to a market that is [projected to be as much as $37 Billion USD by 2025](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mjbizdaily.com/exclusive-us-retail-marijuana-sales-on-pace-to-rise-40-in-2020-near-37-billion-by-2023/). By this line of reasoning, almost anyone can beat the market. There is plenty of bullish sentiment in this community and others. Therefore, I will spare your time on this.

**Enter the USMCA**

Drafted in 2018 and effective on July 1st, 2020, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement replaced NAFTA as the preceding law regarding trade. The prospect of free trade across three countries who‚Äôve legalized cannabis would have an enormous impact. 

&gt; ‚Äú Like NAFTA, USMCA will include a Free Trade Commission (‚ÄúFTC‚Äù) comprised of delegates from each party-country. Those delegates will be tasked with monitoring and implementing USMCA. Crucially for cannabis, the FTC may form ‚Äúworking groups‚Äù for particular topics. There will be no limitation as to what might be addressed in a working group: rather, the delegates can work on whatever seems relevant.‚Äù [1]

&gt; ‚ÄúDo we think all of this is realistic? Absolutely, and it could happen in any number of ways. Here in Oregon, for example, pro-cannabis U.S. Senator Ron Wyden sits on the USMCA trade committee. The Pacific Northwest has a prominent role in trade policy‚Äîespecially with Canada‚Äîso the required base of political support is already in place. Oregon has shown thought leadership on cannabis export generally, and state officials coordinate well with Mr. Wyden and other federal representatives. Industry should push here.‚Äù [1]

However, the devil may be in the details. 

**Bearish Thesis**

The bear argument surrounds the reality behind Canadian entry into the US Market. 

For starters, there‚Äôs the cost to entry. Vince Sliwosky, professor of cannabis law at Lewis and Clark, [stipulates the possibility of treating cannabis as a commodity of heightened surveillance, with heightened transaction costs, regulation, and tariffs.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/robcannabispro/article-how-usmca-could-pave-the-way-for-cannabis-free-trade/). While optimistic about Cannabis overall, Vince identifies this area as a concern:

&gt; ‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt have to actually amend the [USMCA] agreement because [cannabis] would just be treated like a commodity that is a bit more heavily controlled,‚Äù Mr. Sliwoski said in an interview. ‚ÄúThink of something more akin to tobacco than tomatoes. **Countries have all sorts of funky rules about tobacco with different tariffs on it and I think cannabis would simply be treated like that.** [2]

Second, the competition will be fierce. Contrary to the United States, Canada‚Äôs climate is not ideal for outdoor grow throughout the year. Although decreasing, Canada faces higher costs, even if you run an efficient indoor grow. Only CGC, Aphria, Aurora, and Tilray are able to grow in Latin America. Village Farms already is in US. The remainder are forced to seek growing strategies outdoors due to regulatory pressure. [3][4] 

From a general perspective, it costs an average of $100, $233, and $396 to grow a pound of dried cannabis flower in the United States, Outdoors, Greenhouse, and Indoor, respectively [5]. Meanwhile, Canada has discovered low cost outdoor strategies as low as $0.04 at all-cash wholesale, while stockpiling on dried flower, hoping to export as much extract as possible, all the while telling others they‚Äôre focused on the consumer experience [6]

Third, Canada has been in multiple violations cited by the international treaty obligations. A U.S.-Mexico-Canada triple threat would cause the UN to have an aneurism. The only  reasonable Avenue that averts this, unless the treaty is modified, is under the Cannabis Act: international policy that promotes the export of cannabis solely for medicinal purposes.

Fourth, and perhaps the death-knell to the bullish argument is the concept of protectionism. Will the United States Federal Government legalize cannabis AND prioritize Canadian and Mexican entry in the US, and piss off the United Nations in the process? Or will they keep to themselves? There‚Äôs no fundamental reason to open borders for cannabis while the United States has competitive advantage **and** grow companies big and small in their own back yard - especially with most recent Twitter rampage of competing MSO‚Äôs in mind [8]. 

According to Mark Warner, international trade lawyer:

&gt;‚ÄùGiven [cannabis] is such a growth area, the question is whether countries will be tempted to be protectionist about it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn other words, will the U.S. say ‚Äòyes, we have legalized cannabis, but we want to keep all the jobs here? That is where it could get tricky.‚Äù [2]

Also, Mario Torres, a cannabis lawyer, stated in the cited article:

&gt;‚ÄùWhat we have seen from all the drafts in Mexico thus far is they are going to be pretty protectionist in their own cannabis industry... I just don‚Äôt know if there is going to be the political will to do anything on the cannabis free trade front. Until you have federal legislation in the U.S. and something concrete in Mexico, it is just way too early to see how trade between the three countries in North America on cannabis would really shake out.‚Äù[2] 

After all, the current AMCA is already nit-picky, warranting specificity toward intellectual property rights (I.e. what *kind* of alcohol is exported), what constitutes as fair distribution and exportation, and hosts a pre-existing trade disputes regarding wine and other spirits between the US and Canada. [7]

Long term, the ultimate catalyst may very well be a revision to the USMCA Trade deal. I optimistically believe this will take a maximum of two years, although I personally have a hard time imagining the US federal government rushing to hash the details - especially for cannabis that has been overstocked for months.

**Limitations**

This information is largely comprised of sentiment of paraprofessionals in cannabis, law, and business, with minimal inquiry into the logistical costs to produce in the US and Canada, respectfully. This piece takes little consideration toward the economic impact of Canadian cannabis brands in Mexico and Latin America, especially toward potential trade implications in the future. 

**Suggestion for Further Research**

I also did not speak to the reverse implications of US Cannabis imports to either Canada and Mexico. What may be the implications of US Imported Cannabis onto Canadian LP Revenues?

**Final Thoughts**

Please do your own DD, and discuss new ideas here. I found this information to be helpful (although it does serve my bias) but I am far-and-wide open to evidence for both sides. I‚Äôm short-term bearish on Canadian plays until more legal work is completed, and I believe it will take much time to sort out the details. Nonetheless, I hope this serves as a contribution to this sub. 

**TL,DR: Canadian LPs may have a higher cost of entry and time delay associated with USMCA than market euphoria suggests. Canadian companies best not be burning cash when time comes for the borders to eventually open a lucrative, and equally competitive, cannabis trade market in the US.**

Also I can't afford to lose this cash so I didn't want to put it into crypto (if only I had...).

I've been hearing about BlockFi and other exchanges offering pretty high % on stablecoins. I'm thinking about moving this cash into BlockFi on USDC/PAX/GUSD and earning 8.6% interest while we wait for estimates/delays/who knows what since everything takes forever now due to covid. This cash could be sitting for 6 months to a year, so it could earn a pretty decent return in that time. I really like the idea of it earning 8.6% while it sits instead of the 0.02% or whatever Ally offers now.

From my limited knowledge it seems like they should be set for retiring.

Lately my father has been trying to convince my mother that they can refinance a house at low interest rates, take that money and put it into bonds or notes, and end up with much more money. 

It seems like a terrible idea to me, but I don't have the numbers to quantitatively evaluate the risk vs reward. I was hoping someone could explain the pros and cons, possible pitfalls/traps, and how big the risk is.",finance

CryptoCurrency,For Newcomers to trading and investing,"How to Avoid Emotional Investing

Active monitoring of a portfolio is important for navigating the changing tides of financial markets. Still, it is also essential for individual investors to manage the behavioral impulses of emotional buying and selling that can come from following the market's ups and downs. Indeed, investors seem to have a knack for piling into investments at market tops and selling at the bottoms because it is not uncommon to get entangled in media hype or fear, buying investments at peaks and selling during the valleys of the cycle.

How can investors navigate volatile markets while also keeping an even keel and keeping a portfolio diversified for the best overall returns through all types of market environments? The key is to understand the motivations behind emotional investing and to avoid both euphoric and depressive investment traps that can lead to poor decision-making.

Investor Behaviour

Investor behavior has been the focus of many studies and numerous theories attempt to explain the regret or overreaction that buyers and sellers often experience when it comes to money. The reality is that the investor's psyche can overpower rational thinking during times of stress, whether that stress is a result of euphoria or panic. Taking a rational and realistic approach to investing‚Äîduring what seems like a short time frame for capitalizing on euphoria or fearful market developments‚Äîis essential.


KEY TAKEAWAYS

Investing based on emotion (greed or fear) is the main reason why so many people are buying at market tops and selling at market bottoms.

Underestimating risks associated with investments is one reason why investors sometimes make suboptimal decisions based on emotion.

During periods of market volatility and rising interest rates, investors often move funds from riskier stocks and to lower-risk interest rate securities.

Dollar-cost averaging and diversification are two approaches that investors can implement to make consistent decisions that are not driven by emotion.

Staying the course through short-term volatility is often the key to longer-term success as an investor.

The non-professional investor is typically putting hard-earned cash in investments for the sake of receiving a return. Still, they see their investments lose value due to market developments at times. The losses can cause stress and second-guessing. That is, many investors have a relatively low risk tolerance when it comes to investing because losing money is painful.

But risk can be viewed as a guidepost for investing and investor behavior. Investors who enter into investments with a base level understanding of the risks involved can mitigate a great deal of the emotion associated with investing. In other words, challenges due to emotional investing can crop up when investors see unidentified or higher stake risks than they had originally ascertained.

Bull vs. Bear Markets

Bull markets are periods when markets move up relentless and, sometimes, indiscriminately.1Ôªø When the bull rages and investor sentiment becomes one of general exuberance, investors might see market opportunities or learn about investments from others‚Äîsuch as news stories, friends, co-workers, or family‚Äîthat may compel them to test new waters. The excitement might lead the investor to try to obtain gains from investments that are emerging due to bullish market conditions.

Likewise, when investors read stories about a bad economy or hear reports about a volatile or negative market period, fear for their investments can fuel selling. Bear markets are always lurking around the corner and come with many of their own caveats that can be important for investors to follow and understand.2Ôªø In contrast to a bull market, sometimes financial markets can trend lower for many months or even years.

Oftentimes bear markets evolve from an environment of rising interest rates that can spur risk-off trading and a transition from riskier investments like stocks to low-risk savings products. Bear markets can be difficult to navigate when investors see their equity holdings lose value while safe havens become more enticing due to their rising returns. During these times, it can be hard to choose between buying equities at market lows or buying into cash and interest-bearing products.

Bad Timing

Emotional investing is often an exercise in bad market timing. Following the media can be a good way to detect when bull or bear markets are evolving because the daily stock market reports feed off the activity occurring through the day, which can at times create a buzz for investors. However, media reports can also be outdated, short-lived, or even non-sensical and based on rumors.

At the end of the day, individual investors are accountable for their own trade decisions and therefore must be cautious when seeking to time market opportunities based on the latest headlines. Using rational and realistic thinking to understand when an investment may be in a development cycle is the key to evaluating interesting opportunities and resisting bad investing ideas. Reacting to the latest breaking news is probably a sign that decisions are being driven by emotion rather than rational thinking.


Time-Tested Theory

The notion that many market participants buy at the top and sell at the bottom has been proven by historical money flow analysis. Money flow analysis looks at the net flow of funds for mutual funds and often shows that, when markets are hitting peaks or valleys, buying or selling are at their highest.

Market anomalies like a crisis can be useful time periods for observation. During the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, investors withdrew money from the market and money flows to mutual funds turned negative. The net fund outflows peaked at the market bottom and, as is typical for market bottoms, the selling created overly discounted investments, which eventually formed the basis for a turning point and the market's next ascent upward. 

Strategies to Take the Emotion Out of Investing
Two of the most popular approaches to investing‚Äîdollar-cost averaging and diversification‚Äîcan take some of the guesswork out of investment decisions and reduce the risk of poor timing due to emotional investing. One of the most effective is the dollar-cost averaging of investment dollars.

Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy where equal amounts of dollars are invested at a regular, predetermined interval. This strategy can be implemented in any market condition. In a downward trending market, investors are purchasing shares at lower and lower prices. During an upward trend, the shares previously held in the portfolio are producing capital gains and, since the dollar investment is a fixed amount, fewer shares are purchased when the share price is higher.

The key to the dollar-cost averaging strategy is to stay the course. Set the strategy and don't tamper with it unless a major change warrants revisiting and rebalancing the established course. This type of strategy can work best in 401(k) plans with matching benefits, as a fixed dollar amount is deducted from each paycheck and the employer provides additional contributions.

$6.2 Trillion
The total amount of fund assets in 401(k) plans on Dec. 31, 2019, which represents almost 20% of total mutual fund assets.3Ôªø
Diversification, which is the process of buying an array of investments rather than just one or two securities, can also help diminish the emotional response to market volatility. After all, there are only a handful of times in history when all markets have moved in unison and diversification provided little protection. In normal market cycles, using a diversification strategy provides an element of protection because losses in some investments are offset by gains in others.

Diversifying a portfolio can take many forms such as investing in different industries, different geographies, different types of investments, and even hedging with alternative investments like real estate and private equity. There are distinctive market conditions that favor each of these investment groups, so a portfolio made up of all these various types of investments should provide protection in a range of market conditions.

The Bottom Line

Investing without emotion is easier said than done, but there are some important considerations that can keep an individual investor from chasing futile gains or overselling in panic. Understanding your own risk tolerance and the risks of your investments can be an important basis for rational decisions. Active understanding of the markets and what forces are driving bullish and bearish trends is vital as well.

Overall, while there are times when active and emotional investing can be profitable, data shows that following a well-defined investment strategy and staying the course through market volatility often results in the best long-term performance returns.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,1099-R 401k Distribution Question,"Morning all, I cashed out the entirety of my 401k (about $12.7k) in the fall to help keep me alive through the pandemic after my pay and hours were slashed 30% in March. I took that money and paid it all on my various credit cards. When going to do my taxes on tax slayer it bounces back and forth between a $3500 refund (what I was expecting) or a $500 refund depending on how I enter the 1099-R. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q9 from the following IRS Q&amp;A page asks, ""Is it optional for employers to adopt the distribution and loan rules of section 2202 of the CARES Act?"" and the answer reads, ""It is optional for employers to adopt the distribution and loan rules of section 2202 of the CARES Act. An employer is permitted to choose whether, and to what extent, to amend its plan to provide for coronavirus-related distributions and/or loans that satisfy the provisions of section 2202 of the CARES Act. Thus, for example, an employer may choose to provide for coronavirus-related distributions but choose not to change its plan loan provisions or loan repayment schedules. **Even if an employer does not treat a distribution as coronavirus-related, a qualified individual may treat a distribution that meets the requirements to be a coronavirus-related distribution as coronavirus-related on the individual's federal income tax return.""** 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I can document my pay cut and took the money to pay off part of a debt accumulated by the crisis, am I okay to proceed with filling out $0 instead of $12.7k in the 2a taxable amount box when entering form 1099-R into tax preparation software and clicking through the coronavirus related boxes to get the $3500 refund? $2559.20 of federal income tax was withheld on it and my state has no income tax.

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq set to add to record highs

&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday, adding to Friday‚Äôs record closes for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq. The U.S. stock market was closed Monday for Presidents Day. All three stock benchmarks finished higher last week, in a continuation of February‚Äôs strength. For the year, as of Friday‚Äôs close, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were up nearly 2.8%, 4.8% and 9.4%, respectively.

&gt; * The 30-year Treasury yield held above 2% early Tuesday as investors watched for progress on President Joe Biden‚Äôs proposed $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus package on Capitol Hill and the push for wider distribution of coronavirus vaccines across the U.S. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to more than 1.26%.

*****

&gt; # 2. B/itcoin hit a new high over $50,000

&gt; * B/itcoin reached a new record high Tuesday, going over $50,000 per unit for the first time ever, before paring some of those gains. Major firms announced support for digital currencies last week, starting with Tesla revealing it bought $1.5 billion worth of b/itcoin. Mastercard said Thursday it would support certain c/ryptocurrencies later this year, while BNY Mellon announced the following day it would open up its custody services to digital assets. B/itcoin more than quadrupled in 2020 and it‚Äôs up over 60% since the start of this year.

*****

&gt; # 3. Deep freeze in Texas causes massive energy crunch

&gt; * More than 3.8 million households in Texas are in the dark Tuesday morning, as record low temperatures boosted demand for power for heat that pushed the state‚Äôs electric grid to its limits. Rolling blackouts, typically seen on 100-degree summer days, were imposed in Texas. The scarcity of power was so great that spot prices of wholesale electricity on the Texas power grid spiked more than 10,000% on Monday. U.S. oil prices also climbed to a pandemic-high above $60 per barrel. The frigid weather was part of a massive winter blast that brought snow, sleet and freezing rain to the southern Plains, across parts of the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.

*****

&gt; # 4. Congress to establish a Capitol riot commission

&gt; * House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday that Congress will establish an independent, 9/11-style commission to look into last month‚Äôs deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Investigations into the riot were already planned, with Senate hearings scheduled later this month in the Rules Committee.

&gt; * House impeachment prosecutors who argued for Donald Trump‚Äôs conviction of inciting the attack said Sunday that they proved their case. Democrats also railed against Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans, saying they were ‚Äútrying to have it both ways‚Äù in finding the former president not guilty while criticizing him.

*****

&gt; # 5. Biden to make first official domestic trips

&gt; * Trying to move beyond Trump‚Äôs acquittal in last week‚Äôs impeachment trial, Biden plans to keep up a busy schedule focused on the coronavirus in the coming week. Biden is set to make his first official domestic trips of his presidency, starting with a CNN town hall in Wisconsin on Tuesday to talk to Americans impacted by the pandemic. Biden on Thursday then visits a Pfizer Covid vaccine facility in Michigan as the drugmaker‚Äôs two-shot regime and Moderna‚Äôs start making more inroads into pharmacies around the nation.

btc,Why stablecoins do not have a premium over fiat?,"It is a rather simple and obvious question for anyone with a traditional finance background that apparently no one has asked thus far: [Why stablecoins do not have a premium over fiat](https://ungeared.com/the-lack-of-stablecoin-premium-pushing-bitcoin-price-to-125000-in-2021/)?

In the traditional financial world (all else being equal), higher real interest rates lead to the currency‚Äôs appreciation against its counterparts. For example, let‚Äôs assume at t=0, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Swiss Franc is 1 to 1, and the real interest rates in both economies are 3%. A few months later, the Swiss Central Bank increases its main lending rate, and as a result, the real interest rate in Switzerland grows to 5%. We would expect the franc to appreciate against the dollar.

Currently, stablecoin holders can earn double-digit APYs on their deposits. For instance, Celsius is offering up to 16.54% on USDT deposits (the actual rates depend on the proportion of CEL tokens in one‚Äôs portfolio). And this is not an exception, other companies in the space as well as numerous DeFi projects have similar offerings. Meanwhile, fiat savings accounts and even money market accounts are offering interest rates of less than 1% or 20-30 times less. Shouldn‚Äôt stablecoins have a hefty premium over USD? Why don‚Äôt they?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,A CD or other investment to help offset personal loan interest rate,"My wife and I are buying a new home. We want to do some renovations. We will be earning some equity on the same of our current home that would cover the cost of the renovations, but we'd also like to keep that money in the bank for other unexpected costs. We're thinking of getting a personal loan from our credit union. 

If we got approved for the max, it would be $35k with a 7.99% interest rate over 72 months.  That comes out to just over $2,700 over the life of the loan.

First thing I thought of was to take money from our savings and buy a CD to help offset that interest, but we're looking AT BEST .75% over a 12 month CD.  

That gets me maybe $150 in a year, not really making a dent in the interest paid on the loan.

I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions on other options?  I'm doing ok purchasing fractional shares through the Sofi app, but I'm also nervous about the volitility of the market. My parents are retired and buy municipal bonds, but I know nothing about that.

Any suggestions are appreciated. Anything has to be better than just letting it sit in savings at maybe .25% interest.  Thanks!",finance

investing,Watching the 10-Year Like a Hawk,"A few thoughts/questions, I am an amateur investor but like to follow the financial news and try to piece things together. Would love to hear thoughts from people more coherent/intelligent than me:

- Today the 10-year Treasury rate shot higher, to a level comparable to the panic last March when people were dumping everything they could to raise cash. 

- This has matched a melt-up in equities and crypto-currencies, as well as the SPAC craze.

- Treasury yields are rising despite the fact that the Fed is apparently still buying bonds at a massive rate from primary dealers 

- Inflation expectations rising rapidly, Fed has said it will go over 3 percent

- Washington continues to deficit spend like nobody's business

- It's always trendy to talk about the ""bond bubble"" but I haven't seen any of these articles in awhile even though the reasons for owning bonds at these yields defy logic

Potential Risks:

- (Perennial) - China dumping U.S. Treasuries 

- Higher Treasury rate = higher mortgage rates, decrease in home values + many delinquent mortgages due to pandemic

- Does increasing yield on treasuries mean that Washington is increasingly going to be paying out higher amounts of interest on its deficit spending?  Could this lead to a credit downgrade? We know a low rate is good for stocks and real estate, but is it also good for a government that's unable to dig itself out of a fiscal hole and in fact keeps digging deeper?

Owning in our area is significantly cheaper than renting, and we know we're settled where we want to stay for our careers.

I have a credit score of over 800, his is around 750. He's finishing paying off his car loan and has some minimal student loans that are up next, but I'm not concerned about his ability to attain approval for a mortgage with a great interest rate. While I have a great credit score and no debt, I only have one credit card that I pay off monthly. Will this be enough of a credit history to qualify for the best rates? I'd previously attempted to house hunt, but my credit history was too short and I wasn't comfortable with the mortgage rates I was able to secure, so I decided to stay with my parents and save up more money for a future down payment. Now that I've had my credit card significantly longer, I'm hoping that's enough to help with the rates, but if I should establish additional credit I'd rather get started with that now than have to delay buying a home even further.",finance

My name is Michaela, I am 23 years old and I have a credit score of 758.

I recently did a credit check because my credit score dropped from a 785 to 758. There were two stated reasons: I have a ""thin"" file, and I use 41% of my credit card. (Paid off at the end of each month).

I'd like to see my credit grow above 780 within the next year or so - my goal is to be able to buy a house with my partner with a great interest rate. (My partner's credit score is 820).

I need advice for the following situation:

My partner and I are looking to share a credit card for our household expenses. We are wondering if it would be smarter for me to get a second credit card (with him as an authorized user) with my lower credit score - or for him to get a third credit card with me as an authorized user with his excellent credit score?

Also - if I am added as an authorized user, will his credit score be the only one affected (positively, fingers crossed)? Or will I also see my credit increased/decreased depending on the history we generate with it?

We just want some advice on the best course of action that would benefit us both. The end goal is to build my credit so we are within the same range within a year or two.

deeplearning,"""Floaty"" detection using a neural network?","Im running into issues for a certain project. I have microscopic .Tif images (each file contains 200-1000 frames).  These are cell images, and over the time dimension (frames), some cell structures have a large spike in intensity. This is important, and the goal is to plot the location and intensity of these cell structures over time.

The issue is floaties however. Floaties are very small dead cell fragments which may shoot across the frame either very slowly or very quickly. I want to get rid of these floaties before the intensity analysis begins.

I have tried everything. I have tried all sorts of filtering, blob detection, lucas-kanade, etc, with little to no luck.

My question is this. Would it be possible to, either in C++ or Python, have some sort of neural network thats fed in pre-detected images of these floaties and trained, and then have it output the .tiff files with said floaties ""detected"", or possibly have their coordinates exported? With this information, i could simply ignore pixel cluster (x,y)-&gt;(x,y) at frame t and the intensity output would ignore the floaties.

#Background

Marijuana, generally unregulated in the first part of United States history, began facing significant restrictions in the 1900s and continued to be focused on in several pieces of legislation through the latter part of the 20th century including the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 followed by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. Mandatory sentencing minimums enacted during the administration of President Ronald Reagan legislated necessary legal action be taken against drug offenses, often including the use or distribution of Marijuana.

The administration of President Reagan also saw the AIDS crisis break out in the United States. A resurgence occurred of interest in marijuana for medical usage, with AIDS patients reporting significant relief from its usage. A large percentage of these patients being concentrated in San Francisco and Los Angeles may have contributed to the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, a California law which was the first in the nation to defy federal regulations in permitting citizens with a doctor's note to cultivate and possess marijuana for medical usage. However, the 2001 Supreme Court decision in *United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative* ruled that medical exemption could not be used to bypass federal law. This was followed by the 2005 Supreme Court decision in *Gonzales v. Raich*, in which the court ruled that users and distributors of medical marijuana in California could still be prosecuted under federal law despite its legality in that state. This led to a surge in the 2000s of federal Drug Enforcement Agency arrests of medical users within California.

As further states and jurisdictions passed their own legislation loosening regulations on medical marijuana, further court cases would have long-term impacts on their enactment. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on *Conant v. McCaffrey* in 2000 determined that physicians had the right to recommend marijuana usage to patients, but not in fact to prescribe it. From a national standpoint, the *Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr Amendment*, first adopted in 2014, prevents federal prosecution of individuals acting in accordance of state medical marijuana law. Between the Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr Amendment and the United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative SCOTUS decision, the status of medical marijuana in many states is such that one may obtain and use it in accordance with state law while still being in violation of federal law - though relevant prosecution against those individuals, even if pursued, will likely be unsuccessful.

With regards to legislation surrounding marijuana used for recreational purposes, individual states have been slower to adopt allowances. The first statewide legalization of recreational marijuana occurred in 2012 in Washington and Colorado, allowing for professional cultivation and sale. Since then 11 more states have followed suit, in addition to two territories plus Washington DC. In 2013 during the Obama administration the Justice Department issued internal governance known as the Cole Memorandum, stating that prosecution should halt for federal marijuana crimes within states that had legalized such activity. However, the memorandum was rescinded in 2018 under the Trump administration. No further federal-level guidance has been issued, meaning that the Justice Department may choose to federally prosecute for marijuana possession, use or distribution at the time of this post - even if such activity is legal in the state it occurs in. At this time leading recreational marijuana dispensaries still do business in cash and without banking partners, as financial institutions may face federal penalties for aiding these dispensaries.

#Leading Opinions

**Joe Biden and Kamala Harris** both have history with anti-marijuana action during their time in the legislative branch. Currently however Biden's website states, ""Biden believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he will decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. And, he will support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leave decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts."" 

**Donald Trump**'s WH Press Secretary Sean Spicer in 2017 stated belief in a link between marijuana use and the opioid crisis, while clarifying President Trump's sympathy towards users of medical marijuana. In 2018, AG Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum that had previously halted federal prosecution for state-by-state legal marijuana usage, possession and distribution.

**Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV)** stated in 2017, ‚ÄúI go to the treatment centers. I talk to the addicts. I always ask, 'How did you get started?' Most told me they started out with recreational marijuana. Legalizing recreational marijuana is something I have not been able to accept or support. What about medical marijuana? What about commercial cannabis? These are things I don‚Äôt know much about. But I‚Äôm interested in learning and finding out more. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing now.‚Äù Manchin has pledged to maintain the Senate filibuster pertinent to marijuana legislation, meaning that it would require 60 votes to pass.


**Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)** is a supporter of marijuana law reform, significantly from a states' rights perspective. In 2020 he met with representatives from the National Cannabis Industry Association, who released a statement that reads in part ""Senator Paul has been a long-time supporter of cannabis policy reform, and is a cosponsor of the SAFE Banking Act. We are meeting to express our gratitude and to discuss ways in which we can move effective banking reform through the Senate this session.""

personalfinance,$6K into Roth IRA or save for student loans (interest resumes Oct 2021)?,"First post in this community, so apologies for my ignorance!

Currently a student about to graduate this spring, and have about \~$10K-$20K leftover following financial aid disbursement. I have federal student loans that are currently on emergency forbearance (no required payments, no accumulating interest through 9/30/2021). Original interest rates are 4.3% and 5.3%, which I have paid so all that is left is principle.

I realized that I still have time to open a Roth IRA if I want to make a 2020 contribution. Given that interest does not accrue until October and discussions of federal loan forgiveness are pending (not optimistic, but...), I wonder if I should consider maxing out a 2020 Roth IRA contribution with a portion of this money. Earned 2020 income was \~$20K. Expected salary after graduation \~$58K-$63K, depending on where I end up in the country, in case that is relevant.

Any advice or alternatives are appreciated, thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Spending Coverdell ESA at a foreign institution,"My offspring is completing their bachelors in a few months at a US college.  Been spending down their Coverdell ESA, but there's still some money left, and they plan to attend a foreign institution for a masters in the fall of 2021 and spring of 2022 (if the world can get this coronavirus stuff under some control by then).

Said foreign institution is on the list of those eligible for US federal student aid, so as I understand it that means that our Coverdell ESA funds can be used without penalty (within the normal rules of allowed expenses).

Is there anything I should do other than just withdraw the funds from the Coverdell when we have legit educational expenses?  From the tax man's perspective, there would be nothing to distinguish this withdrawal for educational expense from withdrawing it for gold plating our toilets, as far as I know.

I'm trying to do things right and avoid any audit red flags.  I'll of course keep all the evidence of the expenses.

There's no point in filling out a FAFSA for the 2021-2022 academic year, is there?  Just wondering if no FAFSA might raise a red flag.",finance

defi,Clever DeFi ‚Äì Creating Better DeFi for a Better World,"https://i.redd.it/chk6dzj4yvg61.jpg

The features and components available in the DeFi platform are quite sophisticated and sublime. Thus, to operate it, you might need a small amount of know-how in the technical aspects. But, once you are familiar with it, everything will be a piece of cake for you.

Nonetheless, how is Clever DeFi going to change the scenario of the cryptocurrency market forever? Is it beneficial for everyone at all? We are going to answer all of these questions throughout the whole write-up. So, be sure to stay tuned.

What is Clever DeFi?

As implied previously,¬†Clever DeFi¬†is an efficient DeFi protocol, which operates in the world of blockchain. Regarding workability, the platform is particularly popular due to the excellent interest rate (11%). Another impressive thing about the module is that it offers the earnings at a compound rate. Hence, the chance of acquiring more currency becomes much simpler here.

However, to accumulate the interest properly, you will need to own CLVA Token. It will be available on the platform during the minting period, which begins in February 2021. So, suppose you do begin your venture earlier. In that case, you will be able to pass through most of your competitors positively.

cardano,"""Understanding Kamali"" - take a walk in a world outside of your own","Here is a link to the Twitter thread: [https://twitter.com/fatcatofcrypto/status/1361731437561479169](https://twitter.com/fatcatofcrypto/status/1361731437561479169)

I post articles like these once a week, discussing mostly #Cardano related topics!

Although, on Twitter, the infographics illustrate needed information, I will also post the article below:

\#Cardano ‚ÄúUnderstanding Kamali‚Äù

\#Cardano will be the underpinning of the emergence of Africa.

To  grasp the full weight of the SOLUTIONS #Cardano can provide it is  pertinent to read ‚ÄúUnderstanding Africa‚Äù as I will draw directly from  the PROBLEMS laid out.

Here is a link if you have not already read it: [https://twitter.com/fatcatofcrypto/status/1359580806889410560](https://twitter.com/fatcatofcrypto/status/1359580806889410560)

What  I will attempt to do here, is to create an immersive world for you to  be placed in to grasp the weight and size of problems from the ground  level and then taking a grass-roots approach at solving them using  #Cardano and its technology.

As  an investor and community member of #Cardano, this should be extremely  important to you as you have a stake (pun intended) in this.

‚ÄúYou are paid in direct proportion to the difficulty of the problems you solve‚Äù - [u/elonmusk](https://www.reddit.com/u/elonmusk/)

In  Africa, agribusiness, more than any other sector, has the potential to  reduce poverty and drive economic growth. Agriculture accounts for  nearly half of the continent‚Äôs gross domestic product and employs 60  percent of the labor force.

Let‚Äôs start here:

You  are a smallholder farmer, named Kamali, you and your family of 4 run a  wheat farm in the Woinima village of the Jabi Tehnan district of  Ethiopia. You collect irrigation water from an upstream river called  Guisa once every 4 to 6 weeks to water your farm. You own 1.75 hectares  of land and want to expand, but the amount of water irrigated to you is  only enough to support .5 hectares of wheat production and is  inconsistent in delivery.

With  inconsistent and minimal delivery of water to your farm you find it  hard to expand, which is essential for the survival of your family.

Let‚Äôs  take a step back and try to understand how this irrigation  process-control can be reformed so that we may solve Kamali‚Äôs problem.

Irrigation  is the most crucial aspect in the expanding of the agricultural sector  in Sub-Saharan Africa and particularly Ethiopa in which irrigation  accounts for just 3% of food crop production, the lowest in Africa. Here  are reasons why irrigation is hard to implement for small-scale farmers  like Kamali:

\- low input supply (supply of fertilizer/pest control products)

\- lack of credit for basic financing

\- capital fraud

\- lack of post-farming supply chain systems

\- access to reliable electricity

Looking  at this one can deduce that the lack of access to capital at all levels  ‚Äì local, regional and state ‚Äì is the main driver of poor irrigation  infrastructure. How can this infrastructure thrive if investment capital  has high barrier for entry due to poor state-level policy,  regional-level trust, and local-level identity? You secure local-level  customers from state-level jurisdiction then restructure from the  local-level and watch the solution cascade back upward.

The  center of our problem here is financial inclusion, how do we get  investment capital to trust that their money will not only yield a  return but will not be defrauded, breached, or stolen in such a loosely  regulated, non-secure and high-risk market? The same way you establish  trust with anyone, you get to know them.

Enter Atala PRISM.

Atala  PRISM is a decentralized identity solution that enables people to own  their personal data and interact with organizations seamlessly,  privately, and securely built by #Cardano. At the time of writing, many  of Atala PRISM‚Äôs specific technology is not open-source.

Restructuring  how local-level (Kamali) actors interact with important endpoints in a  supply chain using Atala PRISM as an identity layer could work like  this:

1. Kamali is on-boarded to Atala PRISM via mobile-app which holds secure data, including:

‚Ä¢ Her personal information (KYC / AML)

‚Ä¢ Credit score

‚Ä¢ Occupation (small-hold farmer)

‚Ä¢ Type of crop (perishable or non-perishable)

‚Ä¢ How much yield the farm produces

‚Ä¢ What type of inputs needed

‚Ä¢ How much water needed

2.  Kamali is verified by an Agricultural Extension Officer sent out by the  Ethiopian Agriculture Transformation Agency (ATA) that the information  about her farm is correct

3. After being verified Kamali requests a credit voucher from a financial institution that is also verified by the ATA

1. Kamali must pay back this credit voucher in 12 months
2. Kamali  uses that credit voucher to purchase inputs from an agro-dealer or  cooperative (supplier of farming inputs) ‚Äì who is also verified by the  ATA ‚Äì at a subsidized rate
3. The agro-dealer checks the verification process and upon confirmation, grants the inputs requested by Kamali
4. Kamali takes the inputs to tend her farm and then procures a yield
5. The  agro-dealer takes the voucher and aggregates them with thousands to  millions of other vouchers to give back to the financial institution to  collect their margin

Now  there is a trust-based infrastructure in play that all lives on the  #Cardano blockchain, which means auditing the life cycle of vouchers,  credit, inputs and smallholder farm production is no longer an issue  because information is transparent, immutable and non-corruptible.

Well, how do we know the people verifying others will not be corrupt? Incentives.

1. Kamali‚Äôs incentive is to receive inputs to produce yield, so she will pay her loans off
2. The agro-dealers incentive is to make margin on credit vouchers, so they will maintain input supply
3. The ATA incentive is to increase productivity, so they will verify trusted actors in the supply chain
4. The Government of Ethiopia‚Äôs incentive is to procure foreign investment, so they will audit the blockchain routinely

With  an upgraded supply chain production is increasing, fraud is mitigated,  and food scarcity is decreasing. The Government of Ethiopia can more  aggressively shop for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and can even  negotiate better rates. With FDI inflows increasing, the GoE begins  hiring engineers, irrigation technique counselors, contracting out  developers and suppliers and restructures Kamali‚Äôs current irrigation  channel.

Let‚Äôs enter back into Kamali‚Äôs world:

You  have been having your best production yields you have ever had; you  have been building your credit up and are now financing your own  electrically powered irrigation pump that has much better access to  water due to larger irrigation installments upstream.

You  are now able to expand the amount of wheat coverage from .5 hectares to  all 1.75 hectares that you own, but that means your input costs will  increase by 250% but the current financial institutions aren't yet  comfortable issuing an unsecured credit voucher to you of that size.

Your  alternative is to outsource a loan from the current Web 2 CeFi  infrastructure via mobile app, Opay, a borrow/lending platform in  Ethiopia. Opay was demanded to be taken off of Google Play Store for  predatory lending as their practices included:

\- Massive data privacy breach

1. internet browser history
2. social media
3. SMS and call history
4. location data

\- high loan origination fee (upwards of 22%)

\- massive APR (upwards of 300%)

\- short term fixed duration (not suitable for farmers)

You  cannot afford a 22% loan origination fee and don't want to consent to  such invasive privacy access, you seem to be out of options.

Enter [u/liqwidfinance](https://www.reddit.com/u/liqwidfinance/).

[u/liqwidfinance](https://www.reddit.com/u/liqwidfinance/)  will be the first money market borrow/lending on-chain application on  #Cardano. This will enable anyone with $ADA or on-chain stable coin to  engage as a lender/supplier in the market to earn interest or to borrow  against their assets. This is only a high-level view as I will post a  separate thread digging into the details and technology behind [u/liqwidfinance](https://www.reddit.com/u/liqwidfinance/).

The  removal of custody, settlement, and escrow with their heavy fixed costs  built into the legacy CeFi system and the introduction to  algorithmically optimized money, like [u/liqwidfinance](https://www.reddit.com/u/liqwidfinance/) lowers the fees charged to perform key banking actions.

What  this looks like for Kamali is a loan origination fee \~100x smaller than  her current CeFi incumbent, Opay ‚Äì currently 22% ‚Äì at .25%.

[u/liqwidfinance](https://www.reddit.com/u/liqwidfinance/)  will be working on ‚Äòcredit concepts‚Äô that will enable a completely  decentralized, on-chain credit scoring system which will allow for  dynamic, algorithmically set interest rates that will incentivize  borrowers like Kamali to make her loan payments on time.

To do this, it would be massively important for [u/iohk](https://www.reddit.com/u/iohk/) to open-source Atala PRISM to applications like [u/liqwidfinance](https://www.reddit.com/u/liqwidfinance/) as it is the most robust identity solution framework.

We will touch more on the future of [u/liqwidfinance](https://www.reddit.com/u/liqwidfinance/) in this thread, in the meantime lets circle back with Kamali.

You  have now secured financing and can borrow against your new found  liquidity to obtain the credit voucher you were previously denied by the  financial institution; the credit voucher allows you to pay a  subsidized rate for inputs, usually 60%.

Your  demand for expansion has now been met and you begin harvesting wheat  and other crops on all 1.75 hectares, and guess what? Your entire  village and other villages around you start taking the same approach.

Now  the aggro-dealers are struggling keeping up with the new demand as  their source of funding (financial institution + regional government)   doesn't have the capital to pay importers, suppliers and input  producers.

With FDI already at all time highs, how and where do we introduce more liquidity to keep up with growing input demand?

While  the financial bottle necking in Ethiopia forces illiquidity and further  expands financial exclusion from capital on-ramps across the globe, the  bridge to this is being built in DeFi and with the introduction of  tokenization could provide liquidity to the near 5 trillion dollars in  illiquidity that exists in Africa.

Currently,  the financial institutions that distribute credit vouchers are backed  by regional governments through the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia but most  credit and cash sales are collected and facilitated by the financial  institutions themselves therefore mitigating budget risks for regional  governments. These individual vouchers are 100% sovereign-backed and  have a 90% repayment rate with a 15% interest.

While  these vouchers are small individually, what if it was possible to  tokenize them, aggregate them, then create tranches based off of crop,  harvest-rate and seasonal production which have maturation dates built  in to provide investors varied risk profiling. You could call these debt  instruments SBS‚Äôs or (sovereign-backed securities) and they would live  on the #Cardano blockchain and could be sold to hedge funds, investment  banks, or individual investors in the #Cardano ecosystem. Fucking wild.

Capital  inflows into the financial institutions are pouring in and they can now  fund the growing demand for agricultural inputs from suppliers.  Agro-dealers and cooperatives have sufficient supply for small-hold  farmers and production beings to see exponential growth.

You,  Kamali, are enjoying the fruits of your labor and the risks it took to  get there, you leveraged an emerging product that allowed you to set a  new precedence for your community members. They begin to copy your  business model, and word gets out and now your strategy has cascaded  internationally throughout all of Sub-Saharan Africa.

There  are many more problems that exist within this example, for instance  post-harvest strategy, lack of storage-infrastructure, predatory  agricultural brokers, road/railway infrastructure, and current  import/export protocols that could easily be solved by #Cardano and  products like Atala SCAN, but for the sake of brevity, we will stop  here.

I hope by reading this you  were able to place yourselves in a world entirely unlike your own and  recognize just how massive some barriers can be and how important it is  for something as disruptive and necessary as #Cardano is to the world.",cryptocurrency

investing,$STMP DD - Stamps.com's Real Business Is ShipStation &amp; ShipEngine,"I‚Äôve seen a fair bit of talk on the subreddit based around some of the ‚Äúhot‚Äù names in eCommerce (Shopify, Amazon, Wayfair, BigCommerce, PayPal, Square, etc) but I wanted to shed some light on a company that‚Äôs potentially just as big of a play in the eCommerce industry yet operates under the radar. So stick with me here‚Ä¶ Stamps.com (STMP)

**TLDR: Stamps.com isn‚Äôt really a business that sells stamps online, it‚Äôs a SAAS company that‚Äôs quietly become the backbone of eCommerce fulfillment by acquiring businesses such as ShipStation, ShipEngine, ShippingEasy, ShipWorks, MetaPack, etc.**

**Overview:**

From my experience when someone hears Stamps.com they immediately think ""people don't send letters anymore"" and figure the business is on the same path as your local blockbuster was. Thing is, around 10 years ago Stamps.com management must have realized this as well as they started acquiring tons of SAAS companies in the eCommerce industry.

What people don‚Äôt realize is that today, they‚Äôre about as pivotal of a player in the eCommerce space as anyone else out there. So if you‚Äôre long eCommerce, you probably want to go long STMP.

**Ecommerce 101 - Multi-Channel Sales &amp; Fulfillment:**

Generally speaking, most brands that sell online do so through a variety of channels.  You have your first party channel (direct to consumer) via your own website likely built on Shopify, Woocommerce, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento (bless your soul), etc

Then you also likely sell via third-party marketplaces like Amazon, Wayfair, Etsy, eBay, Overstock, etc. The list goes on and on.

The process, at its core, is pretty simple. When someone orders your product from Amazon.com, Wayfair.com, or even your own website someone needs to pull the units from the warehouse, pack it up in a box, and then ship it to the customer. Simple enough.

When selling somewhere like Amazon, everything is for the most part contained in their ecosystem via something like the FBA program. They hold the inventory and manage the fulfillment process from start to finish. However, when you‚Äôre selling multi-channel, it‚Äôs a whole different beast. Obviously, Walmart.com isn‚Äôt going to be cool with your product showing up to the customer's house in an Amazon box with a smile on it. They also won‚Äôt hold your inventory in their warehouses or ship it for you, that‚Äôs all on you.

Due to this, online sellers generally work with multiple warehouse/fulfillment providers. These are called Third Party Logistics providers (3PL‚Äôs) and they not only store the inventory but also ‚ÄúPick, Pack, &amp; Ship‚Äù the products to the customers.

As you can imagine, when you have orders coming from a variety of different marketplaces, being placed by customers all around the country/world, and you‚Äôre working with a variety of fulfillment centers across the map‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a heavy lift. Thus, managing all of this requires software solutions that integrate everything together. Enter Stamps.com

**Imitate Zuckerberg. Buy Everyone.**

If you didn‚Äôt know, Stamps.com owns ShipStation, ShippingEasy, ShipWorks, ShipEngine, Endicia, and a variety of other hugely popular shipping and logistics platforms used throughout the eCommerce industry.

If you sell online it‚Äôs pretty likely you‚Äôve used one of their solutions to manage your shipping/logistics. For example, everyone knows Shopify but if you go look at the most installed/most reviewed shipping apps on Shopify you‚Äôll see some familiar names: ShipStation, ShipWorks, and ShippingEasy. Same thing if you look at the most popular eCommerce shipping software somewhere like G2 Crowd or Capterra. Stamps.com doesn‚Äôt just own one of the players in the space, they own 3 of the top 5 players.

Stamps.com also owns a pretty cool company called ShipEngine.ShipEngine is basically the eCommerce shipping API, think stripe but for shipping. The ShipEngine API allows connections to over 30 different shipping providers (UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL‚Ä¶) in North America, Europe, and Australia. This allows you to not only instantly get shipping labels for orders but also compare shipping costs and rates in real-time.

Need to ship a 12x12x6 box that weighs 3 lbs to a customer in Orlando? ShipEngine can help you determine that it‚Äôs best to route that order to your Atlanta warehouse 3PL and ship it via FedEx to save $4 compared to the second-best solution. Now a 10x6x4 box that weighs 1 lb headed to San Diego? Route it from the LA warehouse, ship via USPS, you get the picture. It‚Äôs a pretty robust solution and used by some pretty big players, for example, Facebook Marketplace and Facebook Shops both use the ShipEngine API for managing all their label printing, shipping, etc ShipEngine makes money every time someone compares rates, prints a label, validates an address, uses order tracking...

**It‚Äôs A Sticky Business**

First off it‚Äôs pretty obvious owning a SAAS company is a better business model than reselling postage at a small markup. It doesn't cost a lot to add another user account to your software and honestly, once you've integrated something into your logistics tech stack, you're gonna need a REALLY good reason to change it out because it‚Äôs a pain in the butt.

This gives Stamps.com an insane amount of price elasticity. In addition to this, once you start taking market share in this industry it causes somewhat of a flywheel or snowball effect.

For example, eCommerce sellers use ShipStation so they want to work with 3PL‚Äôs that understand and have integrated ShipStation into their operations. Due to this, the 3PL‚Äôs themselves are motivated to adopt ShipStation into their tech stack as well. Now when a new eCommerce seller is looking into what solution to use, they see all the warehouse providers are using ShipStation so they go with that as well. It‚Äôs like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

This long-term inertia and stickiness are likely why the monthly pricing on solutions like ShipStation are so low.  Once they ‚Äúown the market‚Äù they can pretty much raise the prices to whatever they want and the customers won‚Äôt go anywhere.

Personal Anecdote: Hopefully someone else who's in the eCommerce industry can back up some of the stuff I‚Äôve mentioned above but just for some background I‚Äôve been in the ‚Äúecom‚Äù space for around 10 years. Founded a few startups, two of which were acquired over the last 5 years (I‚Äôm not talking unicorn level acquisitions btw, more so acquired by PE firms doing roll-ups and stacking EBITDA kind of level.) That said I currently work as a managing partner for a portfolio company that owns/operates a handful of consumer brands that drive a substantial portion of their top-line revenue via third-party marketplaces so I‚Äôm in this space 60+ hours a week on the strategy side. All of this is just to say that I know we aren't switching any of our brands off ShipStation, even if they 10x their prices. Also, when you own the actual API (ShipEngine) that your competitors are building their software solutions on top of, you‚Äôve essentially built a monopoly in the first place, how much of a competitor are they really if you don‚Äôt want them to be...

**Boring Financial Stuff**

So one of the reasons I think Stamps.com doesn‚Äôt actually mind flying under the radar is due to the fact the company is already printing money. Not often are SAAS companies, growing at a crazy pace, in a booming industry, actually generate a ton of free cash flow and sitting on excess cash on their balance sheet. If you‚Äôre like most growth companies in the SAAS space you‚Äôre operating at a loss. You need to ‚Äúhype‚Äù your business up to keep your share price high so you can issue shares and generate cash for operations, a simple game.

When it comes to STMP that‚Äôs not the case. Looking at Q3 2020 alone, STMP generated $194 million in revenue (compared to $136 in Q3 2019.) Additionally, their profitability skyrocketed as well from $9 million in Q3 2019 to $64 million in Q3 2020. A combination of the jump in eCommerce as a whole and the natural margin expansion you‚Äôll see while transitioning from a reseller of postage to a SAAS provider. This left them with a ton of excess cash on the books at the end of Q3, sitting on nearly $400 million.

When you start looking at their valuation it‚Äôs pretty obvious wall street hasn‚Äôt quite caught on to the shift in their business model from reselling stamps to being a profitable SAAS company in the eCommerce space which seems to have a pretty nice macro tailwind behind it.

Trading at a PE ratio in the low 30‚Äôs and a PS ratio around 7, even moderate growth trends make it seem cheap. This is only compounded by the fact that you‚Äôve got other players like Shopify trading at PE ratios of 900+ and PS ratios of 70+.

**The Cherry On Top**

So one of the main reasons I wanted to get this DD published so I could reap the karma if what I‚Äôm about to lay out here actually comes to fruition. The earnings report is Wednesday so wanted to make sure I got this posted prior to that call.

One reason I believe Stamps.com trades at such a low valuation is due to the fact that the company's name is literally, Stamps.com. It‚Äôs probably the same reason some people opened this thread ready to laugh at whatever they thought this DD was going to be about.

That said, I think the name might actually be changing soon which could be the start of a rebrand of the company to not only wall street but the public as a whole.

Stamps.com acquired the trademarks to Auctane back when they acquired ShipStation in 2014 as that‚Äôs the original holding company name for ShipStation. If you search Auctane on Google you won‚Äôt really find much but that‚Äôs due to the odd fact that they‚Äôre actually blocking google from indexing Auctane.com via a robots ‚Äúnoindex‚Äù tag on the domain. Here‚Äôs a screenshot but you can obviously check the source code yourself. [https://i.imgur.com/4tMd6EA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4tMd6EA.jpg)

Until September 2020, Auctane.com was just redirecting to the homepage of ShipStation but as of a couple of months ago there‚Äôs a brand new website built out that encompasses the ‚Äúbrand‚Äù for all the eCommerce software solutions they own and you start noticing it being mentioned in randomly press releases as a ‚Äúparent company‚Äù signing leases on office etc.  You can see when it was updated on the Wayback machine here: [https://web.archive.org/web/20201115000000\*/https://auctane.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201115000000*/https://auctane.com/)

Obviously, this in itself doesn‚Äôt mean anything but it seems a little suspicious that they would be blocking Google from indexing the website. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they spin out all the eCommerce focused SAAS companies to the Auctane parent or potentially even rebrand the entire company as a way to shed the stigma of just selling stamps online.

**Wrap-Up:**

I could probably write out 3 more pages explaining what I believe to be some of the competitive advantages they have in the space but I'm lazy and hopefully, this is enough to at least get the conversation rolling on why wall street may be fundamentally looking at the company wrong.

IMO they‚Äôre poised to be the solution for global multi-channel e-commerce shipping and fulfillment. If they changed their company name to something other than Stamps.com my guess is the street would be throwing cash at them like there's no tomorrow.

**‚ÄúWhy Should Anyone Listen To You? What Credentials Do You Have?‚Äù**

From an investing standpoint, literally none. I‚Äôm not an investment professional, investment banker, analyst, etc. That said I‚Äôve worked hand in hand with most companies that service the eCommerce industry over the last 10 years.

Bitcoin,The infinite leverage glitch that is $MSTR,"This is the theoretical series of steps that leads to them abusing infinite leverage against the Fed:

1. They get some money.
2. They use this money to purchase bitcoins, an amazing highly volatile asset.
3. Now, if bitcoin goes up, they're allowed to (privately) borrow some more money from a hedge fund, since their net assets are higher.
4. The hedge fund is willing to do this, because they quickly wrap this debt up into a CDO or ABS that they sell to a bond fund, that is now backstopped by the Fed.
5. Now that MSTR borrowed more money, what do they do?
6. Go back to step 2.

This is exactly like the infinite leverage Robinhood glitch this guy found a while ago: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/do-not-try-this-at-home-how-to-turn-3000-into-17-million-2019-11-06](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/do-not-try-this-at-home-how-to-turn-3000-into-17-million-2019-11-06)

... except with the Fed instead of Robinhood.

It could go tits up when Bitcoin goes down enough. Until then, the stonk (and Bitcoin) only goes up.

dogecoin,Crypto the new Gold Standard,"I was never in crypto before, until I discovered Doge and read a bit about crypto . Currently the world currencies are printed as needed, stimulus checks, help for companies during pandemic etc. Does anyone an idea where this money is coming from and who will pay back and to whom? Since they stopped with the Gold Standard in the 70s/80s there is no real control on how much US$ , ‚Ç¨ etc are in the world. The coins and paper-money yes, but not the online money, or virtual money. If I understand correctly with  crypto we know the exact amount that is in the world? So by enabling e.g. Doge to be used to buy online or maybe later in store we would create a currency . Doge is still mainly a virtual thing. In my view we need to have a lot of shops etc where we can pay in Doge and a stable value. There will be changes in the value , but it  should not be 100+ % , but bay in a 10% max. Only then it will be a real currency. And that might be u/elonmusk idea. Which is very smart, the currency we use now in daily purchases is out of control, and that is why Elon will give $ for Dogecoin. And Doge will only work if 80%+ are in the hands of millions, 20% in whales, which will have the job of the Federal reserve. Doge will raise , but should be levelled at around 1 Euro or USD . What would help if Doge-wallets could be used in Paypal , Amazon etc. I am just starting in crypto , so maybe I am on a complete wrong track.

-	7%, while not a great rate, is much lower than 16-20%. Is there something I‚Äôm missing in this calculation that would make it worse?

personalfinance,Does payroll consider the standard deduction when holding taxes?,"I make $117.9K/yr on salary and am changing up my 401k contributions. I wanted to see what a paycheck would look like so I went over to PayCheckCity and ran a mock up.

I'm 31 y/o and single and will claim the standard deduction.

In the calculator I put that pay is bi-weekly and the first check is 15 Jan 2021. I added in a single deduction which is my 401k and selected 12% of gross pay and that it's exempt from federal/state/local taxes but not FICA.

What I got out was:

* Federal Withholding: $691.71
* SS: $281.27
* Medicare: $65.78
* State: $209.70
* 401k: $544.15

The 401k lines up ($117.9K * 0.12 = $14148 / 26 = $544.15), but I cannot figure how Federal Withholding was determined. As I understand it from the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes), is that I would compute my income like so:

* $117.9K - $14148 = $103752 (pretax deductions)
* $103752 - $12K = $91752 (standard deduction)

So assuming I take the standard deduction for a single filer, my taxable income is $91752. From here I can compute my liability using the 2021 tables:

* $91752 - $86350 = $5402
* $5402 * 0.24 = $1296.48
* $13293 + $1296.48 = $14589.48

So my tax liability for 2021 would be $14589.48, but my paychecks would have $691.71 withheld per check, over 26 pay periods that's $17984.46, or $3394.98 overpaid.

CryptoCurrency,How much do you really know about the cryptocurrencies you own? (a long discussion on psychological bias),"If I were to ask you, for each cryptocurrency you hold, what are the top 5 things that convinced you to purchase that crypto, what kind of answers would you have?

**Alright, before I get too deep in this post, I want to mention that I myself am fairly new to crypto. The last thing I want to do is give financial advice to anybody, or pretend like I am anything close to an expert on cryptocurrency. I** ***do*** **want to give you some advice on critical thinking, though. While I am fairly new to crypto, I believe some of the thoughts and observations I'm about to share with you could be useful for some people. So, here goes.**

Ask yourself, as honestly as you can: what percentage of your confidence and belief in the cryptos you hold ultimately comes from an aggregate impression you got from reading comments, in places like this sub, written by people who sound smart, or sound like they did their own research and are well-informed and trustworthy?

Everybody has heard DYOR a thousand times. But this is a bull market. Things move fast, and FOMO is strong. So you probably plan on doing your own research, but right now, you mainly want to get the scoop on which coins are good as fast as possible from other people who seem like they know what they're talking about, so you can build your portfolio ASAP before you miss out on gains.

So, what's wrong with that? Isn't trusting the general consensus of better-informed people a decent way to form beliefs? Well, in general it's pretty solid. If 3 of your roommates are history majors and they all tell you that the Battle of Hastings happened in 1066 when you ask them, it is reasonable to assume that is true. They have no reason to mislead you, and aren't likely to all be incorrect. If Wikipedia tells you that carbon has 6 electrons, you should probably believe that to be true without needing to pull out an electron microscope. Many others have already checked, and there is no reason to believe they want to misinform you.

Crypto is a little different, though. This is a market, and money is in play. In a cryptocurrency community (or in any market speculation or investing community) **everything that is said inherently has some bias**.

I'm not talking about explicit shills (people who are consciously trying to manipulate people's feelings and opinions for personal gain) or people that are trying to cause pump-and-dumps by making youtube videos about the next coin that will x100, etc. We all already know about these people. You have already read countless warnings about these people. You already know to be skeptical of anyone making extraordinary claims, or putting in tremendous effort to convince others of their opinion on some coin. This post is not about those people.

I'm talking about the honest, well-intentioned, and often well-informed people that make up a large part of this sub, and other crypto subs. Realize that nearly everything that is said here will have some degree of bias, no matter how trustworthy the person is who said it. I am not trying to throw shade on all the good people here, doing their best to spread only facts and kindness to the less-experienced. I am not calling them dishonest. I am not recommending you disregard what they say.

Here's what I'm getting at: **it is in the financial best interest of every single person holding a given asset for new people to buy that asset.** Does that mean that everything said here promoting some crypto is false? No, not even close. Does that mean that most people here are trying to manipulate you? No, not even close. What it does mean, though, is that every single person in the game experiences **subconscious psychological pressure** to give a positive impression of the coins they hold to others. This is further compounded by the psychological nature of **hope** and **wishful thinking**, which even the most experienced investors are not immune to.

This positive bias effect is especially pronounced in subs dedicated to a single cryptocurrency. These subs, while containing all kinds of excellent and accurate information, are nevertheless always heavily biased towards the positive, due to hope, the echo-chamber effect, confirmation bias, and the inherent incentive that anyone holding a coin has for others to buy that same type of coin.

Now, lots of people are aware of the psychological pressure towards bias that they have, and do excellent jobs of mitigating that thanks to self-awareness and intellectual honesty. However, that doesn't change the overall, **statistical** fact that in such a community, there will be a non-zero bias towards the positive. For example, if, for some coin, the most rational, unbiased, and realistic possible sentiment is 70% optimism and 30% caution, the sub for that coin will have something skewed relative to that, like 90% optimism and 10% caution.

r/CryptoCurrency is about every cryptocurrency, which helps to mitigate the echo-chamber effect with regards to individual cryptos. However, since the whole crypto market moves together, it is true that for anybody invested in crypto, there is incentive towards spreading positivity about crypto in general, which, again, leads to unintentional psychological bias. This fosters a general **culture of positivity**, that is well-insulated due to the echo-chamber effect. Positivity is helpful and healthy for cryptocurrency at large, and I encourage it. However, in the privacy of your own mind, when choosing to buy a speculative asset, you should strive to be **realistic**, not positive.

One more thing I want to mention is the **Dunning-Kruger** **effect**, which basically says that beginners who have learned a little about some field or topic tend to have a very over-inflated sense of how much they know. Meanwhile, people with moderate experience know enough to realize that their knowledge is dwarfed by their ignorance, and these people often underestimate how much they know about the topic. Finally, as people become true experts, their estimation of their own knowledge approaches reality.

In cryptocurrency, the Dunning-Kruger effect is most likely quite extreme. Emotions like excitement, greed, and fear cloud people's judgment of their own expertise. Beginners who are near the top of the Dunning-Kruger curve tend to be particularly loud, due to their hyperinflated confidence, while those who are further along the curve are often more quiet, because they are self-aware enough to doubt their own knowledge. Try to keep this in mind.

In conclusion, I want to mention that I am not trying to FUD cryptocurrency whatsoever. I think it has a very bright future, and I wish nothing more than for it to grow beyond our wildest dreams. I just want people to be aware that nothing and nobody in a community like this is immune to psychological bias, no matter their intentions. It is important to approach things as a skeptic, and make sure you have plenty of grains of salt to take when needed. DYOR isn't just important because of all the people out there trying to deceive you. It is also important because we are all human, and even the best, most well-intentioned people among us cannot truly escape our own bias. In a community like this, the overall average sentiment will **always** be biased towards the positive, even if every single one of us is honest and has good intentions. There is inherent, built-in psychological pressure that pushes sentiment upwards, and no corresponding built-in pressure to push sentiment downwards.

So, try to learn about your cryptos while relying as little as possible on the general consensus and sentiment of others. Challenge yourself to gain enough depth of knowledge on each of your coins that you can give a comprehensive and technical rundown of what that cryptocurrency has to offer, and why you think it will likely succeed. The more you can stand on your own two feet when it comes to crypto knowledge, the more immunity you will have to the biases of others, and the easier it will be to find the courage to hold during dips and bear markets, since you will have well-informed confidence in your picks. Deep knowledge of your cryptos will also give you the insight to recognize when a project is likely dying and not just experiencing a normal downturn, so that you can exit your position intelligently, without having to wait for the advice of others who have already exited their positions.

Please don't take away from this that I think you should automatically distrust what people tell you in this and other crypto communities. That is not at all what I am trying to convey. This community is an excellent resource, and the information spread by the experienced people here is invaluable. I just want you to realize that you and everyone here are subject to psychological biases. Awareness of and resistance towards these biases put you in a better position to make good decisions. The best way to gain independence from the biases of others and the community at large is to truly take DYOR to heart.

Good luck everyone. I hope all your cryptos soar, whether or not you have done your own due diligence!

stocks,17 Investment Principles from Warren Buffett and the late Benjamin Graham,"While many may argue that value investing doesn't make sense anymore, a lot of the rules and investment principles from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham stand the test of time, especially when you apply current nuance to their original investment rules (which are now close to a century-old)...

**Disclaimer:** The views below represent the opinions of the OP and are supported by research from Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis from 1934 and The Intelligent Investor from 1949, along with Google and Yahoo Finance and public statements from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. These investment principles do not constitute investment advice, but rather are general principles one might employ in reaching his or her overall financial goals. *All* investing bears risk, including possible loss of capital.

**#1 Create a healthy balance in your portfolio between risky and less risky investments**

*‚ÄúFurthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.‚Äù ‚Äì quote from Benjamin Graham*

A conservative investor may have 50% of his or her portfolio in risky assets like stocks and real estate and 50% in less risky investments like US treasury bonds (which you can buy either directly from the US Treasury or through ETFs like Charles Schwab Short Term Treasuries ETF (Ticker: SCHO) as well as through investments in gold (SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD)) which tends to be a good portfolio hedge against volatile markets and inflation (at least historically).

Benjamin Graham‚Äôs formula for calculating the percentage of assets that should be in risky vs. less-risky investments is to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your assets in risky investments (like stocks), with the rest in relatively safer assets like cash and gold. For instance, if you are 35 years old, you might invest 65% of your investible assets (not including savings) into risky assets like stocks and 35% of your investible assets in less volatile assets like cash (USD/euro or another stable currency) and gold. A 70-year-old, on the other hand, would only invest 30% (rather than 65%) of his or her assets in risky investments (like stocks) and the balance in more stable assets like cash (again, assuming the cash is in US dollar, euros or another relatively stable ‚Äúlow‚Äù inflation currency.)

Benjamin Graham formula for proper investment portfolio balance:

100 ‚Äì your age = risky assets (such as stocks), with the balance in less risky assets

Of note, most of us might categorize real estate investments as safe investments (which may be the case relative to stocks). That said, as Benjamin Graham reminded us over half a century before the 2007-2008 Great Recession, *‚ÄúUnfortunately, real-estate values are also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location, price paid, etc.‚Äù* With most financial assets being highly correlated these days due to the high interconnectivity of markets and economies, there are few truly uncorrelated and riskless assets. Real estate prices are as high as ever in 2021 thanks to over a decade of easy monetary policy, along with a dwindling inventory of available homes for sale in the US.

**#2 Have an emergency fund**

*‚ÄúThe unexpected can strike anyone, at any age. Everyone must keep some assets in the riskless haven of cash.‚Äù Quote from Benjamin Graham*

We never know when emergencies may strike. We might be fired. Our division at work might be cut. Our spouse or child may experience a significant setback. The 2020 Year from Hell and Covid-19 should remind the world and each of us that disaster can strike at a moment‚Äôs notice. We must be prepared for these uncertainties. While volunteering at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), a patient once inadvertently taught the author of this piece, Henry Gindt, to ‚Äúalways expect the unexpected.‚Äù This particular patient happened to be in the hospital following a heart attack‚Ä¶in his mid-40s‚Ä¶as a marathon runner. (As a side-note, some of the best life lessons and principles can be learned through volunteering. If 2020 taught us anything, it might be that there are plenty of our fellow men and women out there who could use a helping hand. Find a great volunteer opportunity near me.) ‚ÄúEmergencies‚Äù happen all the time in life. Oftentimes these emergencies spill over into the financial side of the house. Vanguard Investments suggests as a rule of thumb to maintain at least 3-6 months of income in such an emergency fund in order to cover things like food, mortgage payments/rent, credit card bills, and ongoing health insurance or COBRA in the event of a lost job. This emergency fund should not be invested except in low-risk securities like US Treasuries.

**#3 Choose ETFs over individual stocks**

*‚ÄúThere are two ways to be an intelligent investor: by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds; or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).‚Äù Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Broad market ETFs can curb our emotional impulses to buy and sell to some degree as these broad market index funds are less volatile than most any single individual security. The framework around how we might build an optimal portfolio might be to create balance in your portfolio by 1) conducting ongoing and rigorous homework analyzing stocks (‚Äúactive investor‚Äù) or by selecting a few ETFs and dollar-cost-averaging your investments into these funds over time (see points below). In the Intelligent Investor‚Äôs prologue, Warren Buffett reminds us that ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework.‚Äù

Step 1 might be to determine a fixed split between risky and less risky assets as part of your investment portfolio (perhaps using Graham‚Äôs formula above based on your age).

Step 2 might then be to select a few US and world market ETFs.

This approach might be thought of as setting your portfolio on autopilot as Graham suggests. Some example ETFs offering broad market exposure to US markets include ETFs under the tickers SPY (S&amp;P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) and DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global markets and global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX). These ETFs can be purchased through whichever financial app you use: You Invest (JPMorgan), Fidelity, E\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, or any other.

This simple framework may likely do the trick in meeting your financial goals (as well as outperforming any active portfolio management you might pursue). See also how the KISS principle might relate to other areas of your life.

**#4 If you insist on owning individual stocks (active investor) vs. ETFs (passive investor), create a well-balanced and diversified portfolio**

*‚ÄúGraham‚Äôs guideline of owning between 10 and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors who want to pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you are not overexposed to one industry.‚Äù Quote from Jason Zweig*

If you insist on picking your own stocks vs. using a basket of stocks through ETFs, try to have between 10-30 stocks to get the benefit of good diversification and do not choose all of these stocks from the same industry. A well-balanced portfolio means selecting at least 10 stocks from at least 3 or 4 different industries, according to Graham. For instance, you might balance some investments in high-growth technology sectors with conservative non-cyclical companies that likely pay dividends and have stable growth such as the best healthcare and insurance companies (what some think of as ‚Äúboring‚Äù companies). Experts disagree on how many stocks you must own to have a well-diversified portfolio, but the benefits of diversification tend to experience diminishing marginal benefit as you go over 30 stocks. Additionally, your life becomes increasingly complicated if you are actively managing 30+ stocks. Hedge fund professionals spend 100% of their work time focused on tracking their investments. Do you have time to dedicate 40-60 hours+/ week on researching and monitoring your portfolio? If so, and for advanced investors, including hedge fund traders, you might read Benjamin Graham‚Äôs textbook Security Analysis. It is quite amazing how few professional investors on Wall Street and elsewhere have ever read Security Analysis. Graham reminds us that:

*There is a close logical connection between the concept of a safety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correlative with the other. Even with a margin in the investor‚Äôs favor, an individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees only that he has a better chance for profit than for loss‚Äînot that loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting business.*

**#5 Don‚Äôt overpay for stocks (or real-estate investments, cryptocurrency or any other investment)**

*‚ÄúThe investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last twelve-month period.‚Äù Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Don‚Äôt overpay for stocks just because momentum is good for the moment. In fact, Graham suggested paying an average P/E multiple of 12-13 across an intelligent investor‚Äôs portfolio with a maximum P/E of 15 for any individual security. While these P/E ratios are likely overly conservative and represent outdated valuation rules of thumb in the era of pre-rapid technology innovation/adoption and hyper-globalization, one shouldn‚Äôt simply ignore a company‚Äôs current and future earnings prospects in assigning a value. Benjamin Graham reminds us that ‚Äúthe time everyone decides that a given industry is ‚Äòobviously‚Äô the best one to invest in, the prices of its stocks \[or other assets\] have been bid up so high that its future returns have nowhere to go but down.‚Äù (See points below on analyzing company fundamentals including both value and growth). If you are investing in some of the latest technology stocks or household name companies like Tesla, Uber, AirBNB, Poshmark, etc., you might notice that the P/E multiple is either non-existent or extremely high. This is because the company is not yet earning much (or any) profit. Instead, the market is valuing the company based on its growth profile which, over time, assuming all goes according to plan, will turn into healthy earnings and profit. However, the second the growth assumptions are tweaked by equity research analysts on Wall St. (or a string of bad news hits the company, its industry or the market overall), the initial rosy valuation assumptions of these high-growth/loss-making companies will swiftly be revised downwards, leading to an almost immediate or rapid decline in value. The collapse in value of your securities and investments will be at least twice as painful as the pleasure from the ride up, according to world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Importantly, never forget that the rosy growth assumptions under which are investing today may experience a sharp reversal when you have ceased actively monitoring these investments months or years later. Even if you choose to become an active investor (rather than a passive investor primarily invested in ETFs), by the time the bad news hits, the damage will already be done due to the rapid price movements following breaking news.

Graham and many other notable investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, billionaire and founder of the investment firm Baupost Group, often speak of creating ‚Äúmargin of safety‚Äù when making investments by buying significantly below a company‚Äôs intrinsic value. This built-in ‚Äúpricing buffer‚Äù creates some wiggle room and margin for when things don‚Äôt work out as planned, as they inevitably do in both financial markets and life more generally. Graham tells us that ‚ÄúIf the purchases are made at the average level of the market over a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assurance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors lies in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market, or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more than average risk of diminished earning power.‚Äù In other words, Graham himself speaks to the value of dollar-cost-averaging, where the intelligent investor is consistently buying over time, during good times, as well as during bad times.

The Acorns investment app is an interesting app that can help smooth the average ‚Äúbuy-in price‚Äù to avoid concentrating investments when markets are hot and selling when markets are depressed by trickling in investments consistently every day/week/month without any active engagement‚Ä¶over decades. This ‚Äúdollar-cost-averaging‚Äù approach is likely a much better approach for most all of us in the long run, particularly those of us with a few decades to go until retirement. Consider using investment apps like Acorns or talk to your investment advisor about dollar-cost averaging your investments each week or month.  **This is NOT a plug for Acorns specifically - only for the importance of dollar-cost-averaging. If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**

**#6 Focus on the ‚Äúfundamentals‚Äù (earnings and growth) assuming you choose to be an active investor as opposed to a passive investor**

*‚ÄúExperience has shown that in most cases safety resides in the earning power, and if this is deficient the assets lose most of their reputed value.‚Äù Benjamin Graham*

Companies like Amazon, Google and Apple are now worth over $1 trillion each as their earnings power is so solid and market dominance so secure (for now). In the case of Google, for example, the company prints billions of dollars annually from Google Ads alone. When selecting individual stocks, focus on the earnings power and repeatability of those earnings in a normal year (‚Äúnormalized earnings‚Äù). Also, pay close attention to the company‚Äôs growth prospects. Growth is a much more important factor in the 2020s due to the current pace of globalization compared with Benjamin Graham‚Äôs era where markets weren‚Äôt as interconnected and the United States market offered nearly all the great investment opportunities in his day.

Graham‚Äôs formula for selecting growth-oriented companies (as opposed to value-oriented companies below) is Value = Current (Normal) Earnings √ó (8.5 plus twice the expected annual growth rate), where the annual growth rate can reasonably be expected from the company for at least 7 to 10 years. This formula might be revised to reflect current growth and technology assumptions. However, having some sort of investment formula (which perhaps you develop) as a guide might come in handy as much today as it did in 1949. If you can hold yourself to this investment formula, you might avoid serious mistakes. You might also stress test each of your stock investment ideas (or investment formula) with 2-3 trusted advisers to gain an ‚Äúoutside view.‚Äù

For more value-oriented investments, Graham lists 7 key requirements:

1. Adequate size
2. Sufficiently strong financial condition
3. Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years
4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years
5. Ten-year growth of at least one-third in per-share earnings
6. Price of stock no more than 1¬Ω times net asset value
7. Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
8. In developing your own formula for investing in today‚Äôs markets, you might take some example key requirements above and revise them to fit your investment strategy.

**#7 Have patience. (This is hard. Very hard. Extremely hard.)**

*‚ÄúA defensive investor runs‚Äîand wins‚Äîthe race by sitting still. Patience is the fund investor‚Äôs single most powerful ally.‚Äù Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

When markets are panicking and you don‚Äôt know what to do, do nothing. Panicking only makes matters worse as you try to sell or make other rash decisions. The Intelligent Investor is patient and knows that the best investment holding period is forever, followed by a lifetime, followed by 30 years, followed by 10 years, followed by 3-5 years, followed by at least 1 year in order to reap the capital gains tax benefits (see point below on optimizing taxes). Benjamin Graham reminds us that *‚ÄúIn the financial markets, the worse the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be.‚Äù*

**#8 Set rules for when to sell**

*‚ÄúReversals \[of fortune\] will have more meaning for the active than for the passive investor. But they suggest that even defensive portfolios should be changed from time to time, especially if the securities purchased have an apparently excessive advance and can be replaced by issues much more reasonably priced.‚Äù Quote from Benjamin Graham*

*It may be assumed that a stern and uniform policy of selling at 25% or 30% profit will work out best as applied to many holdings.‚Äù Quotes from Benjamin Graham*

Set rules for when to sell such as after a certain time period has elapsed (say 2-5 years) or profit goal or loss limit has been reached. Instituting rules such as selling all securities at a 30%/50%/100%/3x etc. profit (or at a 10%/30% loss to cap losses) can take some of the emotion out of investing. Make sure whatever specific goal you set when making the investment in a stock(s) or other security aligns with your long-term financial goals. Setting rules on the front-end that align well with your overall long-term financial goals should include setting rules for both downside scenarios and upside scenarios. The best financial and investment apps are pretty good about making it easy to set ‚Äústop losses‚Äù or sell at a predetermined profit level. We might also be reminded by Benjamin Graham‚Äôs most famous student, Warren Buffett, about the two key rules of avoiding loss of principal so that you can stay in the game: #1 Don‚Äôt lose money and #2 See rule #1.

Some of the best online trading apps and investment apps include Fidelity, E\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, You Invest (JPMorgan), Charles Schwab and Ally Invest. If you don‚Äôt have time to do the arduous and consistent research required on the 10-30 stocks in your balanced investment portfolio, a better approach is to use the Acorns app which automates your investments into the most well-known and diversified ETFs from Vanguard.  **If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**

**#9 Don‚Äôt chase the latest shining star**

*‚ÄúWhat you don‚Äôt do is as important to your success as what you do. The lesson is clear: Don‚Äôt just do something, stand there. It‚Äôs time for everyone to acknowledge that the term ‚Äòlong-term investor‚Äô is redundant. A long-term investor is the only kind of investor there is. Someone who can‚Äôt hold on to stocks for more than a few months at a time is doomed to end up not as a victor but as a victim.‚Äù Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Don‚Äôt jump on the latest stock or other ‚Äúhot‚Äù investment bandwagon. If the stock is front-page news all over the world and is skyrocketing, it is 9 times out of 10 too late to get onboard for profit. Momentum plays a big role in stock prices in the short term, but over the long run, a company is valued on its earnings and growth trajectory. Oftentimes, technology companies receive such a lofty valuation based on future growth expectations, such as Tesla‚Äôs historic rise in 2020. If growth does not end up meeting these expectations, you can expect a company‚Äôs publicly traded valuation to decline as quickly as it rose. 

**#10 Ignore ‚Äúthe charts‚Äù**

*‚ÄúIf you look at a large quantity of data long enough, a huge number of patterns will emerge‚Äîif only by chance.‚Äù Quote from Benjamin Graham*

The only metrics you should be focused on are the fundamentals of the company (earning and growth). Many investors these days are fixated on ‚Äúthe charts‚Äù such as various moving averages. These are all non-sense. These charts are simply reflections of the latest emotion of an entire market consisting of billions of people reacting to the latest positive or negative news. Ignore these human emotions masquerading as indicators and charts. They will not serve you well in the end. Benjamin Graham refers frequently to the stock market as the emotional and moody ‚ÄúMr. Market,‚Äù which is subject to the daily whims and emotions of‚Ä¶the people trading the stocks on the market. Are there market dislocations and can some investors make money by spotting those temporary market anomalies and market dislocations? Sure. Can they do so repeatedly and consistently over time such that they beat the overall stock market? Many experts think not. In fact, Barrons‚Äô research showed that hedge funds only beat the market by an average of 1.5% annually over the past 20 years. After subtracting the 2% annual fees these investment managers charge the pensions and endowments which are their own investors, they lose money. Think you can beat the average hedge fund manager? Statistically, it‚Äôs possible. For a while. Until you don‚Äôt. See later points on automating portions (or a substantial amount) of your investments. As humans, we all like crunching data and seeking out patterns. It‚Äôs usually not wise in the realm of public markets investing.

**#11 Look for large undervalued companies**

*""The market is fond of making mountains out of molehills. If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will undervalue‚Äîrelatively, at least‚Äîcompanies that are out of favor because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature."" - Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

Hunt for true bargains. Graham defines a true bargain as a company that is currently trading at a 50% or more discount from its inherent/intrinsic value. For instance, Facebook was a good example of an interesting investment opportunity for growth at a reasonable price (GARP) during the major market crash in 2020 and when the company made global headlines for it‚Äôs privacy issues. See the referenced two major dips on Google Finance here. The global food giant Wal-Mart provides another good example of a value-oriented investment with a healthy long-term dividend. Wal-Mart was trading in the low $80s/ share in 2018 when Amazon was soaring. Check Wal-Mart today. As conventional wisdom goes, markets tend to overcorrect during negative news cycles and overbuy/overpay when the sky is blue, the sun is out and wind behind the sails is plentiful.

**#12 Expect market volatility (and have nerves of steel during this time)**

*‚ÄúIn any case the investor may as well resign himself in advance to the probability rather than the mere possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more from their high point at various periods in the next five years.*

*In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave.‚Äù Quotes from Benjamin Graham*

Manage your emotions. If you can‚Äôt (like most all of us), read the following two points on micromanaging investments and market volatility. Re-read them. Then, re-read them again. Jason Zweig points to the work of world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, whose studies have shown that we experience negative emotions and pain from loss twice as intensely as we experience joy and pleasure from gain. This ‚Äúloss aversion‚Äù principle applies not only to financial markets but to many aspects of life. You might check out Daniel Kahneman‚Äôs bestseller Thinking Fast and Slow to dig deeper into these psychological forces that influence how we react and behave every day. Markets will inevitably decline, sometimes by as much as 50% or more. Remain focused on the long-run by having nerves of steel. Remember the 2007-2008 Great Recession and the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic and analyze those stock market dips in the context of current market prices. Graham reminds us that:

*For indeed, the investor‚Äôs chief problem‚Äîand even his worst enemy‚Äîis likely to be himself. (‚ÄúThe fault, dear \[investor/Brutus\], is not in our stars‚Äî\[and not in our stocks\]‚Äîbut in ourselves‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚Äì William Shakespeare). We have seen much more money made and kept by ‚Äúordinary people‚Äù who were temperamentally well suited for the investment process than by those who lacked this quality, even though they had an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-market lore.*

**#13 Do not micromanage your investments**

*‚ÄúIt is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds (less risky) to stocks (more risky) in the investor‚Äôs portfolio.‚Äù- Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

Avoiding micromanaging of investments ties into the point above on keeping emotions in check. You might focus on rebalancing your portfolio between risky and less risky assets 1-2 times/ year rather than choosing new stocks endlessly throughout the year. Graham proposes a rule of thumb for maintaining a split in your portfolio of 100 ‚Äì your age in risky assets (like stocks) and the balance in less risky assets like treasuries, cash and gold. Spending your time balancing and rebalancing your investment portfolio 1-2 times a year, for instance, is likely far better than readjusting your portfolio daily or weekly, which is a common investment mistake made by the best of us and is largely based on human emotion and current market news and headlines rather than based on sound financial analysis.

Don‚Äôt overreact to the headlines. Everyone sees the headline and sells or buys depending on whether the headline was positive or negative. Challenge yourself to take a strong mental note (or better yet keep a log of your notes) and consider the particular headline in light of all the other news and headlines the next time you rebalance your portfolio (at most 1-2x/ year). Ben Graham reminds us that *‚Äúmost businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse. The investor need not watch his companies‚Äô performance like a hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time. Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal.‚Äù* In other words, you might take a contrarian approach when looking for interesting market dislocations.

**#14 Automate. Automate. Automate.**

*‚ÄúIt is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the investor‚Äôs portfolio.‚Äù Quote from Benjamin Graham*

*‚ÄúIf your investment horizon is long‚Äîat least 25 or 30 years‚Äîthere is only one sensible approach: Buy every month, automatically, and whenever else you can spare some money.‚Äù Quote from Jason Zweig.*

Choose a financial investment app like Acorns to mechanize and automate the process of investing. If you are starting out investing in your 20s or 30s, you will have plenty of decades for the markets to work for you. You might trickle in however much you can afford in order to make these investments consistently. The beauty of Acorns is you can set up a recurring investment (of say $100 per week) without having to actively remember to invest daily/weekly/monthly. A unique feature of Acorns is that you can link your credit cards so that for every purchase you make, the ‚Äúpurchase amount‚Äù is rounded up to the next dollar and instantaneously invested in a broad set of index funds. Further, you can decide whether the funds are invested in broad index funds falling into a conservative, moderate, or aggressive approach, depending on your age and financial goals. Benjamin Graham explains the concept of ‚Äúdollar-cost-averaging‚Äù (the approach used by the financial investment app Acorns), in the following way\*\*:\*\*

*‚ÄúThe third is the device of ‚Äúdollar-cost averaging,‚Äù which means simply that the practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings.‚Äù*

*You might also consider using a personal financial app like Mint from Intuit or Plaid to manage your overall financial goals, which offer tools and features like a personal budget planner, credit monitoring, and ‚Äútrack my spending.‚Äù*

**#15 Never forget the reason for investing in the first place**

*‚ÄúAfter all, the whole point of investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough money to meet your own needs.‚Äù Quote from Jason Zweig.*

Many investors focus on either getting rich or making more money than their peers or simply beating the stock market averages. These investors tend to lose sight of the overall purpose of investing. Focus on your unique goals for investing as it relates to your unique financial situation. Are you trying to meet your and your family‚Äôs financial needs for this month or this year? Are you on the verge of retirement? Are you in the prime of your career? Each person‚Äôs financial situation is unique because the timing of our financial needs depends on our situation. However, all of us might benefit from reminding ourselves why we invest in the first place. Separate from investing, it‚Äôs also worth considering how much of our time we‚Äôre willing to trade in order to earn money, oftentimes to buy things we don‚Äôt need to impress people we don‚Äôt care about impressing in the first place. Time is the most valuable asset for anyone. Invest as much as you can in yourself through ongoing education, learning, and spending time with friends and family. In terms of your financial goals, specifically, see the point above on finding and using one of the best personal finance apps like Mint or Plaid.

**#16 Understand the definition of the phrase ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù investments (as well as long-term financial goals)**

*‚ÄúPsychologists have shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the long run can be predicted from even a short series of outcomes.‚Äù Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Try to think about the ‚Äúlong-run‚Äù in blocks of 10/20/30/50 years from now, depending on your age. The two most glaring examples of ‚Äúshort-term‚Äù market disruptions in the context of true ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù investments or ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù personal or financial goals might be the 2007-2008 Great Recession or the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic (see also WHO). While both crises were undoubtedly severe during the time, markets typically recover within a decade or less. Why is this? If you consider that ‚Äúthe stock market‚Äù is simply a marketplace for buying and selling ownership interests in companies and that you can own a small sliver of the US or world economy through broad market ETFs, it might not be surprising that over time there will be growth. The aggregate of companies nearly always grows over time because the global population of people is growing and collectively building and creating new cities, companies, patents, inventions, ideas, etc. Companies routinely collapse and fall out of the various stock market indices while other companies soar. Some recent examples include Tesla being incorporated into the S&amp;P 500 in 2020 on the one hand while GE was delisted from the S&amp;P 500 in 2018 as the last of the original members of the exchange and replaced by Walgreens on the other hand. Walgreens itself may ultimately fall (or be diminished) due to competition from Amazon, which is rolling out a healthcare platform of its own with online pharmacy delivery following the acquisition of PillPack.) You might track how some of the best consumer startups from 2021 or social media 3.0 startups are doing in the year 2030. Some of these companies may appear on the Nasdaq and be household names. Others might be totally forgotten. These concrete examples of market forces represent the most authoritative definition of American capitalism or American innovation. One of Henry Gindt‚Äôs colleagues characterized the United States as the largest business incubator the world has ever known.

You can gain exposure to this collective economic growth in the United States through broad market ETFs like SPY (S&amp;P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) or DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX) which all track the collective global stock market and have close to zero fees. Benjamin Graham tells us that ‚Äúthe intelligent investor has no interest in being temporarily right.‚Äù

**#17 Tax optimize by holding investments for at least one year to reap benefits of the lower capital gains tax rate**

""*Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes."" ‚Äì Quote from Benjamin Franklin in 1789*

The long-term capital gains tax rate for 2020-2021 is 15% for most single tax filers, but is 0% if annual income is below $80,000 and 20% if annual income is over $441,450. See the IRS page on capital gains for more detail. Aside from incurring high transaction costs from daily (or otherwise frequent) stock trading, when you sell an investment prior to holding that investment for at least one year, your profit will be subject to your typical income tax rate rather than the lower capital gains tax rates above.

**Disclaimer:** The views above represent the opinions of the OP and are supported by research from Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis from 1934 and The Intelligent Investor from 1949, along with Google and Yahoo Finance and public statements from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham.

Having varying interests rates and values, I'm wondering which would be better to wait for, and which would be better to cash in now. It's hard to determine how long it takes for these to appreciate. I'm reading 17-20 years depending on when it was issued, but the bonds themselves say that they will stop gaining interest after 30 years.

If it helps contextualize, I am not in desperate need of money or anything. I would likely just invest this money further. Below are the following values for each bond that I got from a calculator.

I assume that the best course of action is to just cash in the ones that have reach their full value, instead of waiting for more interest to accrue, and wait on the ones that haven't matured yet. But the interest rate is so abysmal on some of them that it has me thinking it would be better to cash out now and invest in something with higher return.

I am in sort of a situation and have no where to turn to for help right now. I appreciate anyone's time and effort if you have any words of advice!

I attended a university 2019-2020 and then returned to the same school with intentions of attending 2020-2021. I enrolled in classes, applied for aid, and was receiving athletic scholarship. Towards the end of the semester, I made some big life changes and decided that I was going to take the spring semester (2021) off and enlist in the national guard instead. I was not aware of any debt or money owed until I tried to get my transcript to send to a school that I plan on transferring to when I return from training in the fall. This current school will not release my transcript or allow me to withdraw from the university until I pay what is owed. 

A financial counselor from the school spoke with me briefly and I was made aware of several documents that were missing and needed to be turned in in order to process any federal student aid. I am a dependent and was having to constantly bug my parents to get those documents taken care of so I could turn them in. Unfortunately, I think they were turned in too late. When I access my financial portal on the university's website, it is saying that I owe $6,600 with $900 of pending financial aid. 

When I try to take a look at my federal loans on that same portal, it tells me this: 

Federal Direct Subsidized Loan - not enrolled SP21 loans not originated end of FA20

Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan - not enrolled SP21 loans not originated end of FA20

What does this mean? Am I too late to apply for any sort of federal student loan? I have received emails from the school telling me that if I do not make a minimum payment, that my debt will be sent to collections. I am afraid that I will not be able to ship out to basic training if I have debt in collections. But I also do not have $6,600 just sitting around as I am unemployed and supposed to be leaving for basic training in a month. Can I apply or a private student loan to cover this even though I am not currently in school?

dogecoin,A little story about my HLOD,"1 bought about $100 worth of Bitcoin back in 2017 and it dipped so low that I got so fed up, I just deleted the app I was using. I took it as a loss. A few weeks ago, I wanted to invest into Doge, so I downloaded the app again and remembered all my sign in info. I totally forgot about the whole Bitcoin thing and to my amazement, my initial investment actually went up to around $900, money I didn‚Äôt know I had this whole time. I was also surprised to find I also invested into litecoin and ethereum but I barely put any money into them, they were both around $50. Fortunately, I bought into Doge when it was under 3 cents, I have 10k coins and growing, and if I learned anything from my past experience, I‚Äôll take my chances and hold for the long game. The dips can be scary for someone who is a first time investor but you have to remind yourself that you will not get rich over night (unless you really get lucky). Im in the same boat as most of you, trust me I‚Äôm still nervous but I have faith in Doge. Hoping for the best and wishing success to everyone here!",cryptocurrency
investing,Interest rate and Stock market relation,"Hi,

My assumptions may(or 100%) be incorrect.

* Typically when interest rates are lower; stock market performs well. This is typically due to more cash in people's hand resulting in more spending. Which translates to companies performing well.

Currently with interest rates so low and business struggling to meet ends., Does it make sense to have 70%-30% mix in a portfolio? Or is there any alternative investment vehicles that is better than debt but less risky than equity(to replace 30%, 70% will still be in equity).

To my taste, crypto cannot be more than 5%.

Any thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off any debt with an upcoming windfall?,"Hello, r/personalfinance!  In the next 2-3 weeks, I should be receiving a sizable bonus from work.  It's a target bonus of $100k based upon company performance.  It sounds like I should expect close to that amount, though it might be a little below given some effects of COVID last year.  For the sake of discussion, let's say I'll receive $50k after taxes.  I'm trying to determine how best to appropriate this income.

In terms of financial standing, we're doing pretty well at the moment.  We have about $60k in the bank for our emergency fund &amp; partial saving towards some upcoming future bills &amp; expenses.  We have about $160k between retirement accounts, RSU's, and cryptocurrency.  We also have a mortgage, two car loans, and school loans.

For the loans, they roughly look like this:

* Mortgage: $311k (2.875%)
* Vehicle Loan 1: $14k (3.49%)
* Vehicle Loan 2: $20k (2.14%)
* School Loan 1: $3.3k (3.4%)
* School Loan 2: $3k (3.86%)
* School Loan 3: $6.3k (4.66%)
* School Loan 4: $7.7k (4.29%)
* School Loan 5: $9.2k (4.53%)
* School Loan 6: $9.5k (2.75%)

For a long time, I've been planning to put most of our bonus towards our brokerage account for retirement.  (We've already maxed our 2021 IRA.)  However, I'm wondering if instead I should aim to knock out some of the school loans that are above 4% interest rate.  If I should expect to withdraw at a 4% rate at retirement, those are the only loans above that rate.

I also recognize that there is some expectation that the government may forgive some amount of student loan debt.  Maybe another option would be to put the money into savings (or some other type of short term interest bearing account) while waiting for updates on that news.

stocks,CVS: A Value Giant with Cheap LEAPS,"Hi All,

I very rarely post my trading ideas on reddit but I have seen this company gaining traction in a number of investment related sub-reddits and I've been researching it quite heavily over the past couple of weeks. With the earnings call out of the way and a good entry point at hand,  I'd like to discuss my outline of the business and my short-term price targets. After that, I will discuss how I am approaching this trade, namely through cheaply priced long-term call options 

**Core Outline of the Business Model:**

I presume most people are familiar with CVS in some capacity but you may not be aware of the whole of their current business model. As you might imagine, a large part of CVS is its pharmacy sector. CVS sells and manages prescription and OTC drugs, receiving most of its revenues as reimbursement from insurance. CVS also provides a number of pharmacy services (vaccinations, minor check ups, etc.) This has been a growing part of their business as I'll discuss later. You also probably know that CVS has a large retail sector. They sell candy, household goods, etc. Not very exciting. 

However, if you have not been following this company, you are probably unaware that since 2018 CVS has also owned Aetna, an insurance provider, and Caremark, a PBM (pharmacy benefit manager). Aetna obviously collects premium and partially or fully covers the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs for its clients. Caremark, as PBM, negotiates with drug manufacturers on behalf of clients and takes a cut of the money that it saves consumers. 

I'll discuss the potential developments in each these sectors but first I'd like to state my central thesis:

**Price Target, Fair Value Estimate, and Spreadsheets Galore**

**The Central Thesis:** CVS is deeply undervalued at $70-75 dollars a share (EV/EBITDA \~9) given its consistent, if moderate, revenue and earnings growth. This cheap pricing  likely reflects market fears over 1. CVS' debt and 2. Competition with Amazon. I believe that these fears are unsubstantiated and should be dispelled as CVS begins to pay off its debt with its strong cash flow and fully integrates its newly acquired insurance sector and its growing service business. The market should accordingly award CVS a higher earnings multiple and this in-addition to growing earnings should provide investors with an above market return. This investment also provides a good opportunity for considerable leverage considering the cheap pricing of long term options contracts. 

***2 Year Price Target: $100***

***Long Term Fair Value: $130-140*** 

I will try to keep the rest of this post mostly to text. However, since I am providing a concrete price target and fair value estimate, I should provide concrete numbers to back them. 

The  full forecasting I used for my 2 year price target can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VnS5nVvVcAfRu4TrPwXL7IFEMXP9OLTJI5HRe5EuBV8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VnS5nVvVcAfRu4TrPwXL7IFEMXP9OLTJI5HRe5EuBV8/edit?usp=sharing)

The fair value estimate comes from u/EnduredMarkets: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XPR0TqRXZOYqM81nUfuUGIRsot9kfDIif93L7H3y1YQ/edit#gid=1734015007](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XPR0TqRXZOYqM81nUfuUGIRsot9kfDIif93L7H3y1YQ/edit#gid=1734015007)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is CVS so cheap?** 

You'll notice looking at the CVS chart that CVS has traded in the $70 range for a long time putting it at a very cheap (9-10x EV/EBITDA) despite its strong earnings and revenue growth. In fact it was down almost 5% today on a earnings report with almost no surprises. What is the market concerned about? 

1. Debt: CVS acquired ALOT of debt in 2018 when it acquired Aetna. As a result of this, CVS has had a rather concerning Debt/EBITDA above 5 for the past 2 years. However, I believe these concerns are overblown. Debt is obviously a detriment to a business because its represents future earnings that will not be paid to share holders. However, debt is only really a concern when it puts a company at risk of default. This is not a concern with CVS. CVS's free cash flow from operations has allowed them to consistently service their capex, debt, and share holder obligations with almost a third of this cashflow left over. CVS, in fact, could have been more aggressive about paying down this debt for the past couple years but chose not to. This is likely because the cost of servicing these debts was so low (interest rates) and because they saw opportunities to expand their buisness. CVS (both in their own earnings reports and by analyst estimates) is expected to pay down this debt over the next two years and should reach a much healthier 3x debt/EBITDA by the end of 2022
2. Amazon: Amazon has recently introduced Amazon Pharmacy, a mail service for prescription drugs. Obviously as soon as Amazon gets into your industry you should just close up shop right? Not necessarily. Amazon has not been particularly aggressive in expanding their pharmacy business. As far as I can tell, they have not pursued aggressive pricing schemes like in other industries they've attempted to disrupt. In my view, Amazon Pharmacy is intended to act as an added incentive from Prime members rather than an industry disruptor. However, even if they should become aggressive, CVS has two key advantages.  First, CVS has great synergistic benefits from their insurance and PBM buisnesses which they can use to keep customers in the CVS ecosystem and offer attractive pricing. Second, healthcare is an area where consumers are likely to stick to known trusted brand names. Amazon is well positioned to disrupt ""low stakes"" businesses (groceries, consumer goods, etc.) where you can ""just give it a try."" You may not be as likely to switch to them from known healthcare provider which has records of your regular prescriptions/healthcare info and may be entrusted to deliver critical, lifesaving medication. I believe that this will become apparent to markets over the next couple of years as CVS continues to grow revenue and earnings in a post-covid world. 

If we, as investors, do not believe that these factors are of concern, then we can assume that CVS's earnings will continue to grow as they have over the past couple years (mid single digit per year) and that the market will award CVS a higher earnings multiple as it does so**. My 2 year price target of $100/share assumes that this scenario plays out (i.e. CVS maintains it status quo).**

**Added Business Drivers**

As I just stated, I attempted to have a conservative outlook in my price projection. However, there are two key additional developments in CVS' business which may propel earnings and price further than expected in this estimate. 

1. Aetna-Caremark-CVS synergy: For a traditional pharmacy, there are a lot of negotiators to work with. Customer, PBM, Drug manufacturer, insurance provide, and pharmacy all have to agree to certain terms which fit their best interest. With Aetna and Caremark under its wings, CVS controls all parts of this system except of the customer and drug manufacturer. This provides a number of synergistic benefits that can be used to drive revenues and improve margins. For example:

a. Aetna may offer consumers lower co-pays to get their prescriptions at CVS pharmacies

b. Aetna and CVS pharmacy can merge their collected customer data to recommend preventative treatment which will lower customer and insurance expenses by avoiding costly procedures as a result of a health crisis

c. Caremark may use the added leverage of its association with CVS pharmacy and its gains in customer base (due to the advantage its able to provide due to these other synergistic effects) to negotiate better drug pricing from manufacturers (thereby increasing their profits and reducing customer costs.)

&amp;#x200B;

2. Health Hubs: CVS has, for a while now, had ""minute clinics""  in CVS stores where customers can receive shots and basic health assessments. However, CVS has recently introduced ""health hubs"" which offer a much wider range of services. In essence, these health hubs can provide almost all of the healthcare services provided by a primary care doctor at a much lower cost. These health hubs have not been fully rolled out yet and are only being tested in a few cities. However, they are expected to become increasingly prevalent if they are successful. Not only do these health hubs provide an additional source of revenue to CVS, they can be a good way of introducing customers to CVS' system. Using a ""health hub"" provides CVS with the opportunity to recommend that a customer switch to Aetna as an insurance provider by offering them low or zero co-pay at the health hub. Aetna can then incentivize them to use CVS as a pharmacy. Caremark gains the negotiating power of another customer. A fully integrated, healthcare ecosystem.

I'm not an expert in this industry. I have no idea if these additional factors will play out. However, if they do, they will likely bolster earnings and CVS' share price

&amp;#x200B;

**Cheap Options Pricing**

If you're only interested in holding shares, you can stop reading here. This is a great play as a shareholder looking for above market returns and you can earn a good dividend along the way. 

I, however, am adding leverage to this play with long dated, ITM, call options (LEAPS). Because of CVS's low volatility, options pricing is incredibly cheap. Buying, ITM options for Jan 2023 will allow you to at least breakeven, even if CVS only returns 8% over the next 2 years. If CVS hits my price target, this play will provide \~100% return. If the extreme bull-case plays out, \~200-300% return. Obviously, the use of options introduces considerable risk. If you're wrong and hold to expiration, you will lose all your investment. However, I believe that CVS is priced so cheaply it is unlikely to trade much lower and I see good potential for it to reach my current price target. If you access the ""what contract should I buy"" and ""ROI Calculator"" tab of my spreadsheet above, you can see how these return scenarios play out given different prices at expiration. **Note that the option prices listed here do not automatically update. You will need to update them with real-time quotes.** 

Explore and decide what is best for you. Personally, I am holding Jan 2023 $65 calls. 

I am not a professional investor and I mostly learn by researching company's  making a predictions and testing them by investing. I would appreciate any criticisms, added knowledge, or other ideas you're willing to provide. We all learn together

stocks,$OSK (Oshkosh) to Infinity and Beyond (Part 2),"TLDR (Full Series): Oshkosh is a boomer company with the Pilot, Rocket, and Jet Fuel to take off to infinity and beyond. It has the resources allowing it to dominate in its current market and propel it to the hottest market of them all (EV). It has a small downside, but its upside is so massive that the green dildo will tear my ass apart.

TLDR (Part 2): Oshkosh‚Äôs current operative sectors are currently printing cash for the business. It has a strong debt to asset ratio with a TTM Free cashflow of 328M. This gives them a lot of room for R&amp;D in the commercial electric vehicle space without diluting shares or taking on massive debt. In other words, they have F you money to go against competitors looking to get into the commercial EV space.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also stupid, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself.

Oshkosh‚Äôs Rocket Ship will take us beyond the Universe.

In my last post **(**[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixp0/osk_oshkosh_to_infinity_and_beyond_part_1/)**)**, I discussed the management of the business, and why they have the track record to continually grow the company. It was fairly short as the numbers essentially spoke for themselves. This post will be focused on the business of Oshkosh in terms of its products and financial strength.

To reiterate, Oshkosh is a manufacturing conglomerate in the sectors of access equipment, defense, fire &amp; emergency, and commercial. The 2021 Q1 revenue for each sector is 563.7M, 550.3M, 273.9M, and 195.7M respectively. I have attached a [diagram](https://imgur.com/a/iajdpei) to show the breakdown of the sectors. As shown on the diagram, the largest money makers for Oshkosh are Access equipment and Defense, comprising 35.6% and 34.7% of the revenue respectively. Fire &amp; emergency consists of 17.3%, and the commercial sector consists of 12.4%. (Look at the diagram, it‚Äôs easier to comprehend)

The business diversification shows that Oshkosh has a healthy revenue across different sectors, meaning that it does not have all its eggs in one basket. This was evident with Covid hitting. Although the revenue of Oshkosh was affected negatively, it was balanced out in different sectors. For example, the 2021 Q1 revenue for the Access equipment sector decreased by 21.5% and the Commercial sector fell by 12.7% compared to 2020. However, the total change in revenue only decreased by approximately 7% because the Defense and Fire &amp; Emergency business grew. This shows that there is a small downside risk to Oshkosh. The source is taken from Q1 [presentations ](https://s24.q4cdn.com/975203404/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1-2021-Earnings-Slides-FINAL.pdf)from Oshkosh. Q4 2020 numbers will show a bigger dip in revenue, but you get the point. The business isn‚Äôt reliant on one type of business, and the management team was able to adapt and bounce back.

(TDLR Paragraph: Certain manufacturing sectors were affected by Covid, but Oshkosh was able to withstand the hit due to different businesses. This means that it is hard to wipe this business out.

(Skip this if you don‚Äôt care about each business sector.)

Oshkosh‚Äôs Access Equipment business is under JLG and a variety of brands, and it essential manufactures different types of lifts for the construction market. What is exciting about this business is that they have an all-electric scissor lift that was recently just released. This shows that Oshkosh is innovating, and looking to transition from offering only diesel products to electric products. Moreover, it shows that they are capable of it.

The Defense sector brings in a lot of money for Oshkosh, and it does not seem to be slowing down. They received an order for $911 million in 2021 Q1 alone. Moreover, they have a large backlog that will continue to pump cash into the business. There were arguments from my last post that Oshkosh has trouble fulfilling some orders. This was due to staffing challenges related to Covid. However, according to them, they were able to ramp up production successfully even with the setbacks. If they weren‚Äôt doing a decent job fulfilling orders, they would not get large orders like this.

(Read: Oshkosh is constantly getting orders for the military sector. The military sector is related to government bids and contracts. This shows that Oshkosh has the experience and capability to win contracts with the government. Lobbying plays a big part, and this shows they are dammed good at it.\* USPS contract\*)

Oshkosh‚Äôs Fire &amp; Emergency essentially creates fire trucks for municipalities. They achieved new record orders in FY2020. Additionally, they just released a new vehicle. They claim that backlog remains near-record level, meaning that they have a bunch of demand for the product that needs to be filled. Usually, that means it is a great business with a great product. Again, winning over government contracts is apart of their business model. This is their bread and butter. If there is any doubt that they can even get a piece of the USPS contract, this should crush that.

The Commercial sector consists of a bunch of different brands under Oshkosh. The commercial sector for Oshkosh has taken a hit due to Covid. However, they still have a backlog of $361 million. They offer a lot of great products that are required by private businesses and government entities.

Now that we are done going through each business that Oshkosh is in, we are going to dive into some financials, and they look good. I retrieved these numbers on yahoo finance. Look them up if you don‚Äôt believe it. (Disclaimer: these are approximate %). The Debt to Asset ratio for Oshkosh is 14%. Workhorse has a debt to asset ratio of 102%. No bigger numbers don‚Äôt mean it is better. Workhorse is leveraged up the ass, and if they don‚Äôt bring in some revenue, they are F'ed so hard it is not even going to be funny. This low debt to asset ratio allows Oshkosh to invest in current business growth, and it allows them to invest in new products (eg. EV). They have been doing this by investing and Microvast and setting up a joint venture. I will get more into this in the next part. 

**(For the people who are going to say debt is going to R&amp;D and growth, F you. Workhorse‚Äôs revenue is for 2020 is $570 thousand. My wife‚Äôs allowance from her boyfriend is more than that.)** Workhorse‚Äôs cost of revenue is $5,845,000 while Oshkosh‚Äôs is $6,031,600,000. Based on just this number, it doesn‚Äôt look too bad, but it is horrendous. Basically, Workhorse is investing $15 to bring $1 in revenue (that is a -93.3% ROI). Oshkosh‚Äôs revenue is $7,268,300,000, and that gives us an ROI of 20%. This is purely revenue returns of course. 

With the current businesses support Oshkosh, they have a TTM Free Cashflow of $328M. This gives them room to either pay down their debts, which isn‚Äôt high. More importantly, this gives them room to grow into the EV space where they can continue to create products for their Commercial and Municipal customers. They can create the products, infrastructure, and sales teams without worrying about running out of cash. Just for a comparison, Workhorse has a TTM Free Cashflow of -$38.977M.

Oshkosh is a very old business that has great products with great numbers. One of the downsides that I can think of for this business is that they somehow lose all their current business. This is very unlikely because they were able to maintain strong numbers even with Covid. This was due to the management and the employees being able to adapt quickly during hard times, which is the reason **(**[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixp0/osk_oshkosh_to_infinity_and_beyond_part_1/)**)** was only about management competence. They are constantly releasing new products that are in high demand with large backorders.

I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Having great historical numbers isn‚Äôt what is going to guarantee growth in the future. It‚Äôs about innovation and the new type of business. The company is thinking about the future, and that is why they are looking to use their excess cash to develop commercial products in the EV space. What makes this an exciting play is because the company is great at procuring government contracts. This is an art that they have an advantage of compared to new players in the EV space. You cannot disregard the importance of Lobby in winning contracts like the USPS. I will talk more about why Oshkosh is primed for growth based on the EV hype that other companies are receiving in Part 3

The main goal of Part 2 of this DD is to illustrate why the downside for this company is extremely low compared to a play like Workhorse. Workhorse will essentially need to dilute its shares for more cash, which decreases the value of the shares you bought. The reason is that it can‚Äôt leverage any more debt because it already has more debt than assets.

(Stay Tuned for Part 3. These take a long time.)

devops,Hackerrank for a devops role,"I just finished a hackerrank ""test"" for a devops role. It was a pretest before the interview. I've never used hackerrank, I've always viewed it more for programming. Coming from a sys admin background, yeah I can code a bit, script stuff absolutely, build a pipelines for sure. Make pictures about ""devops"" architecture and answer obscure questions on msg brokers, and hardly used git commands. There was a bunch of crap stuffed in there that left me scratching my head, not that I didn't know it or have a partial answer. It was just by the book multiple choice answers to pick from, you know the kind that makes it look like a trick question. Not to mention you don't get to use Google or anything you script you can't write print statements to debug, it's basically right or wrong. I love too they don't give you any background to what the topics are so you just go in blind. 

I appreciate questioning skills, giving a homework assignment. But I just don't feel like hackerrank was a good option for a devops role.

personalfinance,Used Auto Loan Rates + Advice for Purchasing Used Car,"Im looking to get out of a 2006 300C SRT8 (paid off) and into a SUV here in Portland, OR.  I currently make about $110k/yr with a $1900/mo house payment and $1400 in alimony/child support to go along with the usual household bills.

I anticipate getting about $4-$5k for my current vehicle.  I also recently refinanced my home saving about $500/mo and having about $2k come back from escrow.  Based on all this, I feel comfortable going to a $500-$600/month car payment, but wanted to get some advice from others.

Credit score is currently between 792 and 802 depending on the reporting agency.

In particular:

Used car loan rates - I see DCU out there at 1.99% and that appears to be the best with PenFed at 2.99 (maybe be lowered by using autopay).  Are there others that I should be looking at for good loan rates?

Loan term - I'm amazed to see used car loans running out to 60 months or more.  Im in the 2017-2019 model years and think I am comfortable running a term out to 48 months.  Is it advisable to go this long?  How about 60 months?  I'm keeping this car for a long time as my current 2006 would suggest.",finance

1. My DD Research and Why Ehang Technologies  

   1. January 29th, 2021 ($EH - $66.36) - EHang receives $40M investment from Carmignac. Carmignac is a French [asset management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management) firm founded in 1989. What is important to note is that they one of the largest funds in all of Europe with $35 billion under management. And furthermore their flagship fund the Carmignac Patrimoine was one of the few funds during the volatility of 2008-2011 that outperformed their peers. I would imagine being one of the premier benchmarked asset management firms in Europe that their DD would have been successfully completed. Any omissions or errors would have been an immediate disapproval. While there has been some cases of bad investment made by firms, it is on the whole a lot rarer.
   2. December 14th, 2020 - FACC Starts Test Flights with Autonomous Aerial Vehicle EHang 216. The first test flight of the EHang 216 aircraft in national airspace was successfully carried out under the supervision of the Austrian aviation authority Austro Control at the FACC site in St. Martin im Innkreis (Austria). The close and professional cooperation between the specialist teams of Austro Control and FACC led to this milestone. With the successful completion of the system checks and the associated test flight, the aviation authority granted the experimental flight permit for the further execution of EHang 216 test flights.

Of the portions of the research that are suspicious, or have clearly a bias, or have questionable content as they cannot be confirmed or verified in the report and should be ignored in the report.

1. Suspicious Timing  

   1. As the Chinese New Year is in full swing, it is a week long federal holiday. This ensure that panic sellers will not be able to reach with out any additional information.
   2. Slow releases starting around 1200EST-1400EST or roughly 2300-0300 in China, which also ensures that any response will be delayed until after panic selling has been complete.
   3. This in fact caused the stock price to drop almost 62% which brings to price back to roughly \~1 month ago before its run up.
2. Lack of Personnel in EHang Locations, Video Released by Wolfpack Research:  

   1. No metadata on Youtube video, unable to verify date and time stamp. Claimed to be shot during January *but no exact dates are provided.*
   2. Video taken over the federal holiday, there of course would be no people in the building.
   3. But what we are able to see is that there are actual EH216 vehicles that are being built and/or assembled, with lots of parts in boxes. If there were actual fraud, there would be absolutely no reason to even spent the effort in having all those parts and pieces. In fact there would be ample security to ensure that no one would ever discover the deception.
3. eVTOL expert Dr. Moore from Uber and NASA  

   1. Regarding his opinion of the use of hobby motors and general quality. Working at NASA we have seen how stagnant NASA has become due to their over redundancy and unwillingness to take risk compared to how SpaceX operates. But redundancy is waste, especially in startups that do not have the federal money. If ""hobby"" motors work, then why over-engineer something? I think we can draw parallels to early Tesla motors but the key thing is that they worked and that is all that matters.
   2. Lack of research budget, when you work for NASA anything that is not in the billions would of course be considered anemic, but the company is working first to pioneer passenger VTOLs and then moving on getting acceptance for autonomous technology.
4. Flight Autonomy Dream (Headline: It is not, its already here and it works)  

   1. Flight autonomy is already well used in the the aviation industry. In fact the majority of your domestic and international flights utilize autopilot where the pilot has pre-entered in a specific heading and altitude.
   2. DJI with their Mavic Air series are able to perform limited autonomous flight in a consumer drone for under $1000 including takeoff, object detection and avoidance, GPS flight routine, landing, and return to base landing. If a consumer drone maker can do this it is not a leap of imagination to think that the same principles can be applied here.
   3. ***There is nothing special regarding autonomous flight.***
   4. In fact you can see from this Wikipedia image regarding autonomous control levels shows that as early as in 2000s with the Predator and Global Hawk autonomous flight was already widely used in the defense sector. Today the focus into the future are fully autonomous swarms, far far ahead of what is necessary for autonomous drone flight.

Autonomous Control Level Trend

1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Office Visit - Distributor of EHang  

   1. Interview with employee who ""claimed"" to be the finance manager pushing to sell their own drones, which does not make sense because Kunxiang does not make any drones and is a distributor. Also the finance manager reportedly said that their drone had *4 hours flight time* which is an absolutely unbelievable claim versus EHang's 30 minutes of total flight time which is far more realistic. No additional evidence was provided by WolfPack regarding the ""claimed"" finance manager, name, title or any of substance.

Of the portions that provide a negative attack and are at best circumstantial evidence

1. \# of NewsWire PR Articles - Apparently having 55 news article in 14 months constitutes a pump and dump scheme.
2. Lack of Infrastructure Progress and Investments - Because not all progress has gone according to plan, I wonder what other large companies have had the same issues that have become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
3. Misleading English/Chinese Press Release  

   1. While the titles maybe misleading, Googling the original Chinese press releases identifies does not actually mislead any of the readers. It does not make any false claims regarding passenger vehicles or their permitting, in fact it is actually Dr. Mark Moore who is making the *assumptions based upon the title*. And you know what they say about assumptions, they make an a\*\* out of you and me. I would think that a NASA engineer would take his time reading the article, I mean they certainly are taking their time with SLS.

Of the portions that have merit:

1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Price Disparity  

   1. Of all the points in the short research, this maybe one of merit.
   2. The buyer purchased EH216 at widely varying prices from 1.5 million RMB per unit to 150 million RMB as stated in two difference SEC Sales Contract reports. This wide disparity is a note for cause.
2. Rapidly Growing Accounts with low account receivable and allegation of fabricated sales  

   1. Is this not similar to how TSLA presold cars? Additional research needs to be done into this.
   2. Again the research does not say it is evidence of fabricated sales but only that is a textbook indication. ***Again circumstantial evidence is not real evidence.***
   3. ***Why is this buried at the tail end of the report? At page 19 out of 33.*** If this was truly damning than it should have been at the forefront.
3. Ongoing Lawsuit  

   1. Could be a future issue, however without knowing the full evidence of the trial it is difficult to make judgement.

WolfPack Research History so far (two words, desperate &amp; terrible)

[https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports](https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports)

Of the 6 short researches, all of them insisted that the various companies committed fraud and yet ***5 out of the 6 stocks*** are up since their report. I will not mention the tickers as they have all been banned by the mods. With a singular exception, they say a broken clock is wrong twice a day. If ever there was a clear evidence of false reporting and market manipulation this is it. In my opinion WolfPack research utilizes its financial disclaimer purporting that this research is only an expression of their opinion to side step any legal ramifications.

I have to state that $EH has been on a tear lately and as a very young startup it has been on a tremendous run up. It more than likely would have drop due to a pull back but I believe that air transportation will be the next TSLA, especially in China where the population density is 153 per KM2. Electric air transportation is the only way to alleviate the congestion that is plagues their streets and their cities.

But I like this stock!

Right now, the lending space is so new and the rewards for the amount I want to lend (maybe 25% of what I own) is too low. I want to start lending when BTC hits my personal goal and start earning interest.

There are 2 options on Celsius for example:

Lend USDT and gain 16% however, the value of the USDT stays the same even if BTC increases/decreases. Lend BTC and gain 6% however, the interest rate is much lower but the pay out increases as BTC's price increases.

If lending BTC, the price would need to go up x3 times to gain the same amount as lending USDT.

personalfinance,Paid ahead significantly on student loans over the last year. Can I get it back?,"Last February my wife's car was totaled. The car was paid off and the interest rate on the loan for her new vehicle was going to be around 2%. Our student loans have (had I guess...) interest rates in the 5-8% range. As financially literate savvy millennials we put the check into student loans effectively refinancing about 15k of loans down to 2%. In March our student loans went to 0% and now it looks like we're going to miss out on 10k of loan forgiveness each because we've almost completely paid off our student loans over the last year. Is there any way to reverse what we have done and get a refund from the loan servicers?

CryptoCurrency,Quantum computing and btc,"So I have done a reasonable amount of research on btc from a macro-economic perspective, and completely buy the store of value argument, but I do not pretend to fully understand the technical aspects of btc in terms of the details of the POW solution. So I would be grateful if anyone can help answer this question for me.

I can understand that the POW model makes it economically unfeasible to martial a brute force attack on the blockchain for the purposes of theft, since quite apart from the vast cost of doing so, the very success of any attack would destroy the value of the btc that one attempted to steal by it. But assume (and this assumption may not be a good one, but if not I would be interested to know why not) that in a world of quantum computing, the POW becomes relatively trivial. In those circumstances I can see that attacking the blockchain for the purposes of theft is still economically absurd - you would be destroying the value of the very thing that you are trying to steal (although I suppose that in a massive attack provided the heist was rapid enough, you would still escape with vast value even as the price collapsed).

However it strikes me as pretty obvious that the very reasons why btc has such enormous potential value as a SOV makes it a huge risk to governments that are reliant on imposed monetary policy. And it is governments that are likely to be ahead of the game when it comes to developing feasible quantum computing systems. So why is there not a major risk of a government that relies for its continuing existence on spending and the monetary levers of fiat currency from deliberately destroying the btc system by sustained attacks on the blockchain using quantum computing, which though they make no economic sense (indeed they would cost millions or indeed trillions of dollars), nevertheless serve to maintain the fiscal control that those governments currently have, but global adoption of btc seriously threatens?

Would appreciate any sensible and informed thoughts on this. If my post is gibberish, then that is fine - do tell me why...!",cryptocurrency

Fourth: I don't have a citation for this. Coronavirus.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really trying to digest this convergence of data as a lay person. 

I see the P/E of the S&amp;P and I'm convinced the market is way overpriced. 15 seems to be a sweet spot, we're sitting at over 40. We look long overdue for a long term correction back to the mean. I read this as the market is broadly overpriced.

&amp;#x200B;

I see the 10 year bond yield lurking at the lowest rates in history. As a lay person, I first interpret this to mean we have historic pessimism in the market \*DESPITE\* what appears to be such entrenched priced in optimism. I read this as a warning that long money fears a long term big pull back otherwise nobody would find these rates reasonable. Maybe I \*should\* read this as the fed working hard, on a very small scale human basis, to push money out of bonds and into the market with a deliberate stimulus mindset and that is more of an explanation in service of the overpriced market. Maybe the price of the market is more a reflection of centralized tinkering than a reflection of historically comparable value.

&amp;#x200B;

I see the money. What dollars exist at all. This relates to that fourth point too. A pretty good chunk of all dollars in the system were printed in the past year and at an unprecedented rate, even compared to the financial crisis. I don't completely know how to parse this and project forward what it's going to mean. This perhaps explains the overpriced market to a degree -- perhaps it's not really as overpriced as it looks because it is incorporating inflation in a way the rest of the economy is going to lag to catch up on. Maybe this SHOULD create anxiety about the liquid cash in my bank that I'm too cautious to put in the market because of the preceding points. I'm just not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

... but also, besides the money supply, there's just coronavirus on the face of it. I can't ""see"" the macro economics, but I see my region. I'm in the Boston area; it's a pretty prosperous area relatively speaking. It is real shaky. We're a YEAR in to most small businesses near me not having business models that make any sense. There's an awful lot of people, residential and business for that matter, just not paying their rent but there have been freezes on eviction. I think that's extended until end of June at this point. But those losses don't get erased because of the eviction moratorium, they just get deferred and probably accumulate interest while we wait. That's a bomb that - in my mind - we can't defuse, we just get to grow it and move it and maybe we can move it to a point in time when we can absorb the now-larger explosion better than we could at this moment. So this all puts some fear into me as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so that's my stream of conscience that sums up my feeling about the past year. I have felt very bearish since end of 2019 and saw last march's snap correction as a bit of a fakeout - even MORESO now that there's a year of hindsight data to look back on with context. Yet perhaps I do myself a disservice by feeling anxious about the market because we may also be setting up an explosion of inflation and the market is the only way to hedge against it effectively despite what feels like an inevitable big pullback.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin,Cryptocurrencies are a life boat for what‚Äôs about to come,"Every year the United States is running a budget deficit of a trillion dollars plus. No political party has the will to trim spending (they just spend on different things, but the end result is always a huge deficit). We will be at a point, in about 10 years, where ever dollar the US government collects, in a given year, will only be enough to service the interest on the overall debt (27 trillion and counting). Which means interest rates will remain low, basically forever; because increasing the interest rates will bankrupt the government. In order to run the government and pay for its existing obligations (Medicare, social security, etc.) the federal reserve will only have one option left - continue printing more money. At that point inflation will start to become 10% year over year. 

This is why you will start to hear about the US government creating a digital dollar, as they hope to employ behavioral economics with programmable money (different interest rates for different groups and other incentives/disincentives). In a sense they are hoping to haircut the old dollar and monetize the debt with this new dollar. 

I love different cryptos for different reasons and I have a diverse portfolio. But when I recommend crypto to newbies, I always recommend Bitcoin first. Why Bitcoin over other crypto currencies? Bitcoin does one thing very well and has proven itself for over a decade. It is currently 60% of the entire crypto market, so that speaks for itself. I could go on, but there are many others on this forum that will do a much better job than me. I honestly have no ill will towards any other cryptos and in fact think that some compliment Bitcoin very well. I see some real potential to create credit markets, provide private property in the digital space, and revolutionize contracts forever.

But people need to understand what is coming and jump on this life boat before it‚Äôs too late.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The US Federal Reserve need Bitcoin. Here it is explained why,,cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin is expected to become a global reserve currency,"The dominance of the dollar cannot last forever. In the eyes of some economists, the destiny of the dollar as the de facto world reserve currency is quickly approaching its end. But if the hegemony of the dollar really collapses, who will replace it? For many people, the answer is Bitcoin. This article will explain why.

&amp;#x200B;

For more than 75 years, the US dollar has been the global reserve currency. The Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 marked the beginning of the U.S. dollar to replace the gold standard globally. Hundreds of representatives of central banks around the world reached an agreement to maintain a fixed exchange rate between the local currency and the US dollar. At the same time, the US dollar is still bound to gold. It was not until 1971 that Nixon severed the link between the U.S. dollar and gold, thus consolidating the hegemony of the U.S. dollar.

&amp;#x200B;

Global currency reset

The US dollar is not tied to the supply of stable assets, so the US can print US dollars at will. Coincidentally or not, since 1971, consumer goods prices have increased exponentially.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

H59W4tKX7Vf1W0oK6Ybkw3qM0GUGnWqryZaoWoDk.png At the same time, the dollar continued to depreciate.

&amp;#x200B;

xYGHBLf3jYbUJse7SC3HrvcVeTm7NeJL2ETMSODW.jpeg

&amp;#x200B;

Since 1971, many macroeconomic studies have been devoted to figuring out what went wrong. Many studies believe that the answer lies in major changes in the global financial system.

&amp;#x200B;

In hindsight, the gold standard can work well. It had been in operation for centuries before it was abolished in 1971. Therefore, over the years, some economists and analysts have always proposed to restore the gold standard, or at least a variant of the gold standard.

&amp;#x200B;

Jim Reid, the global head of special research at Deutsche Bank, is one such analyst. In the 2019 paper authorized by Deutsche Bank, Reid stated that fiat currency is gradually disappearing and will soon be replaced by other currencies. His paper not only lists the congenital inflation caused by the lack of a standard system, but also points out that the government also tends to print money out of thin air. Given the current economic turmoil, this is especially prescient.

&amp;#x200B;

The article says:

&amp;#x200B;

""The forces that unite the current fiat currency system look fragile now, and they may disintegrate in the 2020s. If so, this will lead to a strong rejection of fiat currencies, and the demand for alternative currencies such as gold or cryptocurrencies may be Soaring.""

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin Standard

In the past ten years, the rise of Bitcoin has not restored the gold standard, but has prompted a new trend of thought, a global currency reset dominated by Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

An important study is to use Bitcoin as a global reserve currency. This study comes from the late analyst and Bitcoin bull Tyler Jenks.

&amp;#x200B;

Jenks boldly proposed that Bitcoin can provide the world with a stable global reserve currency that cannot be inflationary or deflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

Although this view may seem exaggerated, Jenks is not alone.

&amp;#x200B;

The analyst borrowed from economist Saivedean Ammous's seminal book The Bitcoin Standard (The Bitcoin Standard). In this book, Ammous defines Bitcoin's role in replacing gold's historical position.

&amp;#x200B;

Ammous stands on the opposite of Keynesian economics, which advocates increasing government intervention in the financial system. On the contrary, Ammous believes that the central government cannot interfere with Bitcoin, which makes Bitcoin an ideal choice for the main reserve currency.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is not associated with any national government, which promotes the development of Bitcoin as a global reserve currency, because it means that such an asset can overcome the Triffin Dilemma. The Triffin Dilemma refers to the conflict of interest between the currency policy of the reserve currency country and the world. David Andolfatto, senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, pointed out in a question-and-answer session that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have the potential to solve this problem:

&amp;#x200B;

""If a private cryptocurrency replaces a world reserve currency, it will eliminate the plight of this reserve currency.""

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin: a global reserve currency?

Although there is no need to apply for a reserve asset, there is still a common standard: hard currency.

&amp;#x200B;

Hard currency is any widely traded asset that can serve as a stable value reserve. Although Bitcoin is traditionally believed to be unstable, research shows that Bitcoin's volatility has declined significantly throughout its life.

&amp;#x200B;

qkdoJaPqignHSzYFSI1i3kX9PtIZ85Q9A3yRKs5S.png

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, Bayern LB, one of Germany's major banks, pointed out in a report in 2019 that Bitcoin is a ""super-hard currency"" based on the ""stock-output"" model.

&amp;#x200B;

The report draws on Ammous's book ""Bitcoin Standard"" and the research results of the anonymous Bitcoin analyst PlanB on the Bitcoin ""stock-output"" model.

&amp;#x200B;

The stock-production method is an analytical method that is commonly used in commodities such as gold and silver. ""Inventory"" represents the circulation of assets, and ""output"" represents annual output. The combination of these indicators can provide a ratio to quantify the ""difficulty of production"" or scarcity of the asset.

&amp;#x200B;

When the ""stock-output"" model is applied to Bitcoin, the results show that there is a strong correlation between Bitcoin's market value and its SF ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

xzlXIBUlRiEo53Qp7GUjGq7wehXhJILUpVoQZGnw.png

&amp;#x200B;

The report believes that due to the four-year halving of Bitcoin and the less impact of its supply, the SF ratio of Bitcoin and the resulting ""difficulty of production"" have been set and will increase. The bank concluded that Bitcoin will become ""a scarcer asset than gold"":

&amp;#x200B;

""No one really knows the impact of this currency standard. Only one thing is clear: if Bitcoin really becomes the currency of the 21st century, then its characteristics (mainly high scarcity) are the reason.""

personalfinance,Big difference between fed. and state return?,"Hello!

MN couple filing married w X kids. HH income ~Xk, both worked full time for just one employer each for all of 2020. Both of us have 4 allowances and married filing jointly on our W4s.

Fed return came back with a ~$XXXX refund, state return came back with us *owing* ~$XXXX. How is that possible? A $XXXX difference in taxes is weird, no?

My wife roughed out the state taxes we had withheld using the state tax tables, and she says it's correct, that it looks like we underpaid the state, but overpaid the fed.

Should we just reduce our withholding for state taxes (to, say 2 allowances), but leave the fed withholdings at 4? That seems like a ridiculous solution, but I'm just looking for a sanity check from my r/PF friends.

Thanks!

personalfinance,Is there absolutely any option? Massive student loan question.,"I feel like these posts get made a lot, but I'm one of them. Throwaway because I'm embarrassed and overwhelmed. 

I graduated from undergrad with minimal to no student debt. I never really understood what I was doing financially, because I didn't have to. I decided to go to law school in a big city, and took out the maximum all 3 years. 

I worked a low enough paying job throughout and shortly after graduating that I didn't really owe anything. I signed up for the Income Based Repayment, I paid the minimum, and foolishly thought I was ok. I didn't realize that the interest on these massive amounts was adding up and snowballing.

Long story short, I don't really work in law. I don't have the big law salary to help. I ended up in marketing at a law firm, bringing in about $70k. I have a few months of savings stored up, but the loans are overwhelming. 

Right now, I have one subsidized and one unsubsidized. Both are federally held and in forbearance under the CARES Act. Together, they're about $350k (subsidized: $20k total- $17k principal and $3k interest; unsubsidized $248k principal and $81k interest.) 

Here's the thing. I know I'm up shit creek. I can't ever pay these off. I'm just looking for a way to make this manageable. I still live in a city where my rent is about $1300/mo, and I try to be pretty frugal. I contribute to 401k and Roth, and save a good bit each month. 

The loans are still on income based repayment, and I do pay the minimum each month plus more when I can. Unfortunately, the interest far outweighs how much I can throw at this. I'm 32, so still a ways off from the IBR forgiveness, but even then I dread the tax hit I'll have to take.

BlackRock‚Äôs Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world‚Äôs largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.

The remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock‚Äôs chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.

‚ÄúToday the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,‚Äù Rieder said on ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we‚Äôve started to dabble a bit into it.‚Äù

In January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.

A number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation‚Äôs oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.

The price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. ‚ÄúMy sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving the price up,‚Äù Rieder said.

Despite bitcoin‚Äôs growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have ‚Äúdepends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre holding a lot more cash than we‚Äôve held historically,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because duration doesn‚Äôt work, interest rates don‚Äôt work as a hedge and so diversifying into other assets makes some sense. Holding some portion of what you hold in cash in things like crypto seems to make some sense to me, but I wouldn‚Äôt espouse a certain allocation or target holding.‚Äù",finance

personalfinance,"Advice on Private Mortgage from an individual, pitfalls? downsides?","(based in US, crossposting on r/realestate)
Was recently having a discussion with a well off friend about how my wife and I are about planning to start looking to purchase our first home in the spring. He threw out taking the loan from him as an option to consider as he was looking to put some of his money into safer investments with better returns than a savings account, CD, etc.

We live in a high cost area so we weren't planning on putting 20% down, so the most attractive part about this idea about this is not having to pay PMI. Part of me also wonders if we can get it to appear as a cash offer, but that's not my priority. I straight up told him after we got 20% equity I would probably consider refinancing depending on where rates are at, and he actually liked the idea since it put a shorter timeline on him having liquidity back.

From all my research I'm not seeing a lot of downsides here besides potential impact to the friendship if things go south, but to be honest in that scenario I would be more worried about losing my house. Looking for folks who might have experience with private mortgages to point out pitfalls, cons, etc. Also curious on the impact it might have on our ability to field a competitive offer for a house if any at all.

I we opted to try this out, my current plan would be something like this:
-get pre-approved for a conventional mortgage to have a sense of an interest rate for comparison
-assuming my friend will match or beat the interest rate (likely based on our conversation), have his real estate lawyer draft up paperwork
-find and pay for my own lawyer to review, along with our realtor

Thanks for reading and any advice.",finance

personalfinance,[25] I want to pay off my mortgage as soon as possible. What should I do?,"(anonymous account)

I am 25, living in the Netherlands. Self-taught software developer.

Income/financial sources/real estate:

* Eearning 105k EUR per year (achieved a very senior leadership position in a biotech company). Net is a bit over **5K EUR net per month**. I do get a decent stock grant every year, but let's not count that in as it depends on the success of my employer.
* I have a stable side income, which is at about 5k USD (4k EUR) per month from online content that I produce. After taxes (49%) that is **\~2k EUR** **net per month**.
* I own a house that today is worth around **240-250k** I bought this house when I was 21, desperate to stop paying high rent so I was willing to leave the city and found a gem for 165k. After investing some money in renovating it, and the fact that the area became more expensive, the house is estimated at 240k-270k today. **14k** net (excluding interest) has been paid in mortgage so far.
* I own a car that is worth \~13k EUR.
* I have **35k EUR** in my savings account.

Expenses:

* My mortgage is **650 EUR** per month at an interest rate of about 1.5% fixed. Very good conditions in the Netherlands the past few years.
* I took a **18k EUR loan** to completely renovate the house a year back.

My end goal:

I ""just"" want to cover my current mortgage, and then rent out the house for approx. 1300 EUR per month, while living in a nice city using a new mortgage (the mortgage conditions here are really good still). I want to get there as soon as possible so I can relax a bit and enjoy my life.

My goal is that when I'm 55 years old, I will have my pension, two houses fully owned and perhaps some savings from investments I've made throughout my life.

Considering the financial details above, if you were me, what would you do? Saving plans, investment ideas, anything. Thank you all!

personalfinance,Help with understanding taxes,"I just got my paycheck for my first real job and saw that 38% went to taxes. I am in California and I am in the 22% federal income tax bracket and 9.3% state tax bracket. So I get that that adds up to around 31% The payroll person said it is normal that Medicaid and social security etc add on more to that.

But I thought that I am taxed in lower tax brackets for the first portions of my check for example the first $20,000 should be taxed at 10%, then the next 60k is taxed at 12% and on up until you get to your tax bracket. That would mean my effective tax rate should be lower than just adding the highest tax brackets together right? 

For reference, someone told me not to claim myself on my taxes and I also calculated additional withholding because I didn‚Äôt want to owe money but I am thinking that 38% seems wrong. I also calculated the additional withholding based on my husbands and my combined income and not on mine individually so I am not sure if it is wrong to do that.

2)Should I do a cash out refi? My current interest rate on my existing 85k mortgage is 3.25% and I pay $100 a month in PMI.

3) Or should I add a HELOC which will probably be anywhere from 4.00%-5.00%

I racked up a stupid amount of credit card debt while I was in the military. Shocking, I know. Luckily, over the last 10 years I‚Äôve ‚Äúmatured‚Äù enough to create a budget that‚Äôs been successful for over 2 years, allowing us to live and enjoy life without the use of credit, and putting 25% of each paycheck toward savings/retirement. 

While saving up the $15k we also paid down about $8k of credit card debt, however, we still have roughly $10k to pay off.

My question is, should we pay it upright and be done with it or try to negotiate it a reasonable amount? The ethical and moral thing to do would be to just pay it since we (I) racked it up. However, I wouldn‚Äôt feel bad paying as little as possible to close the account since they authorized a $13k credit limit with a high interest rate for a 19 year old making roughly $1800/month.

investing,Shopify Q4 2020 Earnings Analysis and Why the Stock is Down,"Hello! I wanted to share some of my research and analysis on Shopify after its Q4 2020 earnings report. I've also used Shopify myself for 2 years so sharing some insight on that. TLDR on the bottom.

**Q4 2020 Financial Results**

* Shopify **beat EPS estimates by $0.35** by generating GAAP EPS of $0.99 and **beat revenue estimates by $64 million** by¬†generating $977 million in revenue
* Shopify had a monster 2020 with **annual revenue growing by an incredible 86%** which in large part is due to the COVID pandemic as stores moved digital and new entrepreneurs came to the scene
* The company‚Äôs platform showed incredible resilience and stickiness as the company continued to **grow its monthly recurring revenue at an annual 49% over the past 5 years**
* **Customers spent $119.6 billion dollars** on Shopify platforms¬†which is up an astonishing **96% year over year**
* Perhaps even more impressive is that the company is maintaining all this growth while¬†improving their margins, **reporting operating leverage of 39% in 2020 vs. 53% in 2019**
   * This was due to the huge uptick in 2020 revenue and further proves that the company has great product-market fit + has established itself as the go-to eCommerce platform for self-starters

**Why the Stock is Down**

* Since these numbers are so great, you may be wondering why Shopify stock fell today by \~3% (but as much as 7% intraday)
* First, as you can see from the [latest stock price chart](https://www.google.com/search?q=shopify+stock&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS744US744&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00-F5N0A4a0B01WOaVAkOiu1p_BQA:1613621430747&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=fin&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGvbmhyPLuAhVYxYsBHU6PC8EQ_AUoAXoECCAQAw&amp;biw=1923&amp;bih=946#scso=_uegtYMqOEa3KmAW5xbiYDw7:0), Shopify had a really strong build-up towards earnings because **investors were expecting a monster quarter** \+ the stock market was just on fire
   * This is further represented by the 48.3x next twelve months sales multiple Shopify was trading at as of last Friday ([sourced from blog Clouded Judgment](https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-21221)\- highly recommend to anyone interested in Cloud to sign up for this guy's newsletter)
* The second reason Shopify stock is down is **conservative guidance.** The¬†company acknowledged that its 2020 growth rate is¬†unsustainable and stated that it expects a more¬†**‚Äúnormalized pace of growth‚Äù for 2021**
   * Investors probably weren‚Äôt surprised by this but since the company didn‚Äôt provide aggressive guidance, it seems many investors took profits off the table and sold shares
* Third, just yesterday, **Amazon** completed its purchase of Australian-based Shopify competitor Selz
   * The acquisition was announced a month ago, so I don‚Äôt think this was a primary reason but I do think it is a notable factor for two reasons:
      * First, Australia is an extremely important market for Shopify, with management expressing it as a core market in the latest earnings call
      * Second, of course is just that Amazon is a terrifying competitor and may be encroaching onto Shopify‚Äôs territory

**Earnings Call Highlights**

* Throughout the call, most of the discussion was about how the company‚Äôs financial metrics are all pointing upwards and how eCommerce is growing like crazy but we already covered that stuff, so I‚Äôm going to focus on two main takeaways from the call
* **The first takeaway are the four key trends management believes will shape the new Shopify era**
   * **The first is that consumers are voting with their wallets**, meaning that people are buying products that represent their identities rather than focusing on utility
      * To take advantage of this trend, Shopify launched its mobile app SHOP last April, which is a shopping app where you can purchase from brands on the Shopify platform
      * Personally, I like the idea but I think there‚Äôs an incredible amount of competition in the shopping app space so I‚Äôm not super bullish on the app yet
      * Also, when asked for more tangible figures on the app‚Äôs performance, Tobi Lutke, Shopify‚Äôs CEO pretty much dodged the question probably because the numbers are great enough to publicize yet (which is fair since it's a pretty new product)
   * **The second trend is that retailers are prioritizing retention** and in response, Shopify is continuing to build out services that make the customer experience easier, such as Shop Pay which provides accelerated checkout and Shop Pay Installments which lets customers pay in portions instead of all at once
   * **The third trend is the growing popularity of modern financial solutions**
      * The company highlighted its Shopify Capital offering, which provide merchants with short term loans which they can pay back with their sales, Shopify Pay Installments, and Shopify Balance which lets merchants open business accounts
      * To me, its clear that Shopify is trying to be a one-stop shop for everything a merchant needs, which I think will help grow the company‚Äôs total addressable market
   * **The fourth trend is the power of omnichannel,** which is¬†the ability for businesses to be on multiple platforms
      * Shopify has established partnerships with some of the best marketing channels and I believe this trend will only continue
* **The second key¬†takeaway from the earnings call is the 3 areas the company will be investing into in 2021 and will be sources of future growth**
   * **The first is the Shopify Fulfillment Network** which the company launched 18 months ago and is currently under beta testing
      * If you‚Äôre not familiar with fulfillment, basically it allows merchants to not have to physically manage inventory themselves and instead Shopify would have huge warehouses that store your products and ship them out when orders are received for a small fee per item
      * I think this is a great complement to Shopify‚Äôs services and think this will be a great area for future growth
   * **The second main investment will be on the Shop App,** which I mentioned a bit¬†earlier already and am cautiously optimistic of
   * **The third investment will be on international expansion,** and management stated that¬†international GMV grew at a faster pace than overall GMV
      * GMV = Gross Merchandise Volume and is basically the total $ amount spent on Shopify platforms
      * This is obviously a great sign and Shopify has such a great product that I think there is a lot of room for growth in other countries
   * **The fourth bonus one that management tacked on was Shopify POS** **(point-of-sale)**, which competes with Square as an offline retail transaction system

**My Personal Experience With Shopify**

* I used Shopify for \~2 years as a merchant selling clothes and have nothing but great things to say about the platform. Shopify is so much more than just a company that lets you create an eCommerce site. The services I personally also used are:
   * **Shopify shipping** \- The company gives competitive discounted shipping rates that made it cheaper for me to fulfill myself vs. fulfillment centers (which we also used and are able to offer discounted shipping rates since they ship so many items)
   * **Shopify apps** \- There's an app for everything and a really strong ecosystem of developers who are motivated to make good apps since they earn $$
   * **Shopify POS** \- Before COVID, I held 2 physical pop-up shops and used Shopify's POS system. The only competitor I was considering was Square but Shopify's POS connects so well to everything I already set up on my store (i.e. inventory, pricing, etc.) that there Shopify POS was a no-brainer
   * **Shopify Customer Service** \- This may be the best part as a budding entrepreneur. Shopify service is AMAZING and I was able to call a representative pretty much anywhere at any time for help with my site

**Buy, Hold, or Sell?**

* I think if you're already a buyer, then there's for sure no reason to sell and I would hold for the next 5+ years.
* But for me, I haven't yet initiated a position and while the company's valuation is high (\~48X forward sales), the company's growth rate, sticky platform + recurring revenue, and dominance in a growing eCommerce market provide plenty of upside
* Personally with interest rates having gone up and a potential shift out of tech growth stocks (just my personal opinion), Shopify is one of the stocks I'm keeping a close eye on and hoping to buy during any corrections
* I'd love to get some opinions from you all on what you plan to do since I'm pretty torn myself on what to do

**TLDR: Shopify crushed earnings growing revenue at an insane 86% from 2019-2020. But shares slightly dipped by 3% due to high investor expectations + conservative guidance for 2021. From personally using Shopify myself for 2 years + knowing the eCommerce market will only continue to grow, I think the company has a really bright future ahead. But, I'm torn given the recent stock price run-up and am trying to be patient and wait for a dip (unless convinced otherwise).**",finance

personalfinance,California part year resident taxes,"I generally do my federal taxes myself, so I have some idea of reading tax forms, instructions and filling it out. Of course, I also use a Tax prep software like H&amp;R block or Turbo Tax, mostly to make sure my math checks out, and to autofill forms and such. (esp stock sales - even if they don't have to be line itemed)

So, last year, I moved to California in February. I simply changed jobs. Other than my W2 income, I had interests, dividends, and stock sale proceeds (losses actually). 

So, I made a spreadsheet of California/non-California income. The dividends and interests, I was able to split accurately based on statements. The stock sale happened after I moved to California. So, I figure my California income and thereby my taxes would be my W-2 income from California + the other income from California. The standard deduction is pro-rated since I am a part year resident.

However, once I entered the numbers in H&amp;R block (and Turbo tax as a backup online for free), I noticed that my calculated taxes were higher than what I had calculated on my spreadsheet. 

On digging through the forms, it looks like the form uses some %of federal income calculations. Well, I made more in January than 1/12th of the income for the year.

This seems like bs only California can pull! The difference is \~$300, but still, it's more money I have to dole out to the state that neither has LTCG rates, and taxes HSA contributions. (and earnings) Much greed ?",finance

The long version, This is my first full-time job, I racked up the credit card debt in relocating/furnishing my apartment. I'm living like a broke college student in a cheap part of the city.

From there I could look for a position with more room to grow but for now, I want to focus on the next 3-4 years.   Before my credit card debt, my score was 745.  Thanks to the pandemic I am not eating out and cook the majority of my meals, this results in $500-600 leftover at the end of each month. I'm using this money to pay off my credit card debt before my student loans potentially resume interest on 9/30   (While debt forgiveness would be nice and I would qualify under a few of the different ideas proposed I still don't count on any forgiveness).

I would like to pay off all my debt ASAP and don't mind living my current lifestyle for the next few years. If I was following the debt snowball method after paying off my credit card I would start with my ParentPLUS loan debt. However, my parents are willing to let this sit on their credit as long as I am paying.

Should I focus on paying off my debt to raise my credit score then consolidate the plus loan in my name or is there a better method I haven't thought of?",finance

They have retired just recently and are looking to protect their life savings from a possible crisis. They need help and am not sure exactly what would be the safest options right now. The stock market is in my opinion massively overvalued and is in a bubble. The metals are also almost higher priced than ever. Keeping cash would be problematic with possible massive inflation coming up in the future due to all the printing of money for Covid in the USA and elsewhere. It is also my understanding that bonds are also negatively affected by inflation, or in the case that interest rates go up. Which leaves us with what exactly?

&amp;#x200B;

My  thoughts would be a lot of diversification, something like 35% stocks, 35% bonds, 10% metals and 20% cash. This way at least they are more hedged from keeping all their eggs in one basket. They are incredibly risk averse and would like the safest choices available, growth is not something they are interested in, only protection of their assets. They are very against stocks in general, think it too risky and so far they have been mostly having cash and bonds. This has worked for them in the sense that they felt the safety of protecting their capital despite losing some to inflation when inflation wasn't that high over the past few years. But recently with the Covid and all that stimulus going on, inflation may end up becoming a significant concern, to the point that keeping everything in cash and bonds may end up being riskier than having some exposure to the stock market even. What are yours thoughts and advice? What would be the safest way to fight inflation and have the ""safest portfolio"" one could reasonably have without caring for growth?

Forex,How the Forex market can be profitable for you,"Traders are speculating as to how this will affect the forex market and constantly following the **latest forex signals** to maximize profitability.

It is quite surprising that the forex market has remained relatively stable as compared to the other markets. The main currencies driving this market are Euro and USD and most of the traders ask for the forex tips to maximize profits. Although there is a lot of uncertainty about how the forex market will respond further after this global pandemic, several reasons could lead to a profitable trade in this market.

**Here are 5 ways to boost the Forex market profitability via Forex Signals:**

**#1. Traders will Resort to Hedging**

Traders at this time want to limit the funds that they will lose in other markets. This will lead to multiple investments to earn greater profits from their strengthening assets. As the exchange rates fluctuate significantly, they want to lock exchange rates in the forex market using popular trading tips. So, the investors are following forex tips that will help them to hedge the investment.

**#2. More Investment in Safe Haven Assets**

Many traders are opting to trade in the forex market, particularly in safe-haven currencies, in order to earn more pips profits during these volatile market conditions. Although this strategy needs to be carefully monitored, so keep a close eye on **forex signals**.

While investing in such currencies, it is crucial to protect gains. A well-informed trader will set profit targets and use a trailing stop to ensure that their winning position is not converted into a loser position.

**#3. Increase in Inflation**

Countries deposit large quantities of reserves with central banks to maintain the stability of the economy. Banks usually invest these reserves in the forex market. During COVID-19, as a country‚Äôs economy sees a decline, the interest rates stand reduced, which causes a fall in exchange rates of currency.

As soon as the economy enters such a position, inflation rates will increase, increasing interest rates and rising demand for the currency. This leads to profit in forex trading of that currency.

**#4. Switching to Cryptocurrencies**

Higher volatility can sometimes ***lead to higher profits***. If rapid and profound falls in currencies in the forex market seem too small, you can switch to cryptocurrencies that are a lot more volatile and allow trading without weekend gaps.

**#5. Leverage**

***In forex trading, higher leverage leads to more significant profits***. So the investors who plan for higher conversion rates plan to take the risk.

**Final Word**

COVID-19 had a significant impact on financial markets. Therefore it is essential to monitor the risk management strategies employed by you during this pandemic. Such an approach should be in line to meet the challenging trading environment. If you invest wisely in this market and follow reliable Forex tips, it can turn your investments into profitable outcomes even during this time.",finance
financialindependence,FIRE perspective on Roth vs. Traditional with large pensions,"Hey all. I'm trying to figure out how to handle 457(b) contributions for me and my wife. Our annual income is currently $223,000 and I expect it to grow steadily over time, probably maxing out at $300K-$325K. We are fortunate to be in public sector jobs in a state with a well-funded pension system. Assuming we both work 30 years, and our salaries stay exactly the same as they are today, our annual pensions will total $145,000 starting at age 62. With modest salary growth built in, that amount increases to $180K - $200K.

With Social Security included, we *may* wind up with non-adjustable retirement income being as high or higher than during our working years. To me, that tilts the scales in favor of Roth 457(b) contributions. If we were to build up a large Traditional balance, the RMDs would be painful.

Ideally, we'll be in a position to RE by age 50. This could provide opportunities to convert some or most of the Traditional balance. I still feel a bit uneasy, though. I can't help but feel that I'm giving up something I can control (contributing at my known current tax rate) for the hope of a more favorable environment in the future. Obviously, tax rates could be higher in the future, but I also may end up working until age 62, with the pension starting in that year. There's a fair chance that I would lose those years of conversion to an unforeseen circumstance that forces me to keep working: college bills for our newborn, a health issue, etc. There are countless people who plan to retire early but just can't do it for a variety of reasons. I suppose the counter argument to that is that many people *are* forced to retire early, in which case I would have some time to convert the Traditional balances.

There's almost a comfort in knowing that by contributing to Roth now, I lock in the tax-free growth and I won't need to play the conversion game in the future. But, it's painful to pay both federal and state income tax on our full salaries (we have no deductions available other than the SD).

One thing to note: if one of us were to take a private sector job, or our pensions were suddenly cut in half, I would absolutely go Traditional.

Am I a little crazy, or does this sound reasonable? Thank you all.",finance

&gt; # 1. Dow set to drop as Walmart declines on disappointing earnings

&gt; * U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, after Dow stock Walmart dropped 4.5% in the premarket on disappointing earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday erased a 180-point loss and ended 90 points higher for another record close. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower for the second straight session. The S&amp;P 500 pared losses after minutes from the Fed‚Äôs last meeting signaled easy monetary policy for longer with the economy nowhere close to pre-coronavirus levels.

&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly jobless claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect 773,000 new filings for unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 20,000 from 793,000 initial claims the prior week, which saw little relief from declining Covid cases.

&gt; # 2. Walmart missed on earnings, beat on revenue; CEO to boost wages

&gt; * Trying to turn pandemic gains into sustained momentum and higher profitability, Walmart on Thursday before-the-bell reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, which fell short of estimates. Revenue grew by 7.3% to a better-than-expected $152.1 billion. The big-box retailer‚Äôs e-commerce sales in the U.S. grew by 69% and its same-store sales in the U.S. grew by 8.6%. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company will boost the wage of U.S. workers, raising the average for hourly employees to above $15 per hour.

Millions of people were in the dark at the height of the crisis, which was caused by a confluence of factors. Officials are already calling for investigations. Experts said there are a number of steps that Texas can take to combat future problems, including weatherizing equipment and increasing the amount of excess supply needed to meet peak power demand.

&gt; # 5. U.S. life expectancy drops a year in pandemic, most since WWII

&gt; * Life expectancy in the U.S. dropped a staggering one year during the first half of 2020 as the pandemic caused the first wave of coronavirus deaths. Minorities suffered the biggest impact, with Black Americans losing nearly three years and Hispanics, nearly two years, according to preliminary estimates Thursday from the CDC. ‚ÄúYou have to go back to World War II, the 1940s, to find a decline like this,‚Äù said Robert Anderson, who oversees the numbers for the CDC. It‚Äôs already known that 2020 was the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths topping 3 million for the first time.

personalfinance,How to best use pay out from auto accident,"My main question is: how do I best use $13,300 payment for total loss from a car accident?

Do I, Use it all for car purchase? Use some to pay down credit card debt? Should I find a vehicle for a total under $13,300? Should I even toy with idea of financing a new or used car?

My details:

I‚Äôm 33. Single. Full time SC state employee. I have access to a employee credit union.

Full benefits, including SC state employee retirement plan, but no other savings in place. No emergency fund either...

I rent, would like to own a home one day and have access to loan assist from city, but that‚Äôs a whole other post...

Gross Income is $42,800, take home is $28,000.

Thankfully COVID has not affected my employment or health benefits.

Recently got into car accident, car was total loss, insurance paid me $13,300 after $500 deductible.

I will need to purchase a new vehicle, but I am in no serious rush as I can borrow a vehicle from family, but obviously don‚Äôt want to rely on that for too long.

I‚Äôd like to use some of that money to pay down my credit card debt. 

In regards to how I got into debt...overspending, bad/no budgeting...but I have taken steps to correct that and have not added to either card in several months by budgeting and using only my debit card.

Credit score is ‚ÄúGood‚Äù (650-700)

Chase Amazon: $14,341.12, 14% APR, I‚Äôve been trying to do more than minimum whenever possible.

Bank Visa: $3271.33, 8% APR, making minimum payment until higher Interest card is paid off.

No other debts or looming expenses. Month-to-month bills and expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, pets, etc.) are about the same every month.

Thank you.

EDITS:

*My car that was totaled was paid off in full.

*No emergency fund or savings. State retirement.

*Have Dog. no pet emergency fund. No pet insurance. Have care credit card in case of emergency, but that is only feasible if you can pay off balance in promo period.

Pet insurance would be extra $100/month. Dog is almost 5 with pre-existing acl condition they won‚Äôt cover.

*Benefits take a huge chunk out of my monthly income, but I don‚Äôt know what I can possibly change.  Here‚Äôs what was taken out of my 2/1-2/12 pay check: https://imgur.com/a/i7rfUhm

*I file as single with max witholdings...it takes good chunk of my pay check, but I did that out of fear I would owe IRS and not have managed my money well enough during year to pay taxes. I get about $1000 back very year combined state/fed

*monthly budget, I admittedly do not have a budget other than knowing what my core expenses are...it is one of the reasons I am in trouble. 

So...expenses:

I take home $2384/month

*Rent - $850 (1br/1bth, I do not want to move. This place is the perfect mix of commute, amenities and responsible landlords. Similar properties on same block are $1000+ a month.)

*water is part of rent, so that saves a few bucks.

*Power - $150 average, can get close to $200 in summer because of SC weather.

*Medical - deductible is $500. I have a monthly a Dr visit that are $155 before deductible, then $50 afterwards.

*Rx - $70, not going into details, but obviously need these.

*Car insurance - was $100, but I‚Äôm sure it will be higher now.

*internet - $50 (will go up to at least $80 soon for lowest connection I can get, but I have to have it for work (IT)

*phone - $50 (my portion of family plan with parents after discount from work)

*credit cards:
Chase: $300 minimum, I try for $400 to $500 if I can, but usually it‚Äôs the minimum....
Bank visa: $100 minimum.


Honestly...that‚Äôs it...I know where I overspend....food, pets, and random shit. During covid I went ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and started shopping out of boredom and it got bad (obviously)

I just feel stuck now and feel trapped like I can‚Äôt get myself dug back out of this hole I‚Äôve created.

I‚Äôm embarrassed by this situation and hate how much I have screwed up my goal which is to own a home because I am sick of renting, although I know home ownership brings with it all kinds of other challenges....

I just want to get moving...",finance
stocks,I have created an algorithm that tracks discussions across trading subreddits to try and identify buzzing stocks. Here's my results.,"I created an algorithm that scans popular trading subreddits and logs when stocks are mentioned. It also analyses the posts and comments that the stocks are mentioned in and calculates the sentiment and context the stock is mentioned in.

The algorithm tries to track the overall hype and prevalence of the stock across the different subreddits, rather than simply calculating the amount of times the stock is mentioned.

**How do I currently use this?**  
Normally, I would browse different subreddits to try and learn about new stocks that are trending or being discussed. I would use those stocks as the basis of my due-diligence research over the next few days.

What I found was that this was not only time-consuming, but by the time I had done my research, the stock had already shot up in price based on the news or events that were being discussed on Reddit, or simply from the fact that now everyone is aware of this upcoming stock.

The algorithm serves as an early detection system, allowing me to pick up stocks such as SRNE or PLTR before their big price shifts.

**What is it not?**

This is an early detection tool, you should not base your investment decisions solely on the results of this algorithm.

**Please do your own DD before investing.**

**Results**

The results represent the most discussed stocks across the various sub-reddits over the last week, their price movement over the last 2-weeks *(first value in percentages)* and their overall bullishness sentiment score (second value, in bold, ranging from 0 (*negative*) to 100(*positive*)).

[https://ibb.co/vk0hLL0](https://ibb.co/vk0hLL0)

of the top 3 discussed stocks in there, **Aphria Inc (APHA)** **+45%** is the most interesting for me.

This was actually a stock my algorithm has identified for a number of days now, peaking a few days later, however given the continued chatter, and the long-term outlook for this stock, I think there is still a big upside for this stock.

Aphria Inc is a Canada-based international recreation and medicinal based cannabis distribution company. The Company‚Äôs Canadian cannabis operations are comprised of its Aphria One greenhouse facility (Aphria One), facilities held through its wholly owned British Columbia-based subsidiary, Broken Coast Cannabis Ltd. (Broken Coast) and its Leamington-based subsidiary, 1974568 Ontario Limited (Aphria Diamond).

APHA also manufacture and distribute bottled, canned and draft craft beers. The Company currently has established operations in Canada, Germany, Italy, Malta, Colombia and Argentina.

With a market cap of $5.9bn, it‚Äôs currently one of the largest cannabis companies globally, and will only grow even further once its merger with **Tilray (TLRY)** *(this is another stock my algorithm picked up on)* is complete.

To keep things brief, I will skip over discussing the merger in this post, focussing on the company financials and growth landscape instead *(I can cover this in detail if this is something people are after)*.

**Revenue**

APHA has had consistent revenue growth, going from $237m in 2019 to $543m in FY 2020, an increase of **125%**. By comparison, its closest rival Canopy Growth Corporation had a revenue increase of **%76**.

While revenue growth this year will be slightly subdued this year due to COVID supply issues and temporary closure of retail shops, pent-up demand (fuelled not only by a desire to make up for lost time, but also as a way for people to cope with the built-up anxiety of lockdown) and further mainstreaming of recreational cannabis products will only support growth long-term.

In November, Aphria purchased Sweetwater Brewing, one of the largest independent craft brewers in the US. This, along with the fact that TLRY has a contract with InBev, one of the largest beverage producers in the world, and the growing demand for more flexible ways to consume cannabis, opens up a completely new revenue stream. It‚Äôs price since that merger is up **311%**.

**Politics**

In the US, Democrats now control all of Congress, Senate and the White House. Their more progressive stance on recreational drugs compared to the previous administration means decriminalisation at a federal level is a lot more likely. This is highlighted by Chuck Schumer‚Äôs announcement that a draft of the bill be introduced at some point H1 2021.

Full US decriminalisation not only unlocks a massive market, but also places focus on European countries to follow suit with full de-restriction and regulation (this is already happening in some countries, with France currently undergoing a public consultation).

When this happens, Aphria‚Äôs European operations and scale means they can go to market at scale quicker than most rivals.

**Possible downsides**

Cannabis stocks are volatile stocks at the best of times, given the hype that has emerged on WallStreetBets surrounding this sector in the last few days, expect price to be volatile, with some more potential downside as the hype cools down.

Furthermore, some analysts are skeptical of the true size of the recreational cannabis market, suggesting growth has plateaued, pointing to sub-par market performance compared to projections historically. Personally, I believe this is all short term, as the market becomes more embedded and accepted, we will see more ‚Äòcasual‚Äô users entering the market.

**Summary**

Underneath all the volatility, APHA has some solid fundamentals that stand out compared to peers in the sector, that‚Äôs without taking into account the TLRY merger, which personally I believe will be a game changer.

In terms of investment play, this is a long-term hold, so if you are interested prepare to purchase and hold for 2‚Äì3 years. There is lots of volatility surrounding the stock, especially currently, I would suggest a small portfolio allocation, entering either before the merger, or before US decriminalisation if you miss that boat.

Bitcoin,Mainstream misconceptions and FUD explained,"Reading news articles  from the ""mainstream media"" and the subsequent comments from the ""regular folks"" just illustrates how early in the process of adoption we really are despite the price reaching ATH's .

I decided to write this post about common misconceptions I often read about Bitcoin. And yes, I understand it might be pointless to do it in an echo chamber such as this subreddit, but there might be new folks here who might be worried about some of the FUD out there.

**- If bitcoin becomes a threat to governments monopoly on currency, they will ban it.**

The only way that would work is if every country in the world would agree to this. To illustrate how unrealistic that is: The European union can't even come to a consensus regarding something as trivial as the abolishment of daylight savings time. They only agreed to stop resetting the clocks twice a year, but every country has to individually decide whether they keep the summer time or the winter time. This could result in ridiculous time differences, which geographically don't even make sense. It took the EU over 3 years to come to this ridiculous result.

If western countries did decide to ban crypto, you'd still  have countries such as Iran, North Korea, Russia,.. investing heavily in crypto because it is a way to get around economic sanctions. There's just too much conflict of interest between countries.

It is also likely that crypto mining will become an important industry in countries that produce lots of oil. As global dependence on fossil fuels will diminish in favor of green energy, these countries can put their fossil reserves to work in the mining sector, to offset their losses in the energy sector.

Thirdly, there are already countries (such as Switserland) which are embracing cryptocurrencies as the future. You see cities like Miami embracing it, you see more and more government officials invested in the crypto space. Most visibly in the U.S.

We also have seen that China banning Bitcoin in 2017 had no effect on it's parabolic growth.

**- Maybe they can't ban it, but they will regulate and tax the hell out of it.**

Regulation is a good thing. It just stipulates the rules of the game, so the game can be played without reservations. Every country will have different rules, but they will still have to compete with each other to prosper the most from this new industry. People and industry move away from countries that restrict / limit wealth.

That is also why taxation will have to be at a competitive rate between countries. If I live in a country that taxes unrealized gains and my neighbouring country does not. Guess what. I'll move. A nice example of this is Belgium. A few years ago they decided to raise taxes on alcohol. They expected about 30 million euros extra income. In fact they lost about 7 million compared to the previous year, because everybody went abroad to buy their alcohol.

Another factor is big companies investing in Bitcoin have the power to lobby. Now they inadvertantly will lobby for all of us (even though they really don't care about us)

**- How can it be a currency if it is so volatile? A Tesla car can become twice as expensive overnight if bitcoin crashes 50%.**

I read this argument a lot. People should be aware that a product is not priced in a fixed bitcoin amount, but in a fixed fiat amount. The bitcoin amount will change according to market conditions. The reason you can pay in bitcoin is because of it's speed, low fees and universal acceptance, without currency conversion costs and bank intermediaries.

In fact, there will always be fiat currency. How else can you attribute any value to bitcoin in the first place? That would be like trying to measure something with a blank ruler. Fiat would be used as the pricing mechanism, bitcoin would be used as the payment rail.

**- What about Tether? It is fake money used to inflate the bitcoin price.**

Tether is a stable coin, which supposedly is backed by the dollar. It is used by speculators on exchanges, which have difficulty being banked. It is a surrogate dollar with which traders get in and out of positions in the crypto market.

If Tethers have been printed without being backed by an equal amount of dollars, then that is an issue related to Tether, but not to Bitcoin. The fact remains that traders assume they are trading with real money. If Tether goes bust, they will revert to another stablecoin to keep trading. In fact it would then be impossible for money to flow out of Bitcoin into Tether.

A Bitcoin price crash because of Tether misuse would probably be less impactful as some might worry. There is some FUD regarding the large volume of Tether being used. Again, Tether is just a means to trade, not to artificially inflate the price.

Tether significance is being dampened  because of long term investment strategies by big corporations.

**-Bitcoin is a classic pyramid scheme! The last one's in will be the bag holders!**

I'll give you a real example of a Ponzi scheme and compare it to Bitcoin.

The US dollar is the global reserve currency. Up until 1971 it was backed by gold, meaning your dollar bills where effectively IOU's for gold. In 1971 the dollar was decoupled from gold because of government spending on the space race and the Vietnam war. This meant that the US government needed to print more money. The Federal Reserve, prints more money for the government, but also charges intrest. When the governemnt has spent that money, they can't pay it back, so they loan more money, to pay off the previous loan. This has been going on for 50 years. To make matters worse. Every other country in the world has been buying this US debt for years. Effectively every government is invested in the dollar ponzi scheme. Larger and larger amounts have to be borrowed every time.

Bitcoins supply is capped. Less and less of it become available on the open market. This means it gets more expensive to buy, but is also means you need to buy less of it, instead of more.  It also means less bitcoin gives more buying power as time goes on.

**It is really bad for the environment. Energy consumption equals that of a western country.**

I'm not an expert in energy consumption in any way. Energy consumption is still peanuts compared to the traditional financial system. However, I'm not going to deny it's energy requirements. I do believe however, this is a problem that will be addressed by such companies as Tesla for example. It wouldn't surprise me if they start mining in the future with green energy. Also, I've read over half of the mining is done with renewable energy. But I really don't know the statistics here. If anyone cares to enlighten me, go ahead.

**- Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It is like buying air.**

The same can be said about any currency.  Fiat money is backed by a promise of the government that it has value. Time and time again, we have seen that governments break their promises.

Bitcoin is backed by the trust of the people in other people. That is a more valuable propostion, because people act in their own best interest, just like governments act in their best interests. The only difference is that the governments best interests are not in line with peoples best interest.

**-Bitcoin is mainly used for illegal activities and money laundering.**

This one comes up almost every time. Yes it is, just like cash is used, just like bank accounts are used, just like any finacial instrument is used.

The only difference is that these transactions are completely traceable on the blockchain. There is actually more transparency in crypto, than in the traditional banking system. Also, there is much less illegal activity going on in the crypto world, than there is in traditional finance.

**- Bitcoin is the Myspace of cryptocurrencies.**

This is argument is often used by people who are frustrated that they missed out on the opportunity and hope their investment in some shitcoin will pay off. They will also refer to bitcoin as having outdated technology, compared to their shitcoin.

The fact is that there are already well over a 1000 other crypto's who've tried to be the next bitcoin and they all failed. Bitcoin dominance has only grown and these shitcoins are all competing with each other, rather than competing with Bitcoin. The race has already been run. Over a decade later, nobody came close.

Myspace never had the market cap of Bitcoin, Myspace was not around for over 12 years until it got dethroned by Facebook.

Facebook never even had to compete with thousands of other social media sites. Bitcoin did and massacred them all.

Shitcoiners will tell you their coin has newer, better, more secure technology. This reminds me of the battle between Betamax and VHS. Betamax was the better technology, but VHS won because it was adopted by the porn industry.

Bitcoin's tech is robust and does the job.  And (like porn) it has the network effect.

**- The supply is not capped. If they want, they can make more than 21 million.**

They can't make more bitcoin. If anybody would want to do that, there would have to be global unanimous consent and it would essentialy destroy one of the most important premises of Bitcoin.

Let's assume a group of bitcoiners wants to create 42 million bitcoins. Then they could create a hard fork, to make their own chain on the bitcoin network. The dominant strain would remain the true bitcoin and the forked strain would have it's own userbase. However all forks that have happened in the past died a horrible death, while bitcoin prospered.

**-If there's a solar flare or power outage all bitcoins are gone forever.**

You can also kiss your bank account goodbye. Same difference.

**-Bitcoin can be hacked.**

No, it can't. In it's entire existence it has not been compromised. The network grows stronger each day, meaning it gets more secure each day. Because it is decentralized there is no single point of failure, unlike traditional banks.

The only weakness in the system is YOU. If you lose your keys, you lose your coins.

personalfinance,Is it possible to refinance my current mortgage with foreclosure in my credit history?,"Hello,

I really would like to take advantage of todays lower interest rates.

I current have credit score of 820. I bought a house in 2017. I was able to somehow get a mortgage from a credit union.

I foreclosed on a house in 2015. I had hardship after 2008 (losing job, taking care of my parents, etc) and couldn‚Äôt make mortgage payment at the time.

It‚Äôs been 6 years since the foreclosure and with my high credit score, I thought I could refinance without issue.

I was quoted at 2.5% with zero points from a broker. Application process was smooth until toward the end when they started asking me about the foreclosure from 2015. They asked me to write a letter explaining this. I wrote a nice letter and they still came back and told me I would need to wait until 2022 (7 years since foreclosure).

Question to the sub is,are there any other ways to refinance before 7 years? I really don‚Äôt want to miss out on today‚Äôs low rates if there are ways.

stocks,Am I missing something about this dip or is everyone else?,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of discussions of this dip on Reddit as if it‚Äôs just a thing the stock market does randomly once in a while or that it‚Äôs people profit taking or that it‚Äôs due to the three day weekend; none of which seem to make too much sense??

As far as I‚Äôve read there are fears of high inflation right now due to the Fed‚Äôs loose policy and Biden‚Äôs stimulus package. If you ask me the market‚Äôs wrong (exhibits A-Z: every inflation fear-mongering article since March 2020) especially with the US unemployment data looking as bad as it is right now. It‚Äôs funny because just last week markets had a nice boost off the back of that incoming Biden pack.

US treasury yield are up on the back of this and it‚Äôs exacerbated by oil shortage or something the other in Texas and rising gas prices will theoretically lead to higher inflation (this makes me wish everyone owned an EV right now)! The Fed is sticking to its guns and seemingly not worried about the stimulus or overshooting inflation. There are Economists on both sides of the debate as always but the Fed certainly won‚Äôt be taking their foot off the pedal any time soon. 

So there, that‚Äôs my current view on the reds. I doubt the red days will ease up before next week since these things aren‚Äôt going away any time soon even though I believe fears of too much inflation for an economy with insane unemployment statistics are unfounded. 

Am I the idiot here or are people just really not picking up on what‚Äôs causing the dip? Hopefully I‚Äôm right and this helps people.

Wasn‚Äôt the whole idea/motivation of building a trust-less, peer-to-peer cash system as a way to prevent non-transparent central banks from devaluing an individuals wealth via inflation? 

This community has to see the irony in the meme of ‚ÄúJpow money printer go brrr‚Äù and the biggest underlying unit of trade in cryptocurrency markets being USDT Tether, being issued by a private company that has never been independently audited. 

How is a private company controlling money printing better than a central bank? 

Central banks at least have governance systems which minimally prevents any single individual from making decisions as they please. The governance systems could be better, but it‚Äôs better than nothing. Why are we suppose to just trust Tether, a privately owned company, has any such governance system, any real checks and balances on its executives?  The folks at Tether are just really good emperors huh?

It‚Äôs the equivalent of if the US just let Goldman Sachs be in charge of US monetary policy/money printing. 

No matter which cryptocurrency you back, USDT Tether is an issue for all until an independent audit shows healthy levels of non-crypto reserves.  

I am not writing this because I‚Äôve ‚Äúcashed out.‚Äù I‚Äôm invested, but want the community to be stronger, more self critical. I‚Äôve said my peace, voiced my concern, shouted into the abyss. It‚Äôs a systemic issue that requires a systemic response, and I am just one little actor in that system. I see my only leverage as to publicly voice my concern and to not use USDT until they have an independent audit, and to encourage others to do so.  Luckily this isn‚Äôt 2017, there are plenty of audited alternative stable coins.

I hope that Tether doesn‚Äôt fuck us, I hope they have enough stable reserves to support their outstanding liabilities, but I got into this space because I stopped hoping people would do the right thing, and believe blockchain technology gives us the transparency and immutability to efficiently interact globally with minimal risk via trust/hope.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Need advice on finances going back to grad school for a career change,"As the title says, I'm planning on going back to grad school next fall for a career switch from Customer facing roles in tech to Mental Health Counseling/Sports Psychology. I found a program in the city I live in that offers a unique program that is a dual degree program in Mental Health Counseling and Sport and Human Performance.

From my conversations with Alumni the program gets you ready for the counseling license exams and if done right, certified to be a certified mental performance consultant. Jobs in mental health are not going away any time soon and after the pandemic is over I imagine a lot of folks are going to seek help, this thing is doing a number on everyone's mental health. I specifically want to work in the sports world eventually and it might take some time to get there but it's what I want to do and I think my current career path is fairly cushy but does not inspire any sort of motivation or drive in me at all. 

Here's the problem, this program is very unique but since it's at a private university, it's very expensive. It's also very time consuming and only a few of the Alumni I've talked to have said they worked and went to school at the same time, so I might be able to swing having a job the first year but the 2nd and 3rd year with internships school basically becomes your job.

I'm 31 and make $59k a year right now and pay $1400 a month in rent. I'm usually able to fit all my necessary expenses into 50% of my take home pay, keep 30% as pocket cash and save 20%. I have about $21k in my emergency fund and have about $11k in other investment accounts. The program I've been accepted into costs about $33k a year and over three years that's $99k. I have no debt and have never taken out student loans. 

I might be able to pay some of the first year out of pocket but would have to take out student loans for the rest and if I'm not planning on working my second or third year in the program I'd be taking out more loans if I can't find scholarships/grants to pay. Plus I would have to factor in cost of living. In normal times it would be easy to say ""well I can just learn to bartend or serve and make cash on the weekends that way"" but the service industry has been hit too hard for me to fall back on that. Every where I look people are saying you should never pay for grad school but I feel like there's nothing I can do but take out student loans and plan to pay them off for a long time. 

I've thought of other maybe cheaper ways to get into the field like doing a cheaper counseling masters and then going back to just get the sport and human performance masters later but I'm wondering if I should just bite the bullet and take out the loans and know that I'm responsible for what happens after. I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety about the decision. 

Its large and  life changing both in good ways and bad ways. I guess I'm looking for advice. I feel like I just have to say I'll make it work and know somehow someway I will. It took a lot for me to finally start budgeting and getting to a financially secure place feels great but I also hate my job and it was only ever meant to be a day job not a career. I'm going to talk to the Financial Aid office about federal work study programs but they don't offer TAs or anything like that. Any and all advice would be helpful.",finance

CryptoCurrency,THIS... IS... HUGE!!! BlackRock‚Äôs Rick Rieder says the world‚Äôs largest asset manager has ‚Äòstarted to dabble‚Äô in bitcoin,"[BlackRock](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BLK)‚Äôs Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world‚Äôs largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.

The remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock‚Äôs [chief investment officer of global fixed income](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/biographies/rick-rieder), came on the same day bitcoin [broke above $51,000 for the first time](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/bitcoin-btc-price-smashes-through-51000-to-hit-new-all-time-high.html).

‚ÄúToday the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,‚Äù Rieder said on [‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/)‚ÄúPeople are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we‚Äôve started to dabble a bit into it.‚Äù

In January, BlackRock added [bitcoin futures](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=@BTC.1) as an potential investment for [two of its funds](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-blackrock-investment-crypto-currency-idUKKBN29Q0FT), according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are [BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001738078/000119312521012149/d96814d497.htm)¬†and [BlackRock Global Allocation Fund](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/834237/000119312521012142/d46120d497.htm).

A number of other financial institutions, such as [BNY Mellon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BK) and [Mastercard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MA), have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation‚Äôs oldest bank, will [launch a digital assets unit later this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/bny-mellon-to-offer-bitcoin-services-a-validation-of-crypto-from-a-key-bank-in-the-financial-system.html), while Mastercard [intends to support certain cryptocurrencies](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/mastercard-to-open-up-network-to-select-cryptocurrencies.html) on its formal network.

Electric-vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA) also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.

The price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. ‚ÄúMy sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving the price up,‚Äù Rieder said.

Despite bitcoin‚Äôs growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have ‚Äúdepends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre holding a lot more cash than we‚Äôve held historically,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because duration doesn‚Äôt work, interest rates don‚Äôt work as a hedge and so diversifying into other assets makes some sense. Holding some portion of what you hold in cash in things like crypto seems to make some sense to me, but I wouldn‚Äôt espouse a certain allocation or target holding.‚Äù

New York-based BlackRock had [$8.68 trillion of assets under management](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/blackrock-blk-q4-2020-earnings.html) at the end of the fourth quarter.

Rieder has spoken positively about the potential for bitcoin before, telling CNBC in November he believes it [could ‚Äútake the place of gold to a large extent.‚Äù](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/blackrocks-rick-rieder-bitcoin-can-replace-gold-to-a-large-extent-.html) He added, ‚ÄúI think digital currency and the receptivity ‚Äî particularly millennials‚Äô receptivity ‚Äî of technology and cryptocurrency is real.‚Äù  


**KEY POINTS:**  

* **BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, has ‚Äústarted to dabble‚Äù in bitcoin, according to Rick Rieder.**
* **‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt put a number on the percentage allocation one should have, depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like,‚Äù said BlackRock‚Äôs chief investment officer of global fixed income.**

 **KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

**The largest asset manager on this planet, with $8.67 TRILLION under management, has confirmed they are now buying Bitcoin. However, they refuse to disclose what percentage their allocation or percentage to their portfolio.**

I'm about to file for disability since I qualify for being out of work for over 12 months, of which I am aware it taking quite awhile to receive financial assistance. Also, I only have about 3k of funds to work with at the moment. I'll be returning to work in about a month, so I'll soon have income once again. I'm a responsible and diciplined individual. Managing finances and not overspending is easy for me. All the medical issues and not having income just flipped my life on its head.

I'm considering that when I have income again to get apply for a 10k loan with a high interest rate to temporarily offset much of the debt I've accumulated. Buying myself time essentially. I know that digging a hole to get out of another hole can be idiotic. However, getting such a loan would simply be to have increased stability while my life continues to recover and not be living with the stress of being paycheck to paycheck.

stocks,What's causing the stock dump &amp; how it impacts the investor,"So it looks as if a major spike in interest rates is upending the market. There are some reasons why this happens, and I'll include some notes below from some paywalled articles. But the main idea is that there is a rotation building up away from growth stocks into value stocks. That kind of rotation happens very rarely and can be accompanied by significant corrections of 10% or more. 

For some time, because of all the stimulus starting in 2020, people have been warning of inflation Of course, that's affected the market with rising commodity prices, rising bitcoin/ethereum/dogecoin pricing vs the dollar, and so on. But that was all happening in the context of predicting future inflation/future higher interest rates while enjoying low interest rates in the present due to Fed easing. There are a lot of articles on how rising interest rates can kill stock growth, and you can find those online. 

* This 02/18/21 Business Insider article covers some issues: [US stocks are on the verge of a correction as interest rates begin to rise, DataTrek says](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-correction-likely-interest-rates-begin-to-rise-2021-2-1030097824)

&gt; Interest rates have ticked higher in recent weeks, with the 10-year US Treasury Note jumping to 1.31% on Thursday from 0.91% at the start of the year. And even though the Fed has signaled that it does not foresee raising interest rates until 2023, Fed Funds Futures are beginning to signal that the Fed could begin increasing rates in 2022. ""The odds of a Fed policy shift next year has gone from 2% to something closer to 5% to 10%,"" Colas said. That doesn't represent the danger zone yet, ""but the trend is clearly not our friend,"" the note said.

&gt; As interest rates rise, it tends to put pressure on stock prices as the premium assigned to equities drops due to investors re-allocating their portfolios to higher yielding fixed income. Essentially, the bullish ""there is no alternative"" argument for stocks in a zero interest rate world begins to dissipate. And based on its analysis of previous bull markets, stocks could decline by 8% sometime in the next 4-6 weeks, DataTrek said.

Think of it this way: with practically zero interest rates AND inflation, conservative, retired and other investors would actually lose money sitting in low-volatility, slow growth value stocks, bonds and fixed income assets. That's because inflation would erode the value of their money faster than they could maintain it because of the low-interest environment. That means that everyone, even conservative and retired persons have to pile into growth stocks in order to not have inflation eating away at their portfolio.

However, once interest rates start to rise to match or exceed inflation, then they can go back to safer investments like bonds and other fixed-income assets, and low-volatility value stocks. These investors are more concerned with not losing money than making a lot more, so if there's a decent interest rate out there, they will jump ship from growth stocks to bonds &amp; value stocks. 

Because there was a big jump in interest rates this week, a big rush of money is coming out of growth stocks and piling into safer stuff. Also, we've had a big run-up in stock prices recently and these same investors, as well as some others, will be set to take profits. 

&gt; DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said that US stocks are due for a sell-off following a strong 20% rally in the S&amp;P 500 since the end of October.

* In this 02/18/21 CNBC Article, a 10-15% correction is predicted: [How the rapid run-up in interest rates could set off a 10% to 15% correction](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/how-the-rapid-run-up-in-interest-rates-could-set-off-a-10percent-to-15percent-correction.html)

&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.28% as stocks sold off, after trading as high as 1.31% earlier in the day. The yield was about 15 basis points ‚Äì or 0.15% ‚Äì lower in the middle of last week.

&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the stock market could be in the middle of a 10% to 15% correction, after the rapid run-up in interest rates that took the 10-year to fresh one-year highs.

Because the market has had a big run-up and is ""overbought"", the 200 day moving average might provide the bottom

&gt; ‚ÄúThe market is sufficiently overbought that that spot may be closer to the 200-day moving average which is 3,418,‚Äù said Emanuel. He said the market will adjust to the higher yield, and the sell-off should create a buying opportunity. 

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely a change in psychology that as we found, and rightly so, given the greater success of the vaccine and pretty reasonable prospects for the economy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing this shift away from growth and toward value stocks. That shift hardly ever occurs in the course of history in a non-volatile fashion.‚Äù 

This one market strategist says that the steep dive may be due to how fast interest rates moved, causing a stampede

&gt; Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said the stock market should not be reacting as much as it is to the current level of yields.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the pace of change, not the actual place we‚Äôve gotten to that investors are worried about,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe think the yield on the 10-year will be between 1.5% and 2% by the end of the year. We just didn‚Äôt think it would be there by the end of this week.‚Äù 

Again, this isn't just due to rising interest rates, tho, or even interest rates rising very fast, but the fact that the market is already at highs and people were already poised with their fingers on the trigger to take profits:

&gt; ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt freak out every time the yield on the 10-year goes up, thinking it‚Äôs the apocalypse because it‚Äôs not. We‚Äôre near an all-time high. To me this is an excuse to take profits,‚Äù Hogan said. The pullback could be as steep as 10% or more, he said.

The stocks that will be most affected are those with high growth multiples, i.e the opposite of value stocks:

&gt; ‚ÄúThe shift higher and market psychology around what has been a rise in yields, not just in the U.S. but globally suggests at these valuations, the oversold market is going to have difficulty sustaining these levels in the near term, particularly for high-multiple growth stocks,‚Äù said Emanuel of BTIG.

This means that the heaviest incoming losses should be for high-PE stocks, like the overbought FAAMGs:

&gt; ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a source of pressure because as interest rates rise, the value of the discounted cash flow in these companies‚Ä¶decreases,‚Äù Emanuel said. ‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt be a problem at 15 or 20 times next year‚Äôs earnings, but for many companies, with 30, 40, 50 and upward times valuations, it‚Äôs a significant headwind in the near term.‚Äù

&gt; That would include a number of FAANG stocks. For instance, Facebook was down about 1.6% on Thursday afternoon at 2 p.m. ET. Netflix was nearly 0.9% lower and Alphabet was down 0.6%.

&gt; Other growth favorites Apple lost 1.7%, while Tesla was down 1.5%.

All of the above analysts that I quoted above stated that the long term equity growth picture is strong and that when the dust settles, this will be a buying opportunity. 

_________________

Personally, this is a good time for me to rebalance my portfolio back to some value stocks that I had liked in 2020 but weren't doing anything because no one would put money into them. So right now, value stocks are on a growth arc, at least in the short term. Like a lot of other investors, I had swung away from value stocks completely in the past few months and can rebalance my portfolio. Growth stocks should pick up their growth again, but from a lower level after the selloff slows down. In the meantime, I think maybe I can catch some of the run-up in good value stocks that are seeing some inflows.",finance

personalfinance,"Wife has student loans, I just made some money off crypto...","I'll try to keep it short:

My wife and I's income from last year was about $120k. I make around $40k/year, she makes around $80k.

I am debt free, but my wife has about $51k in student loan debt.

$30k are federal loans at 6.1%. We are crossing our fingers that the current administration will do some form of student loan debt erasure, but not banking on it. She is not currently paying these because of the federal halt on student loan payments.

$21k are private loans at 11.25%. At the current rate she's paying this off, she will have paid double the $21k when the loan is paid off.

I have been holding some cryptocurrency for a long time and am now in a position where I could sell enough to pay off the private loans in full. The crypto I would be pulling out would be taxed as a long term capital gain because I've held it for over a year. But it would bump up my taxable income by that $21k too.

To me, this still seems like a good idea that will save us a lot of money in the long run. 

Am I missing anything? Is there anything else I need to consider before doing this?

personalfinance,Debt consolidation to increase credit score?,"\*\*I don't want advice or to be lectured about credit card and debt overall, thats not why I am here\*\*

Theoretically, if you are in a lot of credit card debt, you most likely have a low credit score, IE it is difficult to get approved for good rates.

Tell me if this would be a logical or a potential way to pay down high credit card debts with a lower overall interest rate?

Apply for debt consolidation loan- let's say approving at about the same ARP % as your current credit card rates.

Use money to pay off all credit card debt with a predicted score increase of 100 points

Wouldn't you theoretically be able to apply to Refinance loan in 3-4 months to have a lower interest rate than before if your credit score increases and your credit card balance decreases? Or am I missing something else that would cause it to be difficult to refinance months after?",finance

I  am a 24-year-old guy who got himself a bunch of debt just to increase his chance of getting a decent job. Luckily, I am able to get a somewhat decent job before graduation (got the offer in November last year and started the job in January this year). Here are some backgrounds about  me:

2021 Income: $52.8K after-tax, my company offers 401k plan with 50% match up to 6%

List of debts I have in the order of interest rate:

1. $38,036.00 at 7.08% (federal student loan for master's degree)

6. $21,670.38 at 0.90% (student loan for bachelor's degree from another country)

1. I have seen the flowchart in the wiki
2. I only need to start paying student loan after Sep 30, might be even later depending on the situation of pandemic
3. I  have used loan calculator like unbury.me to let me have more sense  about my loan and how to pay them, and I plan to pay starting from the  highest interest rate to the lowest
4. I am maxing out company 401k match
5. I am saving up 3 months of emergency fund using HYSA by full force, considering pushing to 6 months if needed

Here are my questions:

1. The flowchart says I should get rid of those debts before I start saving for retirement, should I really focus on repaying those debts first and make no investment toward retirement at all? If no, how much (or what percentage) should I spend on investments? What about HSA?
2. Should I try to refinance my federal student loan? If yes, when?

personalfinance,Buying a House Without Loan History (Only Credit Cards),"Hi everyone,

I am starting to think about buying my first house within the next 2-5 years. Currently, I have three lines of credit open, and my score is close to 800, but my account tells me that my lack of credit types hurts me. I am an only child, so I was fortunate enough that I got a hand me down car, never having to take out a car loan for a new or used car, just maintaining that one hand me down car.  I was also fortunate enough to not have to take out any loans out for my academic career (I worked while attending college, and I went to a community college, using my own savings when I transferred in addition to the federal aid I got).

Will my lack of credit types hurt me when I start trying to get pre-qualified for a home mortgage? Would you recommend that I buy a couch (or another big purchase) to add to my credit score?

personalfinance,Consolidate personal loans worth it?,"Hi guys, I'm back again with a question and I need some advice, I'm wondering if consolidating personal loans is worth it and/or what should I do?

I made poor financial choices in my early twenties, and I'm still paying for it..and I'm struggling even more now since my job cut hours and only give a maximum of 20hrs/week. My credit cards have a combined balance of about $5k and one which I'm trying to pay off completely first has an interest rate that never really brings the balance down below 1500. With my hours cut, I can only pay a maximum of 200 to this card every month. 

I know $5k credit card debt is not much, but with little I make now it's so frustrating to not be able to pay things off. Plus I am also paying for my own college tuition/expenses too, so if things go at the pace they are, I won't be able to afford to go to school next semester. I was thinking, if I consolidate my debt, I'd be able to pay $500 per month to that if there's no interest (or a lower one). But splitting out $500 per month on my credit card payments isn't enough to really lower my debt. 


Any advice/suggestions highly appreciated, thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Would LOVE investing advice please,"Hi. Wish I was writing this post 10 years ago but better late than never.

I would love feedback on next steps.  I first want to point out that my numbers include my spouse‚Äôs retirement too. Currently, we have $215,945 in retirement. I have pension from 2 states that will eventually pay out nearly $4000 in retirement. Our current asset mix is 42% D Stocks, 22% F stocks, 12% bonds, 22% short term and 2% other. Based on my profile, Fidelity wants me to be at 35% D Stocks, 15% F stocks, 40% bonds, 10% short term.

Let me explain what the 22% short term.  We have $41,864 in cash that sits in roth and rollover accounts  -13,000 in roth and 28,864 in rollover IRA. I need to figure out where to invest this money.

The question is HOW and WHERE? Our accounts are in fidelity.  I do not want to sign up for advising by Fidelity just yet (unless you all feel I need to) as I don't want to give my money away.  Fidelity has retirement planning on their site and when I ""asked"" it how to invest this $41,864, it says the following: for passive mutual funds, 62% FNSOX -short term bond index fund and 38% FDRXX federal government cash reserves OR for ETF, same percentages but AGG - US Aggregate Bond ETF -62% and SHV - ishares short treasury bond - 38%.

So I am really confused on what to do. I gather it is advising bonds given my asset mix but I feel like I could make more money else where, no?  Initially, I was thinking I would just take the Roth IRA money and buy IVV - ETF that models S&amp;P 500 and then was thinking FBCGX - mutual fund for rollover. Was gonna do that before I ""asked"" fidelity. There is a lot I don't know. 

So based on the info, and the fact that I want to retire in 17 - 18 years, What would you advise? Go with what Fidelity advises since it is using the numbers and allocations of my accounts? OR do I say screw it and get ETF or Mutual fund that has highest return.  Maybe Fidelity says bonds because we have less than 3 months in emergency funds? 

Love the honest and helpful feedback. Thank you!",finance

I cook most of my meals and do all the other little things people normally recommend to save money here and there. I started playing around with a thousand dollars and investing in individual stocks and that has gone well for me so far (figure if I fuck up and a chunk of my initial cash vaporizes it's not a huge loss). I'm not married and my family is not well off so buying a place is all on me if I want to go down that road.

What is Money?

Money is a very important invention that allows for a much more efficient transfer of the value of goods and services than its predecessor, the barter system. The barter system was invented by some pretty smart human beings, back in 6,000 B.C.E. probably somewhere in Mesopotamia.¬†

The barter system was invented because of the idea of scarcity and surplus.¬†

If I have a surplus, it means I have more than I want of some good or service.¬†If I have a scarcity, it means I have less than I want of some good or service.¬†The barter system was a way of connecting people with what they wanted but couldn't otherwise obtain.

The barter system was pretty cool, but then money was invented at some point in various places at various times. The most notable example of this was the Shekel, which was basically a unit of measure roughly equivalent to 8 grams of barley, which was a common¬†medium of exchange in Mesopotamia (see above) around 3,000 B.C.E.


Money has 3 primary characteristics

Money is a medium of exchange.Money is a unit of account.Money is a store of value.

I could go on and on about the history of money, but that's not really what I want to talk about. I also don't think you want to read about it. The title of this post was not ""The History of Money"". I'm sure there is a book titled that. Maybe I'll read a book like that someday, but not today. The point I'm trying to get at... is that money has existed for a very long time. It's gone through many different renditions and changes.¬†Money is always reinventing itself.¬†


More accurately,¬†human beings¬†are always reinventing money, because human beings CAN be pretty awesome.


The form of money we are most familiar with right now is¬†Fiat money. Fiat money is backed by the faith and credit of a government, and issued by the government. The United States government issues money, called federal reserve notes. Some like to refer to these as greenbacks. Some say that greenbacks will be worth no more than toilet paper some day.

Perhaps even less than toilet paper, due to lack of absorbency.


The amount of fiat currency that is created every year is not governed by any true set of rules.¬†


There's no universal constant, or logical function or operation that determines how much money can be created or destroyed. Yes, governments and central banks make decisions based on a certain set of principles, but those principles are mere guidelines, and not absolute rules. The amount of money that is created can fluctuate depending on what is currently happening in the world, and the amount of money that is created can fluctuate based on the opinions of the people in charge of that money creation.

While the above description may be inadequate or may sound flippant and uninformed to those who actually know about economics, I am convinced that if you ponder this long enough, you could come to the following conclusion: Fiat currency, if left in its current state, will eventually become worthless.


Okay. I really haven't gotten around to talking about the stuff I wanted to talk about. Hope you enjoyed my philosophy of money Ted Talk. Let's move along to something more interesting.


What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a form of money, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, and activated in December 2009. One Bitcoin equals 100 million Satoshis. Bitcoin operates on a form of technology known as a blockchain, and uses distributed ledger technology as a form of record keeping. This is a new form of accounting for stuff. The old form of accounting for stuff is called the double-entry system, and it was invented by an Italian guy named Luca Pacioli.

I'm not going to go into the technical aspects of distributed ledger technology, but basically... the way it works is that every transaction that has ever occurred on the Bitcoin network is tracked on every single computer that makes up that network. All transactions = ledger. All computers = distributed. For purposes of this simplified description, a computer is a node. The node provides power to the network.¬†


All of the nodes working together allow the network to function in a way that prevents any single operator from disrupting the system. Since all of the nodes have the same list of all transactions, they can be verified against each other like a sort of recursive back-up loop. If i send you some BTC, that transaction gets grouped¬†with other transactions which form a block, and then that block gets attached to the top of all previous transactions as another link in the chain (hence ""block-chain""). The order of these transactions cannot be rearranged or changed in any manner, because of the distributed nature of the ledger (its carried on everyone's computer that is running a full node).


As a form of payment for keeping all of these transactions on your computer, and for validating new transactions, you can be rewarded with new Bitcoin. You must first solve a very complicated math puzzle. The math puzzle is a complex cryptographic puzzle that requires significant amounts of computing power to solve. Once the puzzle is solved, you are essentially entered into a lottery with a chance to win some bitcoin.


Value Proposition of Bitcoin

By nature of bitcoin's programming, there will only ever be 20,000,000 bitcoins in existence. Roughly every 4 years, the reward for mining bitcoin is cut in half, thus there is a logarithmic decay in the amount of bitcoin that can be created.¬†

This means that as we get closer and closer to 20,000,000 bitcoins in existence, bitcoins are harder and harder to create. This creates an intrinsic level of scarcity. Scarce resources aren't always more valuable, but scarce resources that are fungible (can be broken up into little pieces, like a dollar can be broken up into 100 pennies), and that are easily transferable and verifiable, do have value. Money has value, as discussed above. Bitcoin has demonstrated that it is both money, and scarce. Fiat, as demonstrated above, is money but is not scarce.


Bitcoin is in a bubble?¬†

Perhaps it's value has increased rapidly in a very short time frame, and is due for a correction. This has happened several times already, most notably in 2018, the price of Bitcoin decreased by almost 80%. Before the crash in 2018, the price of Bitcoin soared to around $20k per 1 bitcoin. It is currently $50k per 1 bitcoin.


Let's think for a moment about a wealthy person wanting to hedge their position in fiat. Let's define a wealthy person as someone with 100 million units of US Dollars. That person may be interested in owning 1 bitcoin, because there are arguments that suggest bitcoin is a hedge against inflation. There are roughly 46,000,000 millionaires or high net worth individuals. Let's round that down to 40 million. There will only ever be enough Bitcoin for each of those people to own .5 bitcoin. Think about that.


What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is like Bitcoin's little brother. Younger, smaller, but way fuckin smarter and way fuckin more disruptive. Ethereum is Bitcoin, but with smart contracts connected to it. If Bitcoin is digital Gold then Ethereum is digital oil. More on that in the next newsletter.

I purchased my house in 2018 for $345K. I put $40K as a downpayment and my mortgage loan was for $305K at 4.5%.

Two years later, I‚Äôm trying to refinance. We started working with a lender recommended by my real estate agent.

She quoted me at a rate of 2.99% for 30 years, the loan would be for $299K and our out of pocket would be about $600.

When we got the final paperwork, I skimmed through it and her numbers had us paying $2,500 out of pocket instead of the $600. We told her and she said that her manager hadn‚Äôt applied something and that she would get it done but that it would take her 2-3 days. It‚Äôs been a week and I haven‚Äôt heard from her.

The paperwork did mention that the interest rate was locked until April. Does that make sense? They can guarantee an interest rate for a month and half?

In addition, I noticed that the paperwork had the original price of the house at $320K when it really was $345K (mortgage loan was for $305K). I was wondering if this can affect the interest rate we are being quoted.

Also, the estimated price of the house was listed at $416K on their paperwork. Seems a bit high to me. Zillow has it estimated at $370K and Redfin at $401. Would the estimated price of the house affect the interest rate offered?

I heard some people saying to use specific Cardono run or owned wallets like yoroi and I am wondering why it is best to store my crypto in that wallet rather than the Coinbase wallet or the many other wallets and if the APY when staking ADA is the same over all wallets or does it differ and should I look for the best return on my investment?

I personally use White Flour but I'm sure you could substitute Whole Wheat Flour with Fantastic Results.
Oh and I forgot to mention that the batter after being mixed together can be refridgerated for up to a week and can be frozen after being cooked for upto a month!

As For Pictures, I'll Put Some Up As Soon As I Get Some Eggs.

I was also thinking of maybe boxing them up and selling them, as a near-instant pancake mix.
Does anyone know what kind of red tape i have to go through to do that?

Anything to do with food and you really wanna make sure you don't get sued. If you accidentally ship the mix with a rusty nail in it and someone dies, that's bad.

Anyhow, PM me with the recipe and an address and I'll have a go at it (the pancakes, not the litigation).

CryptoCurrency,"Just because Satoshi used the phrase ""peerless cash"" doesn't mean that he wasn't also modeling Bitcoin after gold -- miners, finite supply, decreasing supply rate. Prove me wrong!!","All the components of digital gold + peerless cash are built my into Bitcoin.  There are fees, but they are virtually non-existent with Lightning.  Being ""feeless"" does not make a currency cash-like, because cash has a hidden fee, known as inflation!!

People keep saying ""Satoshi was not designing digital gold because he used the phrase *'peerless cash'*"", but many elements of Bitcoin are OBVIOUSLY modeled after gold production (PoW) and a limited, finite supply leading to FOMO demand (halvings).

Just because I am charged a $4 fee to move Bitcoin ON CHAIN is not really a problem, guys!!  Even if Taproot, Scnorr, &amp; Lightning don't make a dent in BTC's on chain transaction fees, I promise you there's gonna be a credit card that will allow you to make ONE BTC payment / month for all your monthly fiat transactions... all for ONE $4 transaction fee.  It'll happen soon enough.  Paying $4/mo for an ""in my face"" fee is much better, more honest than the hidden inflation tax.

Sure, you're thinking... ""But I don't want any intermediaries!""  If you want trustless, peerless cash, you MUST use PoW and pay a reasonable fee for the work needed to secure the network in the absolute fairest method possible.  If you want digital gold sent for the cheap, you're gonna need an intermediary... but at least you'll be satisfied with the money issuance policy, knowing it's not ""funny money"".  If you want a shitcoin, you're obviously looking for something that was NOT modeled after gold.

Prove me wrong!!  I know there're a lot of nice projects out there, but they all sacrifice security, trustlessness, or finite supply / halvings, but Lightning has *already* made the iron-clad Bitcoin network scalable for the masses.  Even the Federal Reserve and other Central Banks have many layers necessary for scalability.  Hell... Even the IMF can be seen as a Layer 0, if you will.  Any project that claims to scale on one layer is not really peerless, trustless.  Here's a hint... You can't delegate or choose a validator in a peerless, trustless system.  Again, prove me wrong.  ;-)

The wife and I are getting to a point in our financial journey where we have started looking into interest rates on checking accounts, savings accounts, investment, etc. Up till now we have only ever had a single checking account and no savings account. As I understand it, savings accounts can be good as they can give you a separate place to keep money you dont intend to spend in the short term and tend to have higher interest than checking accounts.
In doing our research I have come across a well reviewed bank that regularly shows up in the top ten for checking accounts at places like nerdwallet, investopedia, Forbes, etc... That has an interest rate of 1.25%. the best savings account apy I can find is 0.6%.
If the interest rate is double for a checking account vs a savings account (I know it has requirements like minimum monthly direct deposit, etc, but I have reviewed those and fully expect them to be no issue), then is there any reason to go with a savings account at all?",finance

investing,Potential Silver and Silver Miner Moonshot,"Short DD, feel free to comment.

Tailwinds:

\- Commodity vs gold ratio has started to crunch down signaling commodity boom (copper, lumber, tin, oil, NG, even uranium). Silver, though considered a partial monetary metal, is only going to see increased demand from batteries, solar, EV, medical equipment from here on out. I believe one Tesla Roadster uses something like 1-3 kg of silver. Historical average gold to silver ratio is 40. We are at 66 ish. Mining ratio is 8:1, even lower.

\- Natural elasticity built up from COMEX futures suppression. This is a long topic in itself, but the silver price along with gold price has been ""managed"" for years, with banks like JPM being fined millions of dollars for spoofing (creating massive sells using paper futures triggering cascade of sell stops during thin volume trading hours). However as supply becomes tighter the COMEX is increasingly being used as a method for private family offices, mints, industrials, and hedgefunds to take delivery. The situation is quite dire IMO after the recent ""silversqueeze"" movement- Currently there are about 700 million ounces worth of open contract, with 4 days until March delivery. This number is historically high, and even a small percentage of these contracts standing for delivery (i.e by mints and ETF etc who are feeling the demand) would lead to price volatility.

\- Monetary metal. Due to its extreme utility it can be considered the Etherium or theta to gold, but it is nevertheless still store of value, even though it is not a tier I asset for central banks yet. While gold experiences short term head wind due to rising bond yields, a FED yield curve control policy would dramatically increase tail winds for gold. If history serves, gold and silver have a deep connection and a true commodities bull market is often marked by high gold prices. 

\- Unlike gold, silver has no direct competitor, perceived or actual. Graphene technology is many years away as is space mining. 

Headwinds:

\- Disbelief. Really this is the only head wind I see. Silver has all the properties of gold, and all the utility of something like copper, along with the right price for a value play. If you believe in commodities and inflation, silver to me is a no brainer. That does not mean people won't state its track record as a negative, I realize this. However I rather be in something that has been stagnant for 20 years with all the right fundamentals than something that has been hot for only one month with no fundamentals.

Volcanoes and earthquakes happen, and the longer you go without one the higher the odds of it happening.

Short term outlook:

\- As mentioned the COMEX March contract situation is a developing story. Shorts closing out positions in fear of being asked to deliver will drive up prices. If this happens we can expect 30 dollars in short order.

\- Technical wise, this is bullish with any method you chose to use. It is far above its 200 day MA, unlike gold. It has been making higher lows since December and hasn't neared its Sept low yet. Alot of upwards pressure esp recently, mixed with the aforementioned price smashes.

The plays:

\-There are no physical silver available any where in the world to retail at spot price. That being said physical silver is something I would consider investing in as an adjunct to gold or bitcoin for store of value.

\-PSLV. Sprott physical silver trust. Really as far as ETF's go I'd say this is the safest. Recent changes to SLV prospectus makes one weary about actual physical availability. PSLV trades at a slight premium to spot, however if one was to accumulate 10K ounces worth (\~34K USD at current price) delivery is an option. 

\-Miners. More leverage, more volatility, potential jurisdiction risk. PAAS and AG are larger players. I am deep into many miners. Can discuss if you want. 

\-SLV calls. Again this is for position/swing trading. If you want to invest in SLV as a store of value, I personally wouldn't.

Not investment advice. Happy to discuss.

personalfinance,Should I refinance to a lower interest rate by a whole percent after 5 years of paying off my mortgage for a new 30 year term loan?,"Here are all the details. My wife and I purchased a home in the Fall of 2015 for $209,900 for a 30 year loan at 4.125%. We've made payments just fine, never late. Current payments are $1,033 each month. I put $200 extra in each month towards the principle. Remaining Principle is about $128,000

The bank is now offering us to refinance for a new rate at 3.125% for a new 30 year loan. The estimated payment by the bank (not including taxes and insurance) is about $553 per month, down from $750 a month. There are no fees with this refinance. The bank pays everything, even the appraisal fee. I've confirmed this with someone at the bank.

Since we've bought the house the value of the home is now about $330,000.

I've never refinanced before, I'm typically pretty good at understanding mathematical concepts but my brain is hitting a wall on this. Why would it be a good idea to refinance to a new 30 year loan if I've already paid off 5 years? I don't plan to move, I have a steady job with family in the area.

Another question I have is, what would happen to all the equity I have in the house if I were to refinance to a lower rate? It's not a cash out refinance, so I'm just left puzzled on this concept.

personalfinance,IRS tax witholding estimator assumes both parties are choosing married for w4?,"Forgive me Ive read every article watched many videos it makes no sense to me.

Im trying to understand why after a 30k raise the estimator wants me to withold an extra $317 per check or 8k a year. Combined with the new total fed rates that are taken out due to a higher salary  that nets me less than 50% of the raise. 

What does this estimator assume? When you are married filing jointly and you select the extra witholding from the chart, that figure is my wifes annual total tax liability which is currently withheld by her employer. Im really not sure how to gauge this?

My W4 is married, hers is single. I make much more so I am using option 2A and referencing the chart. the online tool doesnt tell me anything I can understand as I dont have a paycheck from this position yet. The form clearly states to go online or look at the chart and enter the amount where the incomes meet. divide by pay periods and put that in the line for extra witholding....so 8.2k divided by 26 = $317?

If this is true I am paying $100 more in fed due to more income plus $317 extra per payperiod x 26 = 11k. So 11k more in taxes on a 30k raise? this doesnt even move me into a new tax bracket. I know this not how fed taxes work but this just seems incredibly wrong. My current fed obligation is about $500 per check, I expected a $150 increase with the raise. 

We've never owed, always get a return but im just trying to ballpark the new monthly income. I dont have a check to reference just using a paycheck calculator. I thought the goal of the W4 is to get you as close to 0 as possible then you can withold extra. Im doing this terribly wrong and it all boils down to section 2. Can someone clarify what Im missing?",finance

This information below is important. I ask that you please take the time to read this entire post before making judgment or commenting. My discord group of over 100 people have grouped together the majority of the most asked questioned and misunderstandings regarding Dogecoin, into the following 20 key points. Even if you know the answers to some of these please read the entire post. Please read them below. 

1. Question: What is Dogecoin?

Answer: Dogecoin (/Ààdo äd ík…î…™n/ DOHJ-koyn, code: DOGE, symbol: √ê) is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system that is instant, fun, and free from traditional banking fees. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the popular ""Doge"" meme as its logo and namesake. It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community reaching a market capitalization of US $5,382,875,000 on January 28, 2021. [Wikipedia, 20210203]

2.  Question: Why Dogecoin?

Answer: For the Lolz. Well, not quite. Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!
		
1/2 - second perspective) Question: What Is Dogecoin? And why Dogecoin?

Answer: Back a few years ago, some crazy people banded together in support of a cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin, the people's crypto, finds itself with the support of hundreds if not thousands of individuals pushing for this currency to succeed. But why is that? Unless you have been absent from every social bubble, you may have heard of Bitcoin. For the purpose of this explanation, you will find that Bitcoin is not exactly an easy thing to equate to Dogecoin, but lets think about the criteria of a Cryptocurrency.Bitcoin did not find its foothold overnight. In fact, it took several years. A lot of people fought tooth and nail for their belief in the coin. Crypto, in a nutshell, is a decentralized form of currency that finds its value in a combination of individual asset involvement, ease or difficulty in security of an exchange, creating a method of reliable, secure, trustworthy exchange, and other reasons. 

Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me.Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, insteal of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down. In essence, in 50 years, Dogecoin will still be around, still be mined, still be traded. Bitcoin will cease to be created, hoarded, and become the digital currency of the affluent.

3. Question: Places to buy dogecoin places where you can spend Dogecoin? 

Answer: Refer to r/dogecoin posts by the moderators for a list of businesses that accept doge as payment. 

4. Question: Cryptocurrencies vs stocks. The main differences between them. 
		
Answer:  
A stock is a type of investment that represents an ownership share in a company. Investors buy stocks that they think will go up in value over time. ... A stock is an investment. When you purchase a company's stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, called a share. 

A cryptocurrency:  (crypto for short) is a digital a sset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.

When comparing crypto to stocks, the main thing to keep in mind is that cryptocurrencies have few if any regulations applied to them. It is still the ""wild west"" of trading. You can be scammed, skimmed, pumped-dumped, as so forth, much more often and more easily than with stocks. Terminology is similar to exact between the two, but both require a certain mindset. Crypto is almost always a long-haul game, where stocks can be short play or long haul. Cryptocurrency is literally money. Cryptocurrencies intended purpose is to use it to exchange goods and services. The way paper money is. 

5. Question: Is Dogecoin a product of the Wallstreet Bets movement? What differentiates dogecoin from GME/AMC?

Answer: no. The rest of this article explains why. 
6. Question: Difference between cold storage, internet wallets and Robinhood

Answer: 
Coldstorage - in the cryptocurrency world cold storage refers to physical objects/devices that contain your cryptocurrency. 

Wallets are an electronic program of service that stores your cryptocurrency. There a number of different wallets - but I personally use Dogecoin.info

Robhinhood- as of right now robinhood does not actually give you cryptocurrency when purchased through them. From Robhinhood‚Äôs cryptocurrency page: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt currently provide you with access to your wallet or your wallet address.
You own the cryptocurrency assets in your account, and you can buy or sell them at any time. We‚Äôre evaluating features to allow you to safely transfer coins to and from Robinhood, and we‚Äôll update you when these features are available.‚Äù Robhinhood will be addressed in another section. 


7. Question: Dogecoin vs Bitcoin - their competitive advantages and disadvantages. Answer: information explaining the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin vs Dogecoin will be explained throughout this article. 
8. Question: Is Dogecoin a meme or should it be taken seriously? 

Answer: We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of ‚Äúwidespread information‚Äù. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying ‚ÄúDogecoin is the people‚Äôs coin‚Äù comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn‚Äôt matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald‚Äôs makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald‚Äôs make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald‚Äôs have ‚Äúvalue‚Äù in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald‚Äôs do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

9. Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. It there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let‚Äôs compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let‚Äôs compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That‚Äôs without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn‚Äôt an actual number. You can‚Äôt mine ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù dogecoin because infinity isn‚Äôt a number. It‚Äôs a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn‚Äôt have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn‚Äôt matter. In fact it‚Äôs actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is 40,000 dollars and the price per Dogecoin is .07 with a realistic possibility of only reaching $288.60 at current market conditions. That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That‚Äôs why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different. More will be covered on this topic on another section of this article. 

10. Question: Does Dogecoin have value? How does Dogecoin increase in price or decrease in price? 

Answer: Yes. Dogecoin has value. It is currently valued at between .06 and .08 as of writing this. If didn‚Äôt have value then it wouldn‚Äôt be bought or sold at all. Anything can have value as long as enough people assign it value and agree to it. The value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market.  That‚Äôs why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin, so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn‚Äôt just one person. It‚Äôs the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers ‚Äúvalue‚Äù Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .49. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that‚Äôs only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of the currency in the long run is by eventually by exchanging your coins for goods, services, or just by tipping and trading with other Dogecoin holders. This gives Dogecoin utility. Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying Dogecoin at .05 and selling it .06. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. If legitimatize Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services. 


8. Question: Circulation of currencies. The importance of buying, selling, and holding - and the differences between them. 
		
Answer: To briefly explain this, a lot of people have been saying ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never selling!‚Äù - which in itself is great start. But there remains a lot of misinformation around the topic, for example that simply ""buying and holding Doge"" will drive up the price indefinitely. Unfortunately, that is just not true. Buying, holding, and selling are all intricately connected with each other. ALL of those three states are essential for a (digital) currency to flourish. Holding does neither hurt or raise the value of the asset, but rather it helps to establish a baseline, which is also called ""setting a floor"". Those who have diligently kept on holding their coins, have allowed Dogecoin to stabilize at roughly 0.07 USD cents for the past few days. Remember, this remains a huge gain from where Dogecoin has been just weeks ago. The reason the price is not changing much from this baseline right now is because few are buying and few are selling their Dogecoin, specifically due to topics which will be covered in other sections here. However, an active circulation of a currency is critical to establishing it as an effective means of exchanging goods and setting it up for long term growth. More on the value of Dogecoin in another section. 
	9. Question: Establishing a floor or a baseline.

Answer: The day to day trends of Dogecoin may appear strange at first sight, but those who continue holding onto their Doge are affecting or rather creating the floor. The floor is essentially the lowest value Dogecoin will drop to at current market conditions. The floor is currently 0.07 USD cents. Which is up from 0.008 USD cents just a few months ago.

10. Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. Inflation and deflation Infinite supply / no cap vs cap in regarding to cryptocurrency.

Answer: First of all - the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they‚Äôre just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: ‚ÄúThe interest was already built by people trying to trick others in buying an asset they themselves do not understand and your link is to a petition that tricks people into asserting social pressure towards changing the core parameters of an asset that have been there since its launch.
We believe that what you're really doing is trying to get rich at the cost of others and when that failed because you ran out of victims and money, you come here asking us to bail you out. However, we will not bail you out, as with great freedom comes great responsibility. We take ours seriously and we hope that you will too in the future.
We have now closed this topic. Request denied.‚Äù - Patrick lodder Dogecoin developer. 

Second response
‚ÄúA, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure.
Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins.
The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.‚Äù 

You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1674

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. 

Here‚Äôs some economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or ‚Äúworth‚Äù as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.
		
10a) What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin? 
		
		Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets - covered in other section. What gets misunderstood is which one is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or rather ""the lesser evil"".10b)	Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. If Bitcoin wants to become a real global currency with buying power, not just a speculation tool to exchange it for a few thousand debt based USD, when it hits a new record high every few months or years, its supply will have to grow inevitably. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. 
         Dogecoin is different. Dogecoin has a set amount of coins entering the market by the minute. There are plenty of spreadsheets out there showcasing exactly how much many Dogecoin will be in circulation at any given moment of time. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.

Currencies have inflation - commodities don‚Äôt. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold.

11. Question: Financial aspects of Dogecoin. Who will profit from it? What will happen if Dogecoin has exponential growth? A zero- sum game. Explaining that you only realize a loss or profit at then time of sell.

Answer: To clear things up - cryptocurrency is essentially what economist call a Zero Sum Game. A zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. What this means is that across a group of people who engage in selling and buying Dogecoin, if one person gains another person loses. For example if you bought at 0.08 and sold at 0.03 someone made a profit of 0.05 cents per Dogecoin while you lost 0.05 cents per Dogecoin. The important thing to understand is that in these situations the only way you truly lose or gain anything is when you sell. You don‚Äôt realize your gains or losses until you complete that transaction. What this means is that if Dogecoin does increase exponentially the people who have been holding since the price has been low will gain astronomical returns on their investment, while others who joined late will not.
12. Question: Stability vs Volatility
Answer: This describes basically how stable something is over a set period of time. Volatility is how much prices change over time. Stabilization of Dogecoin is important for the overall health, however, cryptocurrencies are known to and will likely remain very volatile for the foreseeable future.

13a) Question: Pump and dump vs long term growth and the difference between them.

Answer: ""Pump and dump"" is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Pump and dumps are illegal. While a subset of people are trying to pump and dump Dogecoin, the legitimate community is focused its long term growth and stability which is achieved through the rest of the topics addressed here

13b - second perspective)
Essentially many people are just coming onto DOGE because it has low barrier to entry, and enticed by the idea of coming in low, selling what they have and running with the profits short term. This has lead to pumps and dips, and a lot of misinformation being thrown around. I should clarify some points for those who are coming in, instead of repeating the HODL and diamond hands rhetoric.
Planned pumps are not what Doge needs.
Pumps of this nature usually have an attached implication, which is that people will plan on selling, capitalising on the hype and then buying low to wait for the next pump. This leads to money being taken out of the coin, resulting in the lower price we now see. This means that planned pumps are essentially feeding sellers. We are not doing this in secret. This is a public forum and people with the intention have the information needed to drain us dry if we let them.
Essentially, if we want Doge to grow, planned pumps need to stop being openly advertised, or they need to die altogether. Of the two, the latter is the easiest, and it is what this post will be focusing on.
Sustainable Growth is now the way.
Pumps are fine when they're unpredicted - Elon Musk is living proof of that. However, planned pumps will result in our good boy coin shooting down to the dips, where sellers can reinvest and wait to harvest our money again at the next pump.
If however, we grow the price slowly, the floor will increase in a much more stable fashion, resulting in smaller dips. This will mean that the insane dips where sellers truly farm their coin at become very inhospitable to them, as they'd need to put more and more money to receive less and less profit. Essentially, by slowly growing the coin with organic 'food' instead of steroids, we can slowly choke out those parasites who are ruining the growth of the coin by making every dip a horrible investment for their time and efforts.
Sure, buy at the dips. Sure, hold the coin. But don't plan any more pumps. The less room you give to the sellers, the doubters and the paper hands, the more coin you can collect and the more profit that awaits you in the future.
Conclusion
If we come together as a community, Doge will truly live up to the hype - the people's currency. If we choose to continue listening to planned pumps, we have a very difficult, long and risky road ahead of us. Sustainable growth will beat large planned spikes any day.
14. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: Elon Musk, Mark Cuban
As many may know, Elon is highly involved when it comes to ‚Äúmeme culture.‚Äù we can see Elon has tweeted several times concerning ‚Äúdoge,‚Äù reposting memes found from Reddit, as well as concerning himself with the ripples of the recent stock news. Mark Cuban, another notable wealthy, down-to-earth, community-involved individual, has recently mentioned ‚Äú#dogecoin‚Äù specifically. Regardless of whether these people have positive intentions towards $DOGE or not, their mention carries weight and public opinion and is a good assumption that new eyes are looking at us as a result. It should be noted that they have tweeted neutrally to positively towards $DOGE, not indicating a full-send support but they clearly are not talking down the possibilities.

Big business allowing Dogecoin to be supported as means of exchanging goods, and people like Elon musk supporting and backing this cryptocurrency are important to proving its value and legitimacy. 

However, it is important to remember that this is not the sole determining factor in the price. The price is determined by everything covered above. 

15. Question: Is getting Dogecoin to increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Can and will it really happen? What will change if it does happen? How high can Dogecoin realistically rise in price? Market cap explanation and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. 
	
Answer: Yes, despite not having a fixed or capped supply, the value of the currency can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.

Market cap = price x supply. Price is determined by supply and demand (buying snd selling of Dogecoin. Supply is determined by mining Dogecoin. 

The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is 9,000,000,000 (9 billion). if Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of 128 billion dollars. Since the current supply of Dogecoin Is 128 billion in circulation. Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency currently has a market cap of approximately 700,000,000,000 (700 billion dollars). This means that at $1 the total supply of Dogecoin would be ‚Äúworth‚Äù about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is 2,000,000,000 (2 trillion) since 1 dollar = 1 dollar (LOLZ) the market cap of the US currency is 2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach this market cap - the price can be calculated through dividing the market cap (2 trillion) by the supply (128 billion). This means that dogecoin would equal the entire US currency‚Äôs (M0 money supply in economics) at $15.60. This is definitely not impossible but highly highly improbable to ever reach this value any time soon. As in like 3-10 years away minimum. Now the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (paper) currency is 37 trillion dollars. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value would be $288.60 This is the theoretical limit to how much Dogecoin can be worth due simply to the fact that if it was valued at anymore than that amount it would be ‚Äúworth‚Äù more than the entire world‚Äôs paper currencies combined which is not possible without adding more supply. It‚Äôs important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change. 

		
16. Question: The situation with Robinhood - Changes in terms and conditions. *Disclaimer, it is important to read through Robhinhoods entire terms and conditions to fully under what happened. The information below is just a summary and is not Robhinhoods terms and conditions but an explanation of what happened and why it happened* 

Answer: Robhinhood has received high profile backlash in the media recently for their involvement with GME/Wallstreetbets. 
A lot of the cryptocurrency and Dogecoin community were outraged when they found out that about  Robhinhood stopped allowed instant transfers for their cryptocurrency. This issue has been resolved, but people are still skeptical of Robhinhood and are upset that Robhinhood does not allow full access to our cryptocurrency wallets. Whether we like it or not, Robhinhood is a power house in their industry and not going away. The smartest way to handle robhinhood is if you don‚Äôt choose to use them anymore SLOWLY pull out your funds and use another exchange, or if you do choose to use them then to repeatedly ask for access to our wallets until enough public pressure forces them to let people transfer to their personal wallets.

17. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?
Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly¬†bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let‚Äôs do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

18. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. 

The long answer is this: Given the recent surge in Altcoins, both from a financial perspective and media coverage, there is now a very good chance that new developers will come back to Dogecoin in time. There are plenty of people with coding experience, also those who have already worked on cryptocurrency concepts in general.

As of early 2021, there are around 4000 cryptocurrencies in existance, probably several thousand more hidden as drafts or stealth projects. These days, there are well-paid positions in the up-and-coming cryptocurrency space.  There is, as always, a shortage of developers.  Thus, how can Dogecoin compete with the wider market and successfully attract developers? Well, there are a number of different reasons Dogecoin will be able to attract good developers. 
Basically, why does anyone work on anything? Why did the original Dogecoin developers even create Dogecoin in the first place? For fun, because it was interesting, because Bitcoin got the ball rolling, to be part of something exciting. 

Remember - when Bitcoin was created were those developers simply looking for short-term financial gain? No, they were likely not. Bitcoin took a while to take off. And so did Dogecoin. Bitcoin has inherent limitations for day-to-day use, while Dogecoin has received too little attention over the past few years in terms of development. But, the idea that developers will not work on Dogecoin is just a big misconception. Dogecoin is becoming too popular for developers to stay away. 

Also, once Dogecoin legitimatizes itself more widely, working on the project as a developer will become inherently more valuable, both financially and non-financially, due to the fact that it will make its way back in the top tier cryptocurrencies. 

19. Question: if all of the above information is true why the r/cryptocurrency full of people who are trying to discredit Dogecoin as legitimate cryptocurrency.  

Answer: The r/cryptocurrency is horribly misinformed. R/cryptocurrency is a specific subset of society who has an extremely knowledgeable background in computer science and computer coding.  They may have a solid understanding of the technology aspect of cryptocurrency but the reason why Dogecoin will be successful is based on economics, mathematics, social theory and statistics as WELL as the underlying technology. Each of these topics is extremely intricate and each field requires years to fully master. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won‚Äôt be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It‚Äôs been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. r/cryptocurrency is full of gatekeepers who horde their knowledge while the Dogecoin community is focused on explaining and educating new people. R/cryptocurrency is notorious for being extremely serious and feel threatened that something that started at as a joke/meme has the potential to be at cryptocurrencies intended purpose - exchanging goods and services - than Bitcoin or any other popular cryptocurrency which is deflationary in nature.

20. Question: Will cryptocurrency replace fiat currency. Will cryptocurrency be the next world currency. Will the next world currency be Dogecoin?
Answer: 
People don‚Äôt realize the worldwide paradigm that is taking place right in front of our eyes. People are starting to see that traditional fiat (paper) currency back by centralized governments and debt are flawed and can be improved upon. Cryptocurrency is the future whether the people who can‚Äôt see it or try to disagree believe it or not. It‚Äôs inevitable. I knew it was inevitable in 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency will replace fiat currency in the future. Will it be Bitcoin? ETH? Dogecoin? Some other cryptocurrency that doesn‚Äôt exist yet? I don‚Äôt know. What I do know is that the only cryptocurrency that has inflationary tendencies that line up with traditional fiat currency very very well, allowing for an ease in the transition, a community dedicated to its success regardless of the cost, a mascot that allows for ease for spread of information to the masses thereby assisting with mass adoption is Dogecoin.

CryptoCurrency,What to expect during this bull run,"This is not a post explaining how this bull run will go, rather it is a call for the community to dicuss possible outcomes of what will happen in the coming year(s).

So, the general consensus seems to be that every crypto cycle consits of a long bear market where accumulation takes place, followed by a slow rise to previous all-time high, followed by a period of explosive gains and corrections and eventually a bubble peak. These bubbles have occurred in 2011, 2013 and 2017. This makes it reasonable to assume that this will also happen in this bull run. However, let's take a moment to think outside the box and think of what else could possibly happen. Thinking this way would imply that we assume this market cycle to be fundamentally different from the previous ones. So we ask the question: **is this cycle fundamentally different**?

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. Market Fundamentals

The current cryptocurrency market fundamentals are different from previous cycles. First of all, we have institutional whales and companies buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies every day. Think of Grayscale, Microstrategy and Tesla. Second, cryptocurrencies are starting to get more accessible for people. Right now, PayPal let's you buy Bitcoin and it seems that some banks are also wanting to offer Bitcoin to their customers in the coming year. This shows that a lot of money is entering the market. However, will institutional investors really hold long-term, or will they also panic sell once they think a peak is in? There is one thing that we can conclude for sure: **the general consensus is no longer that Bitcoin is worthless and will go to 0: Bitcoin is here to stay**. So let's compare to something that shows many similarities to Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. The Digital Gold

Bitcoin is seen by many investors as digital gold, a safe haven against inflation. This makes it plausible to compare the Bitcoin market with the Gold market. Let's look at the [Gold price chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart). Gold witnessed a bubble in 1980 after which it took 25 years to recover. It also had a significant correction in 2012 but right now it's sitting near its all-time high. We see that gold is not immune to bubbles. Despite its giant market cap and 'safe haven against inflation', it does not at all mean that it is stable all the time. Looking at it this way, **we can expect bubbles to keep happening in the future, despite widespread adoption of Bitcoin**. But this again is based on the assumption that economies around the world remain stable: this is something that is being questioned more and more every day.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Monetary Policies

Throughout history we've seen how reluctant governments are when it comes to printing money. [Estimates](https://news.bitcoin.com/9-trillion-in-stimulus-injections-the-feds-2020-pump-eclipses-two-centuries-of-usd-creation/) say that more than 20% of all US dollars have been printed in 2020 alone. It is unbelievable how this much money can be printed so easily to 'keep the economy stable'. And as you can probably expect, printing money is not going to solve any problems. In fact, the current crisis has caused poor people to become poorer and [rich people to become richer](https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T). Monetary policy is extremely difficult to do right. There is always a trade-off between 'let the markets play it out' and 'stable economic growth'. The former is also the cause of the inflation we're seeing every year and the near-zero or even negative (!) interest rates. They want people to keep spending money as soon as they get their paycheck so the economy keeps growing, but this cannot continue forever. In the extreme case, countries will witness hyperinflation, as currently seen in Venezuela. This makes you question the monetary system that is currently in place. If you don't trust the system, why would you even sell any Bitcoin at all? If you think of it this way, **selling Bitcoin is more speculative than buying Bitcoin**.

CryptoCurrency,Listening to online opinions - a cautionary tale,"People's opinions on the internet are just that - opinions.  When I first got into crypto a month or two ago I primarily bought things I had heard of, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

People scoffed at me - 'Litecoin is old technology, it's not going anywhere, you won't make anything on it'.  I decided to hodl my Litecoins, but I had their words in the back of my head... should I sell, should I convert, what should I get instead, etc.  Every day checking the charts thinking is this going nowhere, is my money just sitting idly by?

Since then, the price of Litecoin has gone up from around ¬£90 to ¬£166 (at the time of writing this).  It's not a moonshot by any means, but it **is** a nice gain for me.  And it's a gain I could have lost if I had listened to people on here and other places telling me their opinion.  I got into crypto because I basically get no interest on my meagre savings.  In one month my money (about 10% of my savings) has increased exponentially above what I would get with it in the bank.

Thankfully for me, it's a cautionary tale that turned out well.  I didn't listen or take on others opinions, but it is easily done.  Please don't listen to opinion.  You know how all those youtube channels make sure to say ""I am not giving financial advice"" - that's so they hold no responsibility when you lose your money because of something they said.

I've watched this god damn internet project grow from literally being mocked 24/7 including by holders and now it's being adopted as a treasury reserve asset by Publicly listed companies. It has already won. The risk is gone.

Buy bitcoin now and front-run every public and privately listed corporation, and every nation states that wants to stay relevant in the 21st century too.

The educational material is awesome nowadays. I have been studying bitcoin 5+ hours a day for the past 2.5 years and every week I learn something new about bitcoin and how money works and realise how ignorant I was before.

First buy Bitcoin. Second invest in yourself through education. Investing in educating yourself will quell any anxiety around holding such a large % of capital in Bitcoin.

HODL does not stand for ""hold on for dear life"". That's dumb.

HODL is from a drunk misspelling from a post on the bitcoin talk forum about the price crashing and a dude's girlfriend out at a lesbian bar.

Open to answering questions.

Peace.

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin isn't just Digital Gold. Why I won't sell my bitcoin, and why you shouldn't either","**Bitcoin is often compared to gold, due to its' property as a store of value and whilst this is an easy to understand comparison, I believe this undersells the real value of bitcoin**

&amp;nbsp;


Please be clear, this is not financial advice, this is my opinion and like anyone I can be wrong. Please know your own risks and personal circumstances and do not take advice from strangers on the internet. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Overview:** I will be going first through Gold as an asset and its' comparison to bitcoin, why it has been valued and a very brief section on layered monetary systems. This is very high level so please do bear that in mind. Please skip to the end for why you shouldn't sell your bitcoin.

&amp;nbsp;
____


&amp;nbsp;

**Bitcoin as digital gold?**

&amp;nbsp;

To understand the comparison, let's first look at what makes gold valuable:

&amp;nbsp;

Gold is a store of value for the following reasons:

- It is durable, it can't be destroyed


- it is fungible, pure gold holds the same value no matter what bullion you possess


- it is divisible (self explanatory)


- it's transferable, it is reasonably easy to transport


- Most importantly - it is scarce

&amp;nbsp;

Looking through this list it becomes easy to see where Bitcoin already outperforms gold:

&amp;nbsp;


- It holds all the same properties - durability, fungibility*, scarcity, transportability etc.

- But most importantly, Bitcoin's scarcity is not only high, but it is known and easily predictable. This is massive for people speculating into assets as a store of value. It is based on maths, no commodity could ever compete with this consistency and reliability of supply


- It is also not able to be faked, unlike gold, it can't be damaged in the same way gold can be, and it is even easier to transport, to prove ownership of and it is increasingly easy for anyone to obtain and truly global. 

&amp;nbsp;
___

&amp;nbsp;

**Gold's Cultural Relevance**


&amp;nbsp;

Gold has served as the backbone of the monetary system for almost two thousand years, ahead of any other commodity, largely for the reasons outlined above, but crucially it has done so because of one thing, belief. Gold is steeped in our history as a planet, stories of greed and plunder and wealth are based on it. It runs so deep through our consciousness that it has out competed all other commodities as a store of value.

&amp;nbsp;

At any level, something only has value because we decide it has value. 


Bitcoin is no different to this, when people tell you it is speculation and a bubble, so is any store of value commodity. It has value because we choose to assign value to it.

&amp;nbsp;

The intrinsic value of gold as an aesthetic good, is something brought up quite often, but this is also simply a cultural construct of our historical attachment to gold. Why do people like gold? Because of what it represents: wealth, power and lavishness. It has a deep feedback loop within our society that ensures this value. 

&amp;nbsp;

___


&amp;nbsp;

**Layered Monetary Systems**

&amp;nbsp;


Layered monetary systems are nothing new - Gold has served as this for centuries. It is the backbone to currencies and bank deposits - from Rome, to Amsterdam, to Florence and London - Gold has been the reserve currency of the world. Layer 2 monetary systems have been built on top of this - Gold coins to bank issued gold certificates. 


&amp;nbsp;

The layering of monetary systems are as follows: Gold and related gold banking products, Government Currencies, Deposits. 

&amp;nbsp;

As you can see, with the evolution of digital currency, a huge leap forward in society is possible. To move from centrally controlled stores of value, built on ideas of hierarchies of power, to a belief in a system which relies on person to person interaction and is governed by mathematics rather than the will of kings.


&amp;nbsp;

Digital currencies are coming. CBDCs will be the future, I hope for decentralisation, but what we will likely see is a competing landscape of centralised banking digital currencies and decentralised finance, a new world order may not be the outcome - but there is a paradigm shift.


&amp;nbsp;

___


&amp;nbsp;

**What does this mean for me?**

&amp;nbsp;

Now the question is, where does it end, who do you back? Well if you have been following so far, whilst there will be competition over the decentralised markets, regulation and centralised currencies - bans from governments - whatever you can imagine. There is one thing that is certain. The evolution of monetary policy and monetary systems is here.

If you can't pick the right horse to back, what do you do? You back the house. Gold was a huge leap forward in human history allowing us to move from bartering to paper transactions and a functioning monetary system. It is the backbone of this system and has underpinned the global currency for hundreds of years.


We haven't moved forward that far since then - even the shift to electronic from paper, is a relatively small leap. What bitcoin presents is the new paradigm of digital currency. It is the reserve currency for these new systems, and the belief in it is growing. 
Now the question is, where does it end, who do you back? Well if you have been following so far, whilst there will be competition over the decentralised markets, regulation and centralised currencies - bans from governments - whatever you can imagine. There is one thing that is certain. The evolution of monetary policy and monetary systems is here.

&amp;nbsp;

___


&amp;nbsp;

**Why I won't sell my bitcoin and you shouldn't either**

&amp;nbsp;


If you have read this far, hopefully you can understand the reasons behind why, as we continue to move toward digital monetary systems, bitcoin will continue to grow. Now let's look at why you, me and all of us shouldn't sell.


&amp;nbsp;


A casestudy in GME: To use the recent crude example of GME, why did it work (at least before the system was fucked)? Because people with money, wanted what you held. They held overly leveraged short positions and were forced to buy back the original shares in order to close their losses. That is all, it went up because of two reasons: 


1. people saw the opportunity and believed in what they were doing. 


2. The other side were forced to engage and they wanted what you held.


&amp;nbsp;

So we have a belief in cryptocurrency, and a huge market who believes incredibly strongly in the potential of it and decentralisation. This has been further fuelled by dissatisfaction with the current system. Secondly, we have people who want it - people see its value. Like him or loathe him, Elon Musk just bought $1.5 billion, Other huge investors are in, banks are adding crypto products and custody for their clients all the time. Family wealth funds are looking at it and whether its this year or 10 years, the market will follow. 


&amp;nbsp;


This may take time, it may not happen overnight, we may have another bear market. But I ask you this, if I offered you an asset that returned on average 300% every year over the last decade, would you sell it?


&amp;nbsp;

I strongly believe Bitcoin is hugely undervalued. It has a limited supply, and you hold some of it. Who wants it? Hedge funds, billionaires, institutions. If you hold it, keep it. Keep it until the amount changes your life for the better. Everytime you sell, or you panic - you are handing over your money back to the people bitcoin was seeking to escape from. Now, unfortunately, these people will get their hands on it - we may not recreate the world, but you may as well take them for all they are worth whilst you can. I attended an event for Quant and MIT yesterday, in attendance were 200 other people. These people were some of the leading execs of the world's central banks. They are looking at this. And you got in first. 


&amp;nbsp;


___


&amp;nbsp;


**TLDR:** Buy bitcoin, hold it, and don't sell it until it changes your life. Bitcoin, Gold, and any store of value is at least partially built on cultural phenomenon and a belief in its' value. So believe in it, the richest man on the planet does.


Invest, speculate and take profits on your other crypto - that's great. Please do, no profit is real until it is realised and this change is still years off. Please do not limit your life or run into debt over this. But I believe a portion of everyone's portfolio should be bitcoin and they should not sell it. 

&amp;nbsp;

*CAVEAT: The caveat is of course, to please take profits if you need to and it is a personal decision about your own goals. Crypto may be maturing into the adoption phase, it may not. Please do not buy bitcoin with money you may need in a year or two, be smart with your money still. Only hold what you can afford to lose, then all you have to do is wait.*


&amp;nbsp;


EDIT: Firstly, thanks for all the great comments, i agree with many of the counterpoints and i think there is very much an open debate to be had around this, hence why it is so speculative. This post is purely based on an opinion I hold regarding the risk of holding bitcoin as a portion of your portfolio - but it is still a large risk. It is built on a belief in its value and the fact there is demand for it, so please do act accordingly. I am posting this on a crypto subreddit and not handing it out as financial advice for a reason. I hope people can take the post as it is intended and I have certainly missed things or oversimplified in places due to necessity. To people who have commented I have tried to respond where I can as I believe it is important to have these conversations and share perspectives.



*Fungibility has been contested, fair enough. Apparently there is a premium for newly mined BTC, haven't had chance to look into it properly as of yet. But you can see the conversation in the comments below, happy to be corrected if this idea around BTC is out of date due to certain groups placing higher value on the newly mined BTC.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,I think AnchorUSD might be a scam. Evidence included.,"AnchorUSD is a new, relatively unknown robinhood-like app for buying crypto/stocks. I tried to withdraw nano from it today. Although it took the nano balance out from the app, I did not receive the funds in my nano wallet. [This screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/xXylZw1.png) shows the popup when I click on the ""Sent Nano"" transaction.

Now, I've been using this app for about 3 weeks. Not having made any cash or coin withdrawls since then, I did not think anything was suspicious. The app looked very professional, its reviews were good, and the relevant (albeit very small, especially at the time) discussion on reddit was mostly positive. However, I have found some major red flags and evidence that calls the app's legitimacy into question.

\- There is extremely little information about AnchorUSD as a company online. [crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anchorusd/people) lists 2 people as running the company, an oddly small amount. The site gives impressive career histories for both people, listing one as previously working for Stripe and Jane Street Capital, and the other as working for Facebook. You can [read their full descriptions](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anchorusd/people) for yourself. Now, I looked these people up, and I could find no LinkedIn--very unusual for individuals accomplished in the tech and finance field. In fact, the only trace I could find of them was this [barren twitter account](https://twitter.com/jimberkleydanz?lang=en) created in March 2019.

\- Impressively high interest rates: 8% for USD accounts and about 4-5% for crypto accounts. While not proof of fraudulence, definitely surprising. But wait, not just 8% interest, but [FDIC insured](https://twitter.com/AnchorUSD/status/1278464699286171648)? Well, I can't find any proof that they are actually FDIC insured other than that solitary tweet by AnchorUSD themselves

\- As mentioned above, what appears to be a tiny company allowing such quick verification and even allowing me to instantly purchase crypto without waiting for funds to settle. Quite impressive that we're essentially allowed to trade on margin

\- [r/AnchorUSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnchorUSD/). Take a look at this subreddit: created on July 12, 2020, only moderator is AnchorUSD. **Posting restricted**. Interesting how that avenue of discussion was conveniently stifled ahead of time.

\- I have found many post/comments on reddit and twitter complaining about being unable to withdraw funds/crypto, I will try to compile some below. Usually the response from redditors or their twitter account is something like ""we're a small company, so we just haven't caught up to support tickets yet."" I will say that while it appears a small amount of users have received their funds/crypto after badgering support or weeks of waiting, this isn't proof that AnchorUSD isn't running a scheme. I would at least be extremely wary of them. At the very least, delays in withdrawing coins/funds may be an issue

dogecoin,"Since Doge is currency, and not stock -","I think we should add more flare. A lil bit of ""wow"" factor. It would be neat if we started calling different amounts of Doge by different names, reminiscent of physical federal currencies. I believe this would make it feel and sound a lot more spendable, not only for hodlers; but moreso to spark interest in those that have yet to purchase. 

I have a few ideas so far, but I'd love to see your reactions and ideas!!!

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-19-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow futures bounce after biggest one-day February loss

&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses in the red-hot month of February. The Dow, which broke a three-day winning streak and fell from a record closing high, remained on track for a positive week, which would be its third straight. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are riding three-day losing streaks and are on pace for their first losing weeks in the past three.

&gt; * B/itcoin ‚Äî which topped $52,000 this week ‚Äî hit another all-time high early Friday near $53,000 per unit. After Tesla and other companies recently showed support for the world‚Äôs biggest c/ryptocurrency, major financial firms also appeared to be warming to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Thursday she believes b/itcoin is a ‚Äúhighly speculative asset.‚Äù

*****

&gt; # 2. Treasury Secretary Yellen pushes for major Covid stimulus

&gt; * As the House aims to pass its version of President Joe Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief blueprint by the end of next week, Yellen told CNBC that a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy back to full strength. ‚ÄúThe price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big,‚Äù she said.‚Äù We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run.‚Äù Democrats hope to get their bill through Congress before March 14, when key federal jobless benefit programs expire.

*****

&gt; # 3. Biden to pledge billions in global Covid vaccination aid

&gt; * Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will spend $4 billion on international Covid vaccination efforts. He will make the pledge during his first virtual meeting as president with G-7 leaders. Biden will also urge other nations to put more money toward the global fight against the pandemic.

&gt; * Later in the day, Biden travels to Michigan to visit Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, a trip that was supposed to happen Thursday but was postponed due winter weather. Biden made his first domestic trip as president Tuesday, traveling to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall on the coronavirus.

*****

&gt; # 4. Uber dealt a major blow as UK‚Äôs top court rules drivers are workers

&gt; * Shares of Uber dropped another 3% in the premarket after the Supreme Court in the U.K. ruled Friday that the company‚Äôs drivers there should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling out of Britain ends an almost five-year legal battle between Uber and a group of former drivers there. Uber insists its drivers are self-employed and that it acts as more of an ‚Äúagency‚Äù that connects them with passengers through an app. The company weathered a challenge in its home market of California in November, when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers‚Äô status as independent contractors, not employees.

*****

&gt; # 5. Citadel‚Äôs Ken Griffin defends controversial Wall Street practice

&gt; * During Thursday‚Äôs GameStop hearing, Citadel‚Äôs Ken Griffin defended a controversial method brokerages use to make money, and said his firm would adapt if new regulations prohibited the practice. Members of Congress spent much of their time prodding about ‚Äúpayment for order flow,‚Äù a practice in which a brokerage receives payment from a market maker like Citadel, known as a dealer, for directing the order to them. This model is how Robinhood and other brokers are able to offer commission-free trading. ‚ÄúI do believe that payment for order flow has been an important source of innovation in the industry,‚Äù Griffin added.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

personalfinance,Here's what to do about unexpected 1099B documents after you've already filed your taxes,"So this is the time of year when people report the following:

- they recently filed their federal income taxes electronically

- they just received a 1099B document from their bank / brokerage and didn't include that in their tax filing

- they want to know their responsibilities and options

So, in no particular order, things to know:

- You can't electronically revise your return, or otherwise request a do-over, except via the amendment process.

- You can and actually should file an amendment to your tax return if your tax liability increased as a result of this. But you may have to do that on paper, if your tax-filing software doesn't yet support doing that electronically, and you need to wait until the IRS processes your return. You'd also pay the money due at that time. https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc308

- If you don't amend your return, the IRS will eventually send you a letter noting that you forgot to declare this income, and so they are billing you for the money you owe them, plus interest and possibly minimal penalties. https://www.irs.gov/faqs/irs-procedures/collection-procedural-questions/collection-procedural-questions-3

For the vast majority of people in this situation, there is no need to panic. Suppose that you had $100 in interest, dividends or short-term capital gains that you forgot to include in your tax return as taxable income to you. You would owe your marginal tax rate on that, possibly $22 or so but it varies. The IRS would send you a note later in the year asking for that $22 + not much more in interest and penalties, and you would pay it at that time. You are not going to owe massive fines or go to jail.

Now, if your 1099B reports tens of thousand of short-term capital gains from daytrading or some such thing, then you could be looking at some significant additional liability, so then the interest and penalties would be more substantial.  (In particular, if you were still a dependent, then this can get unexpectedly expensive.)  

Note that there is no need to file an amendment if your liability didn't increase, e.g. if you got a 1099B showing a net loss. You might want to do so to get a refund, but you don't have to.

Additional note: we also get people asking whether they need to upgrade to a more expensive version of tax prep software in order to file a return with 1099B capital gains. While that's a personal decision about preference in tax software, in general, you don't want to pay for a $70 version of TurboTax to report $20 in capital gains. Use a different program.",finance
personalfinance,Condo-hotel for family member: fair interest rate?,"My sister would like to purchase a unit in a condo that is effectively a hotel (short-term rentals).   Interest rates are quite high for these kind of purchases (\~5.5%), she's asked me to help out.  This will be a unit that she uses about 10% of the time and it will be available for rent the rest of the time.

I realize that lending money to family is fraught with risk, but I'm okay with that.  I lent her money for her last house with no issues.  Assuming my mother doesn't go through her savings with medical expenses, my sister will receive a inheritance when my mom passes, my idea is to ""secure"" the loan against that. (Obviously, not guaranteed).

what's a reasonable interest rate for a family loan?  

To be clear, I know that this is not a good investment for me.  It's a gift (though not for tax purposes!), I recently sold a big chuck on stock and have the cash to help her out, and I'd like to.",finance
personalfinance,Downside to HELOC with mortgage refinance,"About 4 years ago I bought a house. Purchase price $95k, 15% down, 30-year fixed at \~3.8%, no PMI. Over the summer I replaced the garage with a $20k unsecured improvement loan at \~6.7% (higher than I expected it to be, fwiw). Obviously interest rates are super low right now, and my lending institution has a low-closing-cost product on most of their mortgages, so I was just approved for a refinance of the remaining balance of both loans, $90k, at \~3.2% in a 10-year fixed mortgage. Very cool, saving a bunch on interest.

&amp;#x200B;

The wrinkle: the appraisal for the house done as part of the refinance came in way higher than expected, at $145k. The lending institution pre-approved me for a HELOC as part of the refinance application, $26k at prime minus 0.26%, 10-year draw / 20-year repayment. That $26k is the difference between the balance of the new mortgage and 80% of the appraised value, so that checks out. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, is there any downside to opening the HELOC and then just never using it? I don't have plans for that kind of money right now, but this is a good-sized LOC at a good rate, and without needing a hard credit pull. If I decide to re-do the kitchen in a couple of years or something, I'd have financing already available, and as far as I can tell there's no downside to opening it and leaving it alone. Please talk me into it / out of it. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Is there a limit to how many properties you can own before your status changes? More details below,"I have been planning out how I want to invest in the future, and decided that when I have the funds I want to try to manage some rental properties. Ideally I want to acquire them one at a time, pay them off quickly with the rent + some of my income, and have each rental income have a sort of cascading effect on how quickly the next property is paid off, until I'm at a point where I can live off the rent, mortgage-free.

I like to think I'm careful enough not to over-leverage myself, but I'm not super knowledgeable on tax law when it comes to that. Is there a general limit (federally, I won't bore anyone with state laws) of properties you can own before you have to register as a business, or start filling out different tax forms? Google has been less than helpful, I figure some of you might know.",finance
personalfinance,"Mortgage Interest Rates/""Locking"" in+ Customer Service Question","I've reached out to 3x mortgage loan providers.  Let's call them A, B and C; where A was my small local bank, B was Amerisave (online), and C was a mortgage broker highly recommended by my realtor.

A &amp; B quoted me approximately 2.75% &amp; 2.85% respectively (last week), whereas C quoted me at 3.25 %yesterday.

C literally has probably the best customer service I imagine, and of course can't control the interest rates and explained why.  They seem most reputable, I am most confident they'll close in time.  They also have the utmost professionalism and taught me so much in a 30min Zoom call whereas the others have been very iffy on communication

However, B/Amerisave said although it was a floating rate they can lock me in at it?  Seems somewhat untrustworthy. They seem sketchy as a whole, as when you do thier application they charge you up front for the Appraisal, but say it's refundable ( if a appraisal is not done through them).  They also seem slow to reply, and seem to have alot of system/software issues.  Are they communicating honestly that they can hold the rate?

A also is providing poor customer service but is at least local....

I really want to go with C, but ~0.5% interest over the course of the loan is 25-35k I believe.  All of the loan origination fees are comparable &amp; reasonable across all 3.

In addition, C has ""talked me up"" to the sellers agent (no relation/conflict of interest); and we have a pending offer on a multiple offer property.  So the timing is very messy+ I'd love to do business with them, and would be willing to eat a little bit of a higher interest to do business with them, but that's a substantial difference!!!!

CryptoCurrency,"Questions around margin trading on binance, and some easy math for you","Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking into playing around with Margin Trading on Binance.

So I read a lot, but am not yet sure I got everything right. Bear with me, I have a few scenarios to submit to you, and questions...

Do I get this right?

&amp;#x200B;

**The setup**

Say I want to invest **10000 USD** in BTC; For my example, **BTC = 50000 USDT**

I want to use binance x10 Margin trade. I invest 10k, borrow 90k. I have 100k USDT. I **move those USDT into the Margin Wallet**.

From the margin wallet, I buy 2 BTC at 50k each....hopefully, it is correct till now, right? Now

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario A:**

BTC goes up to 60k

I resell all my BTC, make 100k (original investment) + 20k gain

I click ""repay"" in Margin, I payback 90k + interest rates; I have got 30k - interest rates

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario B:**

BTC goes down to 40k

Let's say I had a stop loss, I resell all my BTC, make 80k, hence loss of 20k.

But, I might need to repay the 90k I borrow right?

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario C:**

BTC goes down to 10k

Let's say I had a stop loss, I resell all my BTC, make 20k, hence loss of 80k.

But, I might need to repay the 90k I borrow right?

\---

&amp;#x200B;

I **want to make sure I got that right** and hence, have those questions about that; tell me:

1. First, in scenario B and C, I'm at a loss. Let's be brutal and say I don't have the money.

How is the recovering of my debt meant to go? It's not like legally Binance is entitled to seize my home or anything.

Let's say I really was so inclined, I could just ... run away? Let my account get closed.

My question is hence: what do I have to lose? Or, am I legally bound to repay each and every penny (while my debt is continuing to build up ! Ehm, it does continue to build up, then, right? Because of interests?)

Obviously I'm putting this is a naive way, it's because I want to play devils advocate and understand what the consequences are.

&amp;#x200B;

2) In all scenarios, I really don't get how much interest I have to pay. Let me see if I got this right:

Here is my source info from Binance (I'm VIP 0)

[https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360030157812-Daily-Interest-Rate-for-Binance-Margin-Trading](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360030157812-Daily-Interest-Rate-for-Binance-Margin-Trading)

[https://www.binance.com/en/margin-fee](https://www.binance.com/en/margin-fee)

&amp;#x200B;

I see, I have a daily interest is 0.028500% / 10.40%

The calculation formula I read on the page above is: I (interest) = P (borrowed money) \* R (daily interest 0.02%/24) \* T (in hours)

Hence I would guess for all scenarios, this is the interest rate:

\- say that my investment runs 3 months, so to make it simple 3 x 31 days = 93 days:

I (interest) = 90000 \* 0.028500 \* (24\*93) = 5¬†786¬†640 ?! Could that be? Feels like I'm very wrong.

\- say that the investment runs 1 day long:

I (interest) = 90000 \* 0.028500 \* 24 = 61560 ?!

Expensive stuff. I guess I went wrong with a 0 here probably.

# Complementary Cardano Subs

r/Cardano is our main subreddit, but we also have several complementary and community run subreddits in order to help maintain flow of information and adhere to the subreddit rules (outlined later in this guide):

r/Cardano_ELI5 The 'explain like I'm five' subreddit is for newbie questions (how to buy, how staking works, fees etc). Posts explain in detain and in laymans terms the various Cardano and blockchain related topics. Please make sure you read the guidelines on this sub, as it has a very particular format.

r/CardanoDevelopers Everything Cardano developer related. If you're planning on building in the ecosystem, you'll want to join this sub.

r/CardanoStakePools Here you can also learn all about running a pool and get more insight into the pools in the ecosystem. Stakepool advertisement is not allowed on the main sub, so if your an stake pool operator, you'll want to market your pool on the stake pools subreddit.

r/CardanoTrading \+ r/CardanoMarkets We **only** allow market discussion in our [daily thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/?f=flair_name%3A%22Daily%20Thread%22) on the main sub. If you're more interested in price discussion, the trading subreddits are a better alternative.

# Staking

Comment command: `?staking`

*You can find many comprehensive threads about staking on our 'explain it like I'm five sub'* [r/Cardano\_ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/)*.*

**Some posts regarding staking**

* [What does it mean to ""stake"" your ADA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/kwmli8/what_does_it_mean_to_stake_your_ada/)
* [How do I stake my ADA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/l01bfb/how_do_i_stake_my_ada/)

**There are no risks staking on Cardano!**

* Your ADA is never locked. You're free send your ADA at any time.
* Your ADA is never moved from your wallet. You will always be in control of your ADA (read the above like 'What does it mean to ""stake"" your ADA?' to learn more).
* Your rewards are distributed by the protocol, so there's no possibility they can be withheld by a stake pool.

**There is no minimum to stake (though there is a staking key deposit of 2 ADA) and any ADA added to your wallet is automatically staked, including rewards (rewards are compounded). You only need to withdraw rewards if you need to send the ADA out of your wallet.**

# Stake Pools

Comment command: `?pools`

**Guides to decide which stake pool to delegate to:**

* [How do I pick a staking pool to stake my ADA with?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/l004rh/how_do_i_pick_a_staking_pool_to_stake_my_ada_with/)
* [Selecting Pool for delegation](https://cardano-community.github.io/support-faq/#/select-pool-to-delegate)

**Stake pool comparison sites**

The community has built many invaluable tools for you to compare stake pool statistics:

* [AdaTools](https://adatools.io/)
* [Pool.pm](https://pool.pm/)
* [PoolStats](https://poolstats.org/)
* [PoolPeek](https://poolpeek.com/)

**When delegating try to:**

* Support pools that contribute to the community.
* Use wallets that allow you to select your own pool (like [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/)).
* Avoid staking with [large entities](https://adapools.org/groups) like Binance (It's bad for decentralisation and therefore the project).

**Make sure you visit** [r/CardanoStakePools](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoStakePools/)**!**

&amp;#x200B;

# Staking Fees

Comment command: `?fees`

**Staking Key Deposit**

When you make a delegation, it will cost you 2 ADA for a staking key deposit, plus the standard transaction fee (usually \~0.17 ADA). The key deposit is something you'll get back if you ever undelegate the wallet.

Stake Pool Fees

Pool fees are commonly misunderstood. Firstly let's clarify that pool fees are not a direct cost to you, the delegator! Fees are simply the pools share of rewards when they are distributed.

**Fixed fee**

This is a set amount of ADA the pool earns (min. 340 ADA). *e.g If the fixed fee = 340 ADA: If a a pool earns 20000 ADA, the pool gets 340 ADA, and it's delegators get 19,600 ADA.*

**Variable fee (aka pool margin)**

The variable fee is a percentage of rewards the pool earns. *e.g. If the variable fee = 1%: If a pool earns 20000 ADA, the pool gets 200 ADA, and it's delegators get 19,800 ADA.*

*Note treasury tax not included in examples for simplicity.*

**When making a delegation try to:**

* Support pools that contribute to the community.
* Use wallets that allow you to select your own pool (like [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/)).
* Avoid staking with [large entities](https://adapools.org/groups) like Binance (It's bad for decentralisation and therefore the project).

**Make sure you visit** [r/CardanoStakePools](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoStakePools/)**!**

&amp;#x200B;

# Rewards

Comment command: `?rewards`

There are 3 incentive mechanisms that allow the community to earn rewards in ADA:

**Staking Rewards**

Staking is incentivised as it's important for network function as intended. See:

* [What does it mean to ""stake"" your ADA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/kwmli8/what_does_it_mean_to_stake_your_ada/)
* [Rewards FAQ](https://cardano-community.github.io/support-faq/#/rewards)
* [Staking Calculator](https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator)
* [Where do staking rewards come from?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/l0190d/where_do_staking_rewards_come_from/)

Simply delegate your ADA in a Shelley wallet and you'll earn a passive income!

*Note that when you initially delegate, it'll take 15-20 days until you first receive rewards depending on your pool's performance, then every 5 days after (see rewards FAQ).*

Your rewards depend on the balance during the epoch snapshot (as detailed in the FAQ). That means:

* Rewards are compounded - rewards are added to your main balance and thus are captured in the next epoch snapshot which goes through the delegation cycle for increased rewards.
* Any additional ADA you add to the wallet increases your rewards (again once the balance has been captured in a snapshot and has gone through the delegation cycle).

**Community Advisor Rewards**

In [Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) you can earn rewards be writing thoughful reviews on proposal projects as a community advisor.

Sign up to the [ideascale platform](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) and make sure to read the [community advistor guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QkdaFK1tigrSI40iMeV3UP9GyTGsoqVmCUp7OJz0WFs/edit).

**Voting Rewards**

Voting is another important part of being a community member, as and ADA holder you hold voting power. Our treasury funds projects proposed on Project Catalyst, and with Voltaire we'll soon be voting on [Cardano's Improvement Proposals (CIPS)](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs). Voting is incentivised to encourage participation.

personalfinance,Personal loan to lower credit utilization in order to get a better personal loan?,"I have a well paying steady job now but built up a lot of credit card debt prior. I am looking to pay off my debt as fast as possible and also reduce the interest I am paying. I'd also like to consolidate my debt to make tracking payments easier since it is spread out. Currently my credit score isn't high enough for me to get a personal loan that covers all of my debt or an interest rate that is significantly lower (it is lower though).

Right now the main thing keeping my score in the fair range is my credit utilization. Does it make sense to take out a personal loan now that covers about half my credit card debt and apply to my cards with the highest interest and then maybe 3-6 months in the future get another personal at a better rate since my credit score should increase? From what I understand credit utilization isn't impacted by personal loans",finance

personalfinance,Is it ever worth it to over-contribute to an HSA?,"Hello all- I've used the search function for this subreddit but believe I have a slightly different HSA question.   I'm interested in if an accidental over-contribution to an HSA may ever be ""worth it.""  

Scenario:  

A one-time contribution to a Self-Only (2020 Limit: $3550 annual contribution) HSA of $2500 in March 2020, at more or less the bottom of the general dip across the stock market.  This contribution at the current time is up over 40%.  HSA is then funded through pre-tax dollars by employer for six months starting in April at $585/mo.  Total HSA contributions for the year are thus $2500 + 6($585) = $6010, an over-fund of $2460.  

Now, your general turbotax advice is to withdraw the overcontribution to avoid paying a 6% extra tax per year until the overcontribution goes away (either by applying to future years or what-not).  

Given that the one-time contribution has experienced so much growth, and later contribution themselves are doing quite well, is it ever worth it to keep the overcontribution in the fund and growing, or is it always better to remove excess contribution?  In this case, the employer contribution is by a federal agency with pre-tax dollars: is the overcontribution removal better applied to the one-time, after-tax dollars (which are up 40%), or the employer contribution (up \~20%, pre-tax dollars)?

Does the 6% extra tax penalty apply only to the overcontribution amount and not the growth in the invested funds?  

I'd like to have a healthy HSA as an investment vehicle and the idea of having several times the value of my deductible in there is more appealing than the alternate reality of a one-time contribution of $2500 in a standard stock outside of an HSA.  

I appreciate all the advice in this subreddit!  Thanks!",finance
Bitcoin,"Bail-Ins, Recessions and inflation. Fiat is dying time to jump ship!","Last year the EU quietly brought in Bail-ins, allowing banks to clear THEIR debt with YOUR hard earned and already taxed savings and cash. On top of that the euro is going to go through some unprecedented inflation over the next couple months making your savings and cash far less valuable and because of the design of our current monetary system, and it will never fully recover again. 

For example in the United States, they are currently spending more money they are receiving through taxpayers.

They do this by printing more money from the Federal Reserve, but this money has to be paid back with a small amount of interest, and also because of supply and demand the value of the dollar decreases.

This creates a vicious cycle where the value will always decrease and debt will always grow. Mean our current systems is flawed and is never going to be sustainable.

This is why we are starting to see the big boys move all their money, they know what‚Äôs coming and the pandemic is speeding it all up rapidly. 

You may be excited to see bitcoin hit 500,000 or 1,000,000 (and I have a slowly growing confidence it will) but if bitcoin became an international currency used by people daily, it‚Äôs price will become stable and also be worth a lot more than 1,000,000 per BTC.

If you think 50,000 is too late you are absolutely crazy. Bitcoin has the potential to completely change the world for a better place. A world without you being a crop in the banks money farm.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinancing Car Questions,"I am Just starting the refinance process, and I am trying to figure out how much I still owe my current loan so I can compare. I know the principal remaining, interest rate, and term remaining, but I cant seem to find a calculator to figure out the total cost.

Also when I get quotes, some places just list the installment price, interest rate, and term.  I want to figure out the total cost to me by the end of the loan, because that's the simplest way to figure out how much I can save.

personalfinance,"Newish travel RN making bank - how can I use it wisely? new car, invest, pay off house, do some needed updates to house, etc","I'm an ICU RN and have been doing local travel work (it's always been more profitable than being a staff RN at baseline, but the pandemic has made it absolutely irresistable) since last june. It's wild to think I used to be making $25/hr (yep that's all) to be saving fucking lives. Now I am biting the bullet and getting out there making the big bucks even though it's grueling work (you literally work 12 hr shifts every day with no days off). So in other words, I'll be making 10k/week (pretax) pretty soon. I've been making 3k/week working at local hospitals for a while which has been nice to build up savings and do some needed renovations (just got new windows for the house). My plan is to work for 6 straight weeks (gross about 60K) and then probably work at my local job for a few weeks then get back out on the road and hopefully make crazy money again. It's hard to say at this point how long the FEMA crisis rates will last but I'm hoping nursing wages will generally see a boost after this and stay up (although nobody expects 10k/week to last into next year or even to the end of the year but we will see).

Here's some options I have for where to spend it, I'm just having a hard time figuring out what makes the most sense:

* **We owe 211k on our house, 2.375% interest on a 15 year mortgage. Monthly payment is 1800. Throwing money at it aggressively would probably be a really nice way to knock it out.** I am not sure if I can realistically pay it off this way within the next two years because I do not think that the crazy crisis pay will last that long. And realistically, I cannot work 12 hour shifts every day for many months at a time with basically no breaks. I know I can make myself work for 4-6 weeks straight and then come home for a break (but still be working, though that's making like 2-3k/week pretax) then go back out again. We already do overpay on our mortgage a little bit to chip away at it
* **I really want a new car, which would cost about 50k.** Initially my goal was to buy a new Rav4 hybrid in cash. I do want the one with all the options. I've driven a beater for so god damn long, I want to be driving something that feels like a damn space shuttle in comparison. I could realistically drive my current vehicle for the rest of the year and into next, but we really do want a new long hauler, especially since traveling long distances is now part of my job. I can certify it sucks to drive my car for 12 straight hours, Ive done it many times though.
* **House could really use some renovating.** It's 1955 and we've managed to do a lot of work ourselves, I refinished the kitchen mostly by myself (exception was some of the tile work and the countertop install) and basically doubled its size, added some really nice features, and hopefully added a ton of value to my house. Home value in my area has skyrocketed. With no renovations being considered, my property value itself is about 285k. It continues to rise. Comp homes in my neighborhood are selling anywhere from 280-315k when they have some updates. We've already created an enormous luxury kitchen (for a house my size, 1900sqft) out of something very dated, and I did it for about 15k by doing almost all the work myself. However we are now needing more space, and don't want to move. Because of how quickly home values are shooting up, it would most likely be cheaper to just build on what we have now. We have a mostly unfinished attic space that could add a lot of sqft to our home. Depending on what route we go with that space (debating between new master suite and laundry, vs new bonus hobby room and laundry) that project could be 30-100k it looks like. I do not plan on doing the work myself this time.  So this is where I am not sure what is more cost effective - do I aggressively pay off my house only to need a home equity loan to pay for renovations? Or would it be wiser to put that money into the renovation and then see a big increase in home value in return (although we have no intention of selling any time soon. I'd like to be here at least another 10 years, which is why renovating makes more sense)
* **Husband has a newish car (bought just before covid started) and I think we owe about 25k on it that's at 4%**. Could put some money into that but not sure if it's worth doing that over me buying a more expensive car new.
* **I have 11k left on my federal student loans. There is no interest being accrued until at least Sept this year, so that's cool**. they are at 3% interest normally. I have just been making the regular min payments on it in the mean time. I would like to try and knock that out before interest kicks back in, if it does when it is supposed to in sept. But I also don't mind continuing to make min payments on it if it means I could instead, buy a car and renovate my attic.
* Husband makes about 116k/yr at baseline, pretax. Sometimes he gets enormous bonuses, sometimes he doesn't. Just depends on the year. His job is pretty stable. His income by itself is enough to pay for our basic expenses of car payments/insurance/mortgage/etc.
* When crisis rates disappear, my income will be about 80-90/yr estimated. I do maintain a local nursing job here but it's super flexible and allows me to be gone for long periods (on a travel job) then come back and work. I'm an ICU RN, my job is pretty hard to lose, especially because where I live (mid south) is under-staffed at baseline.
* We already have a healthy emergency fund
* We do not have kids nor will we be having any.
* We both max out our retirement funds, they are doing well, but I am also interested in looking at other investment options for shorter term returns to try and make multiple of the above options possible. If I'm making this kind of money now it seems like it could really make a difference to even just take one week of that and set it aside to put itself to work. But i have to admit I am a pretty risk adverse person and not very knowledgeable when it comes to stocks and shit. I had to spend over an hour on the phone with a guy from fidelity just to figure out how I wanted my rollover IRA to be set up. I don't know what to expect out of aggressive investments or when is the right time to pull out to be safe, you know? I don't see myself trying to predict which companies to invest with. I would likely try to just stick with my fidelity account and do something on there but I seriously know nothing about this stuff. Say I wanted to take 10k and put it aside for some shorter term investments to try and build up enough $$ to eventually reach my goal of getting all of the above done. Realistically, I suspect paying off my house will come last. But who knows. This pandemic has been so unpredictable, the crisis rates may very well last longer than I think they should. We will see.

personalfinance,Bank recommended I refinance my home back to a 30-year (to get a lower monthly payment) since I plan to sell and move in the next year or so?,"So the bank I have my home loan with recently called me. They said I should refinance since interest rates are lower. However I told them I was on the fence about doing so because we have been thinking about selling our house and moving to one with a bit more room (We got 2 kids and only 3 bedrooms, and 1 bathroom, we're cramped af).

My current loan:

* Balance left: $300,000
* Remaining Term: 25 years (Originally 30)
* Interest Rate: 3.625%
* payment (interest+principal+taxes): $2,020/mo


Anyways, when I told them this they said basically we have two options and we _should_ do one of them:

If we don't plan to sell, refinance to something like this which makes perfect sense to me:

* No upfront cost, but the remaining balance will absorb the cost, so balance left: $306,000
* Remaining Term: 20 years
* Interest Rate: 2.875%
* payments: $2,130/mo

BUT, we hopefully plan on selling in a year or at most two. We have a second child being born, and my wife is changing careers so things are a bit uncertain for her salary atm. However, we have full confidence her salary will go back to her average salary in a year or so as well. The bank told us the refinance they would recommend in our situation is this:

* No upfront cost, but the balance left will absorb the cost, so balance left: $300,600
* Remaining Term: 30 years
* Interest Rate: 3.3%
* payments: $1,750/mo

Then, when we sell and buy a new house, we obviously take out a better, lower, shorter loan closer to the first proposed one.

This is tempting, you know more money in our pocket now to give us more flexibility while looking for a new home? Even with the baby and my wife's job momentary uncertainty we can easily afford our current $2,020 payment, but having that extra money short term can't hurt? What do you guys think? Is this dumb?

hydro,Question about Red Robin (and other kind of dwarf tomatoes) life cycle,"Hi,

So a while ago I discovered the joy of hydroponic and wanted to try it myself on a very small scale before going crazy with it (and yes, it was a success, I'm about to build myself a bigger setup!).

I started with a single Red Robin tomato seed, moved it to a 1-gallon bucket once germinated, fed it the (from what I can tell) correct amount of nutrients using the GH tri-part flora serie and used a 20W full spectrum LED to give it some light.

Note: this is a Krakty style setup as I didn't want to invest in pumps etc at the time, and as you can imagine with a 1-gallon bucket (too small for sure) I have to top it quite often to half-height to avoid drowning it but it was fine because it was for science.

Some beauty shots:

I got my first harvest around November, a good amount of small &amp; juicy tomatoes. Then, it stopped producing but I kept feeding it out of curiosity. After a few weeks, it looked quite bad, most of the leaves fell off and branches went dry and I was ready to kill it off... But I decided to clean the bucket and cut all the dry branches, then fill the bucket again as I'd do when the water level gets too low. 2 weeks later it was full of new branches &amp; leaves, and now it's full of new flowers and tomatoes again.

Here's my question: is this expected? I thought I read that determinate tomato plants are meant to grow to a fixed size, produce once and then die, but this one somewhat ""died"", grew back to its original size and went on to start a new life cycle.

If that helps, my mixing ratio for the tri-part is pretty much 1:1:1 because I was lazy.

I'm about to build a bigger, better-thought DWC setup to grow more of these so I'm curious if this is normal or not...

personalfinance,Late 20's Planning Questions + Car (Minivan) Purchase Advice Needed,"Hello PF,

My wife and I are in our late twenties with a 1.5yr old. We are looking to have 1 more child in the next couple of years, not sure after that. We live in what I'd consider a MCOL suburban area that we like -- not a huge job market without a long commute but I currently have a job in town. Overall, I have a couple of specific questions (bottom of post) and am just looking for some advice on improvements/options as we head into our thirties.

While there are definitely people doing much better on PF, I think we are in a relatively good spot. Our position is somewhat because of good decisions and discipline on our part but also due to both financial and social assistance from family (minimal student loans, lived at home while working for a while, etc.) that we took advantage of and helped us build a solid foundation early on. Just mentioning that here as I know it is easy to compare with each other but to put it in context we realize that we have been very fortunate and although we aren't rich by any means we also have had it much easier than most in our generation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Income:**

Me: 86k

Wife: 35k (part-time, allows her to stay home with daughter)

**Debt:**

Mortgage - Owe 332k on a house estimated @ 445k (refi'd to 30 yr @ 2.375% late last year). All-in payment is $1920 with HOA. Built early-90s with mostly builder-grade materials. 

Student Loan - Owe 2k @ 4.2% (currently deferred until Sept 2021 I believe). 

**Assets:**

401k: 90k (roughly 33% Roth)

IRA: 30k (roughly 67% Roth)

HSA: 6k

Cash: 55k (mostly in HYSA) -- this is about 15-mo of expenses if both our incomes went to 0 and no unemployment. This is maybe OK for Covid-times but truthfully I think we only need about 36k in here for a more realistic 12mo buffer without my income but with some unemployment. 

Own a 2015 sedan (\~8k resale) and a 2001 sedan that is close to end-of-life (\~$500 resale).

**Other:**

Life Insurance: 500k (Amica) + 1X salary from work

Pension: If I am honest, I'm not 100% on how this works if I don't stay at my current company until retirement. I will be vested after 1 more yr. My assumption is that I get nothing if I don't retire there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Plan Going Forward**

Overall, I was able to contribute a good amount to retirement in my first 2 years of working but have since been just getting the company match as we saved for a house down payment. Once we got the house we've been saving about $1.5-2k/mo in cash as a hedge against major repairs needed but I don't think that needs to continue going forward, at least not at such a high rate.

Now that we are established in the house here is what I plan to contribute in 2021:

401k: To match (5% of my salary)

IRA: 12k/yr total split between our two accounts

HSA: 7k/yr but we do use it for all medical expenses

So, by my math if I assume we use \~3k/yr of our HSA on average that'd be about 16.5% of our combined salaries going into retirement accounts. I think with this plan we would still be able to save \~$500 for discretionary spending/saving and $600 for house maintenance/improvement each month. All other $'s would be accounted for (bills/groceries/etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Specific Questions:**

In looking at some other posts, I think the life insurance amount may be lower than typically advised here. I'm confident she could re-marry if she wanted to but still, worth considering. And then my wife does not have life insurance at all so that should be something I set up in the next few months (less confident I could re-marry, haha).  

Given our #'s above, any suggestions on life insurance amounts? Mine is a 30yr term I got when my daughter was born. I would need to pay for daycare or move closer to my parents if my wife passed, if I passed she could stay as her parents are close by already but would need to potentially get a full-time job. I could also see her moving in with them and renting/selling the house as needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts on a college fund? I believe I have read to focus on IRAs first but if we do have some extra $ after maxing those this may be a good next option. Alternatively we could stop using HSA for medical expenses and just pay cash for now when we can afford it.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, as I said my car is at about its end-of-life. It is at 200k miles and has some electrical issues that leave it unreliable -- I don't believe it is worth fixing to squeak out another couple of years. Plus neither of our cars are particularly comfortable when driving long-distance with our dog + baby and no chance with two babies + dog. 

With Covid we only need 1 car but with vaccinations I am assuming that I will be back in office full-time by summer. So, I am looking to buy us a car in the next few months.

We are thinking a Honda Odyssey would fit our current and future family well as it would make road trips comfortable with the dog and baby and would work for us even if we have 1-2 more kids.

Currently I am looking for ones around 2014-2016 with 50-80k miles and those tend to be around 15-18k on cargurus. My plan is to pay for this in cash as our savings are above what we need for an e-fund realistically. Couple of questions: a) Interest rates are low right now, looking around briefly I see 2.6% should be achievable. Would you put a bit down on the car and then finance the rest while putting the rest of the \~12k into our IRAs or something? b) Should we be considering new? Seems that \~37k is average for a 2021 Odyssey and we would finance this purchase. There are some good safety features but I don't think they justify 2X the price if the used car will make it to 250k miles hopefully. Does anybody have a different opinion or see something I am missing?

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies for long post but thank you for your help. On the whole we try to be fairly aggressive with our saving as I am pretty risk averse but we still make sure to splurge occasionally, take vacations (mostly through CC points), and invest in our health/wellbeing so that we are hopefully able to fully take advantage of retirement.  It is a constant balancing act that we have gotten wrong in either direction at times but we do our best.",finance

personalfinance,Should I transfer schools or accept the RA position?,"Current freshman at a prestigious (but expensive) university. Seeking advice about finances because my Dad refuses to influence my decision. 

**Some background**

* I recently applied to (and was accepted) to an RA position at my school. This would save roughly $13,000 in room and board. 
* My father's exact salary is unknown, but he made $700k before taxes in 2018
* He pays alimony of roughly $30k to my mother, who is unemployed
* He is currently paying for three children in college.

**Total expenses paid so far in 2020-21 for 3 freshmen in college: approx $147,000.**

* My current college costs $70,000. 
   * He paid $64,500 since I took out $5,500 in federal loans
* My brother's costs $55,000/yr. 
* He paid approx. $22k the first semester for my sister's schooling
   * She did not do well her first semester. She is taking a gap year and probably going to community college in the summer.

I am seriously considering transferring to a cheaper university. I feel like it is smarter since I wouldn't graduate with $20k in loans if I went somewhere cheaper. Also, the money situation has been stressing me out, because my Dad is at the height of his career and he withdrew money from his 401(k) for college.

personalfinance,Should I buy a newer car?,"My current car is a 2001 Lexus with close to 300k miles on the clock.

It's not pretty with clear coat flaking off, front bumper damage, minor issues with the interior.

My concern is right now it's mechanically sound but my transmission shows signs of rough shifting from 1st to 2nd. Given that it's the original transmission with close to 300k miles I'm worried it might break down at any moment. I tried changing the fluids and trans filter but that didn't fix the issue.

If I sell the Lexus I'm expecting to get 2-3k from a private party.

I don't drive that much maybe 50 miles a week. But I'm thinking I should sell it and buy something a bit newer and more reliable.

I'm looking for another used car around $7k mark that I'll be buying in cash.

My current income is $57k per year. I have retirement accounts with about $13k in them. I have around $17k in cash.

After I buy the car I would still have 3 months of emergency fund in cash.

The only other liability I have is federal student loan at $8k and 4% interest (currently not paying because of the pause in interest, also might be forgiven in the future but of course this is not a sure thing depending on Congress). I'm using the extra money each month to beef up my retirement contributions.

personalfinance,Private Student Loan Payoff Plan,"Hello All, Appreciate your time taking to critique my plan

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm trying to come up with a plan to pay off my private student loans, and leave my federal student loans relatively untouched. I want to see what others think of this plan:

&amp;#x200B;

Current Loan Details: $34,750 at 4.19% Interest, 14 years left at $275/month

Assets: 

* Cash $13,000
* Investments $13,200 ($6,000 in 401k, $6,200 in Traditional IRA, rest in Crypto / Normal Stocks)

Income Per Month: $4,280 (With $4,280 extra throughout the year)

Expenses per Month (avg): $3750 (this is planning to be brought down, but I've splurged the past couple of months) A minimum budget of $3300 though.

&amp;#x200B;

Steps I'm planning to take:

1) Refinance the loan in question to 10 years at 3.29%, $342/month (or 15 years / $251.97/month)

2) Make the minimum payment on my loans.

3) All spare cash will go into an investment account, as the market should return (mutual funds and a few well-researched stocks I believe in) better than paying off my student loans (both federal (4.25%, 25 years) and private).

4) Once my investment amount gets over my private loan balance with enough money to cover my gains, take the money out and pay the private loan off. 

5) Repeat for Federal Student Loans ($42k balance).

Optional: Find a side hustle for more money.

3. Deduct the HELOC interest against the dividend income.
4. Write out-of-the-money covered calls to juice returns by a few points. If stock rises and shares get called away, repurchase shares.
5. I live in Ontario (helpful for tax rates).
6. Assume lower income spouse earns 50k and contributes 7k to RRSP and higher income spouse earns 100k and contributes 18k to RRSP.

Key questions:
1. If house is in both partners names, will CRA attribute half the dividend income to my spouse? I'd invest the funds in the brokerage account of the lower income spouse.
2. Assuming one spouse can claim all the dividend income, will CRA allow that taxpayer to claim 100% of the HELOC interest expense?
3. Risks are: stock prices fall (possible), dividends get cut (extremely low-rise for these companies), interest rate rises (unlikely for at least a couple years). Am I missing any?

dogecoin,"I've seen a lot of dogecoiners post about AnchorUSD. Please beware, they are very sketchy and possibly a scam! Evidence included","I have been trying to post this on /r/cryptocurrency but I do not meet the 500 comment karma minimum.

AnchorUSD is a new, relatively unknown robinhood-like app for buying crypto/stocks. I tried to withdraw nano from it today. Although it took the nano balance out from the app, I did not receive the funds in my nano wallet. [This screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/xXylZw1.png) shows the popup when I click on the ""Sent Nano"" transaction.

Now, I've been using this app for about 3 weeks. Not having made any cash or coin withdrawls since then, I did not think anything was suspicious. The app looked very professional, its reviews were good, and the relevant (albeit very small, especially at the time) discussion on reddit was mostly positive. However, I have found some major red flags and evidence that calls the app's legitimacy into question.

\- There is extremely little information about AnchorUSD as a company online. [crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anchorusd/people) lists 2 people as running the company, an oddly small amount. The site gives impressive career histories for both people, listing one as previously working for Stripe and Jane Street Capital, and the other as working for Facebook. You can [read their full descriptions](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anchorusd/people) for yourself. Now, I looked these people up, and I could find no LinkedIn--very unusual for individuals accomplished in the tech and finance field. In fact, the only trace I could find of them was this [barren twitter account](https://twitter.com/jimberkleydanz?lang=en) created in March 2019.

\- Impressively high interest rates: 8% for USD accounts and about 4-5% for crypto accounts. While not proof of fraudulence, definitely surprising. But wait, not just 8% interest, but [FDIC insured](https://twitter.com/AnchorUSD/status/1278464699286171648)? Well, I can't find any proof that they are actually FDIC insured other than that solitary tweet by AnchorUSD themselves

\- As mentioned above, what appears to be a tiny company allowing such quick verification and even allowing me to instantly purchase crypto without waiting for funds to settle. Quite impressive that we're essentially allowed to trade on margin

\- [r/AnchorUSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnchorUSD/). Take a look at this subreddit: created on July 12, 2020, only moderator is AnchorUSD. **Posting restricted**. Interesting how that avenue of discussion was conveniently stifled ahead of time.

\- I have found many post/comments on reddit and twitter complaining about being unable to withdraw funds/crypto, I will try to compile some below. Usually the response from redditors or their twitter account is something like ""we're a small company, so we just haven't caught up to support tickets yet."" I will say that while it appears a small amount of users have received their funds/crypto after badgering support or weeks of waiting, this isn't proof that AnchorUSD isn't running a scheme. I would at least be extremely wary of them. At the very least, delays in withdrawing coins/funds may be an issue

They want me on the loan in the first place for tax refund and to avoid estate tax.

The whole process was a mess. It was with Chinese relators which I don't speak Chinese all that well. Showed me the house just once and assumed I would like it, (They have to put more money to remodel it)

They obviously want to rent it out, I don't know what they told the bank though. Probably not an investment property to get a better interest rate.

Still have a mortgage on their first house. (Which they also rented a piece out but, the city found out about the illegal dwelling unit and had to be shut down. So empty illegal unit, which my lazy dad hasn't addressed either.)

I honestly don't know what my parent's game plan is since they are into their 50s and have like a good 10-15 years left before retirement (none of that either). Really betting on this real estate scheme, to be honest.

Yea, I will take care of them. And legalizing the accessory dwelling unit for rental income will help.

They should just pay off their first mortgage.

They threw around ideas that 3 people can save up 100k no problem in 10 years time.

personalfinance,What to do with home sale gains?,"We are building a new house this year. We already have the 5% and secured the conventional loan on the new house. However, I was hoping that after selling the current house we would be at 20% of the price of the new home, but will be a few percent short unless the market for our house changes dramatically. 

I just need to do a sanity check on what I should do. Should I just hang onto the house proceeds, start the new loan at 5% and then just refinance in a few years after more saving and gains on the cash? Or roll those proceeds into the new mortgage and be around 17-18% down and then hope PMI falls off in a year or two? I was initially going for option 2, but with interest rates so low I don't know. It would help us from financing any purchases for the new house at a higher rate.",finance

I really don't know why I did it but I thought it was a good investment because here in my country keeping your money in the bank is useless (like 1% annual interest rate) and is not convenient to keep large amounts of cash due to the high crime rates. So I put up all my savings, even convinced my mom and family to buy and they did it!!. And to my surprise in less than 1 month it went from 37K to 56K USD.

The math adds up and every part of me wants to take this route but Im just exercising caution. Ive never owed the IRS before. Would this open me up to a greater possibility of an audit? My only deductions were from my 1098 and an additional for my property taxes (theyre high in my area) combined are around $600 less than the standard deduction.

personalfinance,Should I invest in retirement if my marginal taxes post retirement will be higher,"Hello redditors: I am a faculty in a R1 university in USA with marginal federal+state tax rate of 30%. Given the nature of my research (in AI and optimization), I expect to make more money post retirement than what I earn now due to multiple reasons. Thus, if I am alive, I will most likely be in a higher tax bracket.   


I can put money in three separate pre tax retirement accounts (ARP, 403b, 457b), which would amount to roughly $60k per annum pre tax money. I know the conventional wisdom is to max out the pre tax  accounts. I am wondering if I should max out pre tax investment or just invest after tax and pay 15% capital gains as and when I withdraw. The flexibility of taking out the money before 59.5 years old seems attractive.  

Alternatively, I can pay off my mortgage early and get a guaranteed after-tax return of 3% (current mortgage rate).  


Has anyone been in this boat before? What would be the right way to think about this issue?

geothermal,Geothermal nightmare: seeking advice. $2000 electricity bill last month.,"I bought a house in March 2019 outside Boston that was built in ‚Äò86 and rehabbed by an investor and flipped to me. This isn‚Äôt my first rodeo buying a house so I knew there would be issues since flippers take shortcuts. 

The house had a geothermal system installed in the nineties.  I thought ‚Äúgreat!‚Äù The flipper had also installed a brand new water furnace 5 ton. It‚Äôs got two stages. The house is 3400 sq ft and has cathedral ceilings everywhere. The living room for example has a 37ft ceiling. Yes I have fans installed. Note that I have latest ecobee thermostat and it was programmed by an installer that is recommended by water furnace and looks after the system now. The original installer had a falling out with the flipper and won‚Äôt come near the house. Of course learned this after the fact and of course this is what flippers do. The installer gave me the basic talk - set and forget.  I have the AUX setting down very low to like 10 degrees outside temp.

The first winter was brutal with electricity bills and it‚Äôs only gotten worse since this winter has been particularly cold.  The system runs constantly.  There‚Äôs only 1 zone.

My electricity bill was $2000 last month. 

I‚Äôve spoken to the company Thats been helping me with the system and they‚Äôve told me the water furnace unit is undersized at 5 tons. Great but gets worse. I put in an unground pool over the summer and it‚Äôs a damn horizontal field - not vertical. I‚Äôm fairly sure the field is undersized too.  Sometimes I need to switch to aux just to let the glycol recharge because it runs so often.

So here I am with a house with very high ceilings, in a cold climate with an undersized unit and a horizontal field that is likely too small.

So what should I do? At this point I‚Äôm so fed up that I‚Äôm getting quotes to toss out the whole thing and put in a traditional propane system. 

Replacing the waterfurnace 5 ton with the next size up will be expensive as will digging vertical loops. It‚Äôd basically be installing a new geo system. This feels like a terrible option.

What I have heard of is supplementing geo with propane during colder months. Anyone try this? Note that my summer electricity bills are better, like $500 but still feels high.

Any advice? Need to get out of this nightmare. Also note: I looked into solar and given the energy consumption and the cost of a solar array on the roof of save maybe $200/month in electricity. That doesn‚Äôt make a dent in the electricity bills.

Geo seems like a terrible idea in the northeast and unless you enjoy the science of the system they are nothing but trouble. Finding a good installer helps but there are few of them.

personalfinance,Looking to aggressively tackle my student loans this year. Would like some second opinions on how to do that.,"Just a bit of financial context: At the moment, I‚Äôm living at home with my folks and working remotely (indefinitely). I have no other expenses to pay for. I make 19 an hour at the moment and my take home pay is around 1170 a paycheck after taxes/401k/insurance. And I have 20k saved up in a checking account. I have federal and private loans, but my parents are taking care of my federal loans (31k among 8 different loans) for the time being so I‚Äôll focus on my private loan. I currently owe $55,250 at a fixed rate of 5.2% at $391.65/mo. I‚Äôve been prequalified to refinance with SoFi at a number of different rates; I‚Äôm thinking of going for the 15 year term (4.75% at $436.38/mo) or the 20 year term (4.8% at $365.75/mo), paying more than the minimum, but having the option to pay a lower monthly payment if life happens and I need the flexibility. 

As I‚Äôve been writing this post I‚Äôve been thinking about different ways I can make the most of my time at home and I‚Äôve come up with 3 options. For these options I‚Äôm going to use my current interest rate/payment and a principal balance of 55k to keep the math a little more simple. 

**Option 1**: I pay off a large amount now and spend the rest of the year building back up my savings while paying more than the minimum. Let‚Äôs say I pay off 15k now and keep a 5k emergency fund. So my loan immediately drops to 40k. Then from March to December I pay off 1k each month and save the rest. At the end of those 10 months my loan balance would be $31,570, paying $8,429 principal and $1,570 interest. And (in a perfect world), I would have saved at least $18,400 by December. I could then pay off $13,400 bringing my balance to $18,170, leaving me with 5k in savings. Now those numbers are assuming I don‚Äôt refinance, but if I do refinance with 40k instead of 55k, I‚Äôm sure I stand to get a better rate. 

**Option 2**: I hold on to my 20k and throw all the money that I‚Äôll make these next 10 months towards the loans. I could pay off $23,400, which would take me from 55k to around $33,572, paying $21,427 in principal and $1,198 in interest. A portion of my savings I suppose I could invest, but I honestly know nothing about investing at the moment. I am planning on learning a lot about that this year though. The other reason to have so much money saved is to help facilitate a move to a bigger city so I can get a better job and make more money. I recently made the career switch to IT, so another thing I‚Äôm going to be doing this year is earning more certifications so that I can move up the ladder (I‚Äôm in helpdesk at the moment). 

**Option 3**: I pay the minimum from March to December and save the rest of my money. By December I‚Äôd have roughly $39,480 saved up. For the loan, I would have brought the balance to $53,436, paying $1,563 in principal and $2,353 interest. I could then pay off $34,480 bringing my balance to $18,956, leaving me with 5k in savings. It doesn‚Äôt really make sense to do this option, but I already did the math so I‚Äôm keeping it lol. 

The original plan was to move out of my parents‚Äô house some time this year. I only recently considered staying till December, and as of right now, I would then want to move out at some point early in 2022. Some of you may be wondering why I don‚Äôt just plan to stay with my parents until my private loan is completely wiped. And while it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm now considering, it has really taken a toll on my mental health knowing that I‚Äôm going to be 30 next year still living with my parents. I also have a deep hatred for the city I live in. There‚Äôs nothing to do here and I‚Äôve been here most of my life. I struggle between wanting to escape this town and wanting to be free of my student loans. I just feel like my life can‚Äôt really start until I move to a bigger city, but I want to make sure I‚Äôm well equipped financially before I move. What do you guys think?",finance

personalfinance,Can we really afford our dream home?,"Hi Reddit,

Wanted to get a reality check on if we can purchase our dream home, or if there are other priorities we should focus on.

About us: I (30M) and fiance (29F) live in atlanta and started looking at homes and found new construction homes we really really like. This will be our first home. We got a quote for it being $557,202.

Here are our finances: (Me / Fiance)

Salary: ($160k yearly / $26 -per hour) which translates to about ($8600 / $2600 monthly after taxes and 401k)

Cash: (50K / 10K) - We plan to use about $40K from here for the downpayment, and can pull more from investment accounts (see below)

401K: (25K / 20K) - I have only been putting up to the employee match (5% and they match 80% of it), think she puts more like 10-15% in hers. So about $1500 per month is getting added here total (including the immediately vested contributions).

Roth IRA: (22K / 0) - Slowly putting whatever i can, but was focused on paying off cars and student loans.

Crypto Brokerage: ($150K / $0) - I can sell and pull cash from here at any time if needed (obviously saving for enough for taxes)

Regular Investment Accounts ($0 / $5K) - She can also pull from here for emergencies.

Debt: 

I only have student loan debt, we just payed off our cars last year

Student Loans: 21K left - I only started my career since age 25 after I got my degree (worked up to the current salary), and have been spending the past 5 years paying this down from the original $70K in student loans ive had, this is why i dont have as much in my retirement accounts and cash as I would have liked. Minimum due here is about $500 (pre-covid), I have not been paying this down lately due to saving more cash, 0% rates, and talks about student loan forgiveness

Monthly Obligations:

Food + Fun + Dogs + Insurance translates to about $1000 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

If we get the max loan amount before its considered a jumbo loan ($510,400) , then monthly expenses look to be about \~$2100 (loan depending on rate) + $350 (HOA which includes homeowners master policy insurance and water bill) + property taxes \~$760 (will apply for homestead exemption next year) + $150 (PMI) + $50 in HO6 for personal property/liability, we are looking at about $3400 per month in living in this home. So i will need about:

$46,800 for downpayment + estimated $16K in closing costs (they will give $6K if i mortgage through them at 2.85% interest rate)

Our apartment lease ended last month so I moved back in with my parents to save up as much as i can next couple months, they are estimating the house will be finished building end of April, or beginning of May, so we can save probably another $16K-20K in cash by then.

My main concerns are this will pretty much wipe our cash and have no cash for furniture, however I'm considering selling $50K worth of crypto for all of this (but would like to wait till July 20th for long term cap gains tax break). Also we have very good relationships with our parents and they could loan us cash if i were to ever lose my job or something, although i would feel like a loser asking, but they always want to help. My parents are wanting to buy a fridge and washer dryer as home gifts.

My job is in cloud software engineering so im not too concerned about not being able to find another job (I still get bombarded with recruiters a few times a week even in the middle of covid, some even offering higher salaries). I have short term and long term disability insurance.

We also wont be spending money on a wedding (probably just courthouse it and i hate the idea of religion). We've been together almost 8 years.

We also plan on having a kid in the next couple of years and grow a family in this home, she may stay at home for a while for this, but also have parents that would want to watch the kid / help lol.

Questions:

1.) Am I crazy in thinking we could afford this? Should I be putting more into our retirement accounts or anything else instead?

2.) Are there first time home buyer programs that would help out further than the 6K the builder is offering? Whats the best way to ""shop around"" and what to look for?

3.) Any other ""gotchas"" I should be on the lookout for?

4.) Bonus Question: After we get married, should we file jointly or separately (currently she gets stimulus checks and filing jointly i dont think we would). Anything other marriage things I should look out for?

personalfinance,What should I pay off first to increase credit score/help fix my debt situation.,"Not going to change anything but edited to add that I went about this too quick and I know the credit score shouldn‚Äôt be more focus - I was more just curious re: the credit score, but looking for ways to still pay this off in the smartest way possible. I‚Äôm in touch with my banks and stuff too, just looking for input from people who have dealt with similar etc. I never would have taken a high interest loan but it was that or no where to live. 

So I went through a couple years where I was just in a really bad situation and had no choice but to take out a high interest loan, and increase and max my credit cards. My credit score is disgustingly low and I‚Äôm drowning a bit. I have family offering to help me but I‚Äôm not sure what is the best choice. 

~High interest loan (39.9%ish) balance $13058
Pay $257 biweekly
~MasterCard 1 - limit $2000 (25.9%) basically maxed
~MasterCard 2 - limit $10300 (12.99%) basically maxed
~Student LOC - limit $5000 (4.45%) balance $2.5k, can not pull funds from it. 
~Truck loan - payments $357 biweekly and final payment will be July 2027. Interest 4.29%, daily rate $6.11. Buyout today would be $52k. 
~Credit building loan - total payments will equal $2978 over 3 years. $38 biweekly. 17.99% interest rate. 

What is hurting my score the most? I make every single payment on time and little bits of extra where I can. My score won‚Äôt budge and my credit card 2 just keep going back up because of the amount of interest each month (plan on putting tax return money on it to put a dent in so it won‚Äôt keep getting close the the limit with interest). Credit card 1 isn‚Äôt as big an issue and is maxed out because I bought winter tires with it with no interest financing and the tires cost almost as much as my limit (Canadian fire for the Canadians) so the interest is only other small purchases.

economy,Question: New to economy policies: Fed fund rate and its effect on the stock market,"Hi, I recently started to look at the different economic variables, what makes them fluctuate, their effects, etc. However, there's still many more knowledge I need to get to understand better the economy, etc. As I was reading article on the Fed fund rates, the 10 year treasury yield and more. I stumbled on this article: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-signals-the-top-of-a-bull-market-in-stocks-not-rising-interest-rates-11613490352](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-signals-the-top-of-a-bull-market-in-stocks-not-rising-interest-rates-11613490352)

Basically, it says that in the last 7 out of the 9 bull markets came to an end when the Fed lowered the fed fund rate. Therefore, I don't understand why the market would be down if the fed fund rate goes down. My logic was that if it goes down, then people would borrow more money, because the cost would be less. 

Also, in the article, it says: "" the most recent move in the Federal Funds rate was last March, when the Fed cut it by a full percentage point. "" After that, there was a decline in the market. Could it be that it's not because of the market but because of many other variables?

stocks,"This is why you pay attention to Red Days (because it's healthy to notice when market rotations occur) (Heat map of Friday, 02/19)","[Finviz heat map of market 02/19](https://imgur.com/VZAXcd7)

Stock indexes go red for a reason, and you should always be alert when it does. The market sell-off on Tuesday to Thursday was concentrated in recent high-growth stocks, across all market capitalizations. What I started to see on Thursday was a flight to value. What happened on Friday was a rotation of capital from pandemic stocks to small cap and mid cap stocks. 

On Friday, as the Finviz heat map shows, we saw a sell-off in 2020's growth stocks (i.e. mega cap tech, health care and consumer defensive stocks).

The other thing the Finviz heat map shows is another move of capital into small caps and mid caps as investors take profits from large and mega caps that were pumped up by the pandemic and build more distributed portfolios. I.e. people are building new portfolios for 2021's that move away from pandemic stocks.

This is important information to pay attention to. Which is why, in my opinion, you don't ignore Red days, or complain about people you think are naive or inexperienced investors when they sit up and start asking questions or selling stocks they think have topped out to buy new stocks that they think are better going forward. 

If you're not ready to take information that the Red days offer us, and update/rebalance your portfolio going forward based on that information, you're going to miss out on signals that the environment may be changing. And then you might get stuck in diminishing returns as the market moves in a different direction than the portfolio you're sitting in serves best. 

IMO, the action last week suggests people who are going to sit in a 2020-inspired pandemic portfolio for all of 2021 will probably see diminishing returns. 

The rotations into small and mid caps, and also from mega cap growth to value, have been taking place from time to time since the November election, and it seems to be an accelerating trend. Last week also saw a big drop in gold prices at the same time as a stiff uptick in consumer interest rates, which indicates a move away from pandemic safe havens, into higher interest and higher yield investments. The selling of gold into a consumer interest rate hike also suggests the move to value investing in the latter half of last week isn't just noise, because gold is also a hedge against inflation and has tended to go up during times of climbing interest rates. 

So everyone who is bashing Red day alarmists in threads where you talk about how you got big gains in 2020 for doing nothing but investing in Apple type stocks, buying in at the March bottom or riding SPY for 100% gains, if you're not updating your portfolio for 2021 right now, you're probably underperforming the market as these sector and market cap rotations occur. 

For me, last week was the week where I disengaged from a lot of EV sector investments, leaving only a few percent of my portfolio in them. And I was ready to catch the small and mid cap industrial bounce on Friday, which was a big green day for me even tho the indices were flat. 

Personally, I expect these trends to small cap, mid cap and value stocks to continue throughout the Spring and I expect the money for those gains will continue to come from the mega cap tech stocks and pandemic portfolio positions that people/institutional investors are are taking profits from. 

The Red days raise alarms that something is happening and that something is sometimes a change in direction. So I see the rotation out of mega cap and large cap pandemic plays and into small cap, mid cap and value + growth stocks is a trend that is firming up. 

That trend is probably going to become very significant by the end of the quarter, in March, when institutional and professional investors have to rebalance their portfolios across asset classes, take profits and cut bloated positions. The shift in interest rates and asset class rotations is a significant change in investing environment. If you're still sitting in passive index ETFs or pandemic stocks, you may want to start preparing for a rebalance, too. 

There will probably be more Red days like this one, particularly toward the end of March. So for many who are still sitting in pandemic portfolios, you might have a Red March if you don't start revisiting your holdings in February.",finance
personalfinance,Putting more down on a car vs. opportunity cost?,"If saving for a new vehicle, realistically in say 24mo from now. Would it make more sense to agressively save towards that vehicle and put down say 70% of the cost and give up the opportunity cost of investing that ""extra"" capital, then putting down maybe only 30% (per the ""30% rule"") on the vehicle?

Obviously interest rates are low now, but they may not be in 2yrs. And let's also assume the opportunity cost would be relatively small capital gains that would be ""invested"" in stocks...probably in the merely hundreds of dollars to maybe a couple thousand. Not necessarily a lot.

Bitcoin,Reason for Bitcoin recent rally,"This is a cut/paste from a comment I left on another thread that seemed to resonate with a lot of ppl. Please read through and share your thoughts. 


Short version: Bitcoin has been recognized by a few major multi billion dollar companies as a viable alternative to cash reserves in USD. This has driven institutional demand through the roof. 

Long version: Cash is being diluted by a few % per year. Since they have many billions in cash this small % comes in the form of millions and even tens of millions of dollars worth of dilution for them. 

This cash dilution has been going on for decades and typically in these cases large corps would look to treasury bonds. They essentially purchase these ‚Äúsame as cash‚Äù US Treasury bonds and keep those which increase a few % per year. And the growth on those bonds offsets the loss on their pure cash and all is well with the world. 

This year however there was a change. The interest rate in treasury bonds is near 0% so they don‚Äôt have anything to offset their cash dilution. Compounding on this the worlds central banks are ‚Äúprinting‚Äù more money. This is INCREASING the rate of dilution. Where before they were losing 1-2% now they fear they could be losing 7-10% due to this. 

The result is a strong demand for an alternative high liquidity (same as cash) asset. And Bitcoin is being seen as an option for some more progressive companies. 

This might seem like no big deal just a few companies buying some BTC. But these corps have GIANT cash reserves and huge pressure to plug the holes of dilution. They must act in the best interest of the shareholders and ignoring the problem could be seen as mismanagement. In the most bullish cases (microstrategy) they are putting 100% of their cash into Bitcoin ($BILLIONS). More conservative companies (square, Tesla) are putting 1-10%.

But there‚Äôs thousands upon thousands of corporations that still do not have a cash dilution mitigation strategy that includes Bitcoin. And they are starting to adopt. Black rock, the world largest hedge fund with $7TRILLION of assets under management has made public they have an interest.

Bank pre-approved conventional loan for 1.3M without selling current house, but must make around 700k down payment.   
Home needs a kitchen remodel and garage is currently an un-permitted ADU that we would convert back to a garage for car parking. Also has a lease for solar panels.

Strategy is to buy first, then sell current home (list for 700k, 380k loan principal) and use proceeds to pay down new mortgage.

The risks I see with this is

1. RSU share price drops dramatically, already in a dip (relatively volatile).
2. Current home does not sell for expected value.
3. Bay area market cools down drastically.

Typing this out, feels obvious and trolling due to all the large numbers, but I am really looking for feedback. Could also be moot if the seller doesn't accept my offer.  Overall I think I'm in good shape to do this, but after living a couple years not having to worry money at all, I'm questioning my judgment because it's such a high price and it would deplete most of my cash/RSU. Money would be a little tight before selling current place or the next RSU vest period.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation and Refinance; Which first and how?,"First off thanks to all who read and/or respond.  New to all this so any input is welcomed, seriously I'll take whatever you got for me :P

My mom has been in debt all her life.  She hates dealing with or even thinking about finances so it has been hard for me to have her open up about her situation let alone make good moves towards a better one.  I've finally broken her down and she's pretty much given me full access to help her make some tough choices on becoming debt free and looking towards that future.

This shits hard yo.  I don't know what the fuck I'm doing but I'm excited to be doing it.  I have a list of 1000 questions for loan officers/banks/creditors and kinda just wanted to come here and check myself going into that labyrinth on Monday.  

Essentially her deal is thus:

* Age 60+
* 44k gross annual income
* $5,900 total debt ($3,800 on active Credit Cards, $2,100 in collections)
* 4.375% interest rate on 30yr mortgage
* Fair-to-poor credit scores (600-630)
* Has 401k but with 2 loans
* 50-55k Home Equity (Redfin based)
* Paying ~$150/month in min payments on CCs

The general goals are (in no order yet):

* Pay off debt
* Improve credit
* Refinance mortgage (potentially Cash-out) at most advantageous rate possible
* Foster a Home Improvement/Maintenance/Emergency fund

The tough part for me is knowing where and how to start.  The poor credit score and existence of the debt seems to handicap everything.  I've identified the following options for research:

* Bankruptcy
* Debt Settlement
* Debt Management Plans
* Debt Consolidation Loan/Personal Loan
* Home Equity Loan
* 401k Withdrawal (if possible)

Of those, from my research, the latter 3 options appear to be applicable/best/most feasible.  But I don't really know how they effect the goal of refinancing her home and when.  We've spoken only to a single Loan Officer from her Mortgage company and he was...well lazy to be honest.  Didn't learn much other than what she CAN'T do (that isn't a straight refi @ ~ 3.75%) and no feedback on other options.

The most attractive solution seems to be 401k withdrawal to tackle all of the debt at once, build her credit up to a more attractive level then strike on a possible Cash-out Refinance (or just a straight refi at the more attractive rate and try to build the Emergency fund via another avenue).  However I want to exhaust ALL other options and quite frankly I don't even know that she'll be able to make the withdrawal (that's on the seemingly never-ending list of calls we need to make).  Bankruptcy is...a soft subject, she seems to be apposed on principal alone.  Even so I don't think her level of debt calls for that regardless.

**Just don't *really* know where to start and how to sequence actions?  The right questions I should be asking and to whom?**

So yea I suppose I'll cut it there for now.  I just started tackling this stuff like 3 days ago and shits complicated :P  All in all she's in a way better spot than I knew her to be in the past but she's just at a plateau of sorts.  Her being debt free, with a smaller monthly payment and an Emergency fund...it's so close I can taste it.

This will result in my pay going from $83,250 to $103,500 pre-tax. I run a pretty tight budget and we don't have much debt so I am looking for advice and wisdom from the collective on how to allocate this extra money.

Here are the details -

Currently I take home $2065.00 per paycheck, which is every two weeks. My husband's (41) pay is hourly so his income is variable, but it averages $1300 take-home during a normal pay period. There are some seasonal fluctuations which I try to plan for.

Savings:

1. My 401K: $70,000 - I got a late start at age 33; currently I put in 10% and company matches 50% of up to 6%. Also, my company offers a pension which vests at 10 years; I am halfway to the 10 years. It is not a government job.
2. Husband's IRA: around $16,000
3. Emergency Fund: $30,000
4. Vacation: $3250 (we budget about $6000 per year)
5. Hideaway: $2200 (this is for known upcoming expenses like car insurance, school books, vet bills...like finding out last weekend that my cat needs her teeth cleaned to the tune of $300)
6. Education savings: $25,385 - this is total so far for two kids who are in their junior and freshman years in high school. It is in a HYSA. I have run the calculations and believe that we can offer both kids up to $40K. They can use this for education expenses (tuition, room, board, books, fees) but not for daily living. Once the $40K runs out, it is their responsibility to find additional funds.
7. HSA: $4150 (I put $60 per paycheck; company contributes $1600 per year)
8. When there is extra after bills (below) I stash it in a separate account for my kid's high school senior year expenses - and they will be numerous - which starts this fall.
9. We don't invest other than the 401k, IRA, and HSA above. I have no idea where to get started on that.

Monthly Bills:

1. E-fund: $700
2. Vacation: $500
3. College: $850 ($450 for one kid, $400 for other kid; this formula may change in the future)
4. Savings for new car: $300
5. Water/Netflix/Vet plan/internet/phone/life insurance: $450
6. Grocery: $600-$700
7. Electric: $170
8. Cleaning lady: $200 (twice a month; it would be a dream to be every week)
9. Kid's violin lessons: $60-$75
10. Fun money me, including gas: $450-$500
11. Fun money husband, incl gas: $500
12. Credit card bill: $200 (the min is $35)
13. Car loan: $118
14. Inhaler for my asthmatic cat: $13
15. Hideaway budget: $950
16. Mortgage/taxes/home ins.: $480 (1100 sq ft house in low-income area of mcol city

* we owe a little over $40K on our 15-year mortgage; we are 2.5 years into that
* the house is priced at $90k on Zillow
* If you did the math, above, you will notice that we have enough savings to pay off our mortgage entirely and still have money, which was an enormous relief as COVID slammed into the world last year

Total: $5500-$6000 per month


Debt:

Mortgage (see above)

Car: $118 per month (we have 4 vehicles and own 3 outright...the balance on this one is around $3000). It is unlikely we will prioritize paying this off in 2021. We will probably do this in 2022.

Credit card: around $1000

* I don't know the interest rate.
* I have 5 credit cards and this is the only card on which I keep a balance. The others I pay in full.
* I use these cards to rack up credit card points for airfare and hotels.

No other debt.

Thoughts:

I have roughly estimated that I will get an extra $500 per paycheck....$1000 per month. I don't feel rich, but I don't feel we are hurting for money. In no particular order, my desires are to fund retirement, better fund an HSA, buy a new car in the next 5 years, help my husband get a college degree, move into a different home at some unknown date, and take a lot of vacations. I like travel.

Fellow redditors, what would you do with this extra money? People older and wiser than me have recommended that I invest it. I want to be practical, I want to have a bit of fun, and I want to know retirement is secure.

dogecoin,An economist's perspective on dogecoin,"As a disclaimer, I do not provide personal investment advice and I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor. Do your own research before investing your hard earn money.

&amp;#x200B;

I find this enthusiasm with cryptocurrencies to be interesting. What makes cryptocurrencies especially interesting is determining a specific currency's intrinsic (true) value. When determining this intrinsic value, there seems to be two ways that people view cryptocurrencies: as a financial asset and a currency. The factors that determine the intrinsic value of financial assets and currencies are fundamentally different, as they serve two different roles in markets. Financial assets add liquidity to capital markets and currency is, well, the liquidity. For example, the value of stocks is largely determined by the expected future earnings of the publicly traded company, while the value of currencies is determined by exchangeability, supply, and a general collective consensus of its value. The U.S. Dollar is backed by the federal government and therefore we have collectively decided that the value of the dollar is stable. Because the value of currency is agreed upon in a general consensus-- which influences exchangeability and supply-- there really are no conventional ""market fundamentals"" that determines the value of currencies, since the value of fiat currencies are generally manipulated through non-market means. Therefore, a large group of people ""believing"" the value of dogecoin into existence doesn't necessarily violate our understanding of markets. This isn't Gamestop; dogecoin serves a different roles in markets.  

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, dogecoin has more characteristics of a currency compared to that of, say, Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a financial asset being hoarded for gains in fiat, as the supply is fixed. Who, in there right mind, would ever trade in Bitcoin for a Tesla? Buyers are simply exchanging an asset appreciating in value for an asset depreciating in value. While I am sure that there plenty of Dogecoin HODLERS speculating that the market cap of dogecoin exceeds the increase in its supply in the short-run (myself included), the incentive to hoard dogecoin in the long-run is not nearly as enticing, due to its inflationary nature. In sum, the inflationary aspect of dogecoin should increase its velocity, an important aspect of currencies. Also, there are mechanisms within dogecoin that should stabilize its price in the long-run. That is, speculation on the future price of dogecoin will act as a means to stabilize its price through the mining process. If miners expect the price of dogecoin to decrease in the future, they will decide not to mine dogecoin in the present, which increase dogecoin's relative price, and vice versa. Not to say that the price of dogecoin will be stable compared to a centralized currency with a competent central planner, but dogecoin has the potential to be more stable than deflationary coins such as Bitcoin. Hence, dogecoin may be a better candidate to serve as a true currency, especially in places with unstable fiat currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I have one big concern with the future of dogecoin: why would companies accept a relatively risky asset with an inflationary nature? This is where the support of Elon Musk is important to the success of dogecoin. Without him setting the precedence of accepting dogecoin, I am unsure whether many large firms would even consider accepting dogecoin as payment.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Child Brokerage Account - Utma/Jtwros? Fafsa, taxes, etc....","tldr: Financially stable couple looking for advice on how to start kids investing/brokerage account and want to know if UTMA or JTWROS is the way to do it? Not worried about FAFSA, but am worried about taxes.

Let me start out with the fact that I searched and searched and searched for this on this sub as well as on other subs and I'm only posting to help those that may come after me in their research.

My wife and I are in our early 40's with 3 children under the age of 12. We just started discussing investments and money with our oldest and he is interested in the concept of savings (already has a savings account), compounded interest - savings account interest rate is HORRIBLE, and investing. For his next birthday he decided that instead of that new Xbox game or a new GPU, he wanted an investment account. Now he has NO dreams of day trading his lunch money away, but he does want to participate in the investment decisions and monitoring. I'm not sure I'd classify this as a buy and hold strategy, but I foresee the majority of the investments falling under the 'long-term' capital gains description.

As for my wife and I, we are doing just fine, have our 401k's maxed out, only debt is the house, 529 accounts are being funded, we have post-tax brokerage accounts and no matter what we do - when we fill out that FAFSA document in 6 years we are going to be on the hook for a 6-figure amount for the first child. That brings me to my question...what is the best way to set up an investment account for my children?

We found UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minor Act) accounts where we can set up on their behalf, buy and sell on their behalf, and as long as they don't incur more then $2,200 (I think) in taxable gains/year, then the money is tax free, however if you go over that amount the kids' gains are automatically tied to the parents tax brackets.

What I am wondering is if it makes more sense (and is legal) to just create a JTWROS (Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship) account with my child as the primary and me as the secondary. In that case, I believe the gains are taxes according to the split so it seems like my child would then need to complete a tax return (not a big deal), but then only on the percentage of the split of the JTWROS.

Am I looking into this too much or has anyone gone down this path before and can offer some advice? I brought it up to my financial advisor and he wasn't much help (shopping for a new financial advisor as well).

CryptoCurrency,Crypto lending and how to include it as part of a portfolio,"Hey all,

I am just getting started with understanding the larger cryptocurrency market as well as specific assets. After having downloaded my own wallet using the Coinbase Wallet, I noted the option to ""Earn interest on your crypto"". I clicked on it, and noted that DAI in particular had what I felt was an absolutely **bonkers** interest rate of anywhere between 6% - 40% APR!

Now, being the good little noob that I am, before hitting ""buy"" (or in this case ""lend""), I went right down the rabbit hole. A few key observations I was able to glean based on what I found is:

\- Different assets have different rates

\- Much of the collateral for these assets is backed by USDC

\- DAI is not one of these assets, rather the collateral is backed by MakerDAO's own funds

\- The lending market for various assets is more or less self-regulating.

I noted that in [April 2020 an article](https://smartcredit.io/why-is-dai-interest-rate-10-in-defi/) describes that DAI in particular went way out of whack, attributed mostly to the Pandemic. People needed money, and DAI is a stablecoin that **should** follow the US dollar. However, due to the sudden spike in demand, it was trading above a dollar for a sustained period of time. At the time, **83%, or $113,472,067** in loans of DAI were still outstanding. The rate at the time was roughly 10%. In addition, the article posits that the majority of borrowers were exchanges trading crypto on margin, rather than your average every-day investor. Strange, I feel.

Today, as noted above, the rate is anywhere between 6% to 40% according to Coinbase.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to those who are more knowledgeable in the room is, how would the savvy investor look at the Crypto lending market, and things like this, and make informed decisions about how (or whether) to include the lending of Crypto in their investment strategy? What factors do you look for? What are the risks involved (beyond just the risks of owning Crypto in general vs a boomer ETF, as well as the obvious risk that when you make a loan to someone, you may not get paid back)?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Mortgage was sold to Fannie Mae - PMI changed,"The mortgage for my duplex (I'm an owner/occupier) was sold to Fannie Mae from Wisconsin Mortgage Company (serviced by WHEDA).

Initially the mortgage balance had to reach 80% of the original value, but now they are saying it has to reach 70% of the original value. I have paperwork stating that the PMI release amount was $98,800 rather than the new $86,450. Their response was:

""As your loan was sold to Fannie Mae, WHEDA as the Servicer, is required to follow their rules regarding the cancellation of PMI along with the Federal PMI Cancellation Laws.""

personalfinance,Is it worth it to refinance?,"Hello Personal Finance

Looking for some input/advice to see if it is worth refinancing. Real quick, I am a Veteran who has over 10% Service Connected disability who most likely plans on doing a cash out VA Loan with at least $50K Cash Out to pay off some debt. I do want to note that I plan on leaving between 2-3 years so not sure if its worth to refinance and pay down debt slowly (I can do it within 1.5 years). 

My current loan is at 3.125% with payments at $2,760.65 (payment to go up due to escrow analysis, est. $2,840) with $482K remaining in my current loan. 

An option I was given to refinance was: a loan amount of $541,650K (w/$50K)@ 2.528% Interest Rate @30 years. Payment will come out to $2,796.02 and it is based off a 720 credit score. Closing costs will be $6K with the $5,205 in tax reserves. Apparently I can recoup costs in 3 years. 

*** I believe I have a credit score of 700 based off of credit Karma and I feel like my score will go up very soon due to paying of at least $7k in debt a few days ago. 

Do you think it is worth the hassle to refinance if I plan on selling in 2-3 years? Do you think I can get a better rate? 

Your advice is greatly appreciated? If more info is needed or you have questions please ask!",finance

Me: ""I think if I were you, now would be a good time to consider taking profits.""                 

Him: ""I appreciate the advice, but I just want to hang on to what I got for now. I don't think I'll get the chance to buy in the future for my initial buy in price. Besides, I was always ready to lose it all. If BTC went to $1 tomorrow, I'd probably hold, but it would take shutting down the internet or nuking a country to make that happen.""                

Me: ""Makes sense.""                  

Him: ""I only put in a few years of savings. [If crypto failed] I could work another five years and invest in something else.""                 

Me: ""My viewpoint is this either works for humanity is fucked.""                 

Him: ""That's right man. [this is what I read today](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/everyones-a-scammer/). If BTC is a scam everyone's a scammer, all finance is a scam.""

While writing this post I searched for more examples other than those that I am familiar with and found this article from [Bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com/) dated 2/21/2021. Serendipitous?

If you're not familiar with the fiat monetary policy of the U.S., the difference between money, currency, &amp; storage of wealth or don't know what's up with geopolitical turmoil (that's not on the local nightly news), 'BRICS' (payment system &amp; currency basket), the IMF &amp; World Bank shenanigans, the '10 Planks of the Communist Manifesto' and a plethora of other shitty decisions and policies that have put the average Joe of the world in a fucked up position...I humbly encourage you to do so.

Only then will you realize the power that crypto currency has moving forward into a world where we are not bound by debt based money, the global banking cabal, and an inflationary monetary system that results in decreased buying power of your hard earned money with every Dollar that rolls off the printing press; a Dollar that is backed by nothing but public/private ""confidence"" in the paper and the Federal Reserve, a private bank by the way (see, 'The Creature from Jekyll Island by G.

stocks,is scalping and day trading relevant anymore?,"&amp;#x200B;

hi i am a relatively new trader and have been watching a very interesting seminar from anton kreil  
it is from 2017 so some of the things he says here may be outdated, and thought you guys could help me understand whether or not they are still relevant. here is the issue:

from my notes of the seminar:

i) Monetary policy: the financial crisis itself has causes reactionary monetary programms from central banks (historically low rates and QE) that naturally suppress volatility thru relative yield, backstop insurance and inflation fears of not owning assets

technology: retail traders can no longer rely on day trading or scalping techniques in the hope of making quick cash on electronically driven exchanges. algorithms have taken over and will always beat the human over short term time horizons. ""race to zero""

participation: more participants = more liquidity = less volatility = less opportunity

is this still true in today's market? should i completely ignore learning about day trading or scalping?

**We expect a similar reading to the previous lecture: 0.25%**

**We do not expect this announcement to be relevant for the behavior of the NZD against other currencies during the week. More likely the technicals will be predominant. Only a very unexpected final data would affect the price action.**

*****
&gt; A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.
*****
&gt; While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound ‚Äì financials, airlines and industrials ‚Äì stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.
*****
&gt; Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.
*****
&gt; The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.
*****
&gt; He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,‚Äù said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.‚Äù
*****
&gt; But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.
*****
&gt; # Improving forecasts
&gt; Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.
*****
&gt; Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.
*****
&gt; The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.
*****
&gt; ‚Ä≥[Powell‚Äôs] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He‚Äôs going to be supportive of the administration‚Äôs effort to get a big package through,‚Äù said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody‚Äôs Analytics.
*****
&gt; # Key data during the week
&gt; Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy‚Äôs and TJX.
*****
&gt; Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday
*****
&gt; The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,‚Äù said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
&gt; He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that‚Äôs going to go away sooner than we think,‚Äù Keon said. ‚ÄúRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That‚Äôs also due to the fact we‚Äôre likely to get a big stimulus package.‚Äù
*****
&gt; He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We‚Äôre still bullish. We‚Äôre still overweight stocks,‚Äù Keon said.
*****
&gt; He said a flood of money could hit the economy.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,‚Äù Keon added. ‚ÄúHouseholds now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.‚Äù
*****
&gt; He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see an incredible boom.‚Äù

&gt; # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps

&gt; While the S&amp;P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**

&gt; Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.

While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).

&gt; # Industrial Metals Shining Bright

&gt; While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals‚Äîas proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index‚Äîare up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**

&gt; Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.

&gt; Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.

&gt; # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak

&gt; ‚ÄúBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.‚Äù Old Wall Street saying.

&gt; Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage ‚Äústairs up, elevator down‚Äù certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&amp;P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.

&gt; The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&amp;P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn‚Äôt looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?

&gt; **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it‚Äôs difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.

&gt; **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in ‚Äústay at home‚Äù themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,‚Äù noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.‚Äù If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year‚Äôs volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.

&gt; Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

&gt; # Stimulus Matters: Retail Sales Rebound Big in January

&gt; The US economy had a tumultuous year in 2020, to say the least, and after rebounding strongly in the third quarter, the holiday surge in COVID-19 cases increased the risk that the economy may stumble heading into the new year. The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.

&gt; Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December‚Äîordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales‚Äîconsumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau‚Äîthe most in seven months‚Äîand greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.

&gt; Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; ‚ÄúFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,‚Äù added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.‚Äù

&gt; Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January‚Äôs retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn‚Äôt receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.

&gt; Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4‚Äì4.5% to 5‚Äì5.5%. Yesterday‚Äôs retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target‚Äîand may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.

&gt; However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden‚Äôs fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.

&gt; # Tech Leading in New Highs

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&amp;P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&amp;P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**

&gt; On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.

&gt; # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead

&gt; One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**

&gt; We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&amp;P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.

&gt; # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?

&gt; Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.

&gt; This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.

&gt; We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.

defi,How are Liquidity Provider tokens valued and how is the dual asset ratio maintained with price fluctuations?,"Hi there,

I have just dipped my toes into liquidity mining on PancakeSwap and am confused about LP tokens. When you provide liquidity, you are providing two assets rather than one and receive LP tokens. But, what if those on of those tokens were to change in price against the other asset, wouldn't the 1:1 ratio be ruined and how is this reflected in LP token value?

Also, what do you guys think on stablecoin liquidity mining? The interest rates seem like a no-brainer, am I missing something?

investing,Altria/Cronos Group - The Forgotten Deal ($MO/$CRON),"**The (Forgotten) Deal**

In December 2018, Cronos Group Inc. [Announced C$2.4 Billion Strategic Investment](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cronos-group-inc-announces-c2-4-billion-strategic-investment-from-altria-group-inc-300761820.html) from Altria Group, Inc.

Altria Group bought a 45 percent stake in leading cannabinoid company Cronos Group for about $1.8 billion.

Altria **also** has a warrant that would allow it to increase its stake in Cronos to about 55 percent at a price of $19 per share. It allows Cronos the flexibility to take investments from other companies such as, for example, a big food company. 

&gt;""The proceeds from Altria's investment will enable us to more quickly expand our global infrastructure and distribution footprint, while also increasing investments in R&amp;D and brands that resonate with our consumer,"" Cronos CEO Mike Gorenstein said.

Its established U.S. presence should, therefore, serve to benefit Cronos, when cannabis is legalized federally. I suspect majority ownership will come into effect within the next 6-8 months. 

&gt;""most important aspect of growth is going to be innovation and R&amp;D; The proceeds from Altria's investment will enable us to more quickly expand our global infrastructure and distribution footprint, while also increasing investments in R&amp;D and brands that resonate with our consumers. Importantly, Altria shares our vision of driving long-term value through innovation **(technology)**, and we look forward to continuing to differentiate in this area. As one of the largest holding companies in the adult consumer products sector, Altria has decades of experience in regulatory, government affairs, compliance, product development and brand management that we expect to leverage, particularly as new markets for cannabis open around the world.""

This strategic partnership provides Cronos Group with additional financial resources, product development and commercialization capabilities, and deep regulatory expertise to better position the Company to compete, scale and lead the rapidly growing global cannabis industry.

personalfinance,Consolidating Retirement Accounts,"I am in my mid-30s and I have several different traditional 401k accounts due to my various previous jobs.

Currently, my balances are Fidelity (\~$50k), \~15k with TIAA, &lt;2k in Thrift Savings Plan (due to a very brief stint as a part-time federal employee- I am thinking I might want to leave that in there for now because it is not clear if I will become a federal employee again in the future or not).

I hope I can provide you more interesting approaches to the forex market.

Lets start with the result of the trade last week:

&amp;#x200B;

[I wanted to see the price to retrace first so I can then be full engaged. Sadly it didn't so I was in with a starting position. Its funny to see how it went back touched my entry and went into profit again hahaha Anyways, good trade with small profit.](https://preview.redd.it/xdiuvcxpfui61.png?width=2696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3566a32f8a3d75623ef3b5e04d241447563e9a12)

&amp;#x200B;

Today we gonna discuss a potential EUR/USD trade for the next week.

Lets start with the reasons we want to go long the euro.

We got a strong up move in the 10y Bond Yields for Euro Area countries. This indicates future inflation which emerges mostly because of expected economic growth.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f36cx5p2aui61.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e62c94fd14194aa1d40e0695198078b0c55d294

[This makes sense since we got relatively very good Flash PMI data in the euro area.](https://preview.redd.it/rbaswr5aaui61.png?width=2154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c33020cf3a53edb984a8de362aa0d48e2dd0fcab)

What is also interesting, the prices of insurances of a credit default of euro area countries fell very strong. Think of it as a residential building insurance against fire which is falling in price in a city were it always rains recently.

&amp;#x200B;

[It gives us a good indicates what market participants think of the economic conditions in the euro area.](https://preview.redd.it/oee2fnv2bui61.png?width=926&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=162f86613ca9cc3f711f50c85104fbde5e70455a)

Now lets go over to the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sli35zvgbui61.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbcd84a3d7ce8904ce783143ac321a2575d22d57

The US is one of a few countries which sees good numbers in PMI's Inflation etc. Usually we would like to go the US long for that, but why do we buy inflationary currencies at all? If it means that a currency loses its purchasing power because of inflation, surely we should sell it?

Rising inflation is good for a currency when the country‚Äôs central bank is credible and willing to raise rates in response to inflation. This applies to most G10 countries, most of the time. The same can be said of falling inflation‚Äîit is generally bad for currencies in developed nations because it allows the country‚Äôs central bank to cut rates. Lower interest rates usually mean a lower currency.

Rising inflation can be bad for a country if the market perceives that the central bank is behind the curve and will not respond fast enough with interest rate hikes. This is because lower real rates (real rate = nominal interest rate minus inflation) mean a loss of purchasing power and potential loss of value for the country‚Äôs currency. At the same time, falling inflation or deflation can be good for a currency if the central bank of that country is perceived to be impotent or unwilling to act. This was the case in Japan until the deflation/strong currency link was broken by Abenomics in 2012.

It became a rental and we rented it out in 2015 and bought a home   also in 2015 that we now love that is in the suburbs.  Fast forward 5 years I‚Äôm at a point now where I was told I can sell my rental property and use that profit to pay off and  have only 100k left in my current home.  I want to be mortgage free someday cause we‚Äôre a single income 
in my family. I didn‚Äôt know all this and I just very recently refinanced to another 30 year to a way lower interest rate on my current home at 390k.  My leading question because I honestly do not know anything about loans is that I have an idea in my mind that when you pay off a big portion of your loan that you just refinanced is that you won‚Äôt have to pay off much or any interest because interest is collected in the earlier parts of the life of the loan? is this true and would I benefit? Because I am also thinking to keep holding on the the rental until the value goes up a lot more.  

Does anyone have any other suggestions for me? I‚Äôve also thought about selling both homes to be mortgage free and just buy a home with that money.

I graduated with a BA in Economics in May 2020 and after months of searching, I finally secured a full-time job in San Francisco. Our office is fully remote for the time being, and I know I will have at least 3 months' notice before I have to move out there. I am currently located on the East Coast.

Throughout high school and college, I was pretty terrible with money. Although I worked every summer and earned about $10,000 a year, I did not save at all and racked up $5,500 in credit card debt. I finally paid it off in December of 2020, and definitely learned my lesson. I currently have a 760 credit score and have been using a Chase Sapphire Preferred responsibly for a few months now.

I have also started using YNAB religiously to get a grip on my finances and spending.

# Assets and Income:

\- I currently have $2,000 in a HYSA and about $2,500 in a checking account.

\- I am selling a car worth about $2,000 and will be using a 2002 Corolla that is fully paid for until I move. I will not have a car in San Francisco.

\- Next week, I am getting a tax return of $1,156, which I plan to save.

\- If the $1,400 stimulus check passes in anything resembling its current form, I will get all of it- my taxable income was less than $20,000 in 2020.

\- I get paid bi-weekly, $2,030 after taxes. I also get a 50 dollar stipend for cell phone payments, bringing my monthly after-tax income to approximately $4,100.

\- I will also receive semi-annual bonuses in July and March, approximately $5,000 each pre-tax for a total of $10,000 annually. I started my job just as review periods were ending, so while I do expect to get a small ($1,000-$1,500) bonus early next month, I have not factored it into my budget.

***This means that by mid-march, my liquid assets will total approximately $11,000 with a monthly post-tax income of $4,100.***

\- I currently have approximately $43,000 in student loan debt. $28,000 of that is Federal Loans at an average interest rate of about 4.6%. Assuming payments resume in September, on a standard 10-year repayment plan I'll be paying exactly $300 a month. My private loan totals 14,500 at 4.95% fixed. The monthly payment for this is $141 on a 10-year repayment plan, bringing my total minimum payments for student loans (when federal payments resume) to $445. I am currently paying $500 a month towards my private loan while the federal loans are in forbearance in order to get used to this payment. 

\- Car insurance totals about $60 per month.

\- I do not pay rent or utilities and make minimal contributions to grocery bills. 

\- I don't currently pay for my cell phone, but I will start contributing to my family plan and pay $25 per month. 

\- I pay about $30/mo in various subscriptions. 

\- I am very fortunate to pay absolutely nothing for Health, Dental, Vision, and Life insurance. I only have a copay for certain prescriptions, the rest is covered by my employer, and I am in excellent health so I currently do not have any chronic illness to worry about.

***This brings my current expenses to $600 per month.***

# Anticipated Expenses:

\- My target date to move is September 2021. I anticipate paying approximately $1,800/mo in rent.

\- I hope to keep grocery expenses under $450 per month. 

\- I think I'll end up paying approximately $120 in utilities, so I am thinking about paying $200 just to be safe. 

***This brings my total anticipated fixed expenses to about $2,500 per month, leaving me about $1,600/mo in ""disposable"" income.***

# Goals and my Strategy for reaching them:

\- I want to build a $10,000 emergency fund stored in an HYSA by March of next year. This requires me to contribute $715 per month, but while I am living at home I am dumping as much as I can into this so my monthly contributions will be significantly lower once I move out.

\- Given my target move date, I want $6,000 saved by August to pay for the first month's rent, last month's rent, and a security deposit. I am currently saving $800/mo to reach this goal. Given my credit, I hope I won't have to pay this much upfront and will be able to just move a portion of this into my emergency fund.  

\- I know this sounds like a lot, but I want to furnish my apartment nicely and will basically be buying everything in California. To pay for this, I want to have $5,500 by September. I am currently saving $800 a month.

\- I am not eligible to contribute to a 401(k) until July, but I get a match from my employer up to 5% of my income. As soon as I am eligible, I plan to take full advantage of this and contribute 10% of my income, bringing my bi-weekly paychecks down to about $1,850.

***This means for the next 6-7 months or so, my savings goals total plus my fixed expenses total around $3,000 per month, leaving me $1,000 in ""disposable"" income.***

# What I am unsure about

\- Do my numbers make sense? Are they realistic? Are there any major expenses that I am not thinking of? 

\- Is $10,000 an appropriate emergency fund?

\- I am pretty knowledgeable about investing. My current thought is that the market is due for a correction and since I have significant savings goals, although I might miss out on gains, I think it is more important/valuable to focus on these and build a financial ""base"" rather than expend time, energy, and money playing in the markets beyond 401(k) contributions. Thoughts on this rationale?

\- Most of my budgeting and thoughts are based on my current $65,000 salary. I hope to use my first bonus to tie up any loose ends in my savings goals. Although bonuses are never guaranteed, I am very confident that I will get about $10,000 in pre-tax bonuses over the next 12 months. Any advice on how to handle these when they come in? 

\- I am confident in my ability to maximize value from my use of credit. Once I get the SUB from the Sapphire Reserve, Where should I go with credit cards? Stay in the Chase ecosystem? What should I get? I'd like to continue to get travel benefits as I anticipate being back and forth between California and the East Coast, and I'd also like to do some international travel when COVID restrictions loosen up.

\- Any advice on how to handle my student loans? I am probably going to wait until Federal payments resume to refinance my private loans (hopefully to a 10-year plan at a 3.xx% interest rate) and give the Biden administration time to take action on cancellation/further forbearance. 

\- Any high-level evaluation of where my thought process is at, what my financial situation looks like compared to other 23-year-olds, or any other general advice on how I might adjust my thinking would be much appreciated. Also, any ideas on how to start thinking about long-term goals, whether that be saving for a house, saving for a car at some point, etc.

If you've been following OPY over the past two weeks since my first thread, you might be wondering -- not much has changed, so why make this post?

Well gents, I got in touch with the CFO, Jeffrey Alfano, to ask him why Oppenheimer's (OPY) stock price seemed to be so low. I called him on Friday, and here's the kicker: Mr. Alfano told me that he gets calls like this *all the time.* Apparently a fair number of people don't quite understand why the company appears undervalued.

For a quick recap, the stock/company...

* Just had its most profitable year ever
* This year's EPS were almost 2x its second-most profitable year ever
* Has a P/E ratio of around 4.00
* Has been undergoing growth YoY every year since 2016
* Has been conducting share buybacks (float is down more than 4% from 2019)
* Has a tangible book value per share of 41.31 -- 11.8% higher than its current share price
* Has a lower share price than in **2007**, when...
   * its tangible book value per share was only **12.30,** and
   * its EPS then was almost **half** its current EPS (despite 2007 being -- apart from 2020 -- its most profitable year)

So why is OPY seemingly still so undervalued? The good news is that I don't really have a good answer! But I do have *some* answers. Below I will relay some of the information Mr. Alfano gave me -- and some conclusions I've arrived at myself -- about *why* the stock price may be trading lower compared to some of its competitors.

In this post, I'll be going into detail about:

* current and past risks (real and perceived) to the stock and its pricing
* why Q4 2020 was such a blow-out quarter
* appropriate valuation of the company

**Current and past risks to the company**

**1. CEO has total ownership of the company**

The first thing Mr. Alfano discussed was the corporate structure of the company. This is actually mentioned as one of the risk factors in the 10-K. Essentially, all publically-traded shares in the company are non-voting shares. This isn't an inherently a bad thing -- Chinese ADRs function the same way, and so do, essentially, any other company in which one person has a controlling stake of 51%. And yet, these other companies trade at often lofty valuations. In OPY, the CEO, Albert G. Lowenthal, owns something like 98% of the voting shares. Mr. Lowenthal's son, Robert S. Lowenthal, is a senior managing director for the company. A fair assumption would be that Robert is poised to assume leadership of the company when his father retires, though this was never actually indicated to me or even hinted at.

I must stress: Mr. Alfano doesn't personally perceive this as an inherently negative. He seems to have a great respect and admiration for Mr. Lowenthal. He characterized Mr. Lowenthal as being very engaged, studious, hard-working, and very present in the office. And he also mentioned that under his son's leadership, the company has seen record growth. If I believed his convictions to be anything less than genuine, I wouldn't have included them in this follow-up. Still, some investors might view the lack of voting shares as disincentive for owning the stock. This was the first reason Mr. Alfano indicated for why the stock might be trading so low.

**2. Past risks**

OPY apparently ran into some regulatory issues in the past, which could still affect public perception of the stock and company today. I don't know much about these issues, so I suggest you do your own DD. The impression I got was that these issues are in the past and the company has moved past them.

1. Auction rate issues in 2012 -- posed a massive issue for the firm as it was coming out of the financial crisis. Clients had 2.8 billion in assets when the auction markets froze and the auction rate dragged. I... I really don't know anything about this at all. Would appreciate if anyone more knowledgeable than me can chip in.
2. Penny stock regulatory issues in 2015-2016. Mr. Alfano didn't go into detail about this, and I didn't press him on it. It's likely that you can observe the breadth of this [here](https://www.businesstrialgroup.com/news/should-you-trust-your-financial-adviser/). Following 2016, the company has turned around and established a consistent track record of improving earnings.

**3. Potentiality for capital &amp; corporate tax increases**

Mr. Alfano didn't initially bring this one up, but responded in detail when prompted. He said that some clients could've completed more trades in Nov/Dec in anticipation of increased capital gains taxation under a Democratic Congress and White House, *maybe,* and this could've contributed to the massive earnings beat in Q4. This seemed like an extremely minor consideration IMO, but he made time to discuss it briefly, so I figured I would as well.

More significant would be the likelihood of an increase in corporate taxes. My specialty isn't US tax law, so bear with me. I copied down the numbers as I heard them, but I don't know how much more detail I could go into. Before 2017, the effective tax rate for OPY was 40-42%, and now it's been cut to 27-30%. This corresponds to roughly a 21% corporate marginal tax rate. The Biden admin is proposing raising this rate to 28%, which ought to be factored into any calculations of OPY's future earnings and valuation. As an example, this means that OPY's post-tax earnings in 2020 would be down from 122,986m to 111,540m.

**4. Effect of interest rate changes (negative or positive)**

With greater talk of interest rates turning negative, it's worth considering the effect this would have on OPY's profitability. Lower interest rates *are* identified as a risk factor in OPY's 10-K. Were interest rates to decline further, OPY's earnings from its bank deposit cash sweep program (which makes up about 10% of their total revenue) would be adversely affected. Still, when interest rates decline, the loss the company incurs is made up elsewhere. I mentioned this in my last post briefly -- in this time of historically low interest rates, OPY has had its best earnings ever. So while there is some cyclicality to the company's earnings, there are some counter-cyclical aspects as well. Mr. Alfano didn't wish to comment on any prediction for negative interest rates. However, an increase in interest rates would likely benefit the company greatly. The financial sector as a whole is likely to be severely undervalued in the case that interest rates *do* increase as the economy starts to reopen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why was Q4 such a blowout quarter?**

If you followed my last post, you might be wondering why Q4 2020 earnings were so high compared to the other quarters. I didn't have an answer then, but I do now, and it's quite simple. OPY's Q4 is usually its biggest quarter. Mergers and acquisitions, as well as equity underwriting, performs well in Q4 as companies try to close deals before the end of the year. The equity underwriting market this year was very profitable for OPY (as I hypothesized in my previous post), and these exceptional earnings simply continue a sustained track record of growth over the past few years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Appropriate valuation of the company**

Previously, I'd used EPS as a metric to assert that OPY was incredibly undervalued. It seemed ludicrous to me that a financials company could trade at just 4x its current earnings per share, especially after 4 consecutive years of unprecedented growth, low debt, share buybacks, etc., etc.

However, it appears now that I was using a metric that I *believed* *to* reflect the stock's appropriate valuation. Instead, we must look at history to identify and establish a trend of how the market as a *whole* assigns value to OPY.

For over two years -- from Dec 2017 to Feb 2020 -- the stock traded flat. This is despite 2018 earnings increasing from 2.05 EPS to 3.82 EPS. So what gives? When reviewing this period, it seems like the stock's price to tangible book value (PTBV) more accurately reflects the stock's movements.

The PTBV is a measurement that involves the net value of all the company's tangible assets. In other words, if you were to liquidate everything in the company, the PTBV would reflect how much money you would have left per share. If the ratio is 1.00, that means that the company's current stock price reflects the intrinsic value of a company. If the ratio is 2.00, that means that the company is priced 2x above its current inherent value. Sometimes the ratio can be *below* 1. This usually applies to the stocks of cyclical companies -- companies that are earning good *now*, but may have a storm to weather and losses to expect in the near future.

Since 2017, OPY has had a history of trading at *lower* than its PTBV, despite not really being in the same vein as cyclicals like semiconductors, luxury, and travel. Observe some very rough numbers, based on EOY stock price:

||2020|2019|2018|2017|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tangible book value per share|41.31|33.03|28.78|26.74|
|Stock price at EOY|37.10|27.84|25.41|26.80|
|PTBV|0.90|0.84|0.88|1.00|

The stock is currently trading below the actual tangible assets of the company! That means that if they were to liquidate everything in the company *this very moment*, they would, theoretically, have more cash per share than the actual share price of the company. I personally find this ludicrous, but what can you do? This valuation is consistent with patterns of previous years.

In my last post, I analyzed some large and small cap competitors of OPY. Mr. Alfano indicated two good competitors to use when doing a comparative analysis, so I thought I would conduct a short comparative analysis of their financials here. It's worth mentioning that these companies are not small cap, unlike OPY. Just for fun, I've also included what OPY's share price would be if its P/E ratio and PTBV were comparable to those of two of its competitors:

||OPY ^((from Dec 10-K))|RJF ^((from Sept 10-K))|SF ^((from Dec 10-K))|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Share price|36.95|118.25|59.16|
|EPS|9.27|6.17|3.68|
|P/E ratio|3.97|19.18|14.23|
|OPY's share price at the same P/E ratio|36.95|178.51|132.44|
|TBVPS|41.31|34.99|12.79|
|PTBV|0.90|3.38|4.62|
|OPY's share price at same PTBV ratio|36.95|138.77|189.68|

So, you can see that OPY is undervalued on basis of:

* P/E ratio (historical)
* P/E ratio compared to competitors
* PTBV compared to competitors

However, if we *only* look at OPY's PTBV since 2016, the stock seems to be trading in its normal and expected range. This one independent variable certainly isn't an ideal metric for valuing the stock, but then again, I don't think any of us would claim the current stock market is rational.

You'll have to determine the better valuation metrics for the stock:

* a track record of growth
* low P/E ratio compared to previous years
* low PTBV compared to competitors

or...

* an established history of years of trading below a 1.00 PTBV

&amp;#x200B;

Remember: what *should* happen isn't always what *will* happen in the stock market. It's admittedly frustrating watching meme companies with a market cap of 4 billion and negative earnings of 2 million run up 30% in one day, day after day. OPY traded flat for over a year despite nearly doubling its EPS. Just because the stock may be undervalued does not mean that the market will realize this and start to price in a more realistic and less pessimistic valuation for the stock. It's important to keep that in mind. Nonetheless, I know where my convictions lay.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr**: Is OPY extremely undervalued? IMO yes. Could the market continue to undervalue it for years, and the stock remain stagnant? Yes. Could the market suddenly decide to price it more fairly, causing the price to rise drastically and suddenly? Also yes. This could be a very slow burn.

Bitcoin,"Do you believe it? BTC price predicted to reach $115,212 in August","Someone recently used the STOCK-TO-FLOW model to analyze the price of Bitcoin, and the results were surprised, because according to the model prediction, Bitcoin will reach a peak price of $115,212 in August 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As we all know, according to the Bitcoin protocol, the supply of Bitcoin and the distribution of tokens are not quantitative easing, but based entirely on mathematical principles, and the design principles are very transparent and predictable. Its total supply is 21 million. When the block is generated, Bitcoin will be distributed to network nodes, and the Bitcoin block reward will be reduced by half every four years. 10,500,000 coins in the first four years; 5,250,000 coins in the second four years; 2,625,000 coins in the third four years; 1,312,500 coins in the fourth four years...and so on, until 2140, 21 million bitcoins All dug up.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for Bitcoin, one thing will not change, that is about 6.5 Bitcoins are produced every 10 minutes. On Bitcoin, the ""Greenspan put"" does not exist, because this economic strategy may be more suitable for industries such as stocks or real estate that are more affected by traditional policies.

&amp;#x200B;

So what kind of effect will the Bitcoin ‚Äúhalving‚Äù bring? The first to bear the brunt must be the impact on prices. Every time the Bitcoin block reward is halved, the price will always rise, because if the supply is reduced by half (especially in the case of a surge in market demand), there will be a shortage of supply and the price will inevitably rise sharply. ""Stimulate"" those who hold bitcoins to sell their bitcoins.

&amp;#x200B;

According to statistics, before the ""halving"", the average time for the Bitcoin price to bottom was 459 days, and then the price would gradually climb until the ""halving"" approached, and then soaring. The average time of the bull market cycle after the ""halving"" is about 446 days. In this cycle, the time the market is at a trough before the ""halving"" will actually reach 514 days.

&amp;#x200B;

At present, in order to research and analyze the Bitcoin block reward halving framework, a STOCK-TO-FLOW model has appeared on the market. It turns out that the first Bitcoin block reward halving reduced the total supply by 15%, which had a huge impact on both supply and price. The subsequent Bitcoin block reward halving may have a gradually reduced impact on the price, because the ratio of the supply after the ""last block reward halving"" to the supply after the ""next block reward halving"" will continue cut back. After the second Bitcoin block reward halving, the supply was only one-third of the first ""halving"". This phenomenon is very interesting, because the impact of this ""halving"" on the price is also three. One part.

&amp;#x200B;

If this trend of change is projected to the Bitcoin block reward halving event in 2020, then the reduction in Bitcoin supply this time is only 40% of 2016. If this relationship is established, it means that Bitcoin The price of the currency should also rise by 40%. Based on this calculation, Bitcoin will reach a peak price of $115,212 in August 2021. After a few months of growth, Bitcoin is currently progressing smoothly, but whether it will reach $115,212 before August 1, 2021 is unclear.

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth mentioning that the ""halving"" actually usually has a huge impact, but it often takes several years to see what impact it has on the entire market. After analyzing the supply and flow reduction trend of Bitcoin relative to circulation (compared every time the block reward halving occurs), it is found that Bitcoin block reward is a major event, and the effect of ""halving"" may require Wait for several years to play out. Generally speaking, in the 1.3 years before the block reward is halved, the market may experience a trough. On average, the peak time of the market may be about 1.2 years after the block reward halving occurs, and the entire cycle may take about two and a half years.

&amp;#x200B;

The CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, Jesse Powell, said in an investor conference call in May 2020: At least for now, Bitcoin does not seem to have solved the problem of supply and demand imbalances, and it is still in a 10-year index compounding at this stage. The return trend line is below, and the current Bitcoin price is also lower than the previous forecast. The Fed was printing money ""crazy"" and Morgan Stanley bought a 10% stake in the business intelligence software giant MicroStrategy. Perhaps investors still feel that Bitcoin has not yet reached the highest price.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people may think that the price forecast of $115,212 is ridiculous, but when the price of Bitcoin is only tens of dollars, how many people would dare to believe that Bitcoin will surpass $50,000 in 2021?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Credit Card or Car Loan? Which should I pay off first?,"Hey All, 

So here is where I'm at. I have a CC that is maxed out (from making school payments) and a car loan that is within grasp of being paid off. I'm getting my yearly bonus soon and I'm wondering which one I should take out first. 

I know that my CC carries a higer interest rate, but currently the prime rate is low and it appears to be staying that way for the near future. If I pay off my car, then I'll get a boost in cash flow for the year which will help to pay down various debts, including the CC card. I'm also anticipating various income dumps coming in throughout the next 2 years from investment returns. So, I'm feeling the additional cash flow can help until I can take on the CC card at a later time. I can make the payments on the card and will be better positioned after paying off the car. Of course, the ""traditional"" approach would be to pay off the higer interest, variable rate card first.

personalfinance,"Just got engaged, trying to re-evaluate my financial goals and how much I should save","Just got engaged and we are looking to get married in 18 months or so. Her parents are giving us $20k for the wedding, so we shouldn‚Äôt have to pay out of pocket, except for the rings, our suit/dress, and a couple of other small things. I have some hefty short term saving goals, but I also have some debt as well. Here‚Äôs my savings goals: 

Emergency fund: $5,000
Bachelor party: $1,000
House: $20,000
Current balance: $4,000

I‚Äôm almost to my emergency fund goal, and we are putting house fund on the registry so hopefully we can get some cash to buy a house. Next, here‚Äôs what my debt looks like:

Student loans: $27,000 (on deferment until September, but I put it in my budget to pay $500/month towards it)
Car loan: $9,000 (1.9% interest rate)
Credit card: $1,500 (0% apr until April 2022, opened it to buy engagement ring)

Obviously, paying off debt is a big setback to being financially free. Right now, I‚Äôm prioritizing the credit card because even though it‚Äôs 0% for another 14 months, I want to go ahead and get it paid off. I‚Äôm still doing the minimum on my car and as much as I can at my student loans. Should I change this?

Lastly, my investing strategy. I love, love, love to invest. I enjoy the market, looking at trends, and investing in the market. It‚Äôs my outside of work hobby. Currently, I am putting 6% to my 401k (3% pre tax and 3% is Roth) and I have 2% going to a Roth IRA for every paycheck, which ends up being not even $100/month. I also have a brokerage account with $600 in it, but I‚Äôm not contributing to it, it‚Äôs just speculative and I haven‚Äôt touched it in a couple of weeks. Should I change my investing strategy?

With this big life event, I have a lot of short terms and long term goals coming up. Between saving, investing, and paying off debt, I‚Äôm conflicted with what to focus on. My first instinct is to only invest the 401k 6% which is the match and then increase my savings amount. But then again, my Roth IRA contributions are so low I could use that as a savings account too. How should I proceed?

My income is $55,000 per year, my fianc√©e makes $62,000 per year.

Forex,All eyes on USD/CAD and AUD/USD,"Hello everyone, I hope everyone is having a great weekend! My focus for this week is aud/usd and usd/cad. AUD has been rising and I have been enjoying the ride, I plan on still holding eur/aud shorts and aud/jpy buys, for now I am interested in buying aud/usd and selling usd/cad. I have not touched USD due to rising yields and short squeezes happening, but now I believe our friend USD is ready to continue its downtrend. With the feds coming out and still striking that dovish tone, they don't plan on tapering ANY asset purchases anytime soon and with their 2% inflation goal (some voters want %3) still far fetched, USD is still very much bearish! I do not expect to buy USD in till around summer time this year as that is when vaccines should be rolled out to more Americans and more businesses open (we must remember US is the largest economy and many investors know this, so buying into the debt is what we should expect as US will make a comeback medium term especially with a democratic controlled senate)  Another big reason for USD weakness is the 1.9 Trillion dollar package that is soon to be voted this week, if this passes it will send USD straight to hell! so keep your eye on this! For my friend CAD, with rising oil prices there should be more CAD buy interest (remember oil is our biggest business and yes I am canadian!) HOWEVER, due to the biden administration cancelling the keystone pipeline this does hurt the CAD currency. So I am interested in selling usd/cad STRICKLY for USD weakness, Rising oil prices will help lift CAD as long as OPEC does not shoot out more supply AND with vaccines rolling out there should be more demand for OIL and thus CAD looks good to buy. Meanwhile RBA still stands by their bond purchasing and still want to keep the 3 year yield curve at 0.1% as well as governor Lowe expecting a much stronger recovery for this year. Therefore AUD/USD looks good to buy, however I would like to wait for price to pull back to 0.78012 area, Happy pip hunting!

Now it's being acquired by Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ). The stock shot up after going down for long enough to make me concerned. GWPH stock has been sort of flat lined for about $213/share for the last few weeks. So I'm up but things are flat.

personalfinance,What should I [24] know before buying my mother a house?,"**UPDATE**: I just got off the phone with my mother and explained everything I'd learned here. She told me that I absolutely should not buy her the house under these circumstances. She'd been worried about it, too, and she'd only accepted my help because I told her that she'd be helping me by building up equity. When I said that, I already knew that the best-case scenario for me was that it would go just okay for me. My main motivation was helping her, but I  knew she wouldn't accept a dime from me otherwise.

So in a way it was a Gift of the Magi thing, where we were both trying to do something for the other out of love. We talked about it and sorted it out and both felt relieved afterward. I offered to help pre-fund the move, and she said she'd think about it. I would give her the money outright, but she refuses to take a dime from me if it's a gift.

Thanks Reddit for knocking sense into me, and doing it with a kindness and empathy that I don't expect from the Internet. Y'all are truly wonderful people.

**ORIGINAL POST**:

My mother \[\~60\] is retired and living on a fixed income of about $2,000 per month. She has no debts and no assets. Her landlord asked her to vacate by January because he wants to sell the house, but she hasn't moved yet. Moving would be expensive and emotionally taxing for her because she's a hoarder. Other than this, though, she's a good tenant who pays rent on time.

I want to buy the house and allow her to keep living there. The house will cost $150,000. I would put 20% down, and the $750 monthly rent my mother pays would go to me instead. This would cover payments on a 30-year mortgage, homeowners insurance, and property taxes. The home would be in my name. It's located in a good neighborhood in a small southern U.S. town.

I am single with good credit and about $140,000 in assets: $45,000 in a liquid emergency fund, $84,000 in a Vanguard brokerage account, and $12,000 in a Vanguard Roth IRA. My gross income the past two years has been about $50,000 annually. However, I plan to begin law school either this fall or the following fall, and I expect to take on substantial student loans. The estimated cost of attendance is $90,000 per year, and I would likely not have a significant income during this period. (This would be a top-tier law school so my future earning potential justifies the cost to me.)

What should I know before buying the home? How it will affect my credit? My interest rate on law school loans? Should I designate the home as a rental property, or as a primary residence (with my mother's monthly contribution styled as a tax-exempt gift)? What will happen when I later wish to buy a home for myself? How can I get a mortgage while living in another state? How should I negotiate with the landlord on price? Should I seek an independent appraisal? What other risks have I ignored?

Although I could be talked out of the buy if people are strongly opposed, this seems like a somewhat low-cost way to give my mother an easier life. The $30,000 down payment invested at 7% annually over 30 years would become $228,000. Meanwhile, a $150,000 home would be worth that much in 30 years if it appreciates by 1.4% annually. This is less about investing, though, and more about giving my mother a stable home. I'm willing to accept a reasonable loss.",finance
personalfinance,First time Home buyer Questions.,My wife and I are looking at purchasing our first home and are exploring mortgage loans. This would qualify as a second home as we will maintain a rental residence in NYC our rent is $2650. We will NOT be renting out the home to tenants. My income is 250K annually roughly 100K of that is a guaranteed bonuses and stock. My wife makes 260K annually 130K of that is commissions. We both work at large stable publicly traded tech company's. Our net worth is 6m with 4.8M is liquid-able assets without penalties like Stocks/ETF's etc IE: not in 401K/ IRA accounts. We have no student loan debt but lease a car with 10K remaining in payments. We are prepared to put up to a max all in at closing of 200K-300K. (The 100k flexibility is because we are looking in Austin TX and currently with such a hot market you have to almost always over bid asking and by law if we do so we would have to cover the delta between appraisal value and offer bid without it included in the loan.) My question is around our credit and how the above assets will affect our interest rates. My credit score with the big 3 are 699/ 747/ 741 ( will they average these? 729?) My wife's big 3 averaged out to 790. Do they average our scores together or simply use my lower score.

CryptoCurrency,"PSA: If you are a newcomer to crypto, don't forget to file taxes next year and keep track of your cost basis","Folks, I've learned much from this community and I wanted to pay it forward with this post, as I've not seen this mentioned before during my time on here. 

If you are new to crypto and have done some trades or sold, especially if you are based on the US, consider filing taxes properly next year. Yes, crypto is supposed to be decentralized and free from government control but I won't get into that here, as that is a separate discussion. My only intent is to spread awareness that paying taxes on gains and reporting trades might be something you want to do, to avoid Uncle Sam slapping you with a penalty you can't afford to pay. 

This is not as easy as importing your forms from Fidelity/Robinhood and the like. Brokerages keep track of your cost basis for you. Places like Kraken/Coinbase are exchanges instead, so they don't. Most crypto exchanges (looking at you, Coinbase...) do not keep track of your cost basis and worse yet, do not provide you with many useful forms for making things easier. There's reasons why they don't do this beyond just laziness. 

To further confound things, Coinbase may report withdrawals as a ""sell"" which is viewed as a taxable event. In that case, you would need to rely on YOUR records to reconcile this. So if you acquired something on the exchange and withdrew to your own wallet, for example. 

* *Kraken* does NOT provide tax forms or statements ([source link](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001184966-Kraken-does-not-provide-tax-forms-or-statement))

Bitcoin,3 Arguments You Can Use To Change Anyone's Mind On Bitcoin,"To keep it simple, here are the 3 biggest reasons why Bitcoin will win in the end:

**1.** **Bitcoin the currency**: Bitcoin transfers more VALUE than any other currency out there. It does it efficiently with transparency on a virtually unhackable network. It is easily divisible and knows no boarders in the sense that its international. The network never sleeps; no more 3-5 business days for transactions to settle.

**2.** **Bitcoin the store of value**: Bitcoin is digital gold. Its properties make it scarce (limited supply of 21 million) and its a deflationary asset. To put this into perspective, inflation is the biggest cause of wealth inequality in the world. Most people hold their wealth in cash which loses 2% of its value every year due to inflation (mostly due to money being printed). With fiat currencies, such as the dollar, $10 dollars will actually buy you *less* goods/services over time. That is why if I were to save $1 million dollars and pass it on to my grandchildren they will literally be broke. With a deflationary currency, such as Bitcoin, 1 BTC will actually buy you *more* over time. No more of the ""back in my day a ticket to the movies cost 10 cents"" story because your purchasing power is no longer being deteriorated. Your wealth is now preserved and even increased over time. This can literally close the wealth gap in America and other countries over time. This is as revolutionary as anything can possibly get.

**3.** **Bitcoin the decentralized asset**: No one can control it. No government or central authority can shut it down. Bankers are notorious for profiting from hard working middle class people. Take a look at what happened with GameStop stock. Take a look at the interest rate you get from the savings account at your bank, its like 0.05%, which suggests that they make way more considering they have to make a profit. That 0.05% APY doesn't even keep up with inflation. Bitcoin gives power back to the people and allows them to be OWNERS of their own wealth without having to trust a third party. Do you think our financial system has done the common people a favor? Take a look at how stagnant wages have been the last few decades and how expensive cost of living has gotten. Remember, ‚ÄúThey only control us because we use their currency.‚Äù

**TLDR**; Buy Bitcoin as a peaceful protest to our current financial system. It will securitize transactions, close the wealth gap, help you build wealth, and most importantly, give power back to the people.

**Sidenote**: Just buy and hold it. Don‚Äôt try to trade it or find ‚Äúthe right time to buy‚Äù. Dollar cost average regardless of price and you‚Äôll thank yourself later.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Car refinance route or nah?,"Hey guys, look for opinions/advice on this plan. I dont have all the fine details worked out yet, so this is just a generalization of it.  


I currently have roughly 12k USD left on my car loan with a 389$ monthly payment at a 5% interest rate. Due to be paid off in 2023. Car was purchased 2017. My loan is roughly 2k upside down due to my trade in from when I bought this car originally. I knew what I was getting into there and was ok with it. I have about 13k in my 401K from my work with the ability to take out a loan up to 6.5K. I would love to be able to refinance for a lower payment/interest rate mostly for the sake to let me save more from my paychecks.   


My thought was to pull the loan from my 401K, use it towards paying a large chunk on the car for the refinance/lower payment and sooner pay off. I am totally ok with the interest from the loan since it will be going back into my 401K anyways. Have not looked into what the interest would be yet. If my bank is able to drop the interest rate a fair bit, what numbers should I be looking at to make it worth while? I also plan to make additional payments at time to the principal with extra income as it comes in.  


I just wasn't sure if this actually makes sense or not. I can currently afford the payments as they are, but I think the interest is a bit high? Im not as financially knowledgeable as I probably should be at this point in my life but I am trying to fix that. I fully intend to drive this car for as long as possible. As it a great car and I love it. My only other debt, aside from monthly stuff (phone, rent, etc), is a small personal loan that is right around 750$. Almost finished paying that off!

personalfinance,taking money out of your home and investing it,"so I'm down to 7k owed on my home. I have 500k in investments and a pension that will pay around 80k a year.

looking forward I'm thinking of re-financing my home and taking 100k out. The house is worth about 200k. The reason to take it out would be to toss another 100k into my investments and continue to make the same mortgage payment I've been making. With interest rates under 3% (I have a 840 credit score) and traditional returns between 7-10% (I've been doing well over that for several years) I figure I can pocket the extra and could absorb any short term dips. I am planning to retire in 10 years but may just switch jobs then and collect my pension while making 150k at a new job...

anyone think this is a bad idea?",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my 3.85% fixed rate into a 1.61% float credit line or a 2.6% fixed? Complicated by family.,"Situation: wife and I consolidated all our school loans which averaged around 7% interest into a 3.85% fixed home equity line on my dad's house and I take care of the payment every month and have a life insurance policy which would cover him, just in case. It is currently at about 185k in principle left and about 6 years in to a 20 year. We pay about $1800/mo. I went to med school if it helps these amounts make more sense.

We also have a mortgage at about the same rate, 3.89% 30 year fixed, 3.5 years in and also paying $1800/mo.

Current scenario, part 1: my brother in law is working at a mortgage finance co and my dad is refinancing his place. He wants to absorb my loan (the home equity) into his at a lower rate and my payments would be around $775/mo. I do have a good relationship with him and neither of us are interested in trying to screw anyone over, just get a good deal for both. 

I ALSO just talked with my financial advisors who looked at my situation and said they could offer a line of credit at 1.61%  floating on LIBOR to take care of home equity. Interest payment would be 285/mo and anything more can go to principal. So, theoretically, if I keep paying $1800 then I'm paying down 1500 of principal per month and ideally would net benefit by the time interest rates go over the 3.89 I am at now. 

Part 2: my brother in law is also pushing for me to redo my mortgage, he could get me a 2.66% fixed interest rate and closing costs around $2500 which he offered to put back on the principal so we didn't have to pay anything right now. Looks like it might pay out in 1.5 years or so, but honestly I'm not sure how long we will be in this house. Possible we move in next 1-3 years with wife's job flux due to COVID.

I'm leaning towards avoiding the floating rate, just curious to get some feedback which isn't from family.

stocks,Signature Bank (SBNY) - flying below the digital asset momentum?,"I‚Äôve been following SBNY for some time and recently bought shares + thinking about adding. Wondering if anyone else has been watching them and can provide insight on future prospects. I‚Äôm no digital assets expert, so hoping someone out there is and has potentially looked at the possible upside for SBNY. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Stock price at 220, can it continue to climb short-term?** 
* **Does it have a competitive advantage in digital asset marketplace?** 
* **Could NY CRE exposure derail gains?** 

**Signature Bank** (Nasdaq:SBNY), member FDIC, is a full-service commercial bank with 31 private client offices located throughout the New York metropolitan area as well as in San Francisco, California. The Bank primarily serves privately owned businesses, their owners, and their senior managers. Signature Bank offers a broad range of business and personal banking products and services, as well as investment, brokerage, asset management, and insurance products and services through its subsidiary, Signature Securities Group Corporation, a licensed broker-dealer, investment adviser, and member FINRA/SIPC. In addition, Signature Bank‚Äôs wholly owned specialty finance subsidiary, Signature Financial LLC, provides equipment financing and leasing. 

During the current digital asset price surge, this bank has mostly flown under the radar, so I wanted to give it a closer look. It‚Äôs outer facade looks no different than any other regional bank but it‚Äôs stock price has started outperforming the industry index and only Silvergate (155% YTD) has outpaced SBNY (63% YTD). SBNY may not be as sexy as SI, but they already custody over $10bn in digital assets along with the size to more efficiently scale this business line. Is it being overlooked because it doesn‚Äôt market itself? 

**Bull Case -** 

Interest income has stayed consistent at about $480ish million despite declining interest rates this year. This supports they are relatively protected against a prolonged low interest rate environment. 

Non-interest income has grown from $15mm to $24mm YoY!! 

Asset growth $50.6b to $73.9b = +46% YoY growth

Not only do they have a digital assets group; which was an early adopter of supporting ETH, they also have a digital payments system built on blockchain (Signet). Now that ""private banking clients"" are getting into digital assets, they are likely to be funneled into SBNY

Raised over $1bn in capital as it pursues its goal of becoming a $100bn asset bank. 

Acquired a team that will focus on VC funded early stage companies (a highly lucrative business line e.g., Square One Bank, East West Bank, etc)

**Bear Case / Risks**

Banks make loans expecting to be repaid. SBNY has seen an uptick in non-accrual loans going from 0.15% of loans to 0.25%. In addition, they have 1.31 bn in payment deferrals related to COVID. What % of those return to ‚Äúperforming‚Äù is anyone‚Äôs guess. 

Subject to the market sentiment of digital assets. 

Recently dissolved a relationship with DJT which could have some political consequences. 

Loans concentrated in NY metro market. 

55mm shares outstanding‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll rip up or down with relatively small changes in trading volume

Currently 36% over it‚Äôs ATH set bak in March 2017

I‚Äôve been looking over the balance sheet and it seems pretty tight. They have some exposure to brokered deposits, but in the NY market they‚Äôre usually cheaper than ‚Äúcore‚Äù deposits even in normal interest rate markets. Here are some analysts predictions. I don‚Äôt typically give them much merit, but they are usually pretty good with banks. 

2/16 BofA Global Research - $240

2/9 JPM - $250

2/11 Wedbush - $280!

TL;DR - regional bank dabbles in digital assets and has a strong balance sheet with lofty growth goals. Stock price could run.

personalfinance,25k student loan 1.5% variable interest rate,"25k loan, 1.5% variable interest

Debating taking this loan to finish off my flight school, the loan is for $25,000 over 84 months (7years) at 1.5%apr with max interest rate at 25%. The variable rate is based on upon the one month LIBOR rate which is currently at 0.250% and my rate is calculated each month by adding a margin of 1.25% to the LIBOR. 


My question is, I‚Äôm seeing very low interest rates over the next couple years, would that keep the LIBOR on my loan low for the next couple years? Has anyone else gotten a variable interest loan at a low rate and it sky rocketed if so how long did it last and did you refinance?

personalfinance,What should I do with the funds I saved to pay off my student loans since interest is deferred until September?,"My wife and I have six figures of student loan debt. As many know, one aspect of Covid relief in the US is that student loan interest has been waived through September of 2021 (and possibly longer - it's been extended several times). This was a huge savings for us and lead to something of a windfall since we both still have our jobs. We're planning to put those funds and other savings towards paying down the student loan debt as some of it is at 7+% interest rates. However, there is really no benefit to doing so until the interest starts back up again, so I figured I might as well hang on to the money for as long as possible just in case.

Is there anything useful I can use those funds for in the meantime? I could invest in index funds or similar, but given the short timeframe until repayment, it seems risky. I use Betterment and it's easy to move money in and out, but I'd rather not bet these funds directionally on the market. I do have some money in their version of a savings account, but it is currently yielding an uninspiring 0.4%. 

Any thoughts? I assume there is no magic bullet out there that will give reasonable risk-free returns for the next six months, but maybe better rates are available somewhere else. Alternatively, I could do a mix of index funds and bonds. Curious how other folks in this situation are handling it.",finance
Bitcoin,North Korean Hackers Indicted by Cryptocurrency AttacksÔºü,"Three North Korean Military Hackers Indicted in Wide-Ranging Scheme to Commit Cyberattacks and Financial Crimes Across the Globe  


Indictment Expands 2018 Case that Detailed Attack on Sony Pictures and Creation of WannaCry Ransomware by Adding Two New Defendants and Recent Global Schemes to Steal Money and Cryptocurrency from Banks and Businesses while Operating in North Korea, China  


**A federal indictment unsealed today charges three North Korean computer programmers with participating in a wide-ranging criminal conspiracy to conduct a series of destructive cyberattacks, to steal and extort more than $1.3 billion of money and cryptocurrency from financial institutions and companies, to create and deploy multiple malicious cryptocurrency applications, and to develop and fraudulently market a blockchain platform**.  


A second case unsealed today revealed that a Canadian-American citizen has agreed to plead guilty in a money laundering scheme and admitted to being a high-level money launderer for multiple criminal schemes, including ATM ‚Äúcash-out‚Äù operations and a cyber-enabled bank heist orchestrated by North Korean hackers.  


‚ÄúAs laid out in today‚Äôs indictment, North Korea‚Äôs operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world‚Äôs leading bank robbers,‚Äù said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the Justice Department‚Äôs National Security Division. ‚ÄúThe Department will continue to confront malicious nation state cyber activity with our unique tools and work with our fellow agencies and the family of norms abiding nations to do the same.‚Äù  


‚ÄúToday's unsealed indictment expands upon the FBI‚Äôs 2018 charges for the unprecedented cyberattacks conducted by the North Korean regime,‚Äù said the FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. ‚ÄúThe ongoing targeting, compromise, and cyber-enabled theft by North Korea from global victims was met with the outstanding, persistent investigative efforts of the FBI in close collaboration with U.S. and foreign partners. By arresting facilitators, seizing funds, and charging those responsible for the hacking conspiracy, the FBI continues to impose consequences and hold North Korea accountable for its/their criminal cyber activity.""  


‚ÄúThe scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was extensive and long-running, and the range of crimes they have committed is staggering,‚Äù said Acting U.S. Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison for the Central District of California. ‚ÄúThe conduct detailed in the indictment are the acts of a criminal nation-state that has stopped at nothing to extract revenge and obtain money to prop up its regime.‚Äù  


‚ÄúThis case is a particularly striking example of the growing alliance between officials within some national governments and highly sophisticated cyber-criminals,‚Äù said U.S. Secret Service Assistant Director Michael R. D‚ÄôAmbrosio. ‚ÄúThe individuals indicted today committed a truly unprecedented range of financial and cyber-crimes: from ransomware attacks and phishing campaigns, to digital bank heists and sophisticated money laundering operations. With victims strewn across the globe, this case shows yet again that the challenge of cybercrime is, and will continue to be, a struggle that can only be won through partnerships, perseverance, and a relentless focus on holding criminals accountable.‚Äù  


The hacking indictment filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges that Jon Chang Hyok (Ï†ÑÏ∞ΩÌòÅ), 31; Kim Il (ÍπÄÏùº), 27; and Park Jin Hyok (Î∞ïÏßÑÌòÅ), 36, were members of units of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), a military intelligence agency of the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK), which engaged in criminal hacking. These North Korean military hacking units are known by multiple names in the cybersecurity community, including Lazarus Group and Advanced Persistent Threat 38 (APT38). Park was previously charged in a criminal complaint unsealed in September 2018.  


The indictment alleges a broad array of criminal cyber activities undertaken by the conspiracy, in the United States and abroad, for revenge or financial gain. The schemes alleged include:  


* Cyberattacks on the Entertainment Industry: The destructive cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014 in retaliation for ‚ÄúThe Interview,‚Äù a movie that depicted a fictional assassination of the DPRK‚Äôs leader; the December 2014 targeting of AMC Theatres, which was scheduled to show the film; and a 2015 intrusion into Mammoth Screen, which was producing a fictional series involving a British nuclear scientist taken prisoner in DPRK.
* Cyber-Enabled Heists from Banks: Attempts from 2015 through 2019 to steal more than $1.2 billion from banks in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Mexico, Malta, and Africa by hacking the banks‚Äô computer networks and sending fraudulent Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messages.
* Cyber-Enabled ATM Cash-Out Thefts: Thefts through ATM cash-out schemes ‚Äì referred to by the U.S. government as ‚ÄúFASTCash‚Äù ‚Äì including the October 2018 theft of $6.1 million from BankIslami Pakistan Limited (BankIslami).
* Ransomware and Cyber-Enabled Extortion: Creation of the destructive WannaCry 2.0 ransomware in May 2017, and the extortion and attempted extortion of victim companies from 2017 through 2020 involving the theft of sensitive data and deployment of other ransomware.
* Creation and Deployment of Malicious Cryptocurrency Applications: Development of multiple malicious cryptocurrency applications from March 2018 through at least September 2020 ‚Äì including Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, iCryptoFx, Union Crypto Trader, Kupay Wallet, CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale ‚Äì which would provide the North Korean hackers a backdoor into the victims‚Äô computers.
* Targeting of Cryptocurrency Companies and Theft of Cryptocurrency: Targeting of hundreds of cryptocurrency companies and the theft of tens of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of cryptocurrency, including $75 million from a Slovenian cryptocurrency company in December 2017; $24.9 million from an Indonesian cryptocurrency company in September 2018; and $11.8 million from a financial services company in New York in August 2020 in which the hackers used the malicious CryptoNeuro Trader application as a backdoor.
* Spear-Phishing Campaigns: Multiple spear-phishing campaigns from March 2016 through February 2020 that targeted employees of United States cleared defense contractors, energy companies, aerospace companies, technology companies, the U.S.Department of State, and the U.S. Department of Defense.
* Marine Chain Token and Initial Coin Offering: Development and marketing in 2017 and 2018 of the Marine Chain Token to enable investors to purchase fractional ownership interests in marine shipping vessels, supported by a blockchain, which would allow the DPRK to secretly obtain funds from investors, control interests in marine shipping vessels, and evade U.S. sanctions.
* According to the allegations contained in the hacking indictment, which was filed on Dec. 8, 2020, in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and unsealed today, the three defendants were members of units of the RGB who were at times stationed by the North Korean government in other countries, including China and Russia. While these defendants were part of RGB units that have been referred to by cybersecurity researchers as Lazarus Group and APT38, the indictment alleges that these groups engaged in a single conspiracy to cause damage, steal data and money, and otherwise further the strategic and financial interests of the DPRK government and its leader, Kim Jong Un.

Money Launderer Charged in California and Georgia  


Federal prosecutors today also unsealed a charge against Ghaleb Alaumary, 37, of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, for his role as a money launderer for the North Korean conspiracy, among other criminal schemes. Alaumary agreed to plead guilty to the charge, which was filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, 2020. Alaumary was a prolific money launderer for hackers engaged in ATM cash-out schemes, cyber-enabled bank heists, business email compromise (BEC) schemes, and other online fraud schemes. Alaumary is also being prosecuted for his involvement in a separate BEC scheme by the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Southern District of Georgia.  


With respect to the North Korean co-conspirators‚Äô activities, Alaumary organized teams of co-conspirators in the United States and Canada to launder millions of dollars obtained through ATM cash-out operations, including from BankIslami and a bank in India in 2018. Alaumary also conspired with Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, aka ‚ÄúRay Hushpuppi,‚Äù and others to launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist from a Maltese bank in February 2019. Last summer, the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office in Los Angeles charged Abbas in a separate case alleging that he conspired to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from BEC frauds and other scams.  


Accompanying Mitigation Efforts  


Throughout the investigation, the FBI and the Justice Department provided specific information to victims about how they had been targeted or compromised, as well as information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the hackers with the goals of remediating any intrusion and preventing future intrusions. That direct sharing of information took place in the United States and in foreign countries, often with the assistance of foreign law enforcement partners. The FBI also collaborated with certain private cybersecurity companies by sharing and analyzing information about the intrusion TTPs used by the members of the conspiracy.  


In addition to the criminal charges, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Treasury, today released a joint cybersecurity advisory and malware analysis reports (MARs) regarding North Korean cryptocurrency malware. The joint cybersecurity analysis and MARs highlight the cyber threat North Korea ‚Äì which is referred to by the U.S. government as HIDDEN COBRA ‚Äì poses to cryptocurrency and identify malware and indicators of compromise related to the ‚ÄúAppleJeus‚Äù family of malware (the name given by the cybersecurity community to a family of North Korean malicious cryptocurrency applications that includes Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, Union Crypto Trader, Kupay Wallet, CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale). The joint cybersecurity advisory and MARs collectively provide the cybersecurity community and public with information about identifying North Korean malicious cryptocurrency applications, avoiding intrusions, and remedying infections.  


The U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office and FBI also obtained seizure warrants authorizing the FBI to seize cryptocurrency stolen by the North Korean hackers from a victim in the indictment ‚Äì a financial services company in New York ‚Äì held at two cryptocurrency exchanges. The seizures include sums of multiple cryptocurrencies totaling approximately $1.9 million, which will ultimately be returned to the victim.  


Jon, Kim, and Park are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.  


In relation to the case filed in Los Angeles, Alaumary has agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  


The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  


The investigation of Jon, Kim, and Park was led by the FBI‚Äôs Los Angeles Field Office, which worked closely with the FBI‚Äôs Charlotte Field Office. The U.S. Secret Service‚Äôs Los Angeles Field Office and Global Investigative Operations Center provided substantial assistance. The FBI‚Äôs Cyber Division also provided substantial assistance.  


The investigations of Alaumary were conducted by the U.S. Secret Service‚Äôs Savannah Field Office, FBI‚Äôs Los Angeles Field Office, and the U.S. Secret Service‚Äôs Los Angeles Field Office and Global Investigative Operations Center. The FBI‚Äôs Criminal Investigative Division also provided substantial assistance.  


The case against Jon, Kim, and Park is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Anil J. Antony and Khaldoun Shobaki of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section, with substantial assistance from Trial Attorney Scott Claffee of the Department of Justice National Security Division‚Äôs Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.  


Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antony and Shobaki are also prosecuting the case against Alaumary, in which the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the Criminal Division‚Äôs Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) provided substantial assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antony and Shobaki, along with Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Galatzan of the Asset Forfeiture Section, also obtained the seizure warrants for cryptocurrency stolen from the financial services company in New York.  


The Criminal Division‚Äôs Office of International Affairs provided assistance throughout these investigations, as did many of the FBI‚Äôs Legal Attach√©s, as well as foreign authorities around the world. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance.

It seems as if a good percentage of crypto ransomware and high profile malicious attacks are tied to north korean hackers. If the list of crimes these names are being held accountable for is anything to go by.

Is that normal? My lender is an old-school private lender - I was recommended him by a friend. Would a bank give me the interest rate w/ a pre-approval?

Not knowing what the actual home price will be, what the interest rate will be (or even a realistic range), or what any HOA, tax, insurance, or other monthly costs might be, I don't know what my final monthly payment will be &amp; that makes it hard to know whether certain homes I see on the home apps are actually feasible for me to buy. Also can't tell from the home apps what the HOA might actually cover - water? trash? landscaping? etc... Really makes it hard to understand whether certain houses that meet my needs - but are on the upper limit of pricing - are something I can consider. I don't want to be house-poor (aka not able to live at current standard &amp; not able to save), so I really feel like I need to understand this to get a realistic idea of what I can afford.

I've seen on a mortgage calculator that a single point can change my combined mortgage &amp; taxes by \~10%. I also anticipate that since the home we'd like to purchase will be larger than our current apartment that the utilities costs will increase (looking at 2x the square footage of my current apartment &amp; currently don't pay for water or trash). I have also played around with different home prices, HOA fees, insurance rates, tax rates, &amp; down payment amounts &amp; there are definitely some scenarios where I would feel over-extended.

CryptoCurrency,"I have been using Nexo , Celsius and Yield App. This is my review of them, with pros and cons of each one.","I‚Äôve being using this services for a little months and decided to write this pros and cons for new people that are wondering which one is the best. This won‚Äôt be a biased review because I hold all tokens, to achieve greatest returns on each plataforms.

These services offer higher APYs than banks and you can get more money from your Crypto. Buuut you won‚Äôt hold your keys. So it‚Äôs up to you to decide if it‚Äôs worth or not. 

******


CELSIUS


You can get up to 16,5% APY with stables but to get this interest rate you must have 25% of your savings at there in CEL, they‚Äôre native tokens.

Pros 

Transparency.

Accept a lot of coins to hold 

 We all know they‚Äôre treasury, they‚Äôre huge and with more than three years at the road. 

CEO is engaged at the community and makes constant AMAs. 

No fees for withdraw. 

Referral program. 

Cons

You need to hold 25% of they‚Äôre native coins to get the higher rates so you need to control that. If bitcoin goes up and CEL goes down you will need to get more CEL. There‚Äôs no in app swap, so you need to go to an exchange, buy CEL, pay fee and deposit. 

Withdraws can take more time than you are expecting . I usually just get my coins back at the other day. They say it‚Äôs for safety.

Interest are paid on a weekly basis.


********

NEXO


Nexo offers up to 12% on stable coins and you just need 10% of your savings at they‚Äôre native coin. 

Pros

A clean and easy to use app 

You don‚Äôt have to hold a lot of Nexo token to get the best rates 

Fast withdraws 

Interest paid daily 

In app swap

Cons

There have been a lot of controversy about they‚Äôre treasure and insurance policy, and regulations. Besides this, Nexo is paying without delays and you can get in and out without issues 

APY is not that high 

******

YIELD APP

Yield app is the new kid on the block, launched two weeks ago. It pays up to 10% + 10% of bonus if you have 20k YLD, they‚Äôre native token (costs around 0,80 cents each by the time I am writing). I have been using it and moving money in and out easily. 

Pros

Offer the higher APY for Stables at the market 

Offer the higher APY for the native token at the market, 10% + 2% bonus.

It‚Äôs just launched and the token can have more room to grow 

Interest paid daily 

Possible future gain in it token, low mkt cap


Cons 

There is no mobile app (it‚Äôs expected to be launched at March)

Interface is not very intuitive 

It‚Äôs the newest one, so it must achieve credibility 

Fees for withdraw 

****

I won‚Äôt declare a winner, all of them have pros and cons and the best strategy for me is split between them to minimize the risk.

personalfinance,Getting conflicting information - Student Loan Payoff or other uses??,"Throwaway account. Thanks in advance everyone. 

I‚Äôm getting conflicting information about what I should be doing financially right now. Seeking help. 

TLDR; keep hammering away at loans, or start other investments? 

Quick financial picture. I‚Äôm 32. Out of grad school and in my career only 2.5 years. I gross 88k a year. Student loans are 90k now. Zero retirement. No other debt. 5K in emergency fund (2-3 months expenses). That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôd say I could save an excess somewhere between 15-20k a year after my monthly expenses. 

Most of what I‚Äôve read online says, just go at the student loans. It‚Äôs a guaranteed ‚Äúreturn on investment‚Äù. And just nice to be stress free because of no debt. And that it‚Äôs just smart math-wise financially. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing for the last 1.5 years (paid off my car in full first). 

However, some of my coworkers and other people in my life are saying differently. Quite a few have said to purchase a house, so I‚Äôm not ‚Äúwasting‚Äù money on rent. Some have said even with property tax/insurance with a mortgage, it might be cheaper than my current rent (my city is booming right now, fastest growing city in US right now, and rent is skyrocketing, as is house prices). It might or might not be true. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù and some mortgage companies are offering little down and no PMI because I‚Äôm a less risky borrower. My credit is fantastic. Some have said save at least the 6k max for a Roth each year. They argued the math works out as smarter financial decisions than paying every extra dollar at the student loan. 

The other part is the emotional side. I‚Äôve saved zero for retirement. My work offers no retirement benefits. If I put ALL of my excess income towards student loans, it will still take about 4 years to pay off. At which point I will be 37 with no retirement or assets. I might be 40 before I can even afford a starter house after down payment savings. It‚Äôs a scary thought. Part of me wants to at least max a Roth at 6k a year, and then buy a house so I can start both of those processes. In theory it‚Äôs possible those returns on investments could approach my 6.5% loan interest rate. 

Is there an obvious answer on which route to go? I feel pressure due to my age of not having any assets or savings. Would it be stupid to just pay the minimum on loans so I can do these other things? I appreciate all the help!",finance

dot,Will nominators receive inflation rewards ?,"Please read this official text: [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking/#inflation](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking/#inflation)

&gt;For instance, **all of the inflation would go to the validators if 50% of all KSM / DOT are staked**, but any deviation from the 50% - positive or negative - sends the proportional remainder to the treasury and effectively reduces validator payouts.

And the text marked as bold called my attention, because I am a nominator in binance so I think Binance is the validator and if you can see in this image (see the row marked as red).... if the staking Rate is 60% which I think can be very common then I will receive a 7.30% of the year interest rate (because of my monthly staking) but the inflation will be 10% (Validators will receive 4.38% of the new DOTS and the treasury will receive 5.62 % of the new DOTS) that means that at the end of the year I will have a loss of 2.7 % in value of my DOTS and if I do not stake I will receive a 10% loss of my value..... but if the 4.38 % that the validator will receive are going to be distributed into all the HOLDERS or NOMINATOR then I think this wont be a problem.... because if thats the case then I will receive a benefit of 6.06% Yearly.

personalfinance,Financial checkup. Decided to get serious about investing and retirement planning. Suggestions?,"Hello, I'm slightly embarrassed to say that last week I finally decided to take retirement planning and investing seriously. In the past I halfheartedly did some retirement contributions, but never put any planning or thought into it. I've read through most of the wiki the past couple days, but would appreciate any suggestions if I seem to be misunderstanding or missing anything. I think what I would like most is links/references to calculators for IBR loan forgiveness (trying to figure out if student loans would be paid off within 25 years on IBR minimum payments, if it's better to just pay it off now, or can we expect any forgiveness).  

I apologize for the glut of information, but I wanted to be thorough. Here's our background:  



- I'm 36 years old, and my wife will be 38 in two weeks. We file tax returns jointly. I plan to work until 65, my wife would like to retire sooner.  

- I work as an assistant professor at a university. $146,000 W2 salary. My employer does not offer match for employee contributions, but rather gives nonelective contributions (employer contributes 11% of salary up to $24,000 and 5% for salary over $24,000). Past employer 403b contributions have worked out to about $8,500 per year. I also work part-time (eight hours per week) in my wife's business. Our accountant has me set up to take W2 salary of $84,000 from my wife's business.   

- My wife is self-employed, with an additional part-time (eight hours per week) W2 position as adjunct faculty at a university. Her W2 earnings last year was $24,000. She does not take salary or compensation from her business.  

- We have two kids, one is 2.5 years old and the other will be five in three weeks.  


Debt:  

- My student loans: consolidated federal direct unsubsidized $362,000 and consolidated federal direct subsidized $35,000. Loan payments are on pause from COVID relief. I am working towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness.    

- Wife's student loans (according to studentaid.gov): Grad PLUS $66,000, Stafford/direct subsidized loans $40,000, Stafford/direct unsubsidized loans $182,000. $120,000 of these loans (mix of sub/unsub/Grad PLUS) is currently between 6-8.5% interest rate under IBR repayment. The remaining $168,000 loans is 0% interest from COVID relief.  

- Mortgage: Refinanced our house for lower interest rate and lower payments in June 2020. Currently $324,000 balance at 3.375% interest. 30 year fixed rate.  

- Business loan: Interest rate reduction completed November 2020 on original 15 year loan. Currently $560,000 balance at fixed 3% interest, term ends 11/2031. Prepayment penalty if loan paid off within first five years of rate reduction.  

Expenses:  

- Pre-COVID expenses were $9,000/month. Not sure how soon we will return to normal, but now it's about $5,500. Perhaps by next school year we will get closer to normal (will have preschool costs for younger child, and full-day kindergarten costs for older child. However, we will stop using a nanny, which was about $1,300/month. Student loan COVID relief will expire in September).

Assets:  

- Business checking account: $498,000  

- Personal savings: $80,000. Just transferred $50,000 to Fidelity (savings balance used to be $130,000).  

- Personal checking: $30,000  

- T-Mobile Money checking: I opened an account last Friday, and have scheduled automatic transfers ($3,000 daily limit) from personal savings into this account. Planning to transfer $50,000 from savings.  

- Opened Fidelity brokerage account last Friday, as well. Have already transferred $50,000 from personal savings account (personal savings used to be $130,000).  

Retirement accounts:  

- Former employer Fidelity Roth 403b: $34,000  

- Current employer TIAA Roth 403b: $24,000  

- Current employer TIAA pre-tax 403b contributions by me: $23,000  

- Current employer TIAA pre-tax 403b contributions by employer: $44,000  

- My Fidelity Roth IRA: $17,000  

- Wife's American Funds Roth IRA: $29,000
  

A few odds and ends:  

- We are trying to sell my wife's business, which may only be valued at $400,000 (broker started doing the valuation last week). We purchased the business in 2017 for $650,000.  

- I started maxing out my pre-tax 403b contributions in 2020; will continue doing that from now on. Based on our salaries, I do not believe we are eligible for IRA contributions; as such I have not made an IRA contribution for us since we bought my wife's business in 2017.   

- For my Public Service Loan Forgiveness, I submit annual certification forms. I have 51/120 qualified payments that have been certified, and an additional four more qualified payments have occurred since the last certification.  

- We have Fidelity 529 accounts for our two kids; we make the maximum allowable tax deductible contributions in our state ($4,000, so each child gets $2,000 per year).  

- No car loans, just car insurance.  

I'd appreciate any advice on things I am doing wrong, or things that I should be doing instead. I thought about doing a CD ladder, but the payoff just seemed not worth it. That's when I decided to open the Fidelity brokerage ($50,000) and the T-Mobile Money (slowly transferring the $50,000 balance) checking accounts instead.

personalfinance,Things to do before you die: document your life.,"My father surprised the hell out of everyone a couple weeks ago and passed away suddenly. In dealing with the aftermath, here's some things I recommend:

1. Take care of your health now. No, really. You've got one body. Damage can be cumulative, invisible, and irreversible.

2. Document your life. Accounts, vendors, contact numbers. Bank accounts, retirement accounts, investment accounts. Power, water, utilities. The Netflix password. Monthly services. Insurance policies. Most companies have a process to handle these transitions, but you need to know whom to call. Having a single reference document that has a list of ""this is the stuff in our lives"" is just useful to have. Keep it secure, but have something put together.

3. If you have dependents, have a term life insurance policy. Get a 30 year term policy in your 30s or 40s. My $1M policy is less than $50/month. My wife's is even cheaper at $35. We've had our policies for 5+ years; that same policy now we're in our mid-40s is almost 3x as expensive.

4. Have a will. Have advanced health directives. Let people know how you want your remains handled -- cremation, burial, fed to the birds, whatever. Having as much as possible decided beforehand takes the burden away from people having to make hard decisions at a time when their personal bandwidth may be otherwise occupied. Let people know. *Write things down.* 

5. If you're going to register as an organ donor, someone who works with the Coroner's Office is going to call with a 30 minute questionnaire they need to go through. This call may come in the same day or the next day (as time is of the essence); anyone can answer these questions *to the best of their knowledge*, but be aware it's a Thing. The call can be handed off to someone else -- my mother was not prepared to talk to the nice lady about cutting out my father's eyeballs, but I took the call and got to answer questions about my father's sexual history *to the best of my knowledge*.

6. It is bad security practice, but write down significant passwords (computer, email, phone PIN) and keep them in a safe place. Unless you'd rather keep all that locked down forever, which is also fine as long as you've got Step 2 in place. If you use a password manager, keep the master password somewhere they'll find when you're gone. Or most modern password managers have a dead man's switch. 

Programmers joke about documentation all the time. But at the end of the day, the documentation is there to help the *next* person. If one member handles all the finances and taxes and such, leave enough information so it's easier for those left behind to figure out what the hell is going on -- they're going to be having a hard enough time as is.

If you're all alone, on the plus side you don't have to worry about any of this shit. So you've got that going for you. Which is nice.

Edit: once you've got your basic accounts documented, go to the next level and look into setting up trusts and power of attorney. Add beneficiaries to your accounts. You can do this through the ui really easily at Ally or Vanguard; other vendors should have similar. Look into ""transfer upon death"" stuff for accounts *and properties*. 

Edit: the point of the documentation is so someone knows what you have and whom to call. The passwords are a separate issue: do not go and drain all the accounts post-mortem just because you can log in. Make sure you have someone else's name on a bank account so they can use it to pay bills while everything gets settled and transferred, if it came to it. This can take weeks or months. 

Edit: a really simple cremation and nice metal urn cost us a little under $4k (including 15 Death Certificates). If you ask for a senior discount as a joke they might knock a couple hundred bucks off.

Edit: it might be helpful to pull a free credit report before reporting the death to the SSA (I didn't think to do this until a couple days later, at which point all attempts to pull the CR failed). A detailed report will show lists of accounts, which can be helpful. You might still be able to get a report with a Death Certificate; I'm still figuring this part out.

Edit: removed advice about generating unique passwords because people can't stop letting the perfect be the enemy of better. Yes, it's not the best thing to do. Yes, it's still miles better than a single reused password.",finance

he almost bankrupted his hedge fund in the 2008 financial crisis because his timing was wrong. And no, plenty of people knew there was a bubble, he wasn't the first one.He got lucky at the end. Otherwise, nobody would knew him. There are people out there who had bet against the housing market and got bankrupt and we never hear about them, do we?

Second, he sold his g@mestop positions before it took off. He made profits, but small ones.

Third, he shorted Tesla lol.... we all know how this turned out. just coz it's overvalued doesnt mean you're right. being early = being wrong.

economy,WW3 will break out sooner than later.,"WW3 will break out sooner than later.

My thesis goes: 
USA is a morally decadent and uneducated society, this is evidenced by their undemocratic presidential electorial college system that is now as obsolete as it is increasingly polarising (one colour only vote for each state, resulting in each state becoming like a separate country, polarised along republican Vs democrat lines and very selective hostile even to Americans of the opposite political colour, to preserve their state support for president of their political colour).

The monetary system is run under the premise that two foxes (treasury and FED)  guarding the hen house is better than one. Already, lose moneytary policies caused the 2008 Lehmann brothers crisis (Great Recession) and now they are using the exact same lose moneytary methods just to superficially (temporarily) solve unemployment whilst severely short-changing on national education, healthcare and infrastructure etc;  whilst at same time promoting (medical) cannabis use to make people more 'productive'. Whether this will work or is just the Whitehouse/ Senate playing with fire is yet to be seen but the wealth divide, pain, suffering within American society can only get worse, likewise the rest of present USA allies who are disappointed with USA betrayal through USA denial of global warming concerns. 
More jobless, homeless, uneducated drug addicts without medical insurance in USA merely means more support for populist rebel rousers like Donald Trump and army, navy recruitment etc. Such rebel rouser presidents who are likely to either sponsor proxy war with Russia/China in 3rd countries or else begin a full force thermonuclear war just to fan one's own ego by proving that one dares to press the red button at earliest to launce the nuclear missile before anyone else does.

It is very sad that we humans in our self-absorbed/ centred lifestyles have allowed this very sad state of affairs to happen. Armageddon is very much a human creation.
===================
For one, the USA President ought to be selected by popular vote and not the electoral college system (that is only still relevant for the selection of senators for fair representation in Capitol hill of all states), but for the president not to wage civil war in the half of America which didn't vote his party, USA president's should be selected by the modern popular vote system of exact vote counts, rather than the state overall colour vote system, more reminiscent of the pre 1860s system of communication vz horse back snail mail postage of the state presidential party support status.

And the USA treasury should stimulate the economy by increasing property and other progressive taxes to achieve more social compact and trust within American society and worldwide reputation ( with balanced budgets and also reduced wealth inequality), to make American social compact great, rather than be known as an irresponsible banana republic / pariah country, with a currency not worth the paper on which it is printed (/scamming the world).",finance

So I am looking to get more bang for my buck when it comes to sitting assets that being cash or even cryptocurrencies. Right now bank interest rates are still at an all-time low and I learned that you can now earn rewards for holding certain crypto assets. I have a few crypto accounts, one which quotes their rewards in APY and another which quotes theirs in P.A. For example if I hold a certain cryptocurrency balance I can earn 2.00% APY with one but with another I can earn 12.00%. At a first glance, the 12.00% seems to be the better choice over the 2.00%.

But...

My question:

Are APY and P.A. the same? If not what is the difference?

Thank you",finance

stocks,Weekly Stock Market News | ROKU / TWLO / WMT /PLTR / DE / F &amp; other Stock Market News [02-22],"**The stock market cools of as technology drops after the treasury yields spike. Roku, Deere &amp; Twilio smash earnings expectations while Walmart disappoints. Palantir sells off on mixed results, so let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of last week, as we saw a mixed week for the major indexes with the [Dow](https://imgur.com/VX5S1v3) gained just 0.11% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/1uJLQIX) lost 0.7% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/5ZVNdNg) underperformed losing over 1.5% after the treasury interest rate rose sharply to start the week.

7 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/xiLEGrH) finished the week in the red, while Utilities losing over 2%, while Energy &amp; Financials hugely outperformed.

This stock market movement also pushed the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/uEyhkQu) up over 9% in the past week as it rose over 20 yet again.

[Here](https://imgur.com/kPFpl23) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows a pretty divided picture, with Technology, Communications &amp; Cyclicals losing ground, while the gainers were concentrated in just a couple of sectors.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, with the January core retail [sales](https://imgur.com/IbeU1ck) up almost 6%, with the Producer price [INDEX](https://imgur.com/ZocPeJs) also rose by 1.3%, its largest spike since it started being recorded.

So given this numbers, and what the [FED](https://imgur.com/kpGprlk) leaders have continued to tell us, it‚Äôs very likely we won‚Äôt see a sustained inflation rate of at least 2% in the next year or two, despite this huge numbers coming in on the economic side. It‚Äôs really hard to see how this numbers can continue to come in at such high levels once we move on to a more normal life, even with another round of stimulus checks.

The other beat on the economic numbers came in from the [PMI](https://imgur.com/Hrk5SZQ) composite, which signaled the fastest growth in 6 years while in terms of Jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/sEbFcJ2), we saw a spike in numbers yet again for the week, but the continuing claims manage to drop by more than 50K.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/MUk8Vv2), which showed yet again an increase in bullishness, which is starting to get very dangerous for the stock market as I said in my previous posts. The bullishness is nearing the 50% which we haven‚Äôt seen since after the November elections, so yet again, I would pretty much hold my portfolio right now, not selling but not buying much right now either, as this has worked as a good contrarian indicator in the past.

This [week](https://imgur.com/ZPdkzS5) we get some more economic data, with the leading economic indicators, the consumer confidence index, the jobless numbers and consumer spending, while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/IAIyHIf) front, we are moving towards the end of the earnings seasons with interesting names like Square, Nvidia, Moderna, Etsy, DraftKings &amp; many others reporting this upcoming week.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Ford](https://imgur.com/9X9cqJH) continuing their journey on becoming fully electric by 2030 as they will invest $1B in their production facility from Germany. This news, combined with [GM](https://imgur.com/SGIF2TL) and most other traditional OEM joining more &amp; more the EV sector will continue to add pressure to the hyped stocks like Tesla, Nio, Xpeng &amp; many others. I believe there will be a lot of companies that will benefit from this move, but not all will succeed, so you have to watch out and do your DD on what companies you pick &amp; chose. I think we will see a mixed bag in the future with a couple of hyped stocks like Tesla which just cut the [price](https://imgur.com/tIxgkLk) of the model 3 and Y again &amp; Nio remaining favorites while I expect OEMs to eat up some of the other new entrants.

On the earnings side, we had [Palantir](https://imgur.com/EHDqE9f) reporting a beat on revenues, with the stock selling off pretty steeply after that report, despite an in-line [guidance](https://imgur.com/ExRQ4DD) for the revenue growth of about 30% for 2021, with a big growth rate in the first quarter of the year. It didn‚Äôt help the stock that the lock-up period of 80% of the remaining insider shares also expired, but I think this was an interesting buying opportunity for Palantir if you are looking to hold the company for the long-term, as it already started to recover, rising more than 15% on [Friday](https://imgur.com/TDBDIpw), after the [ARK](https://imgur.com/H8m7HBn) Innovation ETF added over 5M shares.

[Twilio](https://imgur.com/qhbS8Ln) also rose after beating both the top &amp; bottom line and impressed with a guidance well above the consensus, though they followed this with a stock [offering](https://imgur.com/JALCaI5) of over $1.5B which caused somewhat of a small correction after the big pop.

One other stock that also rose after the earnings reports was [ROKU](https://imgur.com/j5gA32i), as the company posted a surprise profit while their revenues increased almost 60% over last year. They also expect an adjusted EBITDA of around 5-10% for 2021, moving the company into profitability finally.

But guys, the biggest beat on expectations by far in my opinion this week came from the industrial giant [Deere](https://imgur.com/qoXEacL), rising to a new record high for the stock as they beat expectations by $1.70 and increased their revenues by over 20% over last year, as they also [guided](https://imgur.com/OgcZT2b) for net income of up to $5B next year, compared to $2.75B in FY2020.

On the other hand, [Walmart](https://imgur.com/E2a8iOr) dropped 6% after reporting a miss on earnings for the 4th quarter while also giving a soft guidance for next year, though they did announce a $20B buyback plan and a raise of the dividend yield. I think the drop might have also been cause by the news they would increase employee wages with at least 12months of history in the company to $15/hours from the current $11/hour, which will affect their earnings in the future.

So yeah folks, let‚Äôs hope for a better week in the stock markets again!

I can't see the future but I can't imagine that were going to need/get another massive stimulus or real inflation (Democrats Manchin and Sinema oppose 15/hr).

I read a comment on seekingalpha that the fed is just changing the ink cartridge in the money printer. I thought that was hilarious, but if the 10yr hits 1.75 or 2, should the fed continue current monetary policy?

The fed has committed to current monetary policy for at least another year. What am I missing with the fear of the 10yr breaking 1.3 and going to 1.5? (I understand the relationship between yields and stocks) if the fed has committed to current rates and inflation still isn't above 2% since most families making &gt;$150,000 are saving more than spending.

stocks,A Due Diligence on $LUMN (Lumen Technologies),"I would like to share with you all what I think about **$LUMN** and why it may and may not be a bet of long-term value in the future. Please feel free to comment anything I may have missed / or falsely claimed. TLDRs will be at the very bottom with my positions.

I will structure this DD by first talking about what Lumen Technologies does and how this is different to what CenturyLink did. (CenturyLink got rebranded to Lumen) I will then include the financials of the company and discuss their most recent quarterly results, finally topping everything off by making an honest list of the potential downside to this investment.

**Disclaimer**: I am not a financial advisor, please do your own research before investing.

**Lumen Technologies** manages one of the world's largest fibre infrastructure that connects the world and powers networks, edge computing, security and collaborative services.

**Adaptive Networking:**

Adaptive Networking is a set of technologies that provide increased network performance, flexibility and security. It is a large and fast growing market valued at $25.8bn in 2019 and expected to grow to $41.8bn by 2024.

To grasp this area, think about a firm, new or old, that wants to increase its virtual connectivity in a post-covid world. This company wants to allow its employees all around US and the world to communicate seamlessly with each other. They want to be able to increase their usage of cloud-based services such as remote working, data storage and easy transmission of operational details among others. They can either set this up by themselves by approaching a plethora of service providers such as lets say, zoom for video calling, aws for cloud stroage etc. Or they could go through Lumen who will provide cloud connectivity, internet and networking, content delivery and will also manage IT services securely so this company doesn't have to.

Why can Lumen do this better than Zoom / Amazon / Google?

\- They operate one of the biggest networks of fibre with over 400,000 miles of networking lines and over 100,000 processing centres, you do not have to go through a third party when you can deal with Lumen directly.

**Collaborative Services:**

They drive productivity, innovation and engagement with reliable and easy-to-use voice, video and contact centre solutions that keep your team in sync and customers connected, regardless of location or device.

What this means is that essentially if you are betting on virtual working to persist, then betting on Lumen will mean betting on them providing faster global connectivity with security. They will be able to provide data-driven analytics of employees productivity and other key metrics. Why choose lumen then you may ask? They have leveraged their technology to do this better than their competitiors:

[https://www.lumen.com/en-hk/resources/infographic/adaptive-networking.html](https://www.lumen.com/en-hk/resources/infographic/adaptive-networking.html)

They average 20% extra operational cost savings, 30% increased application performance, 32% faster configuration changes, and 25% improved security posture.

**Security:**

They base their security on leveraging AI in machine-learnt threat detection. In my honest opinion, I see every company saying they focus majorly on security and protection of customer‚Äôs data, which is true but as outsiders we have no way of validating how true it is. The main question to ask is whether LUMN security services are as good as market standard. To which I say: LUMN is the only company to win the Frost &amp; Sullivan's prestigious 2021 Global New Product Innovation Award for its Holistic Web Protection Solutions. You can read more about this on the link below but the fact that lumen is being recognized and not just stating that their security is good, is a great step in the right direction for their turnaround. At the end of the day, the need for privacy and security will only increase down the line, and a company that is able to tackle such threats is in my opinion well positioned to sustainable growth in the future without having to undergo a completely security update in later years.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lumen-technologies-only-company-win-130500720.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lumen-technologies-only-company-win-130500720.html)

**Why trust Lumen when you hated CenturyLink?**

The company launched a plan in 2019 to reduce operating costs by $800 million to $1 billion by the end of 2021, and in 2020 alone, Lumen reported savings of $830 million, indicating that its efficiency has significantly improved. They are really trying to rebrand themselves and change their entire operational structure. There will always be doubts on this transformation but if they consistently demolish targets like the one mentioned above, one has to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are at least trying. And of course the completely change in the way they are approaching the future of cloud computing and setting up to be one of the leaders to bring 5G to around the world with their massive fibre network.

**Financials:**

1. The market is pricing in a significant decline in corporate earnings for Lumen, and this has created an anomaly that could be exploited by value investors. The stock is trading at a forward earnings multiple of just 7.85, compared to the sector average of 22.27, suggesting the market is very bearish on the company‚Äôs prospects

2. Solid Dividend of around $1 (around 9% yield) annually. This has been reduced from the past years in a bid to save free cash flow to reinvest in strategic involvements.

3. They are still perfecting their technology and this may be a negative point for many value investors given declining revenues. Quoting their conference call 2020 Q4: ""Moving to revenue. For the full year 2020, total revenue declined 3.5% to $20.712 billion."" However, the pace at which revenue is declining is declining itself;, this is a 150 basis point improvement from the 5% year-over-year decline in total revenue from 2018 to 2019. Their revenue is not exploding like other growth stocks but it is heading in the right direction.

4. They have massive transformation costs and this will continue to persist in 2021 too. These amass to around $224 million.

5. I am posting their balance sheet and income statement from the latest quarter and year below with some of my comments. To be honest, they do not have the best financials, but they have been paying off their long term debt this year and have leveraged the lowest Interest Rates to take on marginally cheaper debt. They are tactically averaging down on the interest they have to pay on their debt.

**So what happened in Q4 results and what can we learn from the conference call?**

Firstly, I am going to quote a few things said by their CEO and CFO, please make of this what you want, but these were the things I found exciting / to be careful about.

‚ÄúIn 2020 we added 400,000 homes passed to our fiber-to-the-home footprint. We now reached more than 2.4 million homes and are very excited about the digital customer experience we are providing to our Quantum Fiber brand.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶we do see lengthening sales cycles as companies continue to evaluate their new infrastructure needs.‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst of all, we connect customers in more than 180,000 on net buildings directly to our infrastructure with secured and reliable fibers. We have deep and robust interconnections and peering facilities to the world‚Äôs eyeball networks and ISPs acquiring and distributing traffic to and from millions of endpoints. We have direct fiber connectivity to cloud service providers, hyperscalers and more than 2,200 global data-centers with tremendously scalable capacity.‚Äù

‚Äúwe operate one of the world‚Äôs largest Internet backbones and carry a significant portion of the earth‚Äôs Internet traffic each and every day.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs of today, we have fully enabled edge facilities, covering roughly 60% of U.S. Enterprise locations within 5 milliseconds of latency‚Ä¶by year-end, we expect to have more than 95% of U.S. enterprises within that same latency performance.‚Äù

**Things to get excited about:**

1. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working with a major auto company on their autonomous vehicle program, helping them train their machine learning systems by building an accelerated data access network that decreases data transfer times between the metro areas they‚Äôre testing with their headquarters.‚Äù

Now, EVs require &lt;10ms of latency to be able to achieve optimum success and with self-driving in the works and LIDAR what not, Lumen is positioned at the prime spot. Lumen has tested around US and can provide &lt;5ms latency.

2. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre also working with a financial services company to update their computing architecture to meet exacting specifications for performance with financial counter-parties around the world.‚Äù

If this is successful, other companies will likely choose Lumen to not fall behind on their competition. Monkey see, monkey do.

3. Many other partnerships which you can search up and they will also strategically keep announcing more partnerships as 2021 progresses.

Finally, time to balance the knife and talk about all the bad things

**Bad things to consider:**

1. Macroeconomic challenges faced by the broadband business segment have a lot to do with the 61% share price decline witnessed over the last five years. The good news, however, is that Lumen is now focused on catering to enterprise customers, positioning it as one of the key infrastructure players amid the ongoing rollout of 5G technology.
2. Lumen‚Äôs traditional enterprise and consumer businesses are facing headwinds as technological developments have increased the efficiency of network usage, resulting in reduced demand for the company‚Äôs fiber network. Enterprise businesses account for approximately 75% of the company‚Äôs revenue, but many U.S. companies are increasingly embracing shared networking services, leading to a decline in demand for private networks, which has also weighed on Lumen‚Äôs revenue.
3. In addition, the consumer business segment has come under pressure as the company continues to lose broadband subscribers with speed limits below 20 Mbps, which was one of its primary drivers of earnings in the past.

The good news is that Lumen has reshaped its business model to cater to leading national telecommunication giants such as AT&amp;T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). Due to the extremely high capacity required to roll out 5G technology on a national scale, mobile carriers are depending on fiber networks, and Lumen is monetizing its expansive fiber network by catering to the largest mobile carriers in the United States.

**Some interesting questions asked in the last conference call and their relevance:**

**Q1**: ‚Äú...it sounds like potentially next year there could be a several hundred million dollar impact to free cash flow and you would probably reinvest some CapEx into fiber-to-the-home. So curious, how do you think about your dividend payout ratio beyond this year pro forma some of those initiatives, and whether that changes your capital allocation initiatives at all? And in addition, if you could maybe frame-up the outlook for fiber-to-the-home within your consumer segment, how many homes you think makes sense to build to, and maybe some more color on that would be helpful?‚Äù

**A1**: So if you think about CAF II like I mentioned, we were ‚Äì for last three years, we averaged more than $300 million of capital. The other thing to keep in mind is that we ‚Äì through end of last year, we have enabled about 1.1 million units, and these are really in underserved areas. So we are selling into that and that revenue and penetration is picking up every quarter. So there is also cash coming in from the footprint that we have enabled. So when you look at the puts and takes going into next year of the subsidy, the capital going away, and cash coming from customers in that footprint, when you add it all up, it is not a material impact to our free cash flow. So really doesn't change anything from a capital allocation perspective.

The ubiquity of our fiber, the density of our fiber, the reach, the stand, the quality and the ability to upgrade capacity which we saw in 2020 with COVID is second to none and we'll continue to invest in building that infrastructure. But not only that, we've been able to locate our edge compute nodes with that fiber and with the peering connectivity within 5 milliseconds of the majority of the U.S. enterprises. By the end of the year, we'll be at 95%, 98% of U.S. enterprises and so there is that coupling that nobody else has, nobody else has that ability.

Clarification of confusing term (CAF II): Through CAF II, the FCC provides funding to service providers to subsidize the cost of building new network infrastructure or performing network upgrades to provide services in areas where it is lacking. ([https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/connect-america-fund-phase-ii-faqs#:\~:text=Through%20CAF%20Phase%20II%2C%20the,areas%20where%20it%20is%20lacking](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/connect-america-fund-phase-ii-faqs#:~:text=Through%20CAF%20Phase%20II%2C%20the,areas%20where%20it%20is%20lacking).)

**Q2**: We've got a new administration, a lot of focus on the digital device, there was money set aside for RDOF too. There's other programs being proposed in Congress, infrastructure builds etc. So what are you hearing from your folks in Washington, what sort of opportunities do you think this might present for Lumen? And then, perhaps you could just expand a little bit on the lengthening sales cycle. We're obviously still and the kind of pandemic, what ‚Äì has anything particularly changed over the last month or two I think it's gradually getting better or any color there would be great.

**A2**: I don't really have any particular expectations. I expect something out of Lumen. I expect us to following a disciplined, financially driven logical approach to what we serve and what we don't serve. And as Neel pointed out, we think we have lots of opportunities to put our money to work inside of our existing footprint and outside to some extent. But inside our existing footprint, at better returns than some of the RDOF dollars even with the subsidies. And so, we will follow a very disciplined approach to whatever comes out of Washington.

And we'll work within the footprints that we have to deliver the best service for our customers with the best digital interactions so that they can overcome the digital device and have the best capabilities. And that's one of the things that we think we stand out on is more people work from home and educate from home. We think the symmetrical nature of our fiber footprint is a huge advantage for consumer customer or small business customers.

On the sales, the lengthening of the sales cycles. Is there anything different here? Probably not. That was what we found is people aren't resolving what is this post pandemic world look like yet, because we're not in a post-pandemic world, we're still in the middle of it.

And so, I think that it is not terribly that much different. But we thought it would be getting better by this point.

**Current Competitors: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast**

If this garners enough interest, I can provide a competitive analysis of their biggest competitors and also an analysis of their margins and where there might be room for improvement that we should see in 2021.

**TLDR**: Lumen Technologies operates one of the biggest networks of fibre networks across the globe through which they can leverage cloud-based services and 5G. They have completely transformed from CenturyLink with visible improvements and if you are betting heavily on an increasing importance paid by the US on remote working, cloud computing, and faster internet speeds then buy $LUMN with a long term hold.

And of course I cannot forget the obligatory rockets üöÄüöÄ

Inverted yield curves are unusual since longer-term debt should carry greater risk and higher interest rates, so when they occur there are implications for consumers and investors alike. An inverted Treasury yield curve is one of the most reliable leading indicators of an impending recession

2. Who pays the interest?  I‚Äôm at about $30/day of interest so $210 so far. It was stupid to close over the weekend, especially a bank holiday.

I told the lender I wanted to close after TRID, but they changed the closing disclosure so we needed to wait another 3 days. I found this out at the closing table and I was not going to send the notary away and incur the $200 loss from their time.

personalfinance,Variable commission and W4,"Hi,

I‚Äôm hoping someone in a similar position can advise me on this. I get a base salary and also commission. First check of the month is strictly base salary. Second check is base plus commission all in one. So taxes are p visually more on 2nd check. Currently, spouse has W4 as married filing jointly and mine is the same with $300 extra per paycheck. I make roughly double what my spouse makes. If I use the IRS withholding calculator, it wants my last check federal withholding. If I use the base only check amount then it says I‚Äôm going to owe. If I use the check with commission amount then I‚Äôm overpaying. I tried splitting the difference in taxes taken out of each check and I‚Äôm still over withholding but not as much. 

Since my commission varies I guesstimated to get the average for the month for the calculator. What do you all do for your W4 that are in a similar situation. I‚Äôm going to reduce my ‚Äúextra‚Äù withholding but I‚Äôm not sure how much I should do. Help?!?  If you need actual figure please let me know.",finance

investing,$STMP Dropped 25% after crushing all earnings estimates and Declining to offer guidance. The Bullish case for Stamps.com.,"Fundamentals and global trends would point to a bullish outlook for STMP, but after declining to give guidance in their recent earnings call (citing uncertainty caused by covid) STMP dropped ~25% ($70/share).

With the recent dip, continued increase in ecommerce package volume, and Stamps.com‚Äôs international expansion, STMP is poised to be a good play in Q1 and going forward.



**This is post is not financial advice.**

**Background**

Firstly, no, Stamps.com doesn‚Äôt sell stamps. They are a SaaS company that offers a variety of shipping, mailing, and tracking solutions for small to enterprise level businesses. Despite its awful name, Stamps.com is a large player in ecommerce. Chances are, if you have shopped online, then you have received a package sent via Stamps.com. Over 40% of all First-Class packages and 33% of Priority Mail packages sent in the US use postage purchased with a Stamps.com software. In the past two years, they also signed a deal strengthening their partnership with UPS and acquired key European/Asian player, MetaPack.


**Recent Performance**

* 2020 was the best year to date, capped off by Q4 crushing earnings estimates
* Total revenue was $206.0 million, up 28% compared to $160.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.

* GAAP net income was $46.5 million, up 129% compared to $20.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
* Still has an awful name.

**Effects of COVID-19 on STMP in 2020**

In last week‚Äôs earnings call the Stamps.com CEO stated:
&gt;  COVID-19 continues to have a significant positive impact on our business with significant growth in both customers and shipping volume. U.S. e-commerce activity remained elevated throughout the fourth quarter and we benefited from that. 

He later when on to say:

&gt;  The growth in revenue in the fourth quarter and for the year was primarily driven by strong shipping growth attributable to the shift to online e-commerce purchasing that has been driven by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

So, from these statements, it‚Äôs pretty clear that Stamps.com‚Äôs leadership believes that their business befits from consumers‚Äô increased inclination to shop online during the Covid pandemic...

**Q1 Guidance from Stamps.com (or lack thereof)**

...but contrary to the statements above, they went on to cite Covid as a source of uncertainty. Despite being halfway through Q1, and continued YoY growth for ecommerce activity throughout the US, Stamps.com did not provide guidance for Q1. Instead, they stated:
&gt;  ‚Ä¶as we look forward to 2021, the myriad of factors that are beyond our control, and the resulting effects that those factors could have on our business are very difficult to accurately forecast.
&gt; These factors include as; global macroeconomic risks, associated with the ongoing pandemic; timing and degree of moderation, in Safer at Home restrictions; the shift back to an office-based working environment; and the overall changes those things could have on global e-commerce.

**Covid Uncertainty doesn‚Äôt really apply to Q1**

It‚Äôs hard to imagine a scenario where Covid doesn‚Äôt have a net positive impact on Stamps.com in Q1. The rest of 2021 may be hard to predict for ecommerce, but Q1 is almost halfway over, and baring an ~80% slowdown for the next month, there will likely be a YoY increase in package volume. Beyond Q1, it will be interesting to see just how much shoppers will stick with their increased propensity to shop online.

**Future expansion**

Stamps.com has acquired Endicia, ShipStation, ShipEngine, ShippingEasy, ShipWorks, and MetaPack. Though Stamps.com initially started with an exclusive USPS partnership, these acquisitions have opened the door for partnerships with private (UPS, FedEx) and international (Canada Post, Royal Mail, etc.) package carriers. In 2021 Stamps.com expects a 20% increase in operating costs, primarily as a result of increasing headcount and working to develop international business. Stamps.com has only gotten their toes wet in the international market (MetaPack being a huge key to this market), and with their track record, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if their international business eventually surpassed domestic business.

**Stock Buybacks and Neutral Outlooks**

In the past, the tin foil hat-wearing redditors among us have accused Stamps.com of offering neutral guidance in an attempt to lower share price just before large buybacks. I don't usually bust out my aluminum fedora, but I'll just leave these bullet points here below.

* 2020 was the biggest year for STMP by far
* Q4 crushed earnings estimates
* Q1 2021 was halfway over by the time of the 2020 earnings call
* Despite more uncertainty in 2020 than Q1 2021 they provided guidance for all 4 quarters last year
* Share price dropped ~$70 as a result of no guidance

* $60M in stock repurchases were approved through the summer 

**TLDR;**
This is a good stock. Lack of guidance caused a sell-off. This is still a good stock. Stamps.com has a terrible name.",finance
personalfinance,"IRA question: stick with credit union certificate, or do something else?","Hey everyone!

I'm a freelancer (in video production) and am trying to figure out the best next steps for a few personal finance things.

A couple notes...

I'm 28, roughly 95k in my ""business account"" (I have a business account and a personal account with two different banks, and I pay myself from business--&gt;personal via check). Saving up for a house down payment + wedding in the near future.

I started a traditional IRA three years ago, and made the max contribution each time, so there's a little over 18k in there now. I bank with Navy Federal Credit Union, right now all of that IRA is in an ""IRA certificate"" with them, at 3.6% over 40 months. It matures in mid 2022.

So‚Äîmy main question: when I make my next contribution, should I put it in this same IRA account? Or are there better options out there? What should I do when the NFCU certificate matures, in either scenario?

To be honest, when I started my IRA, I knew very little about personal finance and was just getting started with research. There are so many options for IRA's, I'm a little unsure about the best way forward.

Any advice is much appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Investing for wealth growth if I might want to use the money within 10 years?,"I'm 22, just graduated college, starting my first job as an engineer with the US federal government in a few months. Starting salary is $50k, will increase to around $80k in a couple years. No debt, no student loans. I've managed to save $15k throughout college; $10k of it is in a Vanguard target date 2055 retirement fund in a Vanguard brokerage account (not tax advantaged). I auto-invest 15% of the income from my scholarship into this account every month.

Now, the complication: I really love to travel. In college I studied/interned abroad as often as I could, and used my school holidays to travel as well. I spent most of 2020 living out of my car exploring the US since my classes were online. I've done a couple 3+ month trips and only came home because of other responsibilities. So, I have a 3.5 year contract with my new job and then after that I'd like to take at least a year off to travel the world. 

My primary retirement savings vehicle will most likely be the thrift savings plan (US federal govt equivalent of 401(k)). When I start my job, I'll start contributing ~15% of my income to the TSP every month rather than my Vanguard brokerage account. 

But besides funding retirement, I also want to save a significant amount of money to fund some long-term traveling in the near future (5-10 years from now). And even if I decide later that I don't wanna use it for traveling, letting my money grow without it being locked away until my 60s would be nice. I don't like the idea that I'm being frugal now just so I can enjoy my money as an old man - I wanna use that money sooner damn it.

So I guess since I want to use that money before retirement age, it can't really go into an IRA right? In that case, after contributing 15% to my TSP for retirement, should I just put an some additional money (maybe 15-20%) into my existing Vanguard brokerage account as a long-term travel and ""money appreciating that I get to use before my 60s"" fund? That way the money can grow in the stock market and I can pull it out when I see fit (unlike an IRA to some degree), but I do lose the tax advantage.

So my money breakdown is:

* 6+ month emergency fund

* Retirement savings: ~15% of income into thrift savings plan.

* Other savings: 15-20% of income into non-tax-advantaged brokerage account.

Any problems with this plan? Am I better off putting it all into an IRA and taking the early withdrawal penalty when I want to use the money later to travel/etc? Or on the other extreme, am I better off just keeping it in cash if it's gonna be used within 5-10 years?",finance

The SEC is stating the law has to change which isn't for the courts to decide but rather the legislature. Federal Judge Analisa Torres doesn't seem to be buying the SEC position. Therefore, the SEC lawyers changed tactics and it seems that they want to request the motions to dismiss ( brought on by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and former CEO Chris Larsen) to be set aside in order for discoveries to be done for the case. So, the big gamble here is whether or not Judge Analisa Torres will allow the lawyers for the SEC to have discoveries or not.  As the merits of the case at best are weak. Knowing this judge, discoveries might be allowed just to show fairness for both sides before ruling.

personalfinance,"Tax Help: Income in 2 states, W-2 with a Gross Up from relocation, Filing independent for the first time- I'm not sure where to start","Hi,

I'm trying to file my 2020 taxes and am pretty lost. I'm a college student and in 2020 I worked 2 jobs; one was part time in my state of residence (Georgia) and the other was a 3 month internship in Michigan. The company I interned with paid for the cost to fly out and for my housing while I was there; the travel cost was reflected in my first and last paychecks but the housing wasn't shown in my paystubs at all. A couple months after I finished I got an email notification that I was receiving a gross up to 'report my housing as imputed income and cover the tax liability on my behalf'. I don't really know what this means, it sounds good but I don't know how it changes how I file moving forward. I was expecting my W-2 to say my income was around $8k, in accordance with my paychecks, but it says $24k. If I'm understanding correctly, the gross up added the housing costs retroactively to my salary, and I now owe taxes on the extra 12k since those taxes were never taken out of my paychecks like the taxes from my original $8k salary were. Is this correct? Before this I was expecting I'd be filing for a refund, not to give an additional payment, and I'm not sure how to go about it.

I'm also concerned about how filing works with two states. Should I file 3 separate times, once federally and two more times for each of the respective states and their W-2s? Or should I try filing Georgia and federal in one set since that's where I permanently live? I've gotten an 1099 from my bank account; is that counted with federal filing or state?

The last time I had a job where I made enough to make it worth filing for a refund was 2017. I filed as a dependent through TurboTax's free version, though I suspect I did it wrong as I only ever got a state refund back and no federal one. This year my mom was advised by her accountant that because I planned on filing she shouldn't claim me and I should file as an independent. My parents are divorced; my mom pays my insurance and phone bill. I've been relying on a 529 account overseen by my dad to pay for rent and tuition; he makes the withdraws to his account then transfers them to me to pay those bills. I am not sure how, or if, I should account for these when filing.

I feel rather confused and nervous about the whole process; please, any advice or suggestions you can give would be very much appreciated.",finance

6 YEARS AGO 

Back when Bitcoin was hitting just past 200 USD/BTC, I was a white-collar contractor working as a Financial Intelligence Analyst. Think regular Intelligence Analyst, but geared towards Money Laundering, etc.

We had a training seminar from a Federal Agent from (Insert name of 3-letter Law Enforcement Agency here) and they were talking about Bitcoin and how cartels and other criminals were using it due to the anonymity that it came with.

""Its worthless"" he said, citing that the Federal Government was working to ""kill it with regulation"" in order to disrupt the criminal money laundering pipelines. ""It will be dead by the end of the year.""

Afterwards, I sat at my cubicle, chatting with my cubicle mates. ""Hey guys, I am thinking...of just popping in a few hundred...just to see what happens.""

They instantly scoffed at me. ""Didn't you hear him? It will be dead by the end of the year.""

""It will die with regulation""

""its worthless""

\---

On December 14, 2018, Bitcoin was worth roughly (according to Robinhood) $3,199.00 USD.

On February 19th, 2021, 2 years and 1 month later, it crossed the threshold of roughly 57,000 USD. That is a difference of over 53,000 USD!

To the skeptics: I bet you are asking why this is relevant in a Dogecoin forum. My point is: weirder things have happened. It worked for BITCOIN, why wouldn't it work for Dogecoin?

To those that say ""I hope Dogecoin reaches 5 USD, then I will be rich"": Ok, if that works for you, great. But why settle for 5 USD? Why not settle for 1,000 USD? 5,000 USD? TEN THOUSAND USD/DGC!? THINK BIG!!!

&amp;#x200B;

What the main topic of this is, is there any major downsides for DEFI? For me, I'm seeing some rates (FOR USDT / USDC) for upwards of even 10+ percent. Which, to me seems absolutely worth it to invest at least my emergency fund and casual money not in the crypto/stock market into. Anything over say like 4 percent on something like that would be astronomical in the normal financial sense. Is there a big catch? What's the potential downsides on DEFI?

CryptoCurrency,Optimum rate of compounding,"tl;dr: don't compound too often relative to the cost of network fees  
With PancakeSwap blowing up, people (especially those dipping a toe in pools for the first time) might be wondering how often to compound. PancakeSwap reports an expected APR at current rates, along with expected rates of return after 1 day, week, month, and year. It's important to realize these quoted rates assume daily compounding but do not consider the fees associated with each instance of compounding!  


Your optimum rate of compounding will depend on your principal. **The daily compounding assumed in the quoted rates will actually net you a negative return if the amount of interest amassed in a single day is less than the cost of compounding in network fees!** In general, over some period of time T with compounding fees f, we don't want to compound a principal P some number of times n **unless** the effective interest rate \[ (interest generated - fees) / principal \] at each compounding is large enough that we net a larger return than simple interest (with rate r) over that period of time.  


We can approximate this crossover point as follows:  
\- simple interest yields a final principal P \* (1+r).  
\- the effective interest rate when compounding n times is approximately r\_eff = (r / n) - (f / P).  


So if P\*(1+r) is larger than P\*(1+r\_eff)\^n, we're compounding too much (n is too big) and vice versa. In general, there will be an optimum choice of n which we can find by solving for the n yielding the largest value of (1+r\_eff)\^n.  


Note this is an approximation (in fact, the exact final principal with fees is P (1+r/n)\^n - (n f / r) \[ (1+r/n)\^n - 1\], for those who are interested) and there's room here for other models of compounding (e.g. you don't have to compound at regular intervals.)

Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of experience with personal finance. I have always been a bit laissez fair with my finances, since I'm not a big spender and have an intuitive understanding of how much money I can spend, I have managed to accrue and maintain a healthy amount of money in my bank account for my age working a summer job as a laborer at a construction company over the years, plus the two years as a manager. Below are roughly my current finances and bills (food and gas not included).

Bank account total: $25,700
Rent: $220/mo
Internet + electricity: $165/mo
Car payment + insurance: $375/mo
(Thankfully, my amazing mom has helped me out by paying for my phone and health insurance! Love you mom, thank you!)

Now that I'm out of college, out of a job during covid-19, and worrying about my future, it's time to take a harder look at my future and finances. I wish to prepare and plan ahead, but I don't know where to start. My mom says she'd be willing to help me out  financially, but I feel that she's already helped me enough, and I don't want to be a further burden on her. It's time I grew up and took this responsibility myself, because I feel that I need to do this on my own. 

I've got enough saved to live off of for a number of months, but I don't like having to dip into my money without an income, especially since I'm not in school anymore. I've begun applying for managerial/leadership roles at various retail companies and I'm lucky enough to have a very good referral from a friend for a retail team leader position that would pay me $17/hr (everything else pays far less). However, it's not guaranteed I'll be hired, and once my loans become due I know I'll be running at a net loss every month because it won't be enough to cover my monthly living expenses and loan payments. 

So what should I do to get my finances under control? How should I prepare to best set myself up for the future once my loans come due? How much should I budget for myself? Should I invest at all? Should I set up a Roth IRA? I'm honestly a little clueless where to even begin and I would love to hear your guys advice.

Thank you for reading my essay, I know it was long haha! I look forward to hearing from any of you, and I hope it's not too much trouble to respond. Thank you in advance!",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, February 22, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, February 22, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed as rising Treasury yields and expectations of higher inflation weighed on equity prices. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day modestly green while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back steeply. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst performance in more than a month.

Prospects of rising inflation following the coronavirus pandemic have pushed bond prices lower while pushing Treasury yields sharply higher. .The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly ticked above 1.39% on Monday to reach a fresh one-year high. Higher Treasury yields lead banks to place higher on loans in order to offset the effect of inflation. With so much money being pumped into the economy this year, many analysts have warned about rising inflation rates in the post-pandemic economy. However, despite the abrupt spike, Treasury yields remain at historically low levels. Now is not the time to panic, several fundamental factors, such as favorable fiscal and monetary policy and growing corporate earnings, remain in place to support a post-pandemic bull market. Below is a chart of the 10-year Treasury Yield rate made by Bloombergüì∑

The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S. has so far seen just under 64.2 million doses administered to Americans as of Monday morning, according to an update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, 75.3 million doses have so far been delivered to states, inclusive of both Moderna's and Pfizer's and BioNTech's vaccines. Last week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago according to data analyzed by the New York Times. The drop in cases is staggering given that on January 8, the US recorded more than 300,000 new cases. 

**Highlights**

* A lot of popular EV stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Nio (NIO), Plug Power (PLUG) and many others have been pulling back sharply in recent days. Remember Psychos, many of these stocks were overvalued 1-2 weeks ago, pullbacks like this represent an opportunity.
* After reaching an impressive high of $58,000, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back around 10% today.
* The dollar slid against major currencies, slumping to multi-year lows against the British pound and the Australian dollar, another sign of rising fears of inflation
* Australia will not alter legislation that would make Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google pay news outlets for content, a senior lawmaker said on Monday, as Canberra neared a final vote on whether to pass the bill into law. Remember, as of now, Facebook (FB) is not showing any news to its users in Australia.
* China‚Äôs bank regulator on Saturday tightened requirements on the internet loan business of commercial banks, amid heightened scrutiny of online lending by internet giants such as Ant Group, the finance arm of Alibaba Group.
* Albermarle (ALB) target raised by Argus from $140 to $177 at Buy. Stock currently around $156. We like this stock, one of the largest publicly traded lithium miners.
* Baidu (BIDU) target raised by Barclays from $350 to $400 at Overweight. Stock currently around $340

personalfinance,Confused about locking mortgage rate,"I started my mortgage loan process with us bank and their initial quote was 2.625 APR with 3300$ lender credit. I was happy with those numbers and started the process without locking the rate.

Once process started(2 days after quote received date), interest rate jumped to 2.75 and today it is 2.85 APR.

My closing date is 03/12 and my loan officer says, let's see if  rates go down. I am kind of confused and regret for not closing the rate. 

Loan officer says, we have to lock the rate 10 days before the closing date. That means, I have upto March 1st to see if rates go down, if rates don't go down, just accept whatever the rate on March 1.

investing,The Inflation Debate: What do you think?,"I want to know what you all think about the inflation debate.¬† IMO this topic is important because inflation could be the end of the easy monetary policy that's driven equities.


__Assumptions/background__

* Prices are going to increase.¬† It's hard to come up with a more perfect scenario for a price pop .... Loose fiscal and monetary policy, high savings, pent up demand, fragile supply systems and relaxing of market/COVID shutdowns.

* The Fed agrees, but think the price pop will be short lived.¬† It will be reflation and will build things back to pre-Covid levels or better (inflation was low even pre COVID)

* Some economists disagree (e.g. Summers).¬†


__Question:__

* What do you think the price pop will look like?
* How will the price pop impact the market?
* How do you plan to change your portfolio, if at all.


__My take:__

The price pop will be much larger than people expect.¬† In particular, I think a weakened supply chain will be the culprit... Already seeing chip shortage ... Just-in-time supplying is slow to restart/deal with demand spikes.¬† Weak supply chains are very problematic, inputs are not just more expensive, in some cases they're simply not available (price of infinity).¬† This coupled with strong demand will cause prices to sky rocket short-term (1-2 years).¬† At which point, I see the market freaking (even if Fed keeps narrative) and high valuation stocks correcting.¬†¬†

I'm diversifying away from high valuation stocks and toward cheap quality.¬† The party isn't over, but it's end is insight.",finance

personalfinance,Effect of Heloc on credit score.,"I am pissed. I went to refinance a mortgage on a rental property and I find out my credit score is 743. Never been late never defaulted etc. Here is the situation: main home value 500K first mortgage 80k heloc 103K (pretty much the limit,) rental one value 400K old interest only loc 118K (the limit,) rental 2 value 500K (but rural) mortage 100k (old adjustable,) rental 3 (want to refi,) value 500K 193K 30 year fixed 5.6%. All loans are seasoned, youngest is the one I want to refi at 6 years old others are 15-25 years. No other debt.

I am guessing what is messing me up are the loc's which from my point is bullshit as they have tiny interest rates, are tax favored and if I pull money out of my investment account to pay them off I will literally be losing money. I cannot stand that Equifax etc. won't just tell you what they want to see so we are left groping around in the dark guessing what to do to make our score better. Sorry for rant.

Does anyone have an informed opinion about the best way to throw money at this situation to get a score I deserve? I was thinking of putting 20k each to the 2 credit lines but I don't want to do that if it makes no difference. I could pay one of them off but again.....

The China card. The USA cannot let China accumulate too many Bitcoins. But at the same time, the FED cannot do it openly otherwise, it would be a complete stampede.

If you have the chance to listen to Saylor podcasts, please do.

I have listened to many. He keeps saying. Never sell Bitcoin for X and Y reason. 

If you are reading between the lines, his message is : you better not sell because I know things you do not. But I can't lay out the details under the sun. Most Americans listening to him will increase the Bitcoin wealth of the country for the future.

personalfinance,2021 Federal Tax Liability Math,"Hello,  I just started a new job with a large pay increase, and was frustrated  with how little extra I made compared to my old job. I looked at my pay  statements, looked at the 2021 Federal Tax Brackets, did some math, and  it looks like I am overpaying and would receive a large tax refund.  I  also went to the [IRS Tax Withholding Estimator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator), which shows that I am overpaying as well.  I got my 2021 tax bracket info from [www.irs.com](https://www.irs.com/articles/2021-federal-income-tax-rates-brackets-standard-deduction-amounts/)  which is not technically the official IRS website. My solution was to  go online to my tax info with my job and enter $4000.00 in the ""claim  dependents"" section to get less taken out per paycheck. By my math, I  should still get a return.

I just  wanted to post here to see if I made some kind of obvious, moronic  mistake in my math and need to go back and change my W-4 before its too  late.

personalfinance,Considering a home in high COL market,"So my fianc√©e and I are considering purchasing a condo as first time owners. Our combined salaries are \~160k annually. We are in LA county and houses are basically out of the question as they are 700k+ in a good neighborhood, or so far from work as to make it a miserable commute. I had to commute a little over an hour each way during lockdown and while that was barely manageable, when traffic made it 1.5-2 hrs driving home that was unacceptable. What's the point of having a house if you never see the people you care about?

So we are looking at condos. In decent neighborhoods they seem to run 450-550 though I suspect we may find something as low as 400k.

Current assets (took a hit as I was unemployed for a while due to covid):

401k \~37k well behind here, but will work to get back on track, I goofed around in my 20s, now 32

Cash \~22k, 2.5 stays in checking the rest is savings/Emergency, savings rate 1k per month for now while debt is paid off

Liabilities:

Auto loan 5.5k left, should be paid off soon, nominal 2% APR

Credit 9k, should also be paid off soon, promo 0% interest

So what should we work on in the next 6 months to make buying a home a reality. I am honestly tired of paying 2k rent for a one bed/one bath apartment. It would be much more effective to direct those funds towards real estate, right?

investing,VRNOF: High-Quality Way to Play US Cannabis (2-3.5x Return),"For a long time, folks covering the US MSO industry have been talking about the Big 4 ($GTBIF, $CURLF, $CRLBF, and $TCNNF), but its time we started talking about the Big 5 with the newest addition being Verano Holdings ($VRNOF) which went public last Wednesday. Below is my investment thesis on $VRNOF.

**TL;dr: The stock is a high-quality way to play the coming US cannabis wave and could be a 2-3.5x over the next year. I believe this will be a stock that institutions will gravitate towards. The US MSOs will be the most direct beneficiaries of growing cannabis consumption, and $VRNOF has one of the best management teams, several growth drivers, best-in-class margin profile, and trades at a discount to its Big 4 peers. The company went public last week and is still under-the-radar.**

*Note: the company is listed in Canada under $VRNO and is available over-the-counter under $VRNOF.*

Current Price / Market Cap: $24.44 / $7.1Bn

**Thesis**

* Cannabis is a $80-100Bn consumer staple category but only $20Bn are legal sales. The rest of the market is illicit. In addition to seeing the overall industry grow, the US operators should see a strong tailwind from illicit sales converting to legal sales
* Attractive 14-state footprint
   * Core markets of IL, FL, MD, AZ, NJ, and PA are large and projected to grow above the industry average rate over the next 2-3 years
      * IL one of the best adult-use states in the US
      * AZ just started adult use sales at the beginning of 2021 and is poised to see significant growth
      * NJ just approved adult use sales; recreational sales likely to start in early 2022 but could be sooner
      * FL, PA, and MD could enact adult-use legislation in the next 2-3 years
   * Near-term development markets (2021+): MA, NV, OH, MI, AR
   * Longer-term development markets (2022+): WV, CA, MO
* Strong financial profile makes $VRNOF a top 3 MSO
   * 40%+ EBITDA margins currently places it #3 behind $TCNNF and $AYRWF; potential for $VRNOF to become #2 in 2021
   * Expected 2021 EBITDA of $350MM likely places it #2/3 amongst all MSOs (excluding any new M&amp;A)
   * Anticipate tuck-in acquisitions in core markets that would provide upside to these numbers, namely AZ (dispensaries) and PA (dispensaries and cultivation)
   * No debt; has issued equity sparingly
* Strong management with significant insider ownership
   * Conversations with folks in the industry suggest $VRNOF is one of the best, if not the best, operator in the industry (as evidenced by the large EBITDA margins on a broad footprint)
   * Total insider ownership: 20%+
   * CEO (George Archos) ownership: \~19%
* Several industry catalysts including:
   * Federal decriminalization of cannabis
   * Banking bill would allow cannabis businesses to access the banking system, reduce their cost of capital, improve their margin profiles, make customer transactions more seamless, and allow $VRNOF to list on a major exchange
   * Adult use legalization in PA, FL, OH
* $VRNOF trading at a 25% discount to other large, diversified MSO peers ($GTBIF/$CURLF/$CRLBF)
   * $VRNOF trading at 14.5x 2022 EBITDA vs. $GTBIF (21.1x)/$CURLF (19.1x)/$CRLBF (18x)
* Pre-public private round was 5x oversubscribed with largely institutional participation. Demonstrates institutional interest in the company.

**What is the stock worth?**

* Amongst the Big 4, $GTBIF is $VRNOF's best comp. The companies have diversified footprints in limited-license states and the CEOs of both companies are regarded as amongst the best in the industry. $GTBIF trades at 21x 2022 EBITDA vs. $VRNOF at $14.5x. If $VRNOF trades in-line with $GTBIF, the stock could see 45% upside‚Ä¶
* ...but what would you pay for a high-growth consumer staple business growing 40%+ organically with 40%+ EBITDA margins? 30x EBITDA ($50 target price - 2x upside)? 40x ($67)? 50x ($83 - 3.5x upside)? I believe the stock (and group) will re-rate higher as we get positive news throughout 2021 around state legalization plans, earnings, and potentially federal action
* How does the valuation gap close? Now that the company is public, I expect it to increase its profile and share its story through attending conferences, speaking to investors, etc. I also anticipate we will see research firms initiate coverage on the stock over the next 3-6 months. Continued execution will also be a driver.

**Risks**

* Execution missteps
* Regulatory changes that restrict cannabis sales and/or how cannabis can be sold (industry risk)
* Broader market/macro risk",finance

In December 2019, [Canopy Growth Announces David Klein as New Chief Executive Officer](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canopy-growth-announces-david-klein-as-new-chief-executive-officer-300971074.html). 

&gt;David brings a wealth of expertise to this role, having served in a number of senior leadership capacities over the past 14 years at Constellation Brands. His capabilities include extensive CPG and beverage alcohol industry experience, strong financial orientation, and experience operating in highly regulated markets in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe. David is an experienced strategist with a deep understanding of how to build enduring consumer brands while leveraging operational scale across a dispersed production footprint. He is a strong leader with a proven track record of developing diverse and high performing teams.

In a recent interview, David Klien said *‚ÄúIt's past time that cannabis was legalized in the U.S. We're quite encouraged by Senators Booker, Wyden, and Schumer beginning to talk about making cannabis part of their overall criminal justice reform work that they would prioritize during this Senate,""* - and Canopy Growth has consistently maintained it only needs federal permissibility to launch its U.S. plans.

**Acreage/US Legalization**

In April 2019, Canopy Growth [Announced Plan to Acquire Leading U.S. Multi-State Cannabis Operator, Acreage Holdings](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canopy-growth-announces-plan-to-acquire-leading-us-multi-state-cannabis-operator-acreage-holdings-300834628.html)

[Acreage Holdings ](https://www.acreageholdings.com/about-us/) cemented its place as an industry game-changer during this period. Board appointments from across the political and commercial spectrum helped legitimize cannabis among investors and regulators. Press coverage of the broadcast TV rejection of our ‚ÄúTime Is Now‚Äù Super Bowl PSA, which called for further cannabis reform, reached billions. We began rolling out our house of brands, including consumer brands like The Botanist and Live Resin Project, both of which took home honors at the Emerald Cup, the premier product competition in cannabis. And we entered an arrangement with Canopy Growth Corporation, setting the stage for a combined global cannabis powerhouse once it‚Äôs federally permissible for Canopy to acquire our company

The new ‚Äî and complicated ‚Äî agreement, which would allow Canopy to buy Acreage once pot is federally legalized in the U.S., follows broader efforts by both companies and North American's legal marijuana industry to cut costs and shrink their footprint.

&gt;Canopy CEO David Klein said the move ""reflects Canopy Growth's commitment to focusing our efforts on the United States as one of our three core markets. Acreage continues to be Canopy's main point of entry into the largest THC marketplace in the world when federally permissible.""

Under the new deal, Canopy would not have to buy as much of Acreage. It would be obligated to buy only 70% of Acreage whenever the U.S. legalized cannabis, Acreage said.

Fixed Acreage shares will be exchanged for 0.3048 shares of Canopy, down from 0.5818 previously. Canopy Growth has the option to buy the floating shares for a price of at least $6.41. Shareholders also get a $37.5 million one-time payment. Canopy will also loan up to $100 million to a subsidiary of Acreage.

I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8ogt7/the_green_rush_weedstocks_us_legalization/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) in regards to my bullish stance on US Legalization &amp;amp; and the oppotunities ahead. Imo, Canopy Growth (along with top Cannadian LPs/MSOs) will be first in line to benefit.

1) Can you please describe the relationship with Canopy?  CGC's investor presentation has TerrAscend as a key pillar to their US strategy yet I believe they own or will own less than 30%...Sounds to me that Canopy will want to acquire a controlling interest as soon as legally permitted?  Is that accurate?

&gt;Canopy owns about 20% of the company on an as converted basis. We have a great relationship and were flattered that they highlight TerrAscend as a key pillar. In terms of whether they want to acquire controlling interest in the company, you'd have to ask them. 

2) too add on to this.. Like mentioned above, TER is a key pillar to Canopy‚Äôs US strategy, but does that fit both sides of the coin?

&gt;Yes, the relationship is mutually beneficial. We talk to them regularly. They have alot of great insight and are generous with their time and resources. For example: Their advice has been very helpful as it relates to our buildout in New Jersey.

personalfinance,"UPDATE: On ""Money disappearing from bank account""","I posted [this](https://redd.it/lpedc9) yesterday evening and received several good responses from some very patient and kind people.

I called my credit union today and found out that my HOA fees had each been processing three times; or it was three transactions, but I didn't recognize that since I'm kind of an idiot.  Where I was expecting a $266 charge, I was getting $798 worth of withdrawal.  The HOA company changed several months ago, which was when the problem started since my payments are on autopay and it somehow got setup three times.  I talked with the HOA management company and they are fixing the problem with me getting charged multiple times monthly.

My budget is still a mess, but at least I now can account for where my money is going.  I also figured out I eat more than I thought I did -- maybe I should go on a diet.  Budgeting will be easier with an extra $530 every month that's not being taken from me.

My comments involving tax brackets were downvoted so I googled how marginal taxes work.  I sort of understand however I still can't explain why my paychecks got much smaller once I started making more other than that the ""Federal Withholding"" section grew substantially.",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin is the future against the rapidly declining USD (and other declining world currencies).,"Markets continue to whipsaw, but a month into the Biden administration gives me reason to walk cautiously moving forward. This is not financial advice, this is just my opinion. 

Historically, we generally see a market cool-down between mid-February and mid-March, after Christmas consumerism wears off and reality sets in. Last year was a 30% correction, with a quick v-shaped recovery, in roughly the same time period. 

This year is different, though, and I don't like the feeling of it. Oil futures are steadily rising, for no reason other than the erosion of U.S. energy independence. Interest rates are rising, with progressively worsening economic data and no sign of recovery, that's an odd stance for fiscal policy. IMO, every world government and global investor is betting against the U.S. economy... and, for good reason. Dollars are being printed like party invites and inflation is on a quick rise, despite almost no media coverage. 

This over-euphoric bull run, into over a year of lockdowns and restrictions, is well overdue for a harsh correction. The economics are, have been, diverging from fiscal reality, for some time now.

Moving forward, I will be selling off large swaths of my 401k on significant pops, relative to my share-price average. When I feel that is satisfied, I will be taking out a significant loan against my retirement savings, to pay off my higher-interest debt (while interest rates are still historically low) and reallocating cash savings to Bitcoin. The inflationary divergence of the decline of the U.S. dollar, teemed with the finite, deflationary nature of Bitcoin (as well as it's versatility to be included as both an asset and payment method), and the adoption by Fortune 500 (and more) companies, will only serve to catapult Bitcoin's worth. 

My 401k won't let me (and I don't know of any that will.) invest in Bitcoin, so I found a way that I think long-term Bitcoin appreciation value outweighs the interest I would pay, leveraging against rapidly declining U.S. dollar value. I just currently see the declining USD (and diving global currencies) driving future Bitcoin value, including USD-valued stock investments. This is just my opinion and MY plan, not advice. 

I will hold my other brokerage accounts, in full, but may reallocate, based on opportunity. That was always just ""fuck you"" money to begin with. My future plays will be 5G/6G infrastructure (NOK), Bitcoin (which will require 5G/6G infrastructure, to be fully accepted as mainstream currency), healthcare (eyeing re-entry into LCTX, ALBO, BTAI, and DRIO), EV infrastructure (OZSC), and [IoT] sensor technology (DPLS). I'm also gambling on the HCMC lawsuit against PM and Altria Group. This is a huge risk/reward potential that should show direction by the end of the week.

Moving further, I won't be investing much cash into stocks, on dips, but rather into Bitcoin, which I feel will easily double from here. I normally prefer high-upside multiple bets (3x, 5x, 10x, etc.) But I feel like in this market environment, a 2x crypto gain is a big win, compared to the serious downside potential to USD-tethered stocks, and their basis on on the declining USD (or other global currency), solely. 

If you want to learn more about what I'm seeing, DM me. I don't like alt-coins, shit-coins, stable-coins, or anything else. Only Bitcoin, paired with 5G/6G. I see this symbiosis as the future, just my opinion. If you want to discuss more about what I'm seeing in the markets, DM me. I'm not a financial guru, but if you want to know more about what I'm thinking, DM me. Again, this is not financial advice.

personalfinance,I can pay for college in full - considering taking a student loan so I can keep consistently investing in the market and IRA.,"I am really struggling with this question, but it might be an easy one. I currently have about $70,000 saved and am entering a Masters's degree program in an attempt to switch careers.

I was laid off from my job and will run out of unemployment benefits in April (so no income). I am planning on moving to Washington DC (for school) and paying about $1000-$1400 a month for rent. My school costs a total of about 27,000 after scholarships for a 15-month program. I am hoping to find some kind of part-time work, but that's not guaranteed. I am moving to DC in August and my current rent+living expenses is about $1000 a month.

My question: I am thinking if I should expect to dive into my savings, or take out a Federal student loan at the current loan rate of 4.3%. 

The reason I'm conflicted is that I consistently put money into an index-fund-bond-REIT portfolio in order to Dollar Cost Average and I don't want to stop putting in money weekly. I believe my returns over the course of the next two years will be greater than 4% and I have about $40,000 left in cash. If I pay for school and rent, I won't have any money to put into the market and my investment strategy requires me to continuously put money in (I am worried to miss a big dip like back in March 2020). I want to continue to do that, and in order to do that, I will need cash. I can repay the loan monthly as well, it will be around $300 a month, and over the same 15 month period that will be $4,500 dollars and not $27,000 which I would have to pay if I paid it while I was in the program. I mean I hope I can find a job that will cover rent and living expenses ($2000/month), but I don't want to not have any cash left to keep contributing to my IRA and stock portfolio weekly. 

Once I find a job after college, I would aggressively pay down the student loan, since I would hope to have enough money to do so and still be able to invest. 

Is this a weird way of thinking about this? I just think that my index funds/reits/bonds will do better than 4%, especially if I can keep investing weekly. Imagine the stock market drops in the next year and I can't keep buying.",finance
personalfinance,Can you pay off a loan too fast?,"I took out a student loan in August 2020 for $5k for graduate school (2.25% interest rate), I wasn't sure how much my fees + everything else was going to be and I wanted to be covered (I have a stipend and tuition waiver, but it only covers literally tuition). Well, it turned out I only needed about $800 a semester, which is very doable without any loans. So the rest of the $2500 (each semester), I put back into the loan and now only owe about $1900. If I pay off the loan within a year of taking it out, would it look bad - credit-wise?

Because I am still in school, I am only paying interest on my loan, which comes out to \~$2.50-$3.00 a month. I could keep paying this small amount if it would help my credit score to keep the loan open longer.

When I signed, I made sure that the loan allowed for paying in full without penalty. So, I shouldn't have any issues with paying off the loan early in terms of my contract.",finance
financialindependence,200k into my FIRE journey w/ a side of cancer,"Some title, huh?

This is partially a success post, since I just hit $200k and wanted to celebrate, but also I wanted to offer a breakdown of what my journey has looked like so far, while undergoing cancer treatment in the US as a young person. Let me tell you, it's been a ride.

Here's the TL;DR for all y'all who don't want to read: 24F engineer discovers FIRE, saves for a few years, goes back to grad school, gets cancer, gets dream job, buys a house and adopts a dog. 29F today.

So right off the bat I'm going to acknowledge my privilege. I was raised by frugal parents in a lower-middle class background so I always had an appreciation of finances, and had help paying for my undergrad education. I graduated without a crushing amount of debt ($22k) and went into a lucrative field (engineering). Not all are as lucky as I have been.

Ready? Let's blast off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Year 1:** Age: 22 NW: -$20,000 Salary: $0 -&gt; $63,000  
Notes: Graduated with a degree in aerospace engineering in the spring and got a job offer in the defense industry on the other side of the country in the fall. I like space ships, not missile, but hey, I needed a job. Packed my bags and drove 2000 miles away. As soon as I got my first paycheck I started aggressively paying off my student loans.

**Year 2:** Age: 23 NW: $6,000 Salary: $65,000  
Notes: Was about halfway through my student loans, got myself some fancy new toys, but wasn't loving my career. Still sort of just coasting and enjoying having disposable income for the first time in my life.

**Year 3:** Age: 24 NW: $34,000 Salary: $68,000 -&gt; $82,000  
Notes: I paid off my student loans! ...Now what? I suddenly had a surplus of cash and didn't know what to do with it. So I started to google and read a bunch about investing, and that's when I encountered **FIRE**. Finally I had a plan. Even though I didn't love my job, I could at least work toward the goal of investing and retiring early. Hell, I was already living frugally. Almost immediately after that I was headhunted by a competing company and quickly jumped ship. (Spoilers: I wouldn't enjoy the new job any more than the previous one. In fact, it solidified my resolve to switch career paths, FIRE be damned.)

**Year 4:** Age: 25 NW: $74,000 Salary: $82,000 -&gt; $0  
Notes: After less than a year in the new job I was already ready to leave. I'd spent the last year aggressively saving before I applied to graduate school in a field tangentially related to my own (astrophysics) which makes less moolah, but would bring me a lot more happiness. I got in! The first year of graduate school was super fun. I took on some debt, as I applied too late to be considered for a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GSA) position that first semester, but hey, I was desperate to get out of my soul crushing career. I had enough money to pay for living expenses previously saved from my engineering jobs, so I just enjoyed college that first year, applied to be a GSA the following year, and applied to lots of internships for the next summer.

**Year 5:** Age: 26 NW: $82,000 Salary: $20,000  
Notes: And I got an internship at NASA! It was my dream internship. It was also during that internship I noticed a bump in my neck. That summer I went to three different doctors who all assured me, ""You're young, it's probably nothing."" I was young, but it wasn't nothing. When I returned to school that fall I went to my uni's crappy medical clinic, and the nurse there actually had the humility to admit she didn't know what the bump was. Instead of brushing me off, she referred me to a head and neck specialist. That nurse saved my life, because 2 months later I was diagnosed with cancer. That's a big *oof* in your 20's, in the middle of graduate school with hardly any income or health insurance. Oh yeah, and then I got the call to come interview for my dream job on the Artemis program two days later. Talk about a roller coaster.  
I skipped my finals that winter to have surgery. I recovered over winter break. The doctors told me I should take the next semester of school off, but I'm a bit stubborn. I had my thesis coming up, and I got an offer for aforementioned dream job. Hell no I wasn't going to quit now.

**Year 6:** Age: 27 NW: $67,000 Salary: $15,000 -&gt; $78,000  
Notes: In January I took my missed finals. That semester I took the last two classes needed to get my master's, continued to teach and grade as a GSA, finished my thesis, and underwent radiation treatment over spring break. The bills started rolling in right around when I was graduating, but at least I had a job lined up. All told, I probably paid $10k out of pocket that first year (but let me tell you, that HSA I opened years earlier after reading about it on FIRE blogs saved my butt). Once I started my 9-5 I bought the best health insurance plan they offered. My parents also helped to pay about $5k of my medical bills. I know, they're amazing. I love them.

**Year 7:** Age: 28 NW: 105,000 Salary: $81,000  
Notes: You may have noticed that my new salary, despite me now having a master's degree and more years of experience, is actually less than my salary before I went back to grad school lol. I had expected that. That's what you pay for happiness. After getting back into my career, I was able to start aggressively saving again... which is great, because 9 months into the new job I was diagnosed with Cancer: Round 2. Fight! (And getting scheduled for surgery in the middle of a pandemic is it's own fun bucket of balls, let me tell you.) Luckily this time I recovered much faster, and paid only $2,500 out of pocket due to the very fancy health insurance I mentioned before.

**Year 8:** Age 29 NW: $200,000 Salary: $85,000  
Notes: And because I guess I was feeling giddy after the cancer thing, I decided to buy a house! Just three months ago. So part of the jump in my NW is due to home equity, but not much. This was just a really good year for my investments, and I saved over 50% of my income. Oh, and I also got a puppy, because I've always wanted one but I wanted to wait until I had a yard, first. He's 4 months old now and is the best thing to ever exist in the history of humanity. Which brings us to... today.

&amp;#x200B;

The blood work is looking good, so if I'm lucky all the cancer stuff is behind me. The frequent labs and ultrasounds are still a bit of a drain on my finances, and I'll be on daily medication the rest of my life as a result, but I'm lucky to be in a good paying field that can support my medical needs.

**SUMMARY**  
Average Income since undergrad: \~58k  
Liquid Assets: $20k  
Retirement Accounts: $150k  
Home Value: $450k  
Mortgage: $410k  
Grad Loans: $10k  
\-------------------------  
Net Worth: $200k

At the rate of current expenses and savings, I think I can hit my FIRE number in 10 years, around when I hit 40. This isn't accounting for things like kids (I'm a gay woman, so if anything I'd adopt), marriage (a boosted combined income would be excellent), extra roommate income (I've got another room in this house I'm not yet renting, because I'm just enjoying alone time with my pup), or a side hustle. However, a side hustle is likely in my future, because while all this was going on, I was also working on my hobby, which is writing fiction. I don't self publish, but I've been querying in traditional publishing circles for a few years now, and it's looking like a book deal might be in my not so distant future. If my writing career does take off, I think I could go to part-time work in about 5 years. Writing is something I really love, and it's been an amazing stress reliever and outlet for everything I've gone through, so if the numbers looked good enough I would even consider switching to that career full time. But that's still just one of many possible tomorrows.

Things I'd do differently?

Not much. I guess if I had the magical ability to predict my cancer I wouldn't have chosen to do grad school at the same time, lol. And grad school itself basically lost me 2 year's worth of early savings and  compound interest. But I'd do it all again. I loved the program and the people I met there. I've loved working at my new job. I mean, we're sending people to the flippin' Moon, guys! How sweet is that? I didn't enjoy my first 3 years in the defense industry, but it was needed to gain valuable work experience and skills and pay off my undergrad loans. Oh yeah, and I still have $10k on my grad school loans, but since there's no accruing interest or payments due right now as a result of the pandemic (and Biden may or may not forgive student loans) I'm holding off on paying those down in order to invest and replenish my liquid assets after pouring a bunch into the house closing costs.

So, yeah. That's it, guys. It's been a ride. Dunno if you all got anything out of this, but it's been fun to share. I guess if I had any parting words of wisdom, it's to not sacrifice your today for your tomorrow. Running face-first into cancer was a pretty big wake up call for me: all that saving and FIRE planning I'd been doing, and I might die before I would mean anything? I'm not saying to go out and blow all your cash on cars and casinos. But hey, go for that lower paying career that'll make you happier. Finally get that dog you promised yourself you'd have when you were 12. Make time for your favorite hobbies today.

EDIT: Obligatory ""Wow, this blew up!"" I just want to answer some additional questions here so you don't have to go digging.

**What kind of cancer is it?** Thyroid cancer, which had done a lot of spreading. I got it worse than your typical thyroid cancer case, but thyroid cancer is still waaaay more treatable than most other types of cancer, so I feel both lucky, and optimistic about beating it.

**Where did you live during this?** Florida, Alabama, Arizona, and Colorado. The first three were low cost of living and I was able to save a bunch. Denver has been much higher COL, so it's been tougher to save.

**A $450k mortgage seems like a lot.** Well first off, that's not a question. And second, yeah, I know lol. But I have a very low interest rate, and the price is actually on the low end (without being a dump) for the city I currently live in. In fact, the mortgage is only about $500 more than I was paying for rent on my 1 bedroom apartment. And if I wanted to rent out the extra room, I'd actually be saving money! Since I'm settled with a job I intend to stay with in a city I intend to stay in, financially it just made more sense.",finance
investing,The True Power of the Feds Words in a Single Chart,"Edit: I attempted to essentially front run comments about what this post is, but seems to not have worked. So let me put it here, at the very top:  **this is not a market call or a trade idea whatsoever- this is simply an observation. It‚Äôs not a speculation but on what the Fed might do, can do, can‚Äôt do, won‚Äôt do, etc etc. It is, again, nothing more than an observation of a ratio which holds no weight to anything.**

Due to COVID, the Federal Reserve established corporate credit facilities in which they essentially ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù to purchase corporate debt, specifically common ETFs in this space, including high yield. 

US high yield corporate credit (aka Junk or speculative debt) is, let‚Äôs call it, the riskiest of debt available to the broad investment community. It carries the highest yields and tends to have the sharpest volatility, even given its lower duration. 

On the equity front, it‚Äôs safe to say that small caps tend to be the most volatile (risky) of the broad US equity indices, i.e. Russell 2000 index. Some of the components that make up the index also have issued junk debt. The Fed did not stand up and facilities to support equity prices post COVID.

The chart below is intended to show the power of the Feds words, in my view. Yes, it‚Äôs imperfect, let me state this right now. It‚Äôs not intended to be anything more than this observation. 

The chart is simple: it takes the implied volatility of the Russell 2000 Index ($RVX) and divides that by the effective yield on US high yield corporate credit.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=BiWA

A general range for this ratio of 2-4 has history, even post GFC, however COVID has all but shifted this ratio much higher.

You can do the same from the large caps, i.e. $VIX (S&amp;amp;amp;P 500)... the results aren‚Äôt much different.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=BiXa

Now just imagine if the Fed had established a facility to buy equities... where might the RVX/VIX be at then? [Edit: yes, I‚Äôm well aware they do not have the authority to do so.]

In short, it is my opinion that the Feds actions, but much more so words, have suppressed volatility within the US high yield space and offered a floor for the market. And, I don‚Äôt expect this to end well... it brings back (terrible) memories of the SNB ‚Äúhaving your back‚Äù at EUR 1.20... until one night, they gave up.

THREE QUICK NOTES:

1) I do submit that the data set is small, encompassing only one prior recession (GFC) but would argue that high yield has had it moments post-GFC, such as 2015/16 oil sell off when a large makeup of the high yield space was energy companies.

2) I also submit that current implied volatility levels are probably a function of a ‚Äúcrash up‚Äù bid, as opposed to hedging downside risk and/or speculating on falling prices. 

[Edit] 3) The lowering of the FF rate by the Fed has also contributed to the decline in high yields, as the 3yr UST note yields 20bps; therefore, high yield OAS has not made all time lows like effective yields have.


Regardless, I found this observation quite fascinating given the historically elevated implied volatility relative to the effective yield.",finance

stocks,Effect of Interest Rates on Stocks?,"I'm a bit confused about how interest rates affects stocks and I hope someone smarter than me is able to shed some light on my confusion. I understand that the Fed lowers interests rates, making it easier to borrow when the economy contracts. This is done to increase spending and discourages saving since your HYSA isn't giving you much. When interest rates are low, bond yields typically follow. This shoots bond prices up as older bonds with higher yields are more valuable. My confusion comes from what happens when bond yields rise. On one hand, I've read that rising bond yields makes bonds more attractive and so investors sell equities and move to bonds for safer returns. On the other hand, I've read that rising bond yields are a sign of investors selling bonds and moving into equities because it's the increased selling of bonds, more supply, that is pushing bond prices down and thus yields up. These are contradictory. So which is it? Thanks!",finance

Bitcoin,Logically overcoming J Powell &amp; J Yellen FUD. Keep your eyes and brain on the prize.,"This was written by Lyn Alden 2 months ago when BTC was at a $250B market cap. She‚Äôs addressing the ‚Äúbut governments can ban it‚Äù fear mongering where people vote the IS banning gold in the 30s through the 70s. Read and relax. 

‚ÄúThis was back when the dollar was backed by gold, so the United States government wanted to own most of the gold, and limit citizens‚Äô abilities to acquire gold. No such backing exists today for gold or Bitcoin, and thus there is less incentive to try to ban it.

And, the gold ban was hard to enforce. There were rather few prosecutions over gold ownership, even though the penalties on paper were severe.

Bitcoin uses encryption, and thus is not really able to be confiscated other than through legal demand. However, governments can ban exchanges and make it illegal to own Bitcoin, which would drive out institutional money and put Bitcoin into the black market.

Here‚Äôs the problem. Bitcoin has over $250 billion in market capitalization. Two publicly-traded companies on major exchanges, MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Square (SQ) already own it, as do a variety of public companies on other exchanges and OTC markets, plus private companies and investment funds. Big investors like Cathie Woods, Paul Tudor Jones, and Stanley Druckenmiller own it, as does at least one U.S. senator-elect. Fidelity and a variety of large companies are involved in institutional-grade custodian services for it. PayPal (PYPL) is getting involved. Federally regulated U.S. banks can now officially custody crypto assets. The IRS treats it like a commodity for tax purposes. That‚Äôs a lot of mainstream momentum.

It would be extremely difficult for major capital markets like the United States or Europe or Japan to ban it at this point. If, in the years ahead, Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization reaches over $1 trillion, with more and more institutions holding exposure to it, it becomes harder and harder to ban.

Bitcoin was already an unusual asset that grew into the semi-mainstream from the bottom up, through retail adoption. Once the political donor class owns it as well, which they increasingly do, the game is basically over for banning it. Trying to ban it would be an attack on the balance sheets of corporations, funds, banks, and investors that own it, and would not be popular among millions of voters that own it.

I think regulatory hostility is still a risk to watch out for while the market capitalization is sub‚Äì$1 trillion. And the risk can be managed with an appropriate position size for your unique financial situation and goals.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,First home purchase. When to put 20% down or less?,"I'm looking to buy a house in one of the hottest markets in the country. I'm looking to buy a house in the $1.2-$1.5 million range. 
I have stock investments and cash reserves worth a total of about $700k (excluding retirement accounts). 

I have 2 options in terms of a mortgage. I can do a conventional 20% down mortgage with an interest rate of 2.625% or I can do a 80-10-10 loan with 10% down but at an interest rate of 3.125% on the first loan (the 80%) and 4.5% on the second loan. 
Both loan terms are for 30 years fixed. 

With both the options, my monthly mortgage payments will be &lt;40% of my monthly take home pay (after taxes)
The difference of 0.5% in the interest rates and the extra 10% payment (for the 80-10-10) is about 900$ a month on average. I can definitely pay that extra money and it won't make a huge difference in my current financial scenario.

I'm conflicted on what to choose because I know that I can comfortably afford the 20% down and lock down a lower interest rate, but at the same time it feels like I could keep more of my money invested and do the minimum down payment. 
I know that if I wanted to, I could choose to pay down the extra 10% in the future and maybe even refinance into a regular 80-20 loan albeit maybe at a higher interest rate. 
The lure of holding onto that extra 10% cash/investments seems very appealing to me at the moment.

My question is, when does it make sense to actually put down less than 20%? Am I taking too big of a gamble by not choosing to do the traditional 20% down (and also lock in a pretty low interest rate, not sure if it'll go any lower than this)?",finance
CryptoCurrency,This old lady makes my blood boil.,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issued a warning Monday about the dangers that bitcoin poses both to investors and the public.

Despite a sharp slide in price to start the week, the cryptocurrency continues to trade above $53,000 as it has received boosts from various sources. Elon Musk's Tesla recently made a substantial purchase and has said it will accept bitcoin for transactions.

However, Yellen said there remain important questions about legitimacy and stability.
""I don't think that bitcoin ‚Ä¶ is widely used as a transaction mechanism,"" she told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin at a New York Times DealBook conference. ""To the extent it is used I fear it's often for illicit finance. It's an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that's consumed in processing those transactions is staggering.""

Mining bitcoin requires users to solve complex mathematical equations using high-powered computer setups. The electric consumption used in the process leaves an annual carbon footprint equal to the nation of New Zealand, according to Digiconomist.

In addition to consumption concerns, bitcoin also is considered to be a tool of those involved in a number of illegal activities because its use is difficult to trace.

Then there's volatility, as the cryptocurrency's price has seen rapid peaks and valleys during its existence.

""It is a highly speculative asset and you know I think people should be aware it can be extremely volatile and I do worry about potential losses that investors can suffer,"" Yellen said.

Various government agencies have contemplated the idea of making an alternate digital currency with the hopes that it would open up the global payments system to those who don't have access.
The Federal Reserve, where Yellen once served as chair, has studied the issue and discussed the possibility of a new digital currency along with a payments system it expects to roll out over the next several years.

""I think it could result in faster, safer and cheaper payments, which I think are important goals,"" Yellen said.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Beanie Babies Analysis,"A few years ago a relative of mine called revealing they had stumbled on a trove of Beanie Babies. They were going to be thrown out by their neighbors son, who inherited the home upon the collector‚Äôs death. I guess you could say they were HODLing until the bitter end. 

Anyway, I was quite excited to help my relatives earn money because I had always heard that some beanie babies sell for a lot of money‚Äîand seriously‚Äîthese beanie babies were mint condition, in plastic boxes with tags in so many varieties and themes, every holiday you can imagine, every culture whatever you can imagine‚Äîand these are limited supply originals. Some of them were actually pretty cute and fun to look at, too. 

Upon doing research on some of their value based in past completed eBay sales and then the first dozen or so beanie babies it did not take long to realize that the actual velocity of beanie baby transactions were actually quite low. That was disappointing because some of these stuffed animals had sold in the last several months for high amounts. 

That was when I realized: the only practical way to make money on these was to list hundreds of them and to hope a handful will sell every month or so for the ridiculously high price they were selling for in old auctions. 

Now, I can already hear the loyal BTC cult screaming ‚Äúif you think crypto is like a beanie baby you lost all credibility [insert generic defense narrative I‚Äôve seen a million times here]‚Äù 

But come on‚ÄîI really want to challenge you all to think about this for a moment. 

Yes you have bitcoins that the market reflects a theoretical $50k value each.

Yes these coins are in limited supply. 

But did you know that only 4-6M coins of the same origin are currently in circulation? This is the stock you all are buying and selling. Did you know that the remaining 15-13 million coins are being hoarded in the wallets of BTC collectors, sort of like beanie babies in that deceased woman‚Äôs attic. 

So, how much are these coins really worth if we put them into circulation at a rate similar to fiat currency? Would they be worth something tangible at that point? 

Ok so with the beanie beanie babies, I actually like looking at some of them, they were cute af, but when I look at a public key for BTC I just feel..I don‚Äôt know.. it doesn‚Äôt get my rocks off in any way. Also, I know I can‚Äôt really exchange it for goods and services hardly :( 

Unlike BTC I can give a beanie baby to my dog to play with. I can gift a limited edition one-of-a-kind (sort of) Valentine‚Äôs Day themed beanie baby to my significant other. 

If the power grid fails after a snow storm or something, I could put the beanie babies in a big pile and catch them on fire to warm me and my family. 

But a bitcoin? I mean, if the power grid fails, I can‚Äôt even move my BTC from one non-physical realm in the digital ether to another non-physical realm. 

You know. Beanie babies have been selling for years and years. People still collect them and sell them to each other for crazy amounts of fiat currency. Trust me, I really wanted to make a buck doing it, but really, what I realized was even if a small fraction of their fanatical collectors put their beanie babies on the market, if they actually attempted to engage in a meaningful transaction in order to exchange what they‚Äôve hoarded for something else they need‚Äîthat the value of these things would fall to below the basis price rather quickly, I‚Äôve seen this happen to all kinds of commodities in e-commerce. 

Beanie babie$ 

1. Limited supply of various kinds.   

2. No central bank controls them. 

3. People hold them anticipating greater value. They are what their collectors would call ‚Äúa storage of value‚Äù 

4. Low velocity for actual sales. 

5. Real and something I can use as a dog toy or to decorate a room with. 

6. Many kinds of stuffed toys exist but certain kinds of people prefer the Beanie Baby brand.

7. Most normal people would opt in for a cheaper or more practical and entertaining toy than they would elect to be unconditionally loyal to the a beanie baby brand. 

Bitcoin$: 

1. Limited supply

2. No central bank controls them. 

3. They are what their collectors call ‚Äúa storage of value‚Äù 

4. Low velocity  (the same 4-6M BTC are being bought and sold at market out of the 19M in circulation currently)

5. Not tangible or any more unique in function than other kinds of crypto. 

6. Many kinds of crypto exist but some fanatics are loyal to the BTC brand. 

7. Most people would opt for ordinary money, like most people who actually trade BTC for real money and only care to use it to make a quick buck off of those BTC fanatics who keep buying the dips. 


Look, I know there‚Äôs a lot going for blockchain tech. I know BTC isn‚Äôt a beanie baby, but I still can‚Äôt help but ask:

will swaths of you some day be like the deceased beanie baby next door neighbor lady who went hardcore HODL on beanie baby‚Äîmaybe for their value‚Äîmaybe planning some day that their sons and daughters will reap the benefits of their beanie baby hoarding (which, after all, was the basis of its value entirely)‚Äîjust for them to someday throw them on the side of the road after you‚Äôre long gone‚Äîfor someone like my relatives to pick up off the corner of the street and then try to sell unsuccessfully. 

Dear anyone not full blown drinking the Kool aid who has made it this far and is up on their BTC investment today: 

Do your future a favor and learn what real investing is supposed to be like, and invest your profits in the market, or property, ANYTHING as long as its tangible or backed by the trust of a nation with over 1000 nukes and a dozen or so aircraft carriers.  

Many will tell you BTC is going to revolutionize the unfair and corrupt markets and fiat system, but they‚Äôre missing the bigger picture. They will say I‚Äôm missing the bigger picture, but I, as well as the vast majority of adults, institutional investors, bankers, financial authorities and market regulators are grown enough to understand that no market or currency is going to be ‚Äúfair‚Äù at the end of the day, and also, that things that are fundamentally intangible retain no real value or utility (because logic). 

BTC will not help any company grow except for the same hedge funds and financial institutions who milk and manipulate retail investors, real currency, and the value of stock assets in the ‚Äúunfair‚Äù system. 

They (the small bandwagon of institutional investors) have no interest in integrating BTC into the global finance sector like they have fiat. They need guard rails to survive. So do we, unfortunately. 

Look, some people will get rich on this, have already gotten rich‚Äîdo you know what they did or are going to do at some point though? Sell. üòë

They sold or will eventually sell.. for fiat currency. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this year, but eventually they will. Do you want to be stuck HODLing the bag? 

And look, they‚Äôre bound to start selling in mass all at once. That BTC chart looks toxic af right now. I called it like two days ago. 

But who knows? It may go back up, but how much longer do you think this charade is really going to last? Don‚Äôt risk your savings in this stuff. 

You can actually make steady money in the stock market if you learn a skill besides HODL. 5G is about to start popping off, check out the industry. We got gene therapies being made, all kinds of battery tech being developed‚Äîwhy not invest you money in the future you can actually verify is emerging, and not just in the virtues of verifying a monetary system that has been shunned since the end of WW2 (that would be a reference to gold standard, which the globe has all but uniformly denounced as impractical)

I want to share a foundational compliance principle that data is queen for fintech compliance as well.,"Data record retention is actually specifically enumerated in a number of fintech regulations, &amp; when it‚Äôs not specifically required, we must have retained the data necessary to demonstrate our compliance with said regulation.

Which leads directly into data use case number one, auditability. Much like we want to know who drops out of our funnel &amp; when, we must know who saw &amp; consented to what &amp; when. Sometimes fintech compliance is so specific as to require retention of text size &amp; placement.

Fair Treatment &amp; Customer Delight (or not). Delight is over used, but regardless how can we demonstrate fair customer treatment or delight if we don‚Äôt retain our data? A key point to remember here is that compliants program is core to your overall compliance function.

Death &amp; Taxes.  Many of us fintech folks trigger tax implications &amp; the retention, provision, and accuracy of our data has a direct impact on the accuracy of our customers tax filings. Do you really want to come up in a customer audit b/c your data controls were weak?

Decisioning, pricing, &amp; reporting.  An often over looked aspect of our data usage is that a pillar consumer regulation speaks to it, FCRA. Fintech Compliance for data from 3rd parties, internal models, or account holders is all governed with specificity by the FCRA.

New Data Rules. CCPA and/or GDPR are still being batted about in legal circles, &amp; all signs point to a federal data rule in the US. &amp;, I predict it will be more granular than the current broad carve out for GLBA or various AML rules. (Read cookies/app data at a minimum.)

Last but certainly not least, Info Sec. Compliance &amp; Info Sec MUST play nicely together in your fintech. They both have a vested interest in your data, &amp; while each doesn‚Äôt need to know the ins/outs of the other‚Äôs functions, beware strife between these two teams.

Bitcoin,"Bittrex, Kraken, Binance ... three crypto exchanges costumer services : two excellent one nightmare !","Hi everyone !

I've recently had to deal with three different crypto customer support for different reasons and I'd like to share my experience with all of you. If you're wondering which crypto exchange you should use in the future, please consider these following advices.

1. Kraken - quick and efficient

I only used Kraken once back in 2017 and as I recently wanted to get back to their exchange, I found out I lost the two-factor authentication (2FA) needed for login. On Saturday the 20th of February 2021, I contacted their Support. The next day, they reply to my message and also helped me to lift my ancient 2FA. I was impressed by the efficiency and diligence of their customer service working throughout weekends. Good job Kraken !

2) Binance - efficient but could be quicker

In December 2020, I run into similar logging problems with Binance. After waiting for two days, they finally reached out to and solved my issue. Two days does not seem a long time to wait, but it the crypto world, it can fell like an eternity. Given the large number of available crypto on Binance, I still think it's a great exchange for trading crypto currencies.

3) Bittrex - beyond horrible customer service

To everyone considering Bittrex for trading cryptos : think about it twice !

At the beginning of February, my account was disabled for unknown reasons. Since then, their customer service has been essentially ignoring my help requests (ticket as they call it). Although I provided all kind of ID verification and Source of Funds documents. I only got automatic responses telling me to ''wait patiently'' but since it has been more than two weeks, I can hardly stay patient anymore.

Bittrex customer service is only working during week days and seem to be completely understaffed. Their Support is almost inexistent and when they finally reach out to customers, they barely provide any useful help.

To everyone thinking about using Bittrex, you need to know that you might lose control of your own funds at any moment. And as soon as you're getting into troubles, you'll be waiting for ages to get very poor quality support. If it ever happens to you, you'll be wondering why you chose such a shady exchange in the first place. I hope for you that you'll never be in this extremely anxious situation.

Be aware of these very poor customer service crypto exchange to keep your funds safe !

They will do all they can to ensure that BTC is propped up on debt.

*They'll have their minions in the gov't use confiscation (taxes) as a means to accelerate the rate to which debt fuels bitcoin.*

They'll have their minions in gov't institute unrealized capital gains taxes which will encourage individuals and corporations alike, to take loans out to pay their taxes in lieu of selling their BTC.

They'll keep interest rates low (at least through 2025 as indicated by the FED in 2020).

Businesses like BlockFi, and their loan products are going to grow exponentially.

**Then, when 20 million or so BTC is swimming in an ocean of debt, the banks will raise interest rates, with the click of a button and owning BTC will become a liability.**

Taking loans out to pay taxes on BTC will no longer make sense anymore and the interest rate environment will be such that it will be cheaper to NOT own BTC than it will be to OWN BTC.

There will be a rush to sell and the banks will be willing buyers... the HODLER's of last resort...

**Then, we'll all look back at BTC like ""damn, you used to be a snack...""**

\---

*p.s. Seems BTC is headed down towards the 21 Weekly EMA and those of you who follow my posts know that I am physically not capable of buying BEFORE we reach that level.  There's a POSSIBILITY that we may dip below the 21 Weekly EMA inasmuch as there is a CME Gap at the $23k level.  Based on the data we have now, CME Gaps have been filled 95% of the time.   So, do not be surprised to see this gap filled this time around and do not panic.  Just DCA back in around the 21 Weekly EMA level.*

*If prior bull markets are indicator, we'll ""chill for a while"" then go parabolic again.  I see $100k BTC in 2021... my body is ready.*",cryptocurrency

stocks,Let's not panic here - This selloff is a healthy market reaction to rising treasury yields,"**Disclaimer:** I'm heavily simplifying a very complex topic for the sake of keeping this post brief.

Folks, close your trading app. Take a deep breath. Relax.  This is not the apocalypse. This is not the armageddon.

Before I get into what's happening, here is a bit of perspective: Even with yesterday's selloff, NASDAQ ended at 13,533. I can't see what the index is like pre-market, but QQQ is down 1.35% as I write this. So let's assume it opens 13,350.

That's still 280 points higher than the post-January selloff (low of 13,070). That's also still 462 points higher than December 31st (we closed at 12,888). In %, that's 2.14% and 3.58% higher, respectively.

Now I know that a lot of you are trading on highly volatile stocks (looking at you, CRSR and PLTR), so obviously they are hit much harder than NASDAQ. That's the nature of the beast. Volatile stocks = large swings, both up and down. Welcome to the flip side. I have some of those in my portfolio, and also some defensive and cyclical stocks. It sucks those volatile positions deep in the red. I know how you all feel.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what's happening?

**Treasury yields are rising.** That's what's happening. There's obviously more to it (I.e.: vaccination seems to be going relatively well, Biden's stimulus, etc.), but that seems to be the catalyst. In fact, the 10-year yield rose to its highest level in the last year, at 1.37%. **That's a good thing:** Rising yields are a sign of economic recovery and increasing economic activity. It's a good thing.

Why are yields rising if interest rates remain low? Because of one of the fundamentals of yields: As bond prices rise, everything else being equal, yields will drop. And the inverse is also true. As bond prices drop, yields will rise. And right now, bond prices are dropping. People are becoming more and more optimistic about the prospect of recovery, with Biden's stimulus and with the vaccination that is (once again, relatively) going well. So they are exiting ""safe"" investments with lower yields in favor of riskier investments with higher yields: junkier bonds, stock market and alternative investments.

Wait, if rising yields are a sign of people exiting the bond markets to go towards the stock markets, why are prices dropping????? Great question, and my answer is twofold: (1) NASDAQ is not even in market correction territory, Chill. It closed roughly down 5% from all time highs yesterday. (2) Look at S&amp;P500 and DIJA. DIJA is a winner in this, and S&amp;P is barely phased.

So back to my explanation, people are leaving bond markets for markets with higher potential returns, and the stock markets is one of them. Now, the reality is that rising yields are not always immediately good for markets, especially overheated markets like NASDAQ: This can spook a lot of investors and cause a selloff, which is essentially what's happening right now. This doesn't mean, however, that the apocalypse is upon us. Remember one of the reasons why the markets have skyrocketed so much in the last year: Actual interest rates, not yields, are near zero, and will remain near zero for the foreseeable future. This is crucial. New bond issuance will still have shit for yields, this isn't changing.

&amp;#x200B;

**What should we do?** That's entirely up to you. I'm no financial advisor. I'm no expert. Take everything I say with a massive grain of salt. I'm no expert. But really, I'm barely doing anything. I'll be taking a page from Cathy's book: keeping a close eye on when this new craze slows down, sell some of my ""safer, less impacted stocks"" to raise cash and buy the ones that were hit hardest.

Look across at big tech, everything is crushed today. Investors as a whole are selling due to fears of extended inflation and with it higher interest rates.

Higher interest rates does what do fiat currency? It increases its value. What is bitcoin's main bull argument? A store of value against fiat.

CryptoCurrency,"For some perspective, let's take a look at some of the comments in the daily thread from March 2020 when Bitcoin crashed from $8k to $4.8k in a single day. They're golden!","It's understandable that some people will be panicking about the price action of the last couple of days, either because you're new and haven't experienced a crash before, or because you've been around long enough to remember the last time we went from a euphoric bullrun to a multi-year bear market and are concerned that it's happening again right now. For the record: I'm not a fan of crashes either!

I don't know what's going to happen next. My *opinion* is that this crash was well overdue and we'll recover and make new highs over the next few months. I could well be wrong, wouldn't be the first time!

A few months back when Bitcoin hit $17k (we were so jubilant- $17k!!!!) I shared these threads and comments as a reminder to take comments in here with a pinch of salt, and I thought that with the current sentiment being what it is, some people might find that taking a look through the daily threads from [March 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/fh77ef/daily_discussion_march_12_2020_gmt0/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and [March 13th](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/fhqj6t/daily_discussion_march_13_2020_gmt0/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) last year helpful to put things into perspective a bit, and to try not to¬†take all the doom and gloom too seriously (this applies to bullish comments too, because the truth is nobody knows where this is going).

On March 12 last year, the Bitcoin prices plunged 40% from $8000 to $4,800. At the time it felt like the end of the world to many people. (And look how far we've come since then!) Some of the comments are pure gold:

I'm planning on taking a loan against our 401(k) to finanace a down payment. We don't have a great deal in savings at the moment (about $30k), and with skyrocketing mortgage prices, low interest rates, and the stock market at an all time high, it feels like the time might be now. I want to put 20% down on a place to avoid PMI, and I'd rather be paying that back to myself against my 401(k) with interest. I also have some side hustles that will allow me to pay back against the 401(k) fairly quickly. Right now I have about $36k in my 401(k).

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-23-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.

&gt; * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won‚Äôt last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.

&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday‚Äôs downdraft, closing slightly higher. It‚Äôs doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.

*****

&gt; # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell‚Äôs testimony this week

&gt; * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell‚Äôs remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it‚Äôs been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.

*****

&gt; # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again

&gt; * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world‚Äôs largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.

&gt; * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk‚Äôs electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.

*****

&gt; # 4. Home Depot, Macy‚Äôs report better than expected quarterly results

&gt; * Home Depot‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot‚Äôs CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.

&gt; * Shares of Macy‚Äôs rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company‚Äôs efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday‚Äôs trading, Macy‚Äôs shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.

*****

&gt; # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public

&gt; * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.

personalfinance,"How TurboTax might be messing up your mortgage interest deduction if you refinanced, and how to fix it.","*Disclaimer: I'm not a tax professional. I'm just an internet stranger who found an issue with TurboTax and is giving you a guide to fix it. Always check your own taxes carefully to make sure they're accurate.*

Quick intro matter: **who is this for?** This post does NOT apply to you if you (1) take the standard deduction, (2) itemize but had just a single mortgage all year, or (3) don't use TurboTax. If you fit into any of those categories, congratulations! You are not affected by this error. 

This post MAY apply to you if you use TurboTax, itemize your deductions, and had multiple mortgages during 2020 - for example, if you refinanced during the year, or if you took out a new loan and it got transferred to a different servicer so that you ended up with multiple Form 1098s.

**The Problem:** TurboTax incorrectly implements the mortgage deduction limit when you have a refinance. Under federal law, your mortgage interest is fully deductible only for loans with a principal amount of up to $750,000 (for loans taken out after 2017; earlier loans have a higher cap). Anything beyond the cap results in prorating. For example, if the principal on your loan is $1,000,000, then only 75% of the mortgage interest you pay is deductible. If you have a first and second mortgage at the same time, those get added together to apply the limit. For example, if you have a first mortgage of $600,000 and a second mortgage of $200,000, your total is $800,000, which is above the limit and subject to prorating.

The problem TurboTax has is that it does not distinguish between simultaneous first/second mortgage situations like this (which require prorating) and refinances (which might not). For example, suppose your mortgage principal amount is $500,000, and you refinance mid-year to a new mortgage with principal amount $450,000. Your mortgage is never above the $750,000 limit - not even close. But TurboTax doesn't understand this. It assumes that your refinance was a second mortgage and just adds up the numbers. According to TurboTax, you had $950,000 in mortgage principal, which carries a hefty (&gt;20%) reduction in your interest deduction. Suppose you paid $20k in mortgage interest during the year on this loan; TurboTax would try to knock that down to $16k. That's a $4k reduction in your tax deductions, which can result in you paying Uncle Sam $1-2k more than you really owe.

This is a [known problem](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/tax-credits-deductions/discussion/re-entering-multiple-1098s-due-to-a-refinance-is-incorrectly-triggering-the-750-000-principal-l/01/1200728/highlight/true) that that was in [last year's](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/tax-credits-deductions/discussion/mortgage-interest-deduction-in-case-of-refinance-in-2019/00/1052454) software and [wasn't fixed](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/tax-credits-deductions/discussion/refinanced-mortgage-1098-messing-up-deduction-from-original-loan/00/1842343) in [this year's](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/tax-credits-deductions/discussion/bug-with-refinance-on-a-large-mortgage/00/1820267) version - not even a warning flag to let users know it's not working. Thanks, Intuit!

**The Solution:** You have a few options here.

1. Switch to a different software! I've been on TurboTax for more than a decade but after a problem last year with the electric vehicle credit and this problem now, I'm done with them. Not trying to shill but FreetaxUSA worked great for me.

2. In the interview, when you enter info about your mortgage payments from the Form 1098s you received, enter $0 in Box 2 as the mortgage principal amount for the second loan (and any subsequent ones, if you refinanced multiple times or had your refinance transferred between servicers). This is the easiest way to get to the right result within TurboTax; I'm not a huge fan of providing incorrect information but it gets the right result. Important note: this may *not* get you to the right result if you do have to deduct part of your interest anyway (for example, if you refinanced a $900k loan to a $775k one).

3. Switch from the interview to Forms view and go to the Deductible Home Mortgage Interest Worksheet (listed as ""Ded Home Mort"" in the sidebar index). Line 7 of the worksheet is the average balance of your mortgage(s) over the year. You'll see that TurboTax has filled it in by doing straight addition of each loan instead of figuring out an actual average over the year. Calculate the correct average balance, right-click on this field, choose ""Override,"" and put in the right number. You should then see the refund numbers increase as the change flows through. If you're going to stick with TurboTax, this is my preferred solution.

personalfinance,Wrote wrong Property Tax on NJ1040,"Did my taxes with credit karma.

Credit karma asks you how much of the property you actually occupy, and I put 50%, so they halved the number again.  Long story short, I'm owed a small bit.

bonds,Clarification (and advise?) on Bonds ETF,"Hello,

A couple of weeks ago, I wanted to experience a bit, and I bought a couple of Corporate bonds and treasury bonds ETF units (VUCP and VUTY). 

Naively (I know...) , I thought was that even if the interest rate were low, the bonds would offer a certain stability and keep their values. 

So since the beginning of 2021 the US bonds have dropped by quite a lot. Reading a bit further about how bonds are working, I am a bit puzzled. 

I understand now that yield rate and inflation were historically low and now the yield is rising, the bond prices will drop. To me it seems unlikely that the yield rate will go back to its mid-2020 value so it seems to me that the price fall will continue which mean that I must accept my loss.

However I hear that Bonds are products that we should not get rid of because they are... well US bonds and they are long term product.

What do you think?   
Should I accept my loss, get rid of my bonds and purchase something more equity oriented such as S&amp;P500 for instance. Or should I hold on to it and expect a re-bounce of the bond value, even if it means waiting for 20 years.

I would like to clarify that even if I am seeking advise, I am of course not looking for free financial advise but more about the right attitude to have towards bonds.

Thanks a lot

personalfinance,Sell equities or refinance rental to put down payment down on new residence,"**Personal Finance,**

Would like to request your opinions on the doing a cash out refinance on a rental property vs selling equities (most likely VTSAX in taxable) to fund a large down payment 600k on a 1.1 million dollar house in a HCOL area. 

Background: Early 40's couple in a HCOL area. I have a federal government job and max out my TSP every year as well as HSA. Wife has a private job in the medical field and also maxes out her 401k every year. **I plan on doing a FERS deferred retirement around 50 and living off taxable until I can withdraw from TSP's receive a tiny FERS pension at 62 as well as early social security.** We have a two year old daughter who is the reason for a move to a new home (new build in an area with better schools and more kid friendly features (parks etc.) 

&amp;#x200B;

With rates low right now , I am tempted to take equity out of rental #1 below for  part of the down payment on a new house. The intent is basically to never pay it off as I think rents will be able to cover the mortgage for the foreseeable future. 

**Assets:** 

**Taxable:** 

$1.2 million in a brokerage account all VTSAX which we plan to sell some of if we use this for the down payment. 

About 100k in emergency funds either in HYSA or I Bonds. 

**Tax Deferred:**

His TSP and IRA about \~$1.2 million 

Her 401k about $200k

HSA account about \~25k, we pay expenses out of pocket and intend to keep building this up

**Real Estate:** 

**Primary residence:**  Just refinanced this year on a new 30 year at 2.65%, \~300k equity on a single house valued about $850k, original purchase price 6 years ago was 672k. If we bought the new house we would rent this, in our area the rent would cover the mortgage with a small cash flow \~300 a month left over. I don't really want to sell this as we have done a lot of renovations and 3 refinances over six years. 

**Rental #1:** Old primary residence, townhouse which has 8 years left on a 15 year loan at 3.125%. About 400k of equity on a townhouse worth $650k with original purchase price of $472k 15 years ago. If I do a cash out refinance we expect to take 300k out on a new 30 year loan at \~3.5- 3.7% . We haven't had trouble renting this place but basically break even now as the 15 year mortgage leads to high payments with lots of principle paydown. I was originally planning on just paying this off over the remaining 8 years. This has been rented for 6 years with deprecation etc. 

**Rental #2:** Just purchased townhouse with has 30 years left on 30 year loan at 2.75% About 200k of equity on a townhouse worth $650k. This one cash flows a bit every month. I don't intend to do anything with this other than keep renting it out.

personalfinance,Do leasing a car make sense? (Financially),"Ok, let me start this by saying that I¬¥ve always been against leasing a car. Probable mileage fees, paying for something that you do not own, cheaper to get a very good used car, and so on.

The thing is, I am now forced to change my car for the 2nd time in 6 years (family growing), and I live in a country where used cars lose value insanely fast. What does this mean? For my last two cars, I bought them used, the math is like: (Using round numbers to just draw a picture):

Car value (on purchase): 100points

Downpayment for a bank loan (5-7 years, with the standard interest rate for the country): 30 points

&amp;#x200B;

Then, 2-3 years after, when I need to change the car (family growing, the current one has no space for 3 child seats):

Current car value: 40 points

Left to pay to the bank: 40 points

&amp;#x200B;

This means that, when I sell my car, I just ""break-even"" with the bank, and then have to make a downpayment again for a new car and start the whole process. To this, I have to add the car maintenance (plus stuff breaking as they are used cars), higher consumption vs a used car, and so on. Wouldnt it be better just leasing a car?:

Car Value (new). 300points

Lease ""in"" downpayment: between 40 and 60 points

Mileage fees: Highly unlikely, as I am working from home now (and will be permanent) and only use the car to drive the kids and the wife around (school, shopping, etc)

The monthly payments would be a little bit higher than what I currently pay to the bank, but I wouldn't have to worry about maintenance (the lease includes it), stuff breaking (new car warranty, lease warranty, and so on), insurance (lease also includes it). And of course, I would have the chance to just buy the car at the end of the lease.

&amp;#x200B;

I am missing something here? Sounds like a good deal for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Adding numbers instead of ""points"" for the illustration:

*I bought my current car at around 15k USD (fair market price, it was not cheap nor expensive), and right now if i were to sell it, it would be worth around 8500 USD. Thats almost 50% depreciation in 2.5 years. It works like that with all cars in here (Norway), the only ones that dont depreciate that fast are Teslas and some other new EVs*",finance

&gt;As described in the February Monetary Policy Report, in August, the Committee unanimously adopted its revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Our revised statement shares many features with its predecessor. For example, we have not changed our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal. However, we did make some key changes. Regarding our employment goal, we emphasize that maximum employment is a broad and inclusive goal. This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for low- and moderate-income communities. In addition, we state that our policy decisions will be informed by our ‚Äúassessments of shortfalls of employment from its maximum level‚Äù rather than by ‚Äúdeviations from its maximum level.‚Äù This change means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market. Regarding our price stability goal, we state that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. This means that, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. With this change, we aim to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent goal. Well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation goals, particularly in the current low interest rate environment in which our main policy tool is likely to be more frequently constrained by the lower bound.

My pre-approval doesn't say anything about what interest rate I will be getting so I can't really compare lenders until the time I actually buy and see what the rates actually are at that time.

A second question is, when I go to actually buy the house, will the mortgage company do another credit pull? My credit score was lower when I got my pre-approval because I had large balances on some 0% interest cards that I have since paid off, so obviously it would be helpful if they do a second hard credit pull, but I don't know if they do it automatically or could I request it somehow?

personalfinance,Save for retirement or pay off student loans?,"Hi all, this is my situation.

**Basic Info**

I am 23, turning 24 in the summer. I have a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's degree in international finance. I am currently working in the financial industry.

**Income and Existing Contributions**

I currently make $50k USD a year, rounding to $1,544 for each semi-monthly paycheck. That paycheck accounts for a pre-tax 6% contribution to a matching work 401k, the max match offered.

**Expenses**

I currently live at home rent-free, my expenses are minimal. I pay off my credit cards in full each month according to my budget, my car is paid off, and I have no other debts aside from student loans. I also do not ride the 'float', I pay off bills with existing funds rather than waiting for the next paycheck to come in.

**Budget**

I budget approximately $500 for personal spending, this includes gas, entertainment, dining, etc. Basically everything, the rest of my monthly income I set aside for loan repayment. This is mostly discretionary spending and I could most likely eliminate this and be fine, but I enjoy having some spending money to go out with a friend (masked ofc) or get some sushi c:

**Debts**

I do not carry credit card, auto or any other type of debt aside from student loans.

My student loan debt is broken down as follows:

$46,732.88 @ 7.08% - Federal DoE Grad Plus loan

$20,386.12 @ 6.08% - Federal DoE Unsubsidized loan

*These are currently accruing 0% interest however, due to the federal student loan suspension until at least September 30, 2021.*

**Savings and Emergency Fund**

I currently have $41,700 in a high yield savings account earning 0.50% APY. I have made a separate emergency fund account along with my Roth IRA, but that is not funded yet, I will be contributing to this with each paycheck.

**Existing Retirement Accounts**

I have a Roth IRA that I recently opened a few days that has \~$100 in it, I believe I should try and max out the 2020 contribution while I still can before the April deadline.

**Windfall**

I am expecting approximately $5,200 through my 2020 tax return.

**Question**

Thanks for reading this far. My questions now are as follows:

What should I do? I would very much like to be debt-free, if I use my tax return I will be able to completely pay off my Grad Plus loan, and I'd be on track to pay off the remainder by the end of 2021. This is huge, I am very fortunate and eternally grateful to my parents for my situation.

But I just don't know if it is the best thing to do. I could use that tax return and almost fully fund the 2020 contribution and still be on track to pay off both loans by the end of the year. Or I could take that $5.2k and make it my emergency fund. Or I could fund my IRA and start contributing to begin my investment portfolio, which I will plan on contributing $1k a month once I am debt-free.

But of course, this means either delaying loan repayment into 2022 or missing out on the market until maybe the end of the year, and it's not unreasonable to believe I'd make more than 0.5% in the market compared to my high yield savings account. I wouldn't withdraw though, these would be long-term investments on top of my Roth.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling a little lost, I have several paths in front of me, but I just don't know which one to take, and I believe standing still is not the correct choice. Any insight is much appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Why is the general advice to pay student loans before funding your IRA? People talk about interest rates but shouldn‚Äôt the time that your IRA funds will be invested be considered also?,"So I‚Äôve been on my personal finance journey since mid 2019 and since then have started contributing 10% to my 401k and now maxing out my IRA.

I have about 20k in student loans left that are deferred, with the highest interest rate across the 5 loans being 4.66%. I know I‚Äôm not paying anything until September, but in general the advice I see is that you should pay debts down before you fund your IRA, which doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.

Yes, there is a guaranteed return of 4.66% by paying the loans, but if I‚Äôm scheduled to pay them off in 10 years just by paying the minimum, wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to fund my IRA first because of how much more time it will have to grow?

I know this comes down to simple math but I need someone to explain it. My plan is to max my IRA before making any additional payments on my loans.",finance

I transferred money into my ROTH IRA on 2/19, and it is on a hold until 3/1.  My money shows it's available to trade, but when I try to buy the website tells me that transaction would exceed available funds.  According to the Vanguard Rep, Vanguard has begun placing holds on transfers into your account for 7 calendar days (Apparently, it's not their rule, but a new federal rule).  My money was transferred after the end of the business day Friday (East coast time, I live on the west coast so this came back to bite me).  The hold does not start until the next business day after the transfer is initiated so in my case today...

Friday 2/19 Transfer initiated after business hours East Coast time.

Monday 2/22 Technical date of transfer initiation (The next business day).

Tuesday 2/23 Hold Begins.

Monday 3/1 Hold ends and I have access to my funds.

**10 total calendar days.**

Sadly, due to this new rule, I missed out on some good dips today, but so is life.

According the the rep at Vanguard, the reason the Fed placed this new holding rule in response to a stock that can't be named here, but they sell games. I'm sorry if this was a little wordy, I wanted to explain the situation to the best of my ability so others know what to expect.

I would also like to add - the Vanguard Rep was really nice, he even told me he thought the hold was extreme.


Edit to add:  I have been with Vanguard for 13 years, and the dollar amount of this transfer is less than 1% of my total portfolio, so they are not factoring in if you are an established client and whether you have the ability to cover the transfer if something goes wrong.  

Edit: Someone else mentioned they didn‚Äôt get the hold placed on them, so Vanguard must have some sort of parameters they are working off of and not sharing.",finance

I feel like I am absolutely fucked. Every time I set a good pace for not using my credit cards, something comes up and I cannot afford otherwise.

investing,Let‚Äôs talk about interest rates and stocks,"With rising rates being covered widely in the news the past few days, I have grown more confused between the relationship between rates and stocks than ever before.

I have long been told that rates will move inverse to bond prices (obviously true), and that an increase in price in some asset is typically caused by an increase in demand for that asset.

So, I am confused why, as rates have increased (bond prices down) we have seen stocks come under so much pressure.

If rates are increasing without announcements from the FED, should we not assume that it‚Äôs because there is reduced demand for bonds (and therefore increases demand for stocks)??

Or, have people as a whole just decided bonds are worth less without actually seeing significant changes in the volume of demand?

personalfinance,Personal loan to pay off Credit Card Debt?,"Hi, I'm asking this because I made some rather irresponsible financial decisions While trying to build my credit while I was a student.

I recently learned about cash out refinancing and I am trying to gather more information to see if it is a good move to make. I would like to hear people's perspectives of it.

I bought my house for $155K in NJ. Zillow estimates that its worth $290K. The amount left on my mortgage is $87K. Interest rate is 3.875%. 30 year mortgage, I have 20 years left. My monthly payment of mortgage + taxes + home insurance is $1200. The Zillow rent estimate is $2100/mo. Single family house with 3 bedrooms +2 bathrooms.

I was thinking of doing a cash out refinance to buy a new house that would be my primary residence and to rent out my current property. (Also, I want to mention that I don't have any other debt besides mortgage, and I have a 820 credit score, $96K salary where I have been at that employment for over a year).

I am still trying to wrap my head around this tactic but would cash out refinancing at this time, since interest rates are so low, allow me to get a lower interest rate on the new higher mortgage? Then should I hold on to the money I decide to cash out until prices for houses get better (I believe since there is a higher demand for houses now that house prices are higher as people bid for them)?

Its website, which says the firm uses a ‚Äúquantamental‚Äù strategy blending quantitative research with a private equity discipline, was in ‚Äúmaintenance mode‚Äù on Monday night.

&gt;In an emailed statement, Velissaris‚Äôs attorneys, Sean Hecker and Michael Ferrara, said: ‚ÄúOur client has acted in good faith throughout his tenure at Infinity Q and will continue to do so moving forward. His focus has always been on delivering and preserving value for investors.‚Äù

&gt;Infinity Q was using models provided by an outside pricing service to determine the value of the swap contracts, according to the request filed with the SEC for permission to suspend redemptions. Based on information provided by the SEC, Infinity Q found out last week that the firm‚Äôs CIO had been ‚Äúadjusting certain parameters‚Äù within the models that affected the valuation of the swaps, the firm said in a filing.


&gt;The Diversified Value Fund held swap contracts with a fair value of $449 million at the end of November, equaling about 26% of its $1.71 billion in net assets at the time, according to its most recent portfolio report to the SEC. This included so-called variance swap contracts written by a wide range of Wall Street banks that were tied to the volatility of global market benchmarks, such as the S&amp;P 500 index.


&gt;Leonard Potter, Infinity Q‚Äôs non-executive chairman, will take over management of the firm. Potter is the owner of Wildcat Capital Management, which managed more than $3 billion at the end of 2019, including capital from Bonderman.


&gt;The Diversified Alpha Fund‚Äôs institutional shares have gained almost 1% year-to-date, performance that ranked below almost 90% of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

[**Investment Firm Halts Redemptions on $1.8 Billion
Fund**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investment-firm-halts-redemptions-on-1-8-billion-fund-11614090454#:~:text=Investment%20firm%20Infinity%20Q%20Capital,issues%20valuing%20the%20fund's%20holdings.)

&gt;Investment firm Infinity Q Capital Management LLC asked the Securities and Exchange
Commission to halt redemptions on a $1.8 billion fund and is looking to liquidate its
holdings.


&gt;The request comes after the firm was unable to value some of its holdings, which include
swaps, in one of its funds. Infinity Q had about $3 billion in assets under management at
the end of January, with roughly $1.8 billion belonging to its Infinity Q Diversified Alpha
Fund, according to an SEC filing. The fund employed strategies across several markets,
including derivatives, stocks, and futures, according to FactSet.

&gt;Halting redemptions is an unusual move, since mutual funds offer freedom to cash out at
any time, and it suggests severe problems at the firm. Third Avenue Management LLC
halted redemptions in one of its credit funds in 2015, a move that shocked the market, left
a black mark on the firm and spurred worries about the wider bond market.


&gt;The SEC informed Infinity Q‚Äôs non-executive chairman, Len Potter, that staff had evidence
that the firm‚Äôs Chief Investment Officer James Velissaris ‚Äúhad been adjusting parameters‚Äù
of pricing models that were used to value derivatives in the fund‚Äôs portfolio, according to
a spokesman for Infinity Q. As a result, incorrect valuations were likely being reported to
investors. The spokesman said in a statement that the firm is ‚Äúcooperating with the SEC
investigation‚Äù and has cut off Mr. Velissaris‚Äôs access to trading.

Pour one out for mah liquid alts homies.

e: Looks like the ""mispriced"" swaps were around 17-20% of the portfolio, and the word I'm hearing is that the company (Infinity Q) is treating this basically like it's deliberate fraud.  So this is a pretty wild thing to happen in the mutual fund world.  It looks like there was some potentially systemic overvaluation with regard to their swaps in order to make performance look better than it was.  I realize most people aren't super familiar with this stuff but 40 act funds are super regulated, this sort of thing just does not happen much at all.  

realistically this should serve as a bit of a cautionary tale to anyone who's interested in looking in to the alts space, or anything that has some investments that aren't publicly listed and able to easily be marked to market.",finance
personalfinance,Defaulting my private student loans,"Looking for advice and consequences of doing whats mentioned in the subject: defaulting on my student loans. Here's my situation:

I am 25
Make about 30-35k a year in MA
I have 110,000 in student debt 7.5%, $850 a month
Have a car I'm financing and no assets 
No cosigner's

So my thought process here is me defaulting might hurt me in the short run. It'll ruin my credit score for a foreseeable amount of years and cause me to have to deal with courts. That being said my quality of life is significantly hindered by these loans I have to pay about $850 a month and it's causing my finances and day to day life to be significantly worse. Throughout the pandemic I have been just short of making ends meet but finding a way to do it and I'm fed up with it. I don't want to have to live like this anymore, and I looked into federal refinance programs and they only consolidate other federal loans. 

My question here is is it financially strategic to default at this point? And if so what are the repercussions and could I ultimately pay less overall?",finance

GRaDAS (19 Start): Welcome to the final test. When done, place the device on file.

You need to use both hands to retrieve the controller from the Upgrade Center. Wash before the cake.

GRaDAS (19 End): Thank you. In the above test it. Every science remains safe operating until the four Kelvin. No fixed powers, buried before the beauty of the malfunction. Thank you for your help, and participating in a computer program in Computer Science things. Goodbye.

GRaDAS (Escape fire pit): How are you? Stop! I...take the authority of the final challenge, we pretend to be killed. We are happy for their success. We are a gathering to commemorate your great success. It was their stomachs. It spread to the enemy's land, and his weapon was on him. I can't lie. I will pick a partner to create a small party. Pay attention to the trial and leave the country. Begin to break some materials into pieces and place them behind the site.

GRaDAS (Escape 1): Hey? Where are you? I know you're there. I'm listening to your voice here.

GRaDAS (Escape 2): How do you do? You can not escape, you know.We're not going right the way through. Hello? Is anyone there?

GRaDAS (Revisit Test Chamber): Okay. The test is over. I won. The recovery goes sideways. Because of the cake cloud. This test is fun, and we are all impressed with how much you won. The test is over. Please come back.

GRaDAS (Revisit Test Chamber 2) Oh, cut me the cake. I told them to wait for you, but I did it anyway. If that happened, there are still some left.

GRaDAS (Vertical Crusher Room): They are also not going in the right direction. What do you think of where you are going? Because I don't think you're going where you think you're going. Hello?

GRaDAS (Ceiling-to-ceiling Crushers): It wasn‚Äôt fun, though? When the platform collapsed in the oven and said goodbye, it was like \[not at all\], and I was like, ""Did we pretend to kill you?"" That was great! Je! Is there anyone there?

GRaDAS (Vertical Wall Crushers): He will not be here. It is safe for you. It is not too late to go back. I'm not mad. Go back to the field test.

GRaDAS (Pre-Fight): You found me. Thank you. Was it worth it? Because, despite his violent behavior, he has so far managed to break my heart. You might be able to take advantage of it and we'll call it someday. I think we both know it's impossible. He chose this path. Now I have something to ask myself. Surprised by five, four ...

GRaDAS (Morality Core Drop): Exit for the second time. Not necessarily so. Look what happened to me. What's that? No, it's impossible ... I've never seen it. This is not a bar. I'll make the bed later ... I ... because you will die.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): Where is the item from?

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): I don‚Äôt care, I think the road there will somehow make your life worse.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): I don't want to talk about you, but if I were you I would leave you alone.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): Do you think I‚Äôm trying to deceive you with psychology? So that's it.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): Well, I don't want to touch me. Give it to me.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): Frankly speaking, instead of talking to us, because he knows his job. Just put it in the corner and do it later.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): That is for seating. Wipe everything and continue.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): My girlfriend for marriage. You want to get married, not me. What do you think?

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): If you lie? Here it was. Trust me, leave me alone.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): Already heavy. It's crazy, this is part of the test protocol.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): Nevertheless, one must be ignorant and prevent them.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): What do you think that he wants to know if the Lord?

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): However, you can hear me when I come.

GRaDAS (Hold Morality Core): I told you what it was, not yours. Sit alone.

GRaDAS (Burn Morality Core): You are kidding. Have you knowledge of the hole just stopped? For we know that the knowledge of the knowledge of those who work in an emergency, having a censor, as the aperture.

GRaDAS (Burn Morality Core): Because things are crazy. Wow wow wow.

\[Voice with slow changes. The more fluently it is pronounced, the less attractive it will be with a computer\]

GRaDAS (Burn Morality Core): That is good news to know that he had hardly suffered in the fire.

GRaDAS (Burn Morality Core): However, when I entered the Flood Control Center, there was no room to create cancer prevention strategies. I knew I was dead here, it was impossible to ask. They are in the middle. Do not burn it because you know that neurotoxins contain toxins. Messages.

GRaDAS (Burn Morality Core): I am very glad it has neuroma vapor in it.

GRaDAS (Burn Morality Core): Yes. This facility can have many additional responsibilities. I can't lock the tower.

GRaDAS (Burn Morality Core): Ok. Before you go to bed, Rocket. Hope is more painful than neurotoxin.

GRaDAS (Burn Morality Core): Well, if he does not do, and what do you want me to do to you.

GRaDAS (Burn Morality Core): His plan was to fight back and kill her. Especially the palmerworm, unable to move.

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): What you told me, they burned it without trying. This unit is a liquid sound of calcium. Are the shoes made?

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): Not only, therefore, to our knowledge.

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): Invalid. There is a murder case. Who are you and what do you care about?

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): It will be the opposite. You will feel the pain.

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): But I do not know. That this is the case?

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): I give unto thee, hearken unto me: I said, I do not care. Are you listening?

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): I thought. I am with you: I

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): It is not the word of the Lord came to he was a great man, how much less do a lot more to the death, at last be a beginner.

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): What is happening? Did he say something?

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): And he waited. Not because he speaks.

GRaDAS (General Battle Lines): Prolix.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): The latest loss you think you do? For two plus two ... ten. FOUR ugly? Good job!

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): This is a long-term survival after being interested in your account. Yes, greetings like this are part of me.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): Which is so very sad to say, that it is not to catch up more quickly than it can be to be a neurotoxin.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): I like to point out that the chat is approaching.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): This is your wedding. She feasted for all the brothers and friends.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): I called friends and allies. No doubt, that can not be killed.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): Or, there is no friendship. But it is not me no pleasure in them.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): These are the ones in the file at the same time: unreliable. I love you. He will not weep for the bitterness that he did with the desert.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): ""There will be no blue."" Exactly the same. Very formal, very formal.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): It also says that you are approved. The car is also a joke.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): If you speak with longing, legally, ie. After your death, you have to be careful that you do not want to show up? Guess what: I know.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): Please explain to the end of the first one that doesn't bother me.

GRaDAS (Curiosity Core Burned): Here's a hint: you want to save as much money as possible in the next two minutes.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): MSB Mammals ... \[cough\] \[cough\] Thus leads to death ... \[cough\] Choking ... \[laughs\] Kidding me?

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): When I talk seriously about neurological taxes, it's downright irony.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): I can take a bath with cereal and rub it in my eyes. To be honest, it wasn't serious for me.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): On the other hand, its death will not be so sweet.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): Said Cook, who, when he is gone, and what do you do? What about you?

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): To waste time. Trust me, there isn't a lot of junk.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): What do you mean? The last thing I want to do is hurt you.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): In case. Power can safely scan the brain.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): I mean, don't you believe me? Dress: \[Hello!\] Is that you? This is foolishness.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): In order to account of the injuries, he had to keep it.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): You do not know you are not a scientist. You never know when he will be a doctor. You still need to be an employee. When are you alive?

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): When they leave the house, find the life of laughs. Everything has changed. What do you want here?

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): It is understood that there is no God‚Äôs almighty power, so I believe this will never happen again.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): What I do know is that we can stand them. Ehh.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): If you intend to create a moisturizer at your own risk.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): What's in the works?

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): Death can stop kicking in the adult, otherwise I will remove you.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): Please wait! That is enough. It was removed. Now you're dead anyway.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): Rush into the boat; but believe me, you are dead.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): On the side of that was left, so as not to go on to infinity, removed hath been the joy of the. I just beat you a permanent record.

GRaDAS (Cake Core Burned): There are mathematical flaws in your life. I need to fix the mistake.

GRaDAS (Defeated): There really is a cake icing.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, February 23, 2021. What a crazy day!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, February 23, 2021**

The market was extremely volatile today. After opening deep in the red, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) was able to reverse to close marginally positive. The sell-off in technology stocks continued, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) once again underperforming. The recent pressure on the market comes after a spike in the 10-year Treasury yield that has market participants concerned that inflation will begin to rise. 

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered his semiannual monetary policy testimony, offering another update on his view for the path forward for monetary policy during and after the pandemic. In his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, ""The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases."" 

In Washington, The U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee voted to advance President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion virus relief proposal on Monday, bringing it a step closer to passage ahead of a mid-March cliff, after which federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. 

In the last week or two, market participants have been eyeing a sharp spike in Treasury yields, raising concerns of a surge in borrowing costs and inflationary pressures in the post-pandemic economy. The benchmark 10-year yield hovered around 1.36% for its highest level in a year, after wallowing below 1% for most of 2020. That said, the Treasury yield remains at historically low levels. While we expect the spike in the yield to put pressure on the market, our long-term bull thesis remains intact.

Yesterday she went to an accountant and filed her federal taxes and they said since it's Texas they don't file state tax returns.

I'm wondering if there's a way to still file for Minnesota taxes because she's usually eligible for a refund ($500-$800) and it would be nice to have the extra cash. I looked on TurboTax if it's possible to just do state tax returns through it and it said no because they use the federal info to fill out the state forms. There might be a slim chance the accountant she went to yesterday still hasn't filed them and we can just tell them not to so I can do all of her taxes on TurboTax, but would anyone know of any other options we can take? If not, we will just let it go.

CryptoCurrency,For the Newbies: a summary and analysis of XRP and Ripple to help you make up your own mind...or at least better understand the controversy.,"If you‚Äôre new to crypto and especially alts, you‚Äôve probably wondered about XRP. Maybe you did a search for it on r/cc, or maybe you were brave enough to ask about it. If this is you, I‚Äôm guessing your inquiry ended with a dismissive ‚ÄúXRP is a centralized shit coin.‚Äù If that didn‚Äôt scare you away from digging deeper, it‚Äôs likely the pending SEC lawsuit did. Unfortunately, facts take a back seat to rhetoric around here. Maybe XRP is dogshit, but shouldn‚Äôt you at least be able to articulate why? And if it isn‚Äôt, wouldn‚Äôt you want to know so that you could allocate some of your investment before it moons? This long post is for the new people with open minds who are interested in educating themselves about one of the major projects in this space. I‚Äôm probably going to offend XRP haters and the XRP army alike, because both tend to cling to their narratives like junkies.

Disclaimer: XRP is my largest holding by buy-in, so I‚Äôm obviously biased.

**Background**

XRP was created by 3 people: David Schwartz, Arthur Britto, and Jed Mccaleb in 2012 after they became frustrated with Bitcoin‚Äôs scaling issues. 100 billion XRP were created in the genesis block, and no more will ever be made. This already brings us to our first myth that Ripple can print more XRP whenever they want‚Äîthey cannot. The XRP ledger (XRPL) has a sandbox built in so that any proposal which would result in the creation of more XRP is automatically rejected.

Shortly after XRP‚Äôs creation, Ripple the company was created and headquartered in San Francisco, although they may be moving to the crypto-friendlier Wyoming. The founders gifted the XRP they created to Ripple. The XRP army loves to highlight the fact that XRP‚Äôs existence predates Ripple‚Äôs; and while that‚Äôs technically true, it functionally doesn‚Äôt matter because 1) the same people were involved, 2) we‚Äôre only talking about a few months, and 3) at the time, XRP truly was centralized by any metric. At the time, the company didn‚Äôt have a clear vision and ‚ÄúRipple‚Äù was used interchangeably for the company, the cryptocurrency, the ledger, and several other products and features. However, in recent years and in this post, XRP will mean the cryptocurrency and Ripple will mean the international payments company.

Schwartz and Bitto still work for Ripple to this day. Jed got in a fight with the founders of Ripple (including Chris Larsen) and left Ripple to found Stellar. Despite what you may have heard, XLM is NOT a fork of XRP. They share many of the same features, but there is no shared ledger history like BCH has with BTC. Jed also walked away with billions of XRP. Ripple was concerned he would dump them on the market (which he was planning to do), so they took Jed to court and succeeded in imposing selling restrictions on him under which he still operates. [You can follow his activity here](https://bithomp.com/explorer/tacostand). During the legal battle, Ripple convinced an exchange Jed was using to freeze his account until the litigation was settled, giving rise to the myth that Ripple can freeze XRPL accounts. This is completely false. An exchange froze Jed‚Äôs account on that exchange. No freeze occurred on the XRPL. The XRPL has (probably the first) built in decentralized exchange. While the exchange itself is decentralized because the ledger is decentralized, XRP is the only asset on that exchange that‚Äôs decentralized. All other issuances are collateralized (similar to Tether); so while the trade can occur in a decentralized way, the digital asset itself won‚Äôt be unless it‚Äôs XRP (more on the centralization debate later).

Ripple also realized that investors were apprehensive about Ripple being able to dump on the market, so they locked up their holdings into 55 escrows of 1 billion XRP each. Every month, 1 billion is unlocked from escrow, Ripple sells some, and puts the rest back into a new escrow. Nobody, not even Ripple, has access to escrowed XRP until they‚Äôre time released. [Ripple publishes exactly how many are sold in quarterly reports](https://ripple.com/insights/q4-2020-xrp-markets-report/). While many cryptocurrency creators sell their tokens to fund development, I‚Äôm not aware of any other crypto project that publishes data about it. About 18 months ago, Ripple addressed concerns that they were still selling too much by calibrating their sales to the data of an analysis firm which strips wash trading from exchange volume.

Detractors of XRP love to point to Jed dumping and Ripple dumping as a reason XRP is no good. For some reason, it‚Äôs ok to sell XLM even though both Ripple and the Stellar Foundation hold an identical % of the total supply, and the Steller CEO is one of the people dumping XRP, but whatever. This is actually a point where I agree with the haters. The XRP army likes to point to the fact that Jed and Ripple‚Äôs sales amount to only a fraction of a % of daily volume, but in my opinion this is very misleading for two reasons. First, it doesn‚Äôt take into account the XRP that reaches the market through other means such as partner sales. Second, daily volume isn‚Äôt the best metric. As is indicated in the analytics reports cited in Ripple‚Äôs quarterly reports, daily volume includes crypto-crypto volume, for example BTC-XRP or USDT-XRP trading pairs. I read the company‚Äôs methodology and can tell you that it does adjust for wash trading by bots and such, but not for run-of-the-mill swing trading. While I commend Ripple for trying to be more transparent and for reigning in their sales, I have to point out that they aren‚Äôt selling XRP for BTC‚Äîthey‚Äôre selling for dollars. There are only so many new, real dollars coming into crypto and even fewer into XRP. Ripple is taking real dollars, not swing trader USDT, out of the market. All that being said, the degree to which you think Ripple and Jed‚Äôs sales impact the price is pretty much governed by whether you like or hate XRP. It‚Äôs also worth noting that about a year ago, Ripple stopped selling directly to retail (exchanges). They instead only sell OTC; although as the SEC will point out, the OTC buyers can then turn around and sell on exchanges.

**Specs**

So what does XRP do anyway? First let‚Äôs talk specs, and then we‚Äôll talk use cases. XRP is meant to be a medium of exchange just like BTC. As mentioned, it has a fixed supply like BTC, although that supply is 100 billion with each coin divisible into 1 million fragments called drops (compare to BTC‚Äôs 21 million with each coin divisible into 100 million satoshis). XRP can do 1,500 transactions per second (tps) onchain today compared to BTC‚Äôs 3-7. Second layer solutions like Lightning Network can be used on XRP, but they haven‚Äôt been developed as they haven‚Äôt been needed yet. Transactions are fully settled in about 3-5 seconds, whereas BTC transactions are only ever probabilistically settled and take at least 20 minutes if you want two confirmations and get to the front of the line. Since there are no miners to pay, transaction fees are about 1/1000 if a penny. Unlike in BTC and other proof of work (PoW) coins, the fee is not an incentive to secure the network and process transactions; rather, it‚Äôs a spam prevention measure. To spam the XRPL, you‚Äôd have to pay tiny fees which would add up if you were sending millions of dummy transactions. If the network gets jammed from high use, fees go up making a spam attack progressively more expensive. The fees themselves are burned out of existence forever.

The fact that the fees are burned has led to some in the XRP army to claim that XRP is deflationary, which is pretty fucking stupid. The reason it‚Äôs stupid is because Ripple‚Äôs sales, while a small % of daily volume, outpace XRP burned from transaction fees by many orders of magnitude. If you struggle with this concept (looking at you Matt from the Moon Lambo channel), [I suggest you brush up on base vs broad money supply](https://youtu.be/wBqxD9zKzlo).

XRP addresses have a message field, and XRP transactions have a comment field. It may not allow for the most robust meta-data, but it allows some important utility. The comment field is really handy for enterprise use because it can be used for things like an invoice number, a bill of lading, or product information. The message field is what allowed XRP addresses to point to a Spark address for the upcoming airdrop. Also, XRP destination addresses have the option of using a ‚Äútag,‚Äù which is like an address within an address. You‚Äôll often be prompted to provide a tag when sending XRP to an exchange. This is an ingenious feature. I‚Äôve seen a lot of discussions in other coins‚Äô subreddits regarding the backend difficulty of accepting payments. If you have 50,000 customers sending to your same address, how do you differentiate between whose payments belongs to which customer? Alternatively, you could generate an address for each customer and then combine them later, but that‚Äôs a ton of work. Yes, I know there are services that take care of this for a fee, but it‚Äôs pretty cool that XRP (and XLM) provide this as a base layer built-in feature.

The XRPL does not currently support smart contracts (although FlareNetworks is going to solve that for XRP, LTC, Doge, and eventually all the other pure payment cryptos like BTC). However, we are very close to having ‚Äúhooks‚Äù for the XRPL. Hooks are a development from a separate company from Ripple. [They‚Äôll allow you to do simple things like only accept payments above a certain amount, or only accept payments from certain addresses](https://coil.com/p/XUMM/XRPL-Labs-is-working-on-the-transaction-HOOKS-amendment-for-the-XRP-Ledger-Supporting-business-logic/kEmqhoqMW). To be clear, these are simple smart contracts that are not Turing complete, but still provide some nice functionality.

Finally, as mentioned, the XRPL has a built in DEX. This DEX also has a pathfinding feature which will find the least expensive conversion for any desired trade based on whatever‚Äôs currently trading on it.

**Use Cases**

While XRP can be used for everyday payments, Ripple the company is focused on cross border payments. You can‚Äôt really have a comprehensive analysis of XRP without discussing the legacy cross border payment system, its faults, and how Ripple improves it. Here‚Äôs how cross border payments work today:

Pretend I‚Äôm a US bank and one of my customers has family in Mexico. His money is in an account at my bank and he wants to send some to his family, but I don‚Äôt have a branch in Mexico. If I did, the transfer would be completely internal‚Äîand I would only have to update my own records, but I don‚Äôt. Enter the nostro/vostro account. A nostro account is an account that my US bank has in a Mexican bank. Yes, my bank has a bank account at a foreign bank, and it just sits there until I need it. Of course, my customers may need to send money to Singapore or Chile or Thailand, so I‚Äôd need to park money in local banks in those countries as well. It‚Äôs estimated that $27 Trillion sits dormant in nostro/vostro accounts world-wide.

That‚Äôs all well and good if my bank is huge and has tons of money to park all over the world in different currencies, but what if I‚Äôm a local bank? This is what people who slam XRP as a ‚Äúbanker‚Äôs coin‚Äù never acknowledge: not all banks are evil. Some serve local communities by supplying mortgages, construction loans, business lines of credit, etc. These smaller banks don‚Äôt have the money to park all over the world, so they pay fees to the largest 6 banks to use their nostro accounts. The large banks then charge the small banks a fee which they have no choice but to pay. Large banks like this system because they already have the economies of scale which places them in an eternal power position over small banks. Small banks don‚Äôt like it because they can‚Äôt compete on a level playing field with the big banks.

Ok, so maybe I failed to stir your sympathies for the poor little banks, but let‚Äôs keep a few other things in mind. First, those fees are passed on to the customer. For migrant workers sending money home, the fees can be a significant percent of the payment. Second, international money transfers take around 5-7 business days. In an age where you can order a burrito delivered to your house in a few minutes, waiting days for payments to settle is inexcusable. Fourth, the way these payments are processed is through a 50 year old international banking messaging network called SWIFT, and SWIFT has a self-reported failure rate of 6%, meaning that 6% of payments fail and require human intervention. Fifth, SWIFT is not capable of telling the sender how much of the local currency will be received on the other side of the transaction. You might want to read that last one again. When you send a payment cross-border, due to exchange rate fluctuation, combined with long settlement times, SWIFT cannot tell a sender how much will be paid out in destination currency by the time the payment processes. In business, this makes all kinds of hedging necessary for companies who have receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. Before Ripple, SWIFT had no incentive to innovate. Ripple lit a fire under everyone‚Äôs ass in the banking world, and now they‚Äôre all scrambling to update they‚Äôre systems.

So how does Ripple improve on SWIFT? Ripple came up with the idea of putting a bridge currency in the middle of all cross border payments. It works like this: US bank buys XRP with dollars on a US exchange and sends those XRP to a Mexican exchange where they‚Äôre sold for Pesos which are delivered to the recipient. This whole process takes about 1-2 minutes.

This has some major benefits. First, you don‚Äôt need to park money all over the world, so that money can be freed up for other uses. Second, you don‚Äôt need to hold every currency on earth, just your local one. Building on this, the less obvious benefit is the opening up of illiquid corridors. A lot of money moves between the Euro and the Yen, so that pairing has tight spreads on forex markets and the corridor has little friction. But what if you want to send money from Tasmania to Saudi Arabia? In order for a trade pair to exist, someone has to be willing to tie up their capital in those two currencies and just leave them up for trade. No one wants to do that for illiquid pairs with little activity. This means that for smaller countries to do business with each other, they need to use dollars which puts the US at a huge advantage globally. In some cases, countries are basically cut off from the global economy.

It‚Äôs obvious by now that cross border payments are a huge problem, and a great opportunity to whomever can solve it. Unfortunately, banks are skittish about transacting in crypto due to regulatory uncertainty. Ripple dealt with bank‚Äôs reluctance by building a messaging system of its own to rival SWIFT, which at the time they called X-current. This was appealing to banks, because it was a vast improvement over SWIFT and it didn‚Äôt require them to use XRP. However, it still did not eliminate the need for nostro accounts. Through this product, Ripple built a lot of relationships and[signed hundreds of customers](https://ripple.com/customers/). Critics of XRP love to point to the fact that most of Ripple‚Äôs customers were only using X-current which doesn‚Äôt create a demand for XRP, which is fair. Ripple was counting on a day arriving when regulators got their act together regarding crypto. In the meantime, they integrated all their products into one product and rebranded it On Demand Liquidity (ODL). Basically, they got all the milk and cookies ready hoping one day Santa would show up. ODL had the XRP-as-a-bridge-currency feature built into it so that existing customers could just say the word and with the push of a button they‚Äôd be fulling integrated. We‚Äôll come back to the probability of this happening at the end of the post.

Customers are one thing, but to make ODL work they‚Äôd also need corridors. This means they need exchanges in different countries that would support ODL (not a hard sell since they‚Äôd earn fees for doing so). The exchanges need to be stable (can‚Äôt have an exit scam leaving banks with no way to make cross border payments!). Those exchanges need to be compliant with local laws, know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML), etc. Ripple hired a bunch of experts to help navigate the regulatory waters in the countries where they operate and formed relations with governments, central banks, the IMF and the BIS.

In 2019, Ripple had their first big win. MoneyGram was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed cash. Ripple had lots of cash and needed a guinea pig. Ripple bought a 10% share of MG. In return, MG started using ODL. It was going good, and ODL reached $2 billion in settlements and represented 10% of the flows from the US to Mexico. Then the SEC thing happened (more on that later) and MG stopped using ODL, although per their most recent earnings call, the contract is still in effect and they‚Äôll be looking for ways to continue working with Ripple and ODL as regulation gets clearer.

That was a lot about cross border payments; but keep in mind that‚Äôs only Ripple‚Äôs focus. Ripple understands that XRP can be used for a lot of other cool stuff, but they didn‚Äôt want to take employee manpower away from an already monumentally difficult task to pursue these other use cases. So they created a separate company to fund other projects that helped grow XRP‚Äôs use cases. Some of these use cases include web monetization (streaming micropayments to websites and content creators rather than seeing ads or paywalls), gaming (making quick payments for in-game features and items), music streaming, video hosting, and others. Remember, XRP is use case agnostic just like BTC even if Ripple is focused on their customers (banks).

I‚Äôll conclude this section by pointing out that when you pay a transaction fee to a BTC miner, that miner has to pay the electric company and the hardware manufacturer. The money doesn‚Äôt do anything to expand the BTC ecosystem. When Ripple sells XRP, they reinvest in the XRP ecosystem.

**Centralized Shitcoin (or is it?)**

That was a lot of background, so let‚Äôs get to the really contentious part. Is XRP centralized? If you listen to Reddit, the answer is unequivocally ‚Äúyes.‚Äù In my opinion, XRP is more centralized than some coins like Cardano or Nano, but less centralized than BTC. This is going to be the most controversial section and I know I‚Äôll be ripped to shreds in the comments. **I have two requests for those who want to challenge my claims. First, that you define your terms. Second that you apply them consistently**.

I want you, dear reader, to ask yourself a question: what does it mean to be centralized or decentralized? Make a mental checklist. I would submit there are different criteria you could use, and that for each criterion there is a spectrum of centralization.

Most people call XRP centralized because the founders and Ripple control such a large percent of the circulating supply. While I don‚Äôt believe this is the most defining metric of centralization, I‚Äôll concede it‚Äôs more important than the XRP army will admit. If a central company has the power to crash the price through dumping, and if the resulting price crash adversely affects user confidence in the asset‚Äôs stability, that‚Äôs a centralizing factor in my opinion. The XRP army will argue that ‚ÄúRipple would never do that because it‚Äôs in their best interest that XRP has a stable market presence.‚Äù That‚Äôs true, but just because they wouldn‚Äôt, doesn‚Äôt mean they couldn‚Äôt. [I‚Äôve made the argument that China could kill Bitcoin](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ki3e94/if_you_support_the_future_of_cryptocurrency_dump/ggoqfcl?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3), and just because they wouldn‚Äôt, doesn‚Äôt meant they couldn‚Äôt. So to avoid being hypocritical I would say that the concentration of XRP in Ripple‚Äôs coffers is a tick in the centralization column.

However, I ask that if you want to plant your flag on the concentration of supply that you do so consistently. I don‚Äôt see why this sub hates XRP but loves XLM when the championing organizations behind both hold exactly the same percent of the total supply. Is it because the Stellar Foundation is a non-profit? Because that‚Äôs irrelevant. They still fundraise through sales of the coin, and they still pay executives lavishly. There‚Äôs a little thing in law called ‚Äúsubstance over form,‚Äù and it means the fact that the Stellar Foundation filed a different piece of paper when they were created is irrelevant. And how about Chainlink? Or Algorand? Have you checked those circulating supplies vs the organization‚Äôs holdings? Why do they get a pass, but XRP is garbage? Is it because XRP is a legitimate threat to your beloved gas-guzzling BTC? And while we‚Äôre on the subject of BTC, have you checked the address concentration? It‚Äôs not great. There are a few addresses that could easily crash the price if they sold; and unlike in XRP a price crash poses a HUGE security threat in PoW coins. Asset concentration affects almost every coin. It sucks, but it is what it is.

Another factor in the centralization debate is who maintains the code. We all rely on these coins to work, but how many of us dig into their GitHub‚Äôs and poke around? Probably not many, and even fewer contribute to the code base. There‚Äôs no question that Ripple has the most active contributors to the XRP code of any party. They have the people to troubleshoot if something goes wrong. However, remember I mentioned hooks earlier? That‚Äôs a contribution to the XRP codebase that isn‚Äôt coming from Ripple proper. So there are actually other parties developing on XRP and making meaningful contributions to the code. It may not be as diverse a developer base as other projects, but it‚Äôs not the least diverse either. Let‚Äôs say XRP falls somewhere in the middle in this category.

Finally, let‚Äôs talk about what most rational people would consider the most important category in determining whether a coin is centralized, which is permission. While the factors above are pertinent, they become irrelevant if a single entity has special permissions over the blockchain (this is why I won‚Äôt invest in QNT; it‚Äôs not even open source!). So let‚Äôs be clear: Ripple has no special permissions over the XRPL. If XRP was proof of stake, then Ripple‚Äôs large holdings would grant them controlling authority over the network, but it isn‚Äôt so they don‚Äôt. We‚Äôll talk about the consensus protocol shortly, but know that Ripple does not have special permissions. They can‚Äôt unilaterally do anything on the XRPL. They cannot freeze accounts; they cannot block access; they cannot implement code changes; then cannot issue new XRP; they cannot decide which transactions are valid and which aren‚Äôt. They have no special permissions. As an example, there was a recent code change that Ripple actually opposed, but the rest of the validators implemented anyway. Code changes require 80% consensus (compare to BTC‚Äôs 51%). Ripple makes up less than 8% of the validators. This example also speaks favorably to the ‚Äúwho maintains the code‚Äù criterion above.

It‚Äôs time to get a little technical, but I‚Äôll try to keep it simple. Let‚Äôs talk about the consensus protocol. I‚Äôm going to assume most people reading this are new to the space (or your bias would‚Äôve already sent you into a seething rage after my jabs at BTC), so for context let‚Äôs talk briefly about BTC. The most fundamental problem a cryptocurrency needs to solve is the double spend. If I have 0.5 BTC, and I‚Äôm able to send both Alice and Bob 0.5 BTC, that‚Äôs a problem. In traditional finance, banks perform this function, but in a decentralized database (blockchain), it‚Äôs a more complicated issue to make sure everyone has the same information regarding the order of transactions.

You probably know that BTC has people called miners. When I broadcast a transaction to the BTC network, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúhash‚Äù which for simplicity‚Äôs sake you can think of as a random number (I know it‚Äôs more complicated than that, but it‚Äôs close enough for rock n roll). Miners run computers which guess that random number. Whoever guesses it first is rewarded with the transaction fees from the sender and with new BTC which is minted. Since BTC has a set inflation rate, the network has to adjust the difficulty of guessing that random number based on the computing power being used to guess it; otherwise, as more people mined with better and better hardware, the inflation rate would be too fast. So in the beginning there was Satoshi and a laptop. He was the only miner, so the hashing difficulty was easy. He mined a million Bitcoins and he saw that it was good. Then he told some friends and they turned on their laptops and the difficulty increased. Then Elon made a tweet, and the Federal Reserve fucked up their one job, and everyone wanted BTC. More people mining means the difficulty increased to the point where laptops don‚Äôt cut it. They moved from CPUs to GPUs, to ASICS where you basically cut out things like an operating system and just run SHA 256 on a circuit. Pretty soon you‚Äôll need a nuclear reactor, or a neutron star, or the infinity gauntlet to mine BTC. And let‚Äôs remember what this accomplishes: security‚Äîavoiding the double spend. So if you could accomplish the same thing; but didn‚Äôt have to destroy the planet, and nuke all the polar bears, and turn the earth in to a hellscape like Venus, would that be a good thing? If you‚Äôre a BTC maxi, the answer is ‚Äúno.‚Äù Somewhere along the line, the means were confused with the end.

However, not everyone is a moron. The XRP developers realized there are easier ways to order transactions that are just as secure. Anybody can run a validator on the XRPL. You can run a validator if you want. All validators do is tie break between equally valid transactions. If someone sent two conflicting transactions, the validators break the tie. That‚Äôs it. Each validator has its own Unique Node List (UNL). Each validator chooses its own UNL, although there is a recommended one which is the default. The XRPL doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúblocks,‚Äù it has ‚Äúledgers‚Äù‚Ä¶which are basically blocks. However, on the XRPL, every ledger contains current balances of accounts. When a validator receives a transaction, it‚Äôs relatively easy to check the transaction against the last known balance. If it‚Äôs bogus, and the validator is running normal XRP code, it throws the transaction away. If it seems legit, then it passes it along to its UNL buddies. If 80% agree, the transaction is broadcasted to the whole network. If the network accepts it, it goes in the next ledger. Note that validators don‚Äôt trust everyone in their UNLs individually; rather, they trust an 80% consensus within their own UNL. If a validator in the UNL starts proposing bogus transactions, the rest of the validators will simply remove it from the list of validators they listen to.

So is that centralized consensus? I don‚Äôt think so. Validators include banks, universities, Ripple, enthusiasts, Ripple partners, and oh yeah the SEC. Yeah, the SEC ran an XRP validator (so if Ripple loses their lawsuit we should sue the SEC for facilitating transactions with unregistered securities, and also for the LOLz). These validators are spread out over many countries. So I do not believe that in the most important category XRP is centralized. It‚Äôs certainly not the most decentralized by a long shot. But you will have to make up your own mind. I think that when you do, you should explicitly decide on the metric you used to make your decision and then you should use those same metrics, weighted the same way, when you evaluate any project.

**The SEC Lawsuit**

Hey, have you heard? XRP is a security!!!

People who call XRP a security are praying you don‚Äôt ask any follow up questions, because most of them don‚Äôt even know what that means. Here‚Äôs their logic:

1. Me hate XRP.

2. Being a security sounds bad.

3. XRP is a security!

Actually, a security in the US is something very specific (in theory) and was defined by the Supreme Court in *SEC v W.J. Howey Co* in 1946, a case that resulted in the infamous Howey Test. Basically, you can think of a security as a stock. When you buy Apple stock, you don‚Äôt participate in Apple‚Äôs operations. You just hope that management does a good job so they can pay you dividends and the stock will be worth as more in the future. In the Howey case, a company was selling land in Florida which held orange groves. Investors would pay money to Howey for ownership of the land and then lease it back to Howey to grow the oranges in return for money. In that case, the investors were not involved in the production of the oranges. They never visited the grounds. Howey did all the work. If Howey didn‚Äôt do the work, the oranges would die and the investors wouldn‚Äôt get any money in leasing fees.

The result of the case was the Howey Test which has four prongs. IN ORDER TO BE LABELED A SECURITY, THE ASSET MUST SATISFY ALL FOUR PRONGS‚Äîthree out of four is not enough. Let‚Äôs pause to consider how many of the ‚ÄúXRP is a security‚Äù comments on Reddit have made any attempt whatsoever to address how XRP holds up under the Howey test. Anyway, here are they four prongs:

1. There must be an investment of money. Well almost everything hits this category from Bitcoin to beanie babies to baseball cards (although it‚Äôs worth noting that airdropped coins and freely distributed coins like Nano are already exempt).

2. There must be an expectation of profits. Uh oh, are my Pok√©mon cards securities?

3. There is a ‚Äúcommon enterprise‚Äù meaning that investors and the company profit or lose together. Again, you could argue almost anything ticks this box. Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin buyers; Ethereum Foundation and ETH buyers.

4. The profits are the result of a third party or promoter. Ding!

The last point is where I‚Äôd argue XRP (and BTC and ETH) fail Howey. XRP does not depend on Ripple to rise or fall in value. We‚Äôve seen Ripple release great news and the price doesn‚Äôt move. We‚Äôve seen pump and dump groups raise the price for no reason. We‚Äôve seen the SEC tank the price. We‚Äôve seen the Spark airdrop raise the price. We‚Äôve seen companies use XRP for business and to pay employees. We‚Äôve seen people use XRP‚Äôs decentralized exchange to trade assets. XRP has a robust and growing utility outside of anything Ripple is doing. If Ripple went bankrupt, XRP would survive. Companies that have no connection to Ripple are building on XRP. Investors who have never heard of Ripple have bought XRP. Ripple is but one player in the XRP ecosphere. Those orange grove investors never took possession of the oranges, never did anything else with them. If they took possession of the oranges and made marmalade, the land wouldn‚Äôt have been a security.

The SEC will argue that Ripple sold XRP to fund the building of a payment network, the way a company would traditionally sell stock to fund its expansion. However, Ripple never held an ICO. They begged the SEC for clarity for years and never got it. Jay Clayton was asked on a stage where he immediately followed an appearance of Ripple‚Äôs CEO whether XRP was a security and he wouldn‚Äôt say. Ripple took out a full page ad in the WSJ asking for clarity. They showed up to SEC town halls asking for clarity. They lobbied congress asking for clarity. We just recently learned that in 2019 an exchange asked the SEC if it was okay to list XRP and received no answer. No clarity. Instead, Jay Clayton waited 8 years until XRP was being used by dozens of businesses, traded on hundreds of exchanges, and part of millions of investment portfolios before he dropped the lawsuit on his last day in office. He harmed the investors he was tasked to protect. The SEC is the bad guy here, not Ripple. And I believe Ripple will win.

The SEC has previously (unofficially) declared BTC and ETH to not be securities. They have also said that a digital asset can start out as a security but become sufficiently decentralized so that it ceases to be a security, but they provided no guidance on any of those topics. Ripple has filed a Freedom of Information Request with the SEC to find out how it determined ETH is not a security. The point of this is not to drag ETH down into the mud like a crab in a bucket. The point is that the rules should be known and they should be the same for everyone. If the SEC doesn‚Äôt like fundraising a payment network through token sales, why did they give a green flag to ETH when ETH had an ICO, when there is video of Vitalik on stage talking about fundraising with ETH and doing a ‚ÄúRipple style fundraiser?‚Äù Again, I don‚Äôt think ETH is a security either. The point is that the rules should be known to all. Congress has shirked their duty to provide clear rules, and all the SEC knows is lawsuits. If you think XRP is a shit coin, that‚Äôs fine. Maybe it is. But the market should decide the winners and losers, not a bunch of SEC thugs.

**Meta**

XRP is an extremely high risk, high reward investment. Ripple could lose. Without being able to sell XRP, there‚Äôs a possibility they go bankrupt. I don‚Äôt know enough about their financial position to say. While it‚Äôs true that America isn‚Äôt the world, I have a hard time believing that when the next gen payments system is being selected, banks would choose something that can‚Äôt send payments to or from the US. On the other hand, Ripple could (and I think will) win, which would mean all that downward pressure would be instantaneously remove. With their existing customer base and connections, I wouldn‚Äôt rule out seeing thousands of percent gains in a single day.

I purposely haven‚Äôt mentioned defi so far. I‚Äôm a believer in defi, but I think the transition will be gradual for the foreseeable future until we enough factors converge and we get a tipping point. Both Stellar and Ripple (and Tezos and others) are going after the CBDC space. This is just my own speculation, but I wonder whether in the long term we need ODL since the decentralized ledgers can provide that without banks. If multiple CBDCs exist on the XRPL, they could be traded on the XRPL without a bank.",cryptocurrency
stocks,Thinking about put LEAPS. Could the Fed's monetary policy really keep this thing chugging along for 2+ years?,"Disclaimer: Am not bearish (yet anyway), currently long in tech.

At this point it seems like both bears and bulls agree we're in a bubble which is being propelled by the Fed's monetary policy of low interest rates and not QE.

I'm wondering about purchasing put LEAPS for an expiration of Dec 2023. I'm just curious about the chance this thing keeps chugging along on an upward trend for *another* ~2 years.

I know the Fed says they have no plans to raise rates, but I'm sure bond yields have to raise at some point in the next 2+ years (and we're already seeing it now). 

Plus I see the common argument being if rates are too low elsewhere, investors have no choice but to put their money in the stock market, driving prices up. Personally I feel like this is just a fomo argument, and surely can't be true forever. There must be a point where investors are more comfortable receiving 1% bond yields or holding cashing and losing to inflation than putting money into an increasingly speculative or risky market.",finance

Bitcoin,The writing is on the wall,"If you‚Äôve made it to this Reddit page, you are already invested in the idea of Bitcoin. At least enough to seek more information...

If you‚Äôre unsure, uncertain, wavering, quivering, sniffling, or fearful... it just means you‚Äôre human and maybe you‚Äôre cautious or skeptical - I encourage skepticism in general. 

I can‚Äôt call myself an OG when it comes to Bitcoin but I‚Äôve been around long enough to be part of a full bull and bear cycle. I got started after binging on forums, YouTube, Reddit, and googling probably for about 30 hours straight in early 2017 when I had a ‚Äúclick‚Äù moment. I then went through a period of growth reading books cover to cover on things like finance, investing, technology, and history.

Hearing from friends or family to just ‚Äúgo buy Bitcoin‚Äù wasn‚Äôt enough for me. I needed to go seek more information about why people were touting the idea... and it‚Äôs not intuitive until you understand a bit about modern monetary theory (MMT), you read more about popular financial and accounting scandals (like Enron), you learn that (for the US) the Federal Reserve is neither ‚Äúfederal‚Äù nor a ‚Äúreserve‚Äù, you take a look at the history of banking, and you really see that it‚Äôs all spiraling out of control.

Once you grasp some of these ideas you‚Äôre on track to getting the Bitcoin value-add. It‚Äôs not about just being digital. It‚Äôs not about just blockchain technologies. It‚Äôs about much more than that - a paradigm shift in thinking about global economic players and how they transact with each other at a completely frictionless pace. It‚Äôs about true ownership, accountability, and transparency. Then when you start to see counter arguments, for things like gold... you‚Äôll realize why a defined quantity of Bitcoin makes sense. 

Sure, we‚Äôve lost many in forgotten hard drives and wallets... but each of the 21million coins are also divisible so that the method of accounting will occur down to the satoshi level and as we get more advanced and sophisticated the likelihood of these errors will decrease with time.

On the energy counter argument - take a read on George Gilder‚Äôs ‚Äúthe scandal of money.‚Äù I‚Äôm paraphrasing here but the idea is that wealth can‚Äôt be created or printed. Inputs lead to outputs and the input is an investment of energy, materials, and knowledge to support the Bitcoin network. If we‚Äôre concerned about heat or energy, how about we all hop on electricity generating bicycles to power our seemingly limitless need for electronic devices. 

As a final remark, traditional finance is out. Take a look at the extreme dissatisfaction of modern society with the widening wealth gap and overlay that with the democratization and access to knowledge of today. People know the racket and they‚Äôre ready for some accountability and access. Millennials will outlive boomers and then legislation, technology, and finance will reflect their ideologies. Rockstars and fast movers like Elon and Michael Saylor are vanguards for businesses to take their stance. I‚Äôd rather bet on these nerds than a naysayer that lacks research ability or an imagination for the future.

I hope this helped lead to more research and/or helped someone who was on the fence or worried about Bitcoin. Anyone disagree or wish to expand? I may not monitor and edit... then again, I might.

stocks,Relationships: Inflation vs. Currency vs. Interest Rates,"Been studying up for a S&amp;T (Sales and Trading) interview at a BB and this is driving me crazy. Seems like I'm running into conflicting answers everywhere I go and looking for someone actually experienced to help me not look like a damn fool during my interview. 

(1) **Inflation vs. Currency Value: Negative Correlation**

The relationship between inflation and currency value is by far the most straight forward in my opinion. Inflation decreases the value of currency in purchasing goods, which drives down the currency's worth relative to other currencies. Please let me know if I'm wrong on this.¬†

(2) The relationship between **inflation and interest rates** is making little sense to me.

(a) **Positive Correlation**: On one hand, high inflation causes investors to demand a higher yield on their bonds to compensate. Additionally, higher inflation would cause the prices of the goods that companies sell to increase, reflecting positively in earnings and resulting in faster growth for companies, thus driving down demand for bonds -&gt; lower bond prices -&gt; higher interest rates.

(b) **Negative Correlation:** On the other hand, [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/inflation-interest-rate-relationship.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways,to%20have%20an%20inverse%20relationship.&amp;text=In%20general%2C%20when%20interest%20rates,economy%20slows%20and%20inflation%20decreases.) says that¬†

* In general, when interest rates are low, the economy grows and inflation increases.
* Conversely, when interest rates are high, the economy slows and inflation decreases.

Above are evidenced by the fact that the Federal Reserve uses higher interest rates to discourage spending and thus decrease inflation during periods of rapid expansion, and lower interest rates to encourage spending and increase inflation during periods of contraction. What gives? Which one is right?

(3) **Interest Rates vs. Currency Value:¬†Positive Correlation**

All I know about this one is that its for some reason accepted that higher interest rates tend to attract foreign investment, which requires demand for the country's currency, thus higher interest rates beget higher currency value. But at the same time, wouldn't higher interest rates constrain the rate at which companies are able to expand, thus reducing foreign investment in equity markets? Wtf?

I'm getting quite worried at this point because I keep hearing different things on these relationships - the only consistent one refers to inflation and currency value.¬†

Would really appreciate some opinions from those more knowledgeable than I am.",finance

No, the SJWs are gonna shit on the game for hella goriness, and them fortnite kids are obviously gonna stray away from it too. And even more, we're talking about the 1800's here, so there was alot of unfortunate racism.....you know, is the fucking confederate defending slavery after all. Remember WW2 games nowadays?

Imagine a civil war game....you (might) be playing as a confederate in the war, a defender of *slavery*, like people are bound to be pissed at that. Let alone the lack of diversity, it was mostly white men fighting the war, although on the Union their was a good amount of black men infantry too. And the only women fighting in the war would pretend to be men, tomboys if you would, or women like Molly Pitcher, but those were needle in a haystack scenarios. The only thing women were allowed to participate in on the civil war was being field medics and nurses, but some were spies.

personalfinance,Refinancing my home and the closing costs and new loan amount have me confused.,"My current home was purchased about 2.5 years ago with a loan of $272k, which was the appraised value of the home. The interest rate is 4.75%, it is a 30 yr loan, and there is PMI. Currently there is ~$265k left on the mortgage. We applied recently to refinance and received a quote of ~2.75% for a 30 yr mortgage, which would lower our monthly payments by about $500. Here's where I'm hung up. Our house was appraised at a value of $275k and upon receiving the appraisal the lending company informed us they could only do a loan for $261k and we would also owe $12k in closing costs.  To me it seems like I'm paying 12k for a new loan starting at $261, which would put me 8k in the red (current loan amount - new loan amount + closing cost) and would then take 16 months for me to break even.

Why would they only be able to loan for $14k less than the house is worth (probably a question I should ask them)? Why 12k in closing costs, which seems ludicrous to me?

CryptoCurrency,Fed up of eToro‚Äôs manipulation of us.,"Good morning friends,

I went to bed pissed off and I‚Äôve woken up even more pissed off. I dabble a bit in cryptos and eToro completely shut me out of buying the dip and now I wake to every crypto I hold back up by at least double figures. 

It‚Äôs now time for us to stop complaining and actually do something about eToro‚Äôs corruption and manipulation of us. 

So I spent 5 hours before I went to bed writing emails of complaint. I‚Äôm in the U.K. and have raised official complaints to the U.K. SEC, the department of trade, the financial ombudsman, my local MP, the minister for finance, the trade secretary, the SIA and GSI, the financial audit authority, the home office, the US trade envoy to the U.K., the US Embassy in London, The Ambassador, and about 10 other high level individuals who are involved in stock and shares and trading platforms. I also copied in Yoni the CEO of eToro so he can see how unhappy I am. With permission I also copied in my 3 friends who happened to be lawyers. 

I also emailed to the USA as well but I‚Äôm not as informed on your processes. So I email the US SEC, the U.K. Ambassador to Washington DC, the FTC and various high ranking members, the fraud department within the FBI, and small business department within the FBI, the anti trust department Commissioner, the financial ombudsman and the Chairman of internet financial services. A few others too who I don‚Äôt remember off the top of my head. 

I am taking this serious. I collected about 250 pieces of evidence on eToro trading manipulation. My lawyers will file in the most appropriate way and I will go to court. 

I have an idea we could do a class action lawsuit but then actions speak louder than words. By that I mean people like to complain but do nothing about it. They can‚Äôt even be bother to change platforms. 

If you feel we should do a class action lawsuit you have to be committed and have proof how eToro manipulated your trading. So over the next two to four weeks I‚Äôll be seeing where we stand. 

If you wish to join me, whether in the U.K. or USA to start with please just email your name and address so my lawyers can register interest as to whether we do have the chance of doing a large group class action. 

Thanks for reading and please let me know your thoughts. 

Best wishes,

Bitcoin,BTC update captured from seeking alpha. Rat poison? don‚Äôt think so,"""It [Bitcoin] has outperformed all major asset classes over the past 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. Its market capitalization is greater than JP Morgan and greater than Berkshire Hathaway and yet it is still very early in its adoption cycle. The Fed is pursuing a policy whose objective is to have investments in cash lose money in real terms for the foreseeable future. Companies such as Square (NYSE:SQ), MassMutual, and MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) have moved cash into bitcoin rather than have guaranteed losses on cash held on their balance sheet. PayPal and Square alone are estimated to be buying on behalf of their customers all of the 900 new bitcoins mined each day. Bitcoin at this stage is best thought of as digital gold yet has many advantages over the yellow metal. If inflation picks up, or even if it doesn't, and more companies decide to diversify some small portion of their cash balances into bitcoin instead of cash, then the current relative trickle into bitcoin would become a torrent. Warren Buffett famously called bitcoin ""rat poison."" He may well be right. Bitcoin could be rat poison, and the rat could be cash.""",cryptocurrency

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-24-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks set to rise after Tuesday‚Äôs turnaround on Wall Street

&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose on Wednesday, a day after Wall Street‚Äôs wild ride that saw the Nasdaq claw back nearly all of a nearly 4% loss to close down just 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 reversed a 1.8% decline to close up slightly, breaking a five-session losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average wiped about a drop of 360 points, or more than 1%, to close modestly higher for the third straight session.

&gt; * Tuesday‚Äôs turnaround, especially in tech stocks, came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that inflation is still ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and the economic outlook is still ‚Äúhighly uncertain‚Äù due to the pandemic. That eased fears of a central bank policy change. Powell appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday in the second and final part of his mandated semiannual economic testimony to Congress.

&gt; * The Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs staff endorsed Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, a critical step in bringing a third shot to the U.S. marketplace. The staff report is meant to brief the FDA‚Äôs Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which will meet Friday to review J&amp;J‚Äôs request for emergency use authorization.

*****

&gt; # 2. Tesla bounces and a fund manager with a hot-hand may be the reason

&gt; * Tesla rose more than 4% in premarket trading after staging a major comeback Tuesday. At one point, as b/itcoin prices sank, shares plunged 13%. By the close, it recouped most of those losses to finish down only nearly 2.2%. However, Tesla‚Äôs four-session slide did total more than 11%, dragging the high-flying stock into the red by nearly 1% for 2021. Over the past 12 months, it was still up a whopping 287%.

&gt; * Ark Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood, who‚Äôs had a hot hand recently, scooped up more than $120 million worth of Tesla shares during Tuesday‚Äôs rout and subsequent comeback. Wood‚Äôs buying may have helped spark the Tuesday turnaround in Tesla. CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer tweeted that ‚ÄúCathie puts the bottom in Tesla!‚Äù

&gt; * Wood told Bloomberg Radio on Tuesday she‚Äôs particularly bullish on Tesla‚Äôs ride-hailing service as a bridge to autonomous driving. ‚ÄúWe do not think many analysts are giving Tesla credit for autonomous. If they were, the stock would be a lot higher,‚Äù he added.

*****

&gt; # 3. B/itcoin rebounds, surging back above $50,000

&gt; * Wood, also a b/itcoin bull, told Bloomberg, ‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very positive on B/itcoin, very happy to see a healthy correction here, no market is straight up.‚Äù B/itcoin climbed back above the $50,000 on Wednesday, after a brutal sell-off earlier this week. B/itcoin is up more than 70% year-to-date and over 400% in the last 12 months.

&gt; * Square said Tuesday it bought $170 million worth b/itcoin. The fintech firm, run by Jack Dorsey who‚Äôs also CEO of Twitter, bought $50 million worth of the world‚Äôs biggest c/ryptocurrency last year. Dorsey, one of b/itcoin‚Äôs most well-known proponents, once predicted it would eventually become the ‚Äúsingle currency‚Äù of the internet.

*****

&gt; # 4. GameStop CFO to step down after Reddit-driven stock rally

&gt; * GameStop CFO Jim Bell will step down next month. The video game retailer said Bell‚Äôs resignation was not due to any disagreement with the company relating to its operations, including accounting principles and practices. However, a source told Reuters that Bell‚Äôs exit was unrelated to the recent Reddit-fueled wild swings in GameStop‚Äôs stock. However, the source said his departure was initiated by GameStop, in a sign he was not viewed as the right fit as the retailer transitions into a tech-oriented business.

*****

&gt; # 5. Lowe‚Äôs tops earnings estimates as same-store sales jump

&gt; * Lowe‚Äôs shares rose 2% in premarket trading after the home improvement retialer said Wednesday its fourth-quarter same-store sales climbed 28% as consumers spent more on home projects during Covid. Adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share on revenue of $20.31 billion both beat expectations. Lowe‚Äôs reiterated the forecast it gave at an investor day in December. Chief Financial Officer David Denton had said home improvement sales will likely decline in 2021 as more people get Covid-19 vaccines and spend more time outside their homes.

This sort of change within a week would be significant. The 30 year and 10 year reach yearly ATHs as the FED decides to maintain interest rates at near-0 till 2023 and provide continued stimulus.

economy,How to know what regression is used in this equation and their hypothesis for testing?,"If the data are nonstationary or nearly so, any simple regression of the levels of one series
on another leaves open the possibility of spurious regression (Granger and Newbold 1974;
Phillips 1988). An appropriate approach would then be to difference the data and examine a
simple equation such as:


‚àÜR(it) =Œ± + Œ≤‚àÜR(bit)+ u(it) eqn 1

where Rit is the local interest rate at time t, Rbit is the base rate at time t, and ‚àÜ is the difference
operator. This is also a useful specification when the interest rate data are highly persistent and
have a long run relationship. For example, suppose that uncovered interest parity holds, with the
nominal international interest differential the sum of a statistically stationary expected
depreciation rate and a stationary risk premium. Then a regression in interest-rate levels must
yield a slope coefficient approaching unity as the sample size rises, regardless of the extent to
which the nonbase country exercises its short-run interest-rate independence. A regression in
differences such as (1), however, will measure that exercise of independence even in a large
sample.
With perfect capital mobility and an exchange rate permanently and credibly pegged within a
band that is literally of zero width, we would expect to find Œ≤ = 1 above: home and base-country
interest rates would always move one-for-one, and the pegging country's monetary independence
would be nil. Otherwise, we would find Œ≤ &lt; 1 if the home monetary authority uses its monetary
independence to offset base interest-rate shocks but Œ≤ &gt; 1 if it reinforces them.",finance

Bitcoin,"Questioning the Validity of Bitcoin: Intrinsic Value, Adoption, Longevity","PLEASE DO NOT DOWNVOTE BECAUSE TITLE

I am a senior finance major in college and taking a course related to financial upheavals and overhauls,  and almost nothing has been a larger disruptor to the financial markets than Bitcoin (Tesla too). However, my professor made an astoundingly great contrarian stance to the crypto currency boom, and specifically around the adoption of Bitcoin. 

His point was simply this: Bitcoin only has worth because it‚Äôs worth is based in DOLLARS, and will never have any true value as a CURRENCY as long as that remains a fact. Currently Bitcoin operates more like a security than a currency, mainly due to its insane volatility. When people talk about Bitcoin they say Bitcoin hit 20,0000 dollars, 30,000 dollars, 50,000 dollars; keyword DOLLARS. At what point does 1 Bitcoin simply just be worth 1 Bitcoin? At what point is there a disconnect from the centralized currency of the US and the IMFs global currency, the USD? 

He also made the point that governments, despite this currency being ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù, will never lose control of the monetary supply. This is done in 2 ways: control and force. First, they would make it illegal to own Bitcoin. There is a historical note to this when FDR made it illegal to own Gold and would raid people‚Äôs homes of their precious medal portfolios. Secondly, the US has the largest defense budget in the world supporting their currency, and yeah not much to explain there. And to add to that he said, ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin starts to seriously threaten the US dollar, the Fed will just simply make their own cryptocurrency.‚Äù And to that fact it is already being beta-tested by the People‚Äôs Republic Bank of China. 

My professor didn‚Äôt mention the value of Blockchain technology, or the accuracy at which transactions are processed on Bitcoin, but I think his argument is a valid one to entertain. Even if Bitcoin goes to $100,000 or $500,000 or $1,000,000; when is it simply 1 Bitcoin=1 Bitcoin? 

He made a statement and said he thinks Bitcoin is the ‚Äú1st ever trillion dollar ponzi-scheme‚Äù. Also I think it is important to state that this professor is not some old, uninformed, boomer, but young, low-30s, and in my opinion incredibly well-informed. 

THESE ARE NOT MY OWN PERSONAL VIEWS OF BITCOIN. I want to remind you that I do not agree with his position on Bitcoin, so please don‚Äôt downvote me to oblivion, but I do think he poses some valid questions that ignite interesting discussion amongst strong believers and non-believers.

personalfinance,Grandparent college saving strategy in 529 and FASFA impact,"We are in a position to fund college savings plans for our grandkids and having had my own parents do this incorrectly for our kids, I want to try and avoid problems for our kids and grandkids down the road.  I don't want them to have FASFA issues, tax problems, etc..  I believe the best approach is a 529 plan, but am confused about FASFA impact.

As an example, if I were to put $10K into a 529 plan that I own, and then associated it with the grandkid's SSN, would this work out OK.  Looking at the following site, [https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/529-plans-receive-favorable-treatment-on-the-fafsa](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/529-plans-receive-favorable-treatment-on-the-fafsa)  , it seems like this might not be good for them.  According to this site:

Parent held 529 - Fund counts 5.64% towards Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and distribution is untaxed federally and not reported on FASFA

Grandparent held 529 - Fund not reported on FASFA and distribution counts 50% toward EFC and treated as income on FASFA.

I guess I don't have a problem with the 50% EFC because if they are going to have say $10K from the fund to go towards tuition, then they are expected to pay $5K more... if its primarily loans we are talking about then fine.  If they would potentially lose grants then that stinks... punishing those who save for college.  I assume that none of the distribution is actually taxed if used for education.  

I don't understand why the government comes up with these crazy rules and why make them different for a parent vs. a grandparent when the goal is to create an incentive to save money to educate kids so the government doesn't do it.  I would rather retain control over the money we are giving to the grandkids for education to make sure it finds its way to education.

stocks,"After this week, what could possibly cause the stock market to crash at this point from here?","I'm on the bullish side looking for some bear arguments. It seems like with stimulus coming, money being printed, the economy recovering soon, the market should continue to rally like no tomorrow. I believe interest rates are even set to stay low, although I haven't followed in about a month, so someone can maybe comment if anything's changed. It seems like the only reason people believe it's going to crash soon is because the market is expensive, not much beyond there. I actually believe it will eventually crash, but after going through another massive bull run, to make that crash insignificant to worry about. I might get flag for this, but I do think it's important to hear things from both sides. 

I know the strategy and belief that the stock market is essentially free money right now and we should put every last dollar inside has worked wonderfully so far, and there doesn't seem to be anything that could possibly change that at this time. The only reason it went down this week is because of a slight correction, is it safe to assume after this week it'll simply be back to normal?

CryptoCurrency,My beginner setup,"I‚Äôm fairly new to crypto, but I‚Äôve been in the stonk game for a little while. Naturally when getting started everything was really confusing, as it‚Äôs not as simple with crypto to just sign up for an investment account with a Goldman/Schwab and allocate money - you‚Äôll likely have a few different apps/web platforms for all your crypto needs (wallet, exchange, staking/rewards, etc).

Also just to note, there are a ton of options out there so definitely DYOR, but these worked for me so I use them. 

Exchange: You‚Äôll need a place to buy, sell, and trade crypto. I decided on using Coinbase just because of the popularity of it (US) and it‚Äôs been around for a while, plus it‚Äôs safe. Now here‚Äôs the thing: Coinbase is separate from Coinbase Pro, I use BOTH of these. I like Coinbase for its mobile app, and it has some staking feature for it, as well as a vault feature that can be used as a wallet. I don‚Äôt recommend trading here because the fees are high, instead use Coinbase Pro (formerly known as GDAX) for trades. I will link my bank to Coinbase Pro and deposit here. You can do instant, unlimited, and free movements from Coinbase accounts. *Note: Link bank to Coinbase Pro for fiat in, as funds take a few days to clear and they cannot be moved between Coinbase accounts until they are completely cleared. 

Wallet: Keeping it in an exchange isn‚Äôt safe (although it‚Äôs likely that you won‚Äôt have any issues here), if you have a small amount I think it‚Äôs okay to keep on an exchange in the short term. This is where you could use Coinbase‚Äôs vault feature or consider another wallet option - be it online or in a hard wallet. Once I hit $10k I‚Äôll likely be getting a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano. It‚Äôs a small investment for your holdings that is very secure. 

Staking/Rewards: I currently use Celsius just because I‚Äôve heard great things about it. Right now I‚Äôve got about $2,500 in crypto in here, and it‚Äôs been great. I don‚Äôt earn bank, but my interest payout last week was a dollar or two in crypto. If you are HODL for the long-term it‚Äôs great. They have a mode called HODL mode in the app that doesn‚Äôt allow you to take coin in/out with for me is just an added safety feature because I am not going to liquidate anytime soon anyways. They have a lot of options like this, but I recommend checking out one that works for you as the APY can be up to 12.50% on some coins, which beats out inflation easily. Again, a lot of these aren‚Äôt super secure so I would not recommend holding all of your crypto in here unless you‚Äôve got some serious risk appetite. Note: It charges fees to transfer money into here, but if you use it long-term and work their current promo codes you should be able to make back what you lost in fees pretty quickly. 

Passive Earning/Fun: Coinbase has informational videos that give you coins, Brave is a cool browser that is actually very secure and allows you to earn BAT along the way, and if you live in a somewhat urban area you can use WeNano to Pok√©mon-go style some coinage. None of these are going to make you a ton of coins, but they are cool projects that ideas that I really like! 

Strategy: I HODL and will continue to HODL as I do not want to deal with the tax man in terms of capital gains. This does not mean I won‚Äôt take profits, but right now with my current holdings it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to trade a bunch. As they say, we are so early. 

Security: Don‚Äôt use your phone number for accounts as it can be spoofed, always use TFA (I have DUO Mobile), and ensure that your security settings across your platforms are shored up! Plus, if something feels weird go with your gut and investigate or just be cautious. 

Information: Beware of trash YouTuber‚Äôs! You won‚Äôt 100x today on anything, and if you do you‚Äôll probably lose it just as quickly as you earned it. I recommend checking out Data Dash on YouTube for info on the market and general strategy (he‚Äôs genuine, and I find his takes very informative). Also for podcasts, Unchained is great too! It‚Äôs nothing specific but they do a lot of interviews on generally fascinating crypto talk - from SEC‚Äôs XRP case to ETH bulls and bears, and why they either see or don‚Äôt see a future. 

Lastly, always DYOR on apps you want to integrate into your crypto ecosystem. Don‚Äôt sweat it if the market is down 20% in a day. And try not to check your crypto all the time.

Cheers!",cryptocurrency

And asking about this results in a ban because ‚Äúprice discussion not allowed‚Äù","Binance Smart Chain projects are super high risk because the devs seem utterly incompetent, have very little understanding of the complex projects they are forking, and on the tech side they just know how to fork from Ethereum, but dont have any clue about the maintenance, or future upgrades and keeping the project up. 

&amp;#x200B;

One such project is Venus Protocol, which CZ just thumped his chest hardly 6 hours ago as ""#3 now"", and claims to have $2bn worth assets locked in the protocol. Venus is a copypasta fork of Maker DAO and similar to DAI, Venus issues VAI which is a stablecoin pegged to the value of USD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Except its no longer stable, its value has crashed over the last few days and the $1 peg has now turned into a 9-10% loss for anyone holding VAI over other stablecoins such as DAI or USDC/USDT/BUST. And the value is fast crashing. $2bn worth assets in the protocol could be due for a liquidation if this mess isnt fixed immediately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, there is no price stability mechanism in Venus, the same mechanism used in Maker DAO which gives DAI its peg was not included in Venus' copy paste job. Incredible. For some crazy reason, Venus VAI stablecoin has no mechanism to adjust the interest rates and keep the value stable. Did the Venus devs really think the value would be stable all by itself? This is what happens when the Maker DAO team does all the study and research to build the product on Ethereum, but then a bunch of clueless developers without any clue of the economics of a stablecoin decide to clone it to profit from someone else's work.  

&amp;#x200B;

And to boot, if you bring this topic up in the Venus Protocol group, you get directed to a meme group and asking again you get banned because the mod says ""not the place to discuss price"". Yeap, you can't discuss the stablecoin's price on a group about the stablecoin project.

I agreed to 2.625%. LO said if I changed my mind and wanted to go with 2.75%, I could let them know in the meantime.

A few days later, just when I was going to ask LO to make the switch, I got a rate lock agreement for 2.625% at .25 points. I was thrilled, I thought either the rates went down or promotional funds were replenished or LO worked some magic for me. I signed.

And now, a week after signing, I‚Äôve been sent another revised rate lock to sign for 2.625% at .875 points with no heads up from LO. Change in circumstance says Rate Lock Mod with comments that the discount points increased. Presumably LO made an error on the initial one?

Do I have any recourse? Is this legal? Am I just stuck with having to sign and pay extra points? There‚Äôs been a couple other instances where I‚Äôve felt ‚Äúbait and switched‚Äù during the process and now I‚Äôm rethinking if it‚Äôs a good idea to move forward at all. What if they want me to sign another revised rate lock right before closing even though it‚Äôs locked until April?

TLDR; Lender wants me to sign revised rate lock with increased points. What are my options?

Here is my brief DD on why I am deep in TSM

* President Joe Biden is close to signing an executive order reviewing supply chains for critical materials, including semiconductors to pharmaceuticals and rare-earth minerals.
* The global semiconductor chip crisis has compelled U.S. automakers, including Ford Motor and General Motors and other manufacturers, to opt for production holidays.
* The executive order is estimated to seek a 100-day supply chain review in four areas, including semiconductors used in products from cars to phones, large-capacity batteries for electric vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and vital rare-earth elements for technology and defense.
* Interestingly, China rules the rare-earths market and is a major player in multiple supply areas, including pharmaceuticals. The order is timed when the U.S. intends to forge ties with different supplier countries and shun relations with China.
* Major US semiconductor companies have outsourced their chip production to **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** (NYSE: [TSM](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/tsm#NYSE?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site)) and **Samsung Electronics Co Ltd** (OTC: [SSNLF](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ssnlf#OTC?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site)). TSM recently disclosed plans for a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona to come online by 2024.
* The order is estimated to seek a one-year review of supply chains encompassing six sectors, from technology to food production.
* The order will be focused on domestic production with incentives including job-training programs and business loans, including the federal procurement process for more American-made purchases. It will also include certain import limitations.
* The Defense Production Act, covering vaccine production, could also be a part of the order. The government is expected to focus on public-private partnerships while improving relations with allies to address common supply vulnerabilities, including semiconductors.
* The executive order will be linked to Biden‚Äôs plans towards U.S. job creation, mainly in the manufacturing sector that has faced intense foreign competition.
* The long-term executive order is expected to incorporate the short-term chip crisis.

TL;DR - TSM gonna go zoomy-zoom to moony-moon

personalfinance,What would you do? Refinance Condo / Single Family Savings,"Hi! I bought my first home in 2020 (literally closed the Friday before everything shut down). I made a small downpayment ($15k on a $290k property). I live in a difficult renters market and we were paying $1600 a month to rent someone else's condo, so it seemed better in the long run to be paying towards equity in our own condo while still saving for a single family home. We now pay $1850 for the mortgage, PMI, taxes, and HOA per month. 

It took a year due to COVID related income loss for us to begin saving again, so only now am I putting money away for a single family home. I expect to save about $18,000 to $20,000 this year. We're thinking we will live in our current condo for 3-5 more years. 

Interest rates have gone done, so although we have only lived here for a year I am thinking about possibly refinancing if the rates are around what they are right now at the end of 2021. I would plan to use the bulk of this year's savings to make a \~20k payment while refinancing. Here's my thought process  
\- that will lower our monthly payment by $100-150, so although we would be repurposing some savings that are otherwise flagged for a single family home this will enable us to save more per month  
\- I hope to keep the condo when we buy a single family home, so lowering the monthly mortgage payment increases cash flow when it's a rental property  
\- we'd save about 18k in interest over the life of the loan

Is this totally crazy for someone only one year into a mortgage? Is it worth considering refinancing it but not pay off a lump sum while refinancing? Is there anything I'm missing or should consider otherwise?",finance

Loan details -
Amount - 80K
Term - 30 year
Interest rate - 2.24% if loan balance is above 50k and 2.99% if balance of loan is less than 50k. Rate is variable. 
Payment - $306 per month. About $3600 per year. I start with paying about 150 against principal and about 150 in interest, every month. 
Loan type - amortized, just like house mortgage loan


Stock market returns long term - about 8%.

My thinking - i will gain about 5% every year from this. I will pay taxes on gains whenever i sell the investments. The home equity i gained from the house price increase is adding nothing to my financial picture at the moment, unless I sell the house, which I m not until we start earning much more money in the future. Only thing it is doing currently is increasing my property taxes.

What I currently have -
A secure steady job
$800 per month mortgage
No other loans
Low expenses

I will be monitoring the interest rate closely since interest rate is variable and is tied to prime rate. Prime rate increase can ruin my plans.

I want to know what do you think about this. Thanks in advance.

Edit: All, thank you so much for your comments. I highly appreciate it. You guys really made me think. It seems like my plan could encounter following issues -
1. Stock market might tank - I don't think it will stay tanked for 20 or so years. I think I will recover my money + interest paid, eventually.
2. I could lose my job - this is highly likely to happen if the economy crashes. I don't think that adding 300 to my regular expenses would make this situation much more worse. I will need to find another job no matter what, to make ends meet.
3. Cascading events - like many of you have said that the probability of the bad cascading events happening is pretty low. I think I am ready to take this risk.
4. Interest rate increase - This could make my loan installment go up. At 5% interest rate, I will be paying about $430 per month, which would be $130 more than normal.
5. I get injured or big expenses come up - Well having another $300 payment on top of my other expenses won't matter much if this happens. I will be in deep trouble anyway :p",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, February 24, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, February 24, 2021**

Stocks rose on Wednesday, with each of the three major indices closing the day positive. Shares of technology companies, which were hit the hardest by the pullback, shook earlier losses, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) closing 0.82% higher. 

In the past week, the rotation from high-flying growth stocks into cyclical and value investments picked up steam as fears of higher Treasury yields pressured stocks across the board this week, with higher prices and increased borrowing costs for companies seen as an emerging threat for high valuation companies. 

During his semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said that rising Treasury yields are, ‚Äúa statement of confidence on the part of markets that we‚Äôll have a robust and ultimately complete recovery‚Äù. As a reminder, Treasury yields are the total amount of money you earn by owning U.S. Treasury bills, notes, bonds or inflation-protected securities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury sells them to pay for the US debt and when the timeframe of the note expires, the government pays back the face value plus states interest. Essentially, Powell is saying that Treasury yields are going up because investors believe in the US‚Äô ability to pay back the interest of those yields when the time expires, which implies the economy will recover.

In his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, ""The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases."" Supportive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve is one of the reasons we think the factors are in place for a sustained bull market even after the pandemic is over. While there are certainly short-term headwinds in the market, our long-term outlook remains bullish.

* Incredible, in the last few hours of the market, ‚Äúmeme stocks‚Äù like AMC and Gamestop (GME) gapped up strongly. Including after-hours movement, GME is up more than 120% on the day at the time of writing. This really is Psycho!!

‚ÄúFirst, the order directs an immediate 100-day review across federal agencies to address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of four key products.  

1. APIs are the part of a pharmaceutical product that contains the active drug. In recent decades, more than 70 percent of API production facilitators supplying the U.S. have moved offshore.  This work will complement the ongoing work to secure supply chains needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. Critical minerals are an essential part of defense, high-tech, and other products. From rare earths in our electric motors and generators to the carbon fiber used for airplanes‚Äîthe United States needs to ensure we are not dependent upon foreign sources or single points of failure in times of national emergency. 

3. Semiconductors and Advanced Packaging. The United States is the birthplace of this technology, and has always been a leader in semiconductor development. However, over the years we have underinvested in production‚Äîhurting our innovative edge‚Äîwhile other countries have learned from our example and increased their investments in the industry.  

4.

By identifying supply chain risks, we can meet the President‚Äôs commitment to accelerate U.S. leadership of clean energy technologies.

Last Friday I posted a discussion of the week ending Finviz heat map ([link](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lobfjy/this_is_why_you_pay_attention_to_red_days_because/)), where I discussed that what I thought I was seeing last week was an uptick in the rotation into energy, mining &amp; minerals, commodities, financials as money was beign moved out of the mega-cap and large-cap ""pandemic stocks"" that got so big (overvalued) in 2020. You can see this visually in [this heat map of last Friday's trading](https://i.imgur.com/VZAXcd7.png), which reveals what people were buying (and in some cases, still selling) after a lot of people took profits in mid-week last week. 

This is a quick update and follow up of my post last Friday. 

**2020 winners continue to sell off as the end of Q1 2021 approaches**

The trend of selling off stocks that did well in 2020, and especially in the first 3 quarters of 2020, and rotating into smaller stocks and away from consumer defensive, work from home and other pandemic stocks, seems to be continuing. [Here's a finviz.com heat map after close of trading today, Wednesday Feb 24](https://imgur.com/SFED2aK),showing more green than red but roughly the same trend as last week's trading. 

The arguments I made in my post last Friday still hold, in my opinion. The transition from pandemic 2020 portfolios, which were largely consumer defensive, work from home, tech and other coronavirus restriction stocks, as well as high-stakes speculative trades, has started to occur and should continue either steadily or periodically into March. It's my feeling that these selloffs followed by rotations into new (recovery/rebound) investments will accelerate into the end of March when funds and pensions have to rebalance their portfolios, take profits, and position themselves for the rest of 2021 at the end of Q1 2021. 

An example of this trend is where Cathie Woods' ARK Invest funds in the past few weeks, which are full of high-growth meme stocks of 2020, have been hit by a sell-off this week. The selloff in Ark follows a few weeks of ARK funds underperforming competitors' actively managed funds and ETFs for innovation/tech stocks. The underperformance of the ARK funds vs competitors suggests that investors have been buying other innovation funds while selling ARK Invest (and the stocks ARK holds). An alternative explanation for the recent relative underperformance of the ARK funds could be that the drop in TSLA and a few overpriced stocks are starting to drag it down. Here are some reference charts for ARK funds underperforming other funds:

* [ARK funds vs PSCE (small cap energy ETF), IEP (Icahn's industrial fund) &amp; PICK (minerals &amp; mining ETF)](https://imgur.com/z1spO52)  
* [ARK funds vs KRE (regional banking ETF), XLE (energy ETF) &amp; IEP (Icahn's industrial fund)](https://imgur.com/CJAla9S)   
* I already posted charts of ARK funds underperforming some other innovation tech ETFs in the past couple weeks in the post linked above. 

You might ask, Why would people be slowing buying into ARK funds in the past few weeks if they've been so successful, or worse, dumping ARK funds? Three reasons: 

1. ARK funds have seen massive inflows for its investing/business model, which is to have a limited portfolio of small growth companies. An ETF company can only pour so many billions into the same few dozen companies before they get overvalued and become the target of short sellers and other investors stop buying those stocks. Cathie has been flogging that same team of horses well past the finish line, continuing to acquire already-overvalued stocks to add to her fund portfolios (TSLA, PLTR, DKNG). This is a structural challenge to her small-portfolios-of-companies business model. 

2. Some of the meme stocks in her portfolios that are considered overvalued are themselves not doing so well lately, including her signature holding, TSLA. To a great extent, some ARK funds are just [diluted versions of TSLA](https://imgur.com/v7irVCD) with [a little relatively microscopic extra growth potential here and there that you can notice occasionally when TSLA starts dropping very quickly](https://imgur.com/ICVQw7g). The fact that the ARK funds are dependent upon the continued outperformance of some very overvalued stocks is multiplied by the ability of a certain well known tycoon to pump up the value of his company with high-volatility moves such as [buying billions of dollars worth of bitcoin, thereby linking his company's stock to bitcoin's volatility to some extent](https://observer.com/2021/02/tesla-stock-bitoin-tumble-elon-musk-net-worth-fall-billion/). While some might like that, other investors avoid too much complicated volatility and would take that as a signal to exit the stock and the ARK funds. The fact that Cathie Woods cut some other positions to allocate more money into making massive TSLA buys today, punching up the stock's value, suggests that the dependence of ARK funds on TSLA's performance may be an existential issue at this point. 

3. There probably just are greener fields to invest in right now than highly leveraged, no-positive earnings growth stocks, and these have fallen slightly in status because of inflation rearing its head. I feel that inflation is  probably a *catalyst* that galvanized institutional and professional investors to take this time to take profits on what worked well in 2020 and switch to other investments that do better during periods of high inflation, as those other stocks and assets will see some good gains (at least in the near term). Those other investments would be the energy, commodity, mining, financials, transportation, (certain) industrial stocks and real estate related stocks that are represented by XLE, PICK, IEP, KRE in the charts linked above. 

So Buy This, Not That: Inflation Edition would look at where the money is going out of the assets that have been seeing accelerated selling, particularly in the past couple of weeks, and that would be these other sectors that have been seeing cash inflows. And those smaller/midcap stocks and sectors are green on these heat maps. 

**Small companies not consistently outperforming this week as they have been previously**

Last week in the post I linked at top, I pointed out that because a lot of the mega caps and large caps had become flooded with investor cash, and are in fact many of the ""pandemic stocks"" that did well during lockdowns during 2020 (work from home stocks, tech stocks, consumer defensive/staples, etc), money that had been avoiding overvalued stocks had been going into small caps. The small cap versions of the sector ETFs that I looked at had done about 2x better than the versions that were large-cap or market cap weighted. That's not necessarily the case for inflation week (this week). Why? Because small cap stocks tend to need more debt, and need to pay higher interest on their debt, which comes hand in hand with their growth potential. So until the hunt for value in terms of low P/E resumes, small cap is no longer a blanket under which to cuddle for better returns this Spring, in my opinion, but it remains the place where value is found for picking individual stocks where you can screen stocks for low price/debt ratio and low long term debt.  

**How does inflation fear change how we screen stocks?**

Firstly, the stocks that do worse during times of inflation are not that different from people who do worse: if you have a lot of credit card debt and loans, and not a lot of cash coming in, you're not doing as well when inflation is high. Companies with high price/debt ratios, low long term debt, high free cash flow and strong balance sheets/assets are suddenly more popular this week than disruptor companies with no profits, not a lot of cash incoming and expectations of future growth propping up their value with intangibles like futuristic tech offerings. 

So this week, I've added a few steps to my review of new stocks, and I'm also going back and reviewing my own stocks by comparing them to their peers based on what I'm calling their ""financial moat"" vs inflation/high inflation:

* price/debt ratio  
* low (or better yet, no) long term debt  
* high free cash flow  

Then there are concerns of companies being more sensitive to downturn risk, and these are the same considerations as value investors apply. This is a little different than just cashflow and debt

* other financials like p/e can give a sense of value  
* strong technical/capital equipment moat in their industry/niche  
* lack of governance, legal or technical problems that caused them to be ""good values"" (i.e. the companies are not actually good values but have low prices because they have been run badly)   

These ""financial moat"" vs inflation considerations might overlap with how people judge ""value stocks"" and ""dividend paying stocks"" because both value stocks and dividend paying stocks have some of these attributes in order to be considered good values, and to pay high dividends. But that doesn't mean it's safe to just substitute value stocks and high dividend paying stocks as classes of stocks that will be sure to blanket do well. There are so-called ""value stocks"" that are just low p/e because they happen to suck and there are high dividend paying stocks because they're able to get low interest rate loans right now to maintain their dividends during a tough time (like AT&amp;T and XOM). 

So in my personal opinion it's wise to avoid just going with what some financial advisors and writers are saying, which is that value stocks and high dividend paying stocks are popular right now/this week, and not overlooking the detail: that maybe it's that the stocks that pass some inflation ""financial moat"" evaluations that are doing well and most of the time these are also value stocks and high dividend paying stocks (and not vice versa). So I'm not skipping the debt and free cash flow checks anymore, even in looking at value and dividend stocks. 

So my ""Buy This, Not That"" thought for this week is to maybe add to your DD checking the stocks for a good financial moat vs inflation (the checks I mentioned above) and maybe thinking twice about taking on stocks that have debt, cashflow, leverage, and other interest-rate vulnerable problems. It might be a good time to avoid pandemic stocks that did well in 2020 and look to new sectors and industries, as well as staying away from any stocks that are overvalued. 

tldr; inflation fears lead me to adjust my approach a bit, updating my Friday 02/24/21 post on rotating out of pandemic stocks, by adding checking for debt, free cashflow, value and some other factors to harden the companies against rising interest rates, and these changes to my approach also help me understand why some of my stocks this week have done better than others.

personalfinance,Short Term Investing Strategies While Student Loan Interest Is on Hold.,"I have roughly $13,000 USD in a savings account that originally started off at 1.7% APY, but has since dwindled to only 0.5% APY. I am planning on using all of that money to pay off my student loans, but not until October 2021 when interest will start to incur again. There is a temporary hold on all federal student loans due to COVID-19 in the USA, which is why I am looking to earn some extra money while I wait for the ""due"" date of my student loans to come again.

Are there any better or alternative ways (that are relatively safe) that I can utilize to temporarily make more than 0.5% APY?

MachineLearning,[D] Backpropagating to LSTM inputs!,"Hi, I'm trying an architecture that is a sort of autoencoder, where the encoded representation is a string. In order to deal with differentiability issues, I'm not actually encoding it as a string, but as the softmax of the output of the encoder LSTM. Then, this tensor is fed into the decoder LSTM.

However, I am noticing a huge difference (of the order of 10\^3 or 10\^4) between the grads calculated on the outputs of the decoder LSTM and the inputs during backpropagation. That is, it seems that the LSTM barely propagates back to the input sequence. Also, the input sequence tends to always collapse to a single character (that is, at every time step it outputs a tensor whose argmax would always be the same character).

personalfinance,Tax/student loan implications of marriage vs delaying?,"Per the title, looking for some insights on whether it's better to move forward or delay marriage in our scenario: 

Together 3 years, great relationship built on communication, somewhat ambivalent on marriage and having a tough time sorting out pros/cons. Our state does not recognize domestic partnerships/common-law.

We are both 33 with solid emergency funds in M-HCOL:

P1 makes $38k and solely owns a house worth $240k. No debt other than mortgage. About $70k in assets/retirement, not including house equity. Aggressive about retirement and savings for last 2 years after becoming debt-free. Excellent employer benefits. Has 3 auto-immune conditions that may make working until typical retirement age difficult--FIRE-minded.

P2 makes $40k (used to make more, pre-Covid). $35k in federal student loans on Income-Based Repayment plan (on deferment until the fall, monthly payment goes into HYSA), no other debt. About $25k in assets, no retirement. No benefits from employer, on ACA for healthcare ~$350/mo.

P1 has POA, life insurance, and wills/trusts set up and P2 will be setting these up ASAP now that they are employed again. It would be great for P2 to be on P2's ins and save $300/mo, but there are too many other things to consider...

I've read up on a ton of these scenarios and follow r/PF pretty closely, but can't figure out if the student loans cancel out the pros of being married. If P2 goes to grad school, is it better that they stay single?

With nearly identical income, are tax savings a wash? Will filing MFS, be advantageous? P1 may have more than standard deduction in coming years due to house and maxing medical.

We aren't looking at this from just a financial standpoint, as better medical and legal protections by marrying would be helpful. However, with lower incomes, we are big on being as smart as we can about money and don't want to get screwed over on taxes or grad school should either/both of us go that route. We both have bachelor's, but pay in our fields is pretty stagnant even with grad degrees.

personalfinance,Rent vs buy - idea of equation to find 'irrecoverable losses' balance,"Just trying to understand if my train of thoughts goes on the right track.

^((Instead of using buy vs. rent calculators that tell you 'that's how many years you must live in your house' - i basically thought of formula to get mortgage spending SAME as on current rent, AND to minimize 'burning' money for renting.))

# Renting vs buying equation.

Given:

I pay $1500/month rent, that gives us **$18,000/year ""irrecoverable losses"" for rent.**

I want house price of X ($300,000).

I understand that owning house (mortgage interest aside, for now) - also has 'irrecoverable losses':

* 1% of X ‚Äì state tax
* 1% of X ‚Äì house repairs (yearly, rule of thumb)
* 1% of X - HOA maybe (actually I calculated as $300/mo = $3,600/year, which is \~1% of X)

So we have 3% of X ""irrecoverable losses"" for house ownership. == $9,000/year for house of price $300k.¬†Let's round it up - **we have $10,000 / year ""irrecoverable losses"" for house ownership.**

**It's $8,000 better than renting ¬´losses¬ª**
$8000/year == $666/month.That's $155,000 mortgage loan for 30 years at 3%

So **IF** I HAVE REST (X minus $155,500) as downpayment - I can immediately get mortgage and start paying it off (without changes in my housing monthly expenses)

**My main idea here was to find that 'irrecoverable losses' balance point, so that I can start paying off mortgage and actually start owning the place, WITHOUT increasing my current housing spendings.**

**Do you see any obvious errors in that idea?**  (like, no bank will give you that small monthly payment, or any realistic world limitation that i don't see?)

Thanks! :)

P.S.

1. I understand that I won't be accumulating $8000 per year, because some will go to the interest.
2. I also understand prices will fluctuate slightly with changes for utilities/insurance etc. That slightly affects the final number, but the idea/formula still works, right?
3. Basically ‚Äì worsening in any of the variables above (house price, mortgage interest rate, HOA, etc.) - will only enlarge needed downpayment.
4. Let's assume i have good chances approval for that 3% 30yo mortgage. I'm not really familiar if this sort of mortgage is possible with that low monthly payment.",finance

We are considering going up to $1.2 where the market is less competitive. Of course, we also keep falling in love with the higher priced houses. I am a bit confused about how much we can actually afford. This is our first home and in a hot market for context. Here's the rough financial situation:

**Salary:** Wife $100k, me $15k (currently getting MBA), but previously $150k and can expect to get back up there within a few years (pursuing startup roles, so may take longer)

**Assets:** $250k liquid, \~$2m invested - more complicated but still fairly liquid, $200k retirement

**Debt:** $25k car loan (0% so figured why not)

**Children:** Not yet, but on the horizon

Would buying a $1.2m house be terribly silly? Or is it OK to just accept that the house will be a large portion of our assets? Although we have the assets to cover it, we'd plan to get a mortgage given low interest rates.

personalfinance,Issues with State returns since 2017 due to AGI,"Here's the situation.

So for the past several years I've encountered issues receiving my state's taxes (IL) due to an issue with my AGI on a previous filing. I think the reason being is because I received a payment from a company I used to work for regarding an Employee Stock Ownership Program and that payment/form arrived after I filed my taxes for that year. Ever since I've had an issue receiving a payout from IL because my IL returns are regularly getting declined while my federal taxes are being accepted. This poses a few issues.

1. I'm 100% certain I haven't ""owed"" IL any money because my tax bracket hasn't changed and I've been paying essentially the ""same amount"" in taxes every year and typically receive a payout.
2. I'm genuinely not sure what to do as this year my taxes are an absolute mess due to capitol gains, a few additional sources of revenue, issues with IDES not taking taxes out of my unemployment insurance when I was laid off for 7 mos, etc and I honestly need to get this sorted out before something bad happens and I don't want to encounter issues this year due to knowing I'm going to owe a ton.
3. I'm legitimately not sure what kind of bad can come from this issue as I definitely don't want to get into trouble for tax evasion or something along those lines even though I haven't evaded taxes in any way.
4. I've had no idea who I should even talk to about these issues because I'm not sure what route I need to take to resolve the issue before it just gets out of hand and I encounter more issues down the road from it.

What are the best steps I need to take to resolve this issue? I typically file on my own but I prefer to sit down and speak with someone who's educated on the subject to help sort this mess out that way I'm not getting into any legal trouble and so I can properly file taxes every year but I'm really not sure who would be the best person to speak with. I do make under $70k a year and I know I qualify for one of those free programs but is it worth going that route or should I sit down (or zoom) with someone regarding this issue that I should pay for?

Any general advice is greatly appreciated and I apologize for not being educated on this beforehand so if I got some information incorrect please inform me. Genuinely want to learn as much as I can as it can assist anyone down the road.",finance

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-25-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks set for mixed open after another major comeback

&gt; * Dow futures hold on to slim gains Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average wiped out a 110-point loss and climbed 424 points, or 1.4%, to a record closing high. S&amp;P and Nasdaq futures dropped in the premarket. The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Wednesday erased a 1.3% drop and closed 1% higher. The S&amp;P 500 finished 1.1% higher after recovering from a 0.6% decline. Two days of reassuring words on interest rates and inflation from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell helped push stocks higher and tempered bond yield gains Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield on Thursday rose to 1.45%, around the highest levels in a year. B/itcoin rose 2% early Thursday, back above $50,000.

*****

&gt; # 2. Jobless, GDP, durable goods data all out before the bell

&gt; * The government is set to release weekly jobless claims, revised fourth quarter gross domestic product and January durable goods orders at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect a drop in new filings for unemployment benefits to 845,000. GDP in Q4 is seen rising slightly from the initial estimate to a 4.2% annual growth rate. Forecasts call for a 1% rise in durable goods orders last month, double December‚Äôs increase.

*****

&gt; # 3. GameStop shares surge again as Reddit favorites rally again

&gt; * GameStop climbed more than 70% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket trading as heavily-shorted stocks favored by Reddit traders surged again. Shares of the video game retailer doubled Wednesday to nearly $92 each after Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell resigned. The GameStop frenzy last month sent shares skyrocketing, causing a short-squeeze on a number of Wall Street hedge funds. GameStop traded below $20 per share in early January, before soaring to an intraday high of $483 on Jan. 28, a surge of more than 2,300%. The stock crashed below $50 by mid-February before Wednesday‚Äôs spike higher.

*****

&gt; # 4. Pfizer, Moderna work on shots against strain first discovered in South Africa

&gt; * Pfizer and BioNTech said on Thursday they‚Äôre testing a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine to better understand the immune response against new variants of the coronavirus. They are also in talks with regulatory authorities about testing a vaccine modified to protect specifically against the new variant originally found in South Africa.

&gt; * Moderna has shipped to the National Institutes of Health doses of a new Covid-19 vaccine designed to provide better protection against the variant spreading in South Africa. The new vaccine is ready to be tested in an early stage clinical trial to determine if it can be used as a booster shot against the highly transmissible strain.

*****

&gt; # 5. GOP rallies against Democrats‚Äô Covid relief package

&gt; * Republicans rallied solidly against Democrats‚Äô proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill as lawmakers awaited a decision by the Senate‚Äôs parliamentarian that could bolster or potentially kill a pivotal provision hiking the federal minimum wage. Despite narrow majorities on Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders were poised to push the sweeping package through the House on Friday. They were hoping the Senate, where changes seem likely, would follow quickly enough to have legislation on President Joe Biden‚Äôs desk by mid-March.

personalfinance,Credit card debt help: what to pay off first,"Okay so I have a question for someone who might be smarter with finances then me. 

So my husband has 2 credit cards. One we use for just groceries and it gets paid off the 1st of every months. The other is at 75% utilization.

I have ‚Äú3‚Äù credit cards. One is a Ashley furniture card that we just paid off, the other is actually my dads card and he pays it off every month I‚Äôm just a a authorized to user: have been since I was 16, and the other is mine. It‚Äôs at 50% utilization. But my over all utilization is only 30%. 

We are trying to get his credits score up. Mine is a 750 even with one card being at 50%. I‚Äôm due in July and will be quitting my job. Once I quit we won‚Äôt have ‚Äúextra‚Äù money to put on debt. But we are also trying to build our savings before I quit. 

Now the question. Which option is better 

Option 1: pay off my husband credit card 100% by may 1st. Continue to put $50 over my minimum payment on my card (card is never used now). after May 1st put ‚Äúextra‚Äù income into savings account instead of on my Credit card 

Option 2: get both cards down to 30% each by May 19th. After May 19th we‚Äôd then have to put $50 over the minimum payment on both credit cards instead of just one. Then put all extra income into savings. 

Personally I feel like it‚Äôs smarter to get my husbands card paid off because 
1. We don‚Äôt use mine ever. 
2. We‚Äôd be able to put more into the savings
3. My credit score is good even with my highly credit card balance. 

Oh and my interest rate is lower then my husbands. Even with my card having higher balance, our monthly interest is the same

personalfinance,$4500 return stuck in transit. Chargeback help.,"My partner bought a Macbook in December directly from Apple. After receiving it we found a much better deal on the exact same computer online. We were within the 2 week return period so we requested a return label from Apple. The computer had not even been opened. We received the FedEx return label and sent it out the next day.

6 weeks go by and we don't see a refund on our credit card statement. We contact Apple several times and they keep telling us the refund has already been issued and to wait 5-7 business days. After hearing this several times and not getting the refund, we go onto the FedEx website and track the return. The tracking says delivery is ""pending""--- same status for the last 2 months! We contact FedEx and they are zero help. Every attempt at contacting Apple we keep getting the same answer ""refund has already been issued, just wait.""

After several weeks of this back and forth and not getting a refund, we file a credit card dispute with our bank, Chase. We provide the return tracking number and screenshots of the chat conversations that says a refund has already been issued. We receive a ""temporary credit"" from them. 

Today, about a month after the dispute opened, we get a ""letter"" about the dispute from the merchant. Apple is saying that the return was never scanned in and it is past the return period so they are fighting the chargeback. 

Do we have any chance here or are we out almost $5k? Again, we used THEIR return label, and did everything we were supposed to. Thanks for any input!


TLDR: Returned a ~$5k computer bought directly from Apple with their return label. Return is stuck in transit. Apple does not issue refund. Filed a dispute with CC company, and Apple is fighting it.",finance
personalfinance,Prepayment penalty or not?,"Sorry for the noob question in advance; I searched reddit and google and couldn't find a perfect answer to this. Thanks for any help you can give!

I have a CA car loan for 5 yrs at a low interest rate and have 13k left. The dealership told me that CA doesn't have prepayment penalties but the contract language at the bottom of the post confuses me a bit.

**Finance charge:** 2,300  
**Amount financed:** 25,500  
**Total of payments:** 28,000

On an old online thread a few people said that this type of language means that you request the payoff amount and you're responsible for the interest that has accrued since your last monthly payment.

**Questions:**

1. As written, I'm understanding that **I'd pay ALL of the remaining interest on the** loan (\~1,300 or so) but I'm probably wrong.
2. What exactly is the **earned** part of the finance part? I presume the earned part is what you have paid off and the **unpaid** part is what you have remaining.
3. I'm confused what the **minimum finance charge** is. **What is it?** There's nothing in the contract speaking about it.
4. Finally, I'm a bit confused what the second part of the below paragraph means.

""...if the minimum finance charge is greater than the earned Finance Charge, you may be charged the difference; the minimum finance charge is as follows: (1) $25 if the original Amount Financed does not exceed $1,000, ....""

**Contract language:**

""1.d. You May Prepay: You may prepay all or part of the unpaid part of the Amount Financed at any time. If you do so, you must pay the earned and unpaid part of the Finance Charge and all other amounts due up to the date of your payment. As of the date of your payment, if the minimum finance charge is greater than the earned Finance Charge, you may be charged the difference; the minimum finance charge is as follows: (1) $25 if the original Amount Financed does not exceed $1,000, (2) $50 if the original Amount Financed is more than $1,000 but not more than $2,000, or (3) $75 is the original Amount Financed is more than $2,000.""",finance
personalfinance,What does a large monthly mortgage payment really feel like?,"My husband and I have been actively trying to buy our first home for the past several months and have either been outbid or discouraged by the 10-25 offers on any home that we really loved and are now looking at more and more expensive homes.

We're in Northern VA, and make $280k+ annually, have about $1k in monthly student loans and $1k in recurring monthly debt/misc mandatory expenses (cars, cell phones, internet, gym, etc). Excellent credit, no credit card debt, etc.

We have anywhere between $80k-$100k that we could put towards a down payment (we plan to do 10% down) and are budgeting $15k separately for closing costs. We'd still have leftover emergency savings.

The issue is with inventory so low, we are constantly adjusting our budget upwards and now are looking at $900k homes. from my calculations, this could put the monthly payment somewhere in the ballpark of $4200-$4700, depending on HOA, interest rate, etc.

We don't yet have children, and calculators aside, I was hoping to hear from some folks on what a $4000+ mortgage payment would really feel like. It makes me nervous to take on that much monthly debt (and I know that people should stick to where they're comfortable) but I guess I'm having a hard time really getting a sense of how it would feel. We currently rent a tiny condo for $1700 a month and hate it- I'm losing my mind. We're putting at least $5k away monthly into our savings account dedicated for home buying, but know that if we ever successfully have children, they will add significant monthly costs and that our personal costs are super low right now due to COVID and teleworking.

Does anyone have a $4000+ monthly payment? If so, could you share how much you make/what kind of debts or costs do you have, and how do you feel with that type of mortgage? Do you regret it and wish you'd gone with a cheaper home? Or is it worth it because you love your home so much? 

This is less a 'can we afford it' type post as I know the numbers can check out- albeit at a tight budget- and more just wanting to hear from others with this type of mortgage.",finance

I am m24, working full time in a ‚Äúreal‚Äù career without a degree,  have relatively low debt (6k/2 semesters work of student loans + car bill), and live at home while saving for a house. 

Last April, my car died and due to the uncertainty of the early pandemic, I had to go through a dealership and finance a car. Normally I would have payed cash for a beater as I am knowledgeable enough to keep one on the road. 

Due to mishaps surrounding leaving college, my credit score was low (but improving, all good with advice on that) and I was given a high interest rate. I now have an offer on the table to refinance and cut my interest in half. I have ~4 years and 10k left to pay off. 

I plan on putting a one time additional payment of $1000 from my tax refund towards the car, and need help on whether I should pay the additional payment THEN refinance, or refinance THEN make the additional payment. 

In additional to the one time payment, i plan on paying ~$100 a month towards the vehicle now that I have built a modest emergency fund. 

Any advice would be appreciated!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Will 2021 Be the Year in which BTC will Be Recognized Globally?,"Bitcoin. The world‚Äôs most valuable digital currency is both hot and cold. No doubt, it has had its episodes‚Äìmostly of defying investor expectations. Whether you were a holder or an observer, fluctuating crypto prices could be bliss or a train wreck gladly missed.

Heightened Volatility in 2020

Oscillating prices, nonetheless, weren‚Äôt specific to Bitcoin alone.¬†

Forex rates have been heavily impacted by depressed economic conditions, swinging widely over the last few months. It explains why a currency exchange rates comparison between different providers is critical to businesses, specifically for¬†larger-sum international money transfers, especially those in import and export.
Last year, some suffered heavy losses due to fiat price volatility.

Because of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic that adversely affected commerce, fiat currencies dependent on exports, for instance, were hammered because of contagion measures such as lockdowns.¬†

Central bank interventions also exacerbated the situation. The Federal Reserve (FED) and most central banks slashed interest rates to record lows. They continued to ease in reflation, mitigating the consequential effects of COVID-19.

Bitcoin Coming to Age

Amid this, safe havens like Bitcoin and gold posted superior performances, edging higher. Behind this were supportive fundamentals such as halving and the capital flight from Wall Street to value-preserving assets, of which Bitcoin prominently features.¬†

According to Bitcoin proponents, the coin is slowly but surely, inching closer towards¬†mainstream adoption. There are several attributes associated with Bitcoin that make it a darling for users.¬†

For libertarians, the coin represents value. For value seekers, the coin is heaven-sent. Yet, for those who treasure privacy, the technology behind the juggernaut marks the final turn of the screw ending financial surveillance and unwarranted profiling‚Äîat least not overtly.

Proponents say Bitcoin is a network, a foundation for the next financial system that will replace the inefficient legacy infrastructure. It prioritizes the end-user while at the same time ensuring high reliability, cheap value transfer, and 24/7 operations.¬†

There are two primary components of Bitcoin: The transactional layer and the native currency, BTC.¬†

The network, powered by globally distributed nodes, are incentivized for their transaction confirmation actions, cutting out the middleman by automating auditing trustlessly and continuously. Additionally, the network‚Äôs transactions are pseudonymous and secured by cryptography.

The Deflationary Feature in Bitcoin Preserves Value

Over the last few years, the growth of Bitcoin as an alternative network enabling the cheap transfer of funds is at the back of BTC prices‚Äô parabolic rise and the network‚Äôs increasing complexity.¬†

Notably, the network founder designed BTC to act like money but fixed the total supply at 21 million. The deflationary element combined with the increasing adoption over the years has seen prices rise to new levels. BTC has also evolved from being a medium of exchange to a store of value competing with gold.

Accordingly, Bitcoin prices have been volatile and on an uptrend.¬†

For instance, in the last decade, Bitcoin gained 1 million percent, once it rose from obscurity to peak at $19.7k in December 2017. Prices fell to $3.2k in December 2018 before exploding to $58k in mid-February 2021.¬†

Since Bitcoin and crypto are relatively nascent‚Äìwith comparatively low liquidity that doesn‚Äôt match traditional systems, the price remains a top concern. As such, holders pay close attention to their digital assets‚Äô prices. It is especially the case considering the level of intervention from central banks and governments in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.¬†

Central Banks Actively Debasing

In the last year, central banks debased their local currencies to keep afloat due to COVID-19 ravages.¬†

For perspective, from March 2020 to early January 2021, the USD lost roughly 10 percent following the FED chopping fund rates to record lows, keeping them between a range of 0 to 0.25 percent.¬†

It is massive because the greenback is a reserve currency that many central banks hold across the world.¬†

Therefore, its depreciation and volatility become consequential, having a domino effect whose reverberation was felt not only in trade but in other sectors of the economy.

It was particularly inconveniencing for traders who had to watch their assets debase through inflation‚Äôs eroding effects.¬†

Heavily reliant on best exchange rates for business purposes, they now have to focus on prices, time entries at currency exchanges and sift through thousands of providers for the best rate.¬†

All this could be avoided if not because of central banks‚Äô intervention and fiat debasement, sometimes not for economic mitigation, but to rig the global system and retain certain advantages, especially in trade.¬†

Will Bitcoin become Mainstream in 2021?

Currency manipulation and debasement of fiat currencies weigh negatively on trade. Unfortunately, banks have been accelerating draining value apparently without care.

Expectedly, this smashes the trust people had in central banks. Their relentless money printing erodes value on what citizens hold dear. Presently, the fiat value of assets doesn‚Äôt represent the trust a given currency initially had.¬†

In turn, the mistrust with central banks has caused a paradigm shift. The trustless nature of Bitcoin with baked-in deflationary features makes it an ideal platform for global users. Both institutional and retail investors can store their hard-earned value with¬†the expectation of even more gains.¬†

Besides, each coin is immune to central banks‚Äô actions meaning even if they lower rates and mint more, the value of each Bitcoin remains unaffected. Prices will only tick depending on user and holders‚Äô sentiment, not policymakers and politicians‚Äô whims.",cryptocurrency
btc,"Cointelegraph is a lying, market-manipulating fake news outlet run by scammers and bullies.","[Cointelegraph: Bitcoin Cash is on the brink of falling below 1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs price](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-cash-is-on-the-brink-of-falling-below-1-of-bitcoin-s-price)

The [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1364946006849187841) out this hit piece [twice](https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1364972173446807557) within an hour:

&gt;Life's a *BCH* for BitcoinCash as the forked coin drops by 96.5% in value vs. Bitcoin (BTC) in 3 years, [*@noshitcoins*](https://twitter.com/noshitcoins) explains.  
&gt;  
&gt;Will Bitcoin Cash slide out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies? Things appear bleak considering it once was the third-largest crypto by market cap one year ago.

Have you seen them allude to the words ""bitch"" and ""shit"" in a tweet about any other coin before? In a bull market, they constantly try to pump every centralized exit scam on the planet, by lavishly praising its DeFi TeChNoLoGy and promising buyers insane returns with their rosy headlines. (They were also [exposed](https://breakermag.com/we-asked-crypto-news-outlets-if-theyd-take-money-to-cover-a-project-more-than-half-said-yes/) for publishing paid shill pieces without marking them as such.)

They only hate the one coin that is sound, efficient, stateless money -- a fear of competition to the ponzinomics of useless tokens whose only purpose is speculation fed by their lies. Bear or bull, they've been attacking Bitcoin Cash non stop for three years.

&gt;Bitcoin Cash holders have *no reason to celebrate*, despite the 46% year-to-date gains in U.S. dollar terms. One year ago, the *altcoin* was the third-largest by market capitalization. It now risks dropping out of the top 10

Implying that the only thing to be celebrated about Bitcoin Cash is its price and relative market cap position. No mention of its actual utility, permissionless fast cheap payments, anywhere in the article. They have no clue what Bitcoin ever was other than a get-rich-quick scheme.

&gt;After three years of continuous devaluation, BCH finally traded below 0.01 Bitcoin on Feb. 22. Besides being psychological support, it marks a 96.5% devaluation from its highest close of 0.285 BTC on Aug. 2, 2017. Even though both cryptocurrencies' combined hash rate was somewhat comparable at the time, it has since become a one-sided battle, with BTC's hash rate dominance now over 98% versus BCH and Bitcoin SV combined.

AKA trying to trigger speculators' fear and herd instincts with ominous wording and constant appeals to popularity (the only things that supposedly matter are price, price-induced hashrate).

&gt;As the data indicates, Litecoin currently has double the number of Bitcoin Cash daily active addresses. *Therefore, the activity on the Bitcoin Cash network is more similar to that of Dash, an altcoin with a $2.2 billion market capitalization*

They NEVER mention the fact that Bitcoin Cash's transaction count has surpassed BTC, here or in any other article. Or that it has no congestion and remains fast and cheap to use nevertheless -- an empirical demonstration that big blocks work. Let's ignore that historic flip and completely focus on active addresses as the ONLY metric to judge network activity, to suit the FUD narrative.

&gt;The VORTECS‚Ñ¢ metric from Cointelegraph Markets Pro¬†began dropping on Feb. 18, just days before the price peaked.  The VORTECS‚Ñ¢ score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from multiple data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity. The score fell to sub-50 levels, and the drop in BCH price came four days later, losing the important $670 support level.

More appeals to popularity; also ""technical analysis,"" a pseudoscience similar to numerology and astrology, used by the likes of Contelescam in an attempt to manipulate the market with self-fulfilling predictions.

This is the kind of malicious disinformation we're up against.

Don't trust a word these con artists ever publish. They're part of the massive propaganda effort against Bitcoin as peer-to-peer cash and a vehicle of economic freedom. Their business model is trying to keep this pump-and-dump market alive and milking it for all they can before it inevitably collapses and is replaced by one driven by fundamental value.

I mean really all I have to do is beat 2.2% returns over the next six years which would be incredibly easy especially with something like ADA, where on top of that if I stake my ADA coins I will have about 4% return which that by itself covers more than the interest. in the next couple years I feel like ADA will surge much higher than what it is now and so I‚Äôm basically making free money as I see it. I am long on this investment so I‚Äôll be holding for a couple years at least and so if you don‚Äôt think I should do this then that means you think that ADA won‚Äôt go up in the next couple years and that it is going to be less than $1. I mean can anyone seriously tell me that they believe that this is the highest ADA will ever go that sounds ridiculous to say and I‚Äôm sure no one would actually think that this is the peak of ADA.  this is only the beginning and so I really don‚Äôt see any downsides. of course this is the line of credit which means I can‚Äôt afford to lose the money but I don‚Äôt see how I would lose it , really the only possible way I would lose it is the whole crypto market crashes which I do I believe is highly unlikely and if you go by that line of reasoning then no one should ever invest because the market always has a chance of crashing which we know is a possibility but it is also highly unlikely and it‚Äôs always better to invest your money then to just let it sit there and lose value to inflation. so all in all I think if I didn‚Äôt invest this money it would be pretty stupid of me and I see ADA as a perfect opportunity to invest in with low risk and very high upside of returns.

Feel free to make fun of me for not knowing, try and guide me a touch in the correct way though too if you could as well haha.

1. Is moving your coins from an exchange to your own wallet ever a taxable event?
1. When I stake a coin, is this a taxable event?
1. I can't figure out how to link my Blockfolio with my ledger Nano X, is this supported?
1. For a complete beginner, what is the simplest way to passively earn money on your own coins? Is it just staking (think KISS method, seriously I am dumb lol).
1. If my wallet address gets made public, the one that you would use to deposit Bitcoin to let's say, is my ""account"" compromised now?
1. What are the most simplest and user-friendly ways for novice to have a tangible way to interact with the crypto universe, I want to feel like I'm participating in a meaningful way. I use Brave browser, I think that counts?
1. Have another question about staking, let's say I have 500 coins of ADA and I stake all of it. After all has been staked I buy 1,000 more coins and it goes to the same wallet as my previously 500 staked ADA, does this new 1000 coins get staked automatically?
1. If I participate in a staking pool am I helping out the person that owns it way more than I'm helping out myself, am I just making some YouTuber rich? Full disclosure I went and used digital asset news to stake my ADA, hope this was not a dumb choice?
1. From the literature angle, are there any physical books related to all things crypto that people should read and educate themselves with? Follow up why do you make that recommendation for this book too?
1. Okay possibly really stupid question here, does it matter that I'm an American when I'm looking to buy Monero XMR I don't know if the feds will be stopping by since a potential percent of my portfolio could be XMR, anything else I should be aware of concerning this?
1. is there a way to hold your ""cash emergency funds"" inside the cryptoverse without suffering capital gains when you need to withdraw and use it should the emergency come up?
1. If I put some of my money into a stable coin to diversify and for safekeeping is there any way I can lose my money or is it super safe?

If I used the wrong terminology, ***please*** correct me so I can be on point next time I speak on this subject.

stocks,Introducing non-Canadians to SCR (The Score Media and Gaming) (aka TSCRF) - DD post,"The Score Media and Gaming is a Toronto based sports media company. If you are in North America, you are probably aware of The Score's sports app, which is the second most used sports app on the continent, behind only ESPN.

The Score started as a 24 hour sports broadcaster in Canada way back in 1997 (under the name Headline Sports, before rebranding to The Score). Eventually, they sold their broadcasting assets to Rogers Communications for $167M.

In their time as a sports network, they had developed Canada's most popular multi-sports app, and they kept their digital assets after the sale of the TV channel, and spun them off into a new company. That company (SCR) traded on the TSX Venture exchange until 2020, and then got uplisted to the TSX.

[I am writing about the company now, because as of probably tomorrow, SCR is being uplisted to the Nasdaq.](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1364665634626416645)

**Why Should I Care?**

For years, The Score has been growing it's presence, in the digital space. [As of late 2019, The Score had 4.3 million users worldwide, with 62% of them in the US, 27% in Canada and 11% in other international markets.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_Media_and_Gaming_Inc)

Once you have a platform that reaches that many people, the question is: how do you cash in on it? Up until recently, the play had been pure advertising, but the long term play had always been much bigger: **Sports Betting**.

The Score decided to enter the sports betting industry as an operator, commencing in the New Jersey market in late 2019. They started with market share of about 0.45% in Q1 2020, and steadily increased that to 1.3% by Q4 of 2020. Management reported an increase of 500% in total handle in September 2020 vs September 2020, with the trend holding in October.

In the last 6 months, they have launched in three more markets (Colorado, Indiana and Iowa).

But, none of this is the exciting part...

**Ok, so what's the exciting part?**

While The Score's app is popular in the US, it is omnipresent in it's home market of Canada. The Score is not only the top sports app in Canada, it has about twice the monthly users as the second place sports app (which is TSN...ie. Canada's version of ESPN).

Single sports betting is still currently illegal in Canada, but Bill C-218 is being fast-tracked to change that. [It passed it's second reading on February 17, 2021 with overwhelming support across all major parties](https://openparliament.ca/bills/43-2/C-218/). Next in the process is committee stage ([which is literally occurring as I write this](https://parlvu.parl.gc.ca/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20210225/-1/34842)), then the final reading and royal assent. There is no guarantee on the speed a bill will pass through Parliament, but with all parties supporting it, the bill could become law within weeks.

Bill C-218 would leave it to individual provinces to regulate, with the elephant in the room being Ontario, which has about 35-40% of Canada's population.

In November of 2020, [the Ford government in Ontario promised legislation which would end the provincial lottery's current monopoly on legal online casino games](https://www.onlinepokerreport.com/45574/ontario-ford-government-promises-online-gambling-legislation/). Sports gambling is expected to be part of this shift as soon as the feds give the ok. With Michigan legalizing single sports betting, and all the tax money currently being lost to off-share operators (part of the justification for the casino game shift), sports betting in Ontario could be open for private operators as early as this year.

And, if that happens, SCR becomes an unbelievable play.

The Score's largest market is it's home market of Ontario. It is based in Toronto. When it was a TV network it's open-window studio at King and John was a local landmark. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that almost every serious sports fan in Ontario already has the Score App on their phone.

[The Score has 1.4M active monthly users in Ontario.](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/46185/canada-sports-betting-winners/#:~:text=Toronto%2Dbased%20TheScore%20estimated%20a,in%20annual%20gross%20gaming%20revenue) For a province with about 14.5M people, that's about 10% of every man, woman and child in the province who uses The Score's app regularly.

[The Ontario sports betting market is estimated to be worth between $1.5B and $2.1B in gross annual revenues](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/46185/canada-sports-betting-winners/#:~:text=Toronto%2Dbased%20TheScore%20estimated%20a,in%20annual%20gross%20gaming%20revenue).

The hardest part about growing as a sports betting operator is user acquisition. The Score already has that taken care of. Their target market is already checking sports scores on their app. It's not a big move to get those interested in gambling on those games to also use the same app.

They have their app already loaded on the phones of most of their target market, and have a brand advantage with a decades-long head start on any American competitors who try to enter the market.

[The Score's revenue over the last 12 months is just over $20M.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SCR.TO/financials?p=SCR.TO) **If we are conservative, and estimate that they achieve a 10% market share in Ontario, that's about 150M to $210M in revenue**. Meaning, that **Ontario revenues alone could increase the Score's annual revenue by 7.5 to 10.5 times their current levels**.

...and that's just one Canadian market. The Score is the top sports app across Canada, and will have easy footholds into other Canadian markets once they open, too. They are a local Canadian player who have never skirted the rules by operating offshore, and who have expertise operating in heavily regulated markets since they were a broadcaster. As such, they are a prime candidate for any Canadian government to support through the regulatory process.

Ontario represents about 35-40% of Canada's population, so the above revenue projections are only the start. Markets in Alberta, BC, Quebec, and other smaller provinces would be significant boons to follow.

And, of course, as the #2 sports app in the US, The Score is constantly entering new American markets. Iowa just opened in the last couple of weeks. [A Score representative just testified before the Ohio Senate Select Committee yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamblingstocks/comments/lrq2ot/for_an_inside_scoop_read_the_scrs_testimony_today/). Being publicly listed and regulated on the Nasdaq can only help The Score's push to be regulated in more and more US markets.

One of the things that any marijuana stock investor has seen over the years is that legalization provides numerous catalysts for stock growth. Rumours of legalization, election of pro-legalization representatives, each step of the legislative process, etc. There are tons of catalysts that we will see as sports betting gets legalized across Canada and the US...and the next catalyst is the Nasdaq uplist tomorrow, which will allow ETF and other institutional investors to buy into the stock. While there isn't official confirmation that the uplist will be tomorrow, whether it is tomorrow or next week, the uplist should be a serious catalyst for the stock, both short and long term.

[With their IPO on the Nasdaq, The Score has secured funding of $162M](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224006208/en/theScore-Announces-Pricing-of-Upsized-Initial-Public-Offering-in-the-United-States#:~:text=The%20underwriters%20have%20agreed%20to,announced%205%2C000%2C000%20Class%20A%20Shares). So, they are also flush with cash to pursue all the growth opportunities I discussed above.

**...But there's more**

While sports betting will be the big short term driver of the stock, there is another driver which is probably coming behind it: eSports betting.

While The Score hasn't announced plans to launch an eSports betting platform, the move seems like a no-brainer.

The CEO of The Score, John Levy, has his sons work with him at the company. They each work in different areas, and one of them happens to be big into eSports. So, dad let him run with it and build an eSports platform. [At the time that I write this, The Score eSports has 1.64M subscribers on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSCoziKHqjqbox3Fv3Pb4BA).

They have recently started using their background in broadcasting, and their platform in eSports, and [obtained exclusive English broadcasting rights for the League of Legends Demacia Championship](https://mobile.thescore.com/2020/12/thescore-esports-named-exclusive-english-language-broadcast-partner-for-league-of-legends-demacia-championship/).

The formula they used with the sports app was: create the platform, acquire the users, then find a way to monetize it (ie. sports betting).

Once The Score makes their push into sports betting, is there any reason why they wouldn't use the exact same technology, along with their eSports presence, to push into eSports betting?

It just seems like such an obvious next step which, at the moment, has a very low barrier to entry.

This is an emerging area, which most of the big sports betting players don't currently participate in, but is one that could see major growth in future years (especially as the comparably young demographics of eSports players get old enough to legally bet). With an existing eSports platform to leverage, and a sports betting platform already operating, The Score are positioned very well to take advantage of this future growth driver, when the time is right.

**Conclusion**

In recent years, we have seen a ton of retail investors enter the market. A lot of them have their main investments with a broker, while they use their investment ""fun money"" to day trade. The companies that you are seeing inflate to wild valuations right now are companies that engage in ""fun"" highly visible industries which appeal to those retail investors.

With that context: Oh, what a time to be a business with huge growth prospects in sports betting and esports!

As Canadian legalization has come closer, The Score saw a run-up in it's value up to a high of $5.67/share. Over the last week, they executed a 10:1 reverse share split, in order to facilitate their Nasdaq entry. Between that, profit taking, the announcement of the IPO share sales, and a couple of generally bad market days, the stock's value has dropped down to about $35.70/share (equivalent of $3.61 if compared to pre-reverse split prices). That value is in Canadian dollars, so the equivalent of about 28.42 in USD.

With all that now priced into the stock, this looks like the perfect time to get in. As of tomorrow (probably), when the Nasdaq listing goes up, US institutional investors and ETF's will be able to get in on the stock. Once further catalysts hit, for legalization and opening, The Score has a chance to soar in value.

Disclaimer: I am not an investment advisor. This is not investment advice. This is for entertainment purposes only. Do your own due diligence.

Disclosure: I currently own 800 shares of The Score, with 500 of those shares being added this week, and I may increase my position further in the coming days.

I do not know all the specifics but my question is broad enough that it won't entirely matter I hope. I have been research the avalanche vs snowball method of debt repayment and have also learned about risk tolerance/aversion. Because the sheer amount of her debt is so staggering I thought it more prudent to refinance whatever loans were able to be refinanced and do a long play strategy....paying the monthly minimums and investing the ""rest"". Even if I fully supported her and took over our COL; we could MAYBE pay the loans off in 5 years? We are both 28 and have been in professional school prior to this so neither of us have any real retirement savings/etc. I don't want to delay any more time that are monies could be invested and compounding in order to pay off the debt I think?

I did a search of this topic before posting but wanted to specify what everyone was referring to when they say ""invest the rest"". Is this just retirement investing, maxing 401k and contributing to Roths (if possible) or are we talking like brokerage ETFs (3 fund accounts)?

btc,NYAG Bitfinex/Tether Settlement Redux,"As many have heard, the New York Attorney General's office has [settled their Tether legal action](https://www.coindesk.com/ny-ags-850m-probe-of-bitfinex-tether-ends-in-an-18-5m-settlement) for a mere $18.5 million fine. Also Bitfinex is prohibited from transacting with customers residing in New York State. NYAG stated that Tether was not fully backed, but Bitfinex admitted no wrongdoing.  

To many this settlement appears to be a very easy out for Bitfinex. The Tether money printing scam is blatant, that Tether artificially inflates BTC price is an open secret in the crypto sector. Bitfinex now is free to continue printing Tethers to their heart's content. 

A backroom deal might've been hatched by NYAG, where US government actors essentially take over Bitfinex or at least seize control of the Tether printing presses. Let's face it, the **US government simply MUST have the ability to control prices of ANY asset or currency which challenges the US dollar.** The Fed and BIS control exchange rates with all foreign currencies, keeping everything weak against USD.  The Fed and hedge funds artificially suppress gold and silver prices with ""paper metals"" ETFs and naked shorting. What better way to control BTC price than to take over Tether presses?

A month ago I posted a thread about Wall Street traders likely having inside information on the Tether lawsuit. It's simply not plausible that multiple Fortune 500 corporations would be trading billions worth of BTC without knowing that the Tether lawsuit would be hand-waved away. It appears this was the case. BTC will continue mooning, likely until the Fed is ready to launch its CBDC central bank digital currency. When the CBDC is ready, they can dump BTC down to $3k or lower by pulling out the Tether rug. And they will likely use that CBDC to panic-buy up the remaining BTC and corner the market.

CryptoCurrency,Andrew Poelstra's case for why bitcoin's Proof-Of-Work incentivizes capitalistic specialization and decentralization based on... thermodynamics??,"I only just recently came across [this paper](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf) from Andrew Poelstra, making the case that ASIC specialization for bitcoin mining inherently supports decentralization. I found the connection between hash rate and meat-space limits to energy production fascinating, and wanted to share the paper with this sub. I'm open to discussing any criticisms as well, so fire away!

First, he states that physically separated mining operations can more closely approach the thermodynamic limit of energy production/consumption, since there are limits to how much heat you can dissipate in a local area. This already incentivizes miners to physically decentralize, dispersing across the globe. 

Now, many point to the fact that electricity generation is an economy of scale (i.e. electricity can be generated more efficiently with large expensive generators than small cheap ones). This implies that miners will gradually centralize, as the more money you have, the more electricity you can generate cheaply, the higher your hashrate, the more bitcoin you can mine, the more you can invest in generators, etc. His response is that:

1. The same point about centralization can be made about almost any industry that demonstrates economies of scale. 

2. Waste heat can be fed back more efficiently better in different areas based on local energy sources and governmental regulations. This difference in waste efficiency based on physical location combats the centralization due to economy of scale.

3. China's advantage in cheap electricity generation will be combatted by renewable energy sources balancing the generation market and expected regulatory action on the part of China, reducing their advantages.

So long story short, Poelstra believes these decentralization forces will combat the centralization incurred by electricity generation's economy of scale. Now moving into ASICs...

ASICs can output more hash power for the same amount of energy, reducing environmental impact. There is a fear that a select few ASIC manufacturers will dominate the hardware market that miners support. Natural market forces combat this, with huge competition already observable in the ASIC manufacturer space. He goes on to make cases for bitcoin's hashing algorithm and cases against Proof-Of-Stake, but I was more fascinated by everything up to this point. 

Market forces incentivize miners to explore different geographical areas and even privatizes certain aspects of energy generation and consumption. We're already seeing waste fuel being used for mining operations, per Great American Mining (and I'm sure there are countless other innovations occurring). This underscores what's possible when energy generation is moved away from inefficient government-subsidized monopolies, and into the hands of bitcoin-incentivized private enterprise. Though mining requires a great deal of energy, I think it will also drive great creative innovation in energy efficiency breakthroughs. Anyway, I'd be curious to hear what you all hear about this, as I found the ideas super interesting.

&gt;Several Federal Reserve presidents argued Thursday that surging Treasury yields reflect economic optimism for a solid recovery from the Covid-19 crisis and stressed that the central bank has no plans to tighten policy prematurely.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI think the rise in yields is probably a good sign so far because it does reflect better outlook for U.S. economic growth and inflation expectations which are closer to the committee‚Äôs inflation target,‚Äù St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told reporters after a virtual speech.  
&gt;  
&gt;Comments by Bullard and two other Fed leaders, Atlanta‚Äôs Raphael Bostic and Kansas City‚Äôs Esther George, showed that the central bank‚Äôs policy makers are solidly united behind Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs patience in making any adjustments to monetary policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Powell told lawmakers this week that the nation was still a ‚Äúlong way‚Äù from the Fed‚Äôs goals for full employment and price stability, signaling the central bank will maintain ultra-easy monetary policy for some time -- despite hopes for a strong economy later this year as vaccinations spread.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed presidents agreed with Powell‚Äôs characterization of the rise in yields as ‚Äúa statement of confidence‚Äù in the economic outlook. The 10-year Treasury yield reached 1.61% Thursday, the highest in more than a year, before trimming its gains.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yields on U.S. 10-year notes have climbed to the highest in more than a year  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúMuch of this increase likely reflects growing optimism in the strength of the recovery and could be viewed as an encouraging sign of increasing growth expectations,‚Äù George said in a speech.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bostic told reporters he was not expecting the Fed to respond to rising yields: ‚ÄúYields have definitely moved at the longer end, but right now I am not worried about that.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;All three Fed presidents said it was premature to begin discussing tapering of the central bank‚Äôs massive bond-buying program, with Bullard noting that Powell would initiate the discussion when it‚Äôs appropriate. Strong Rebound  
&gt;  
&gt;In separate remarks, a fourth Fed leader, New York‚Äôs John Williams, said the economy was poised for a strong rebound. ‚ÄúIndeed, with strong federal fiscal support and continued progress on vaccination, GDP growth this year could be the strongest we‚Äôve seen in decades,‚Äù he said, though he added that underlying inflation is likely to remain ‚Äúsubdued for some time.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Bullard echoed that optimism, noting the Atlanta Fed‚Äôs tracking model shows robust growth for gross domestic product in the first quarter. He predicted the U.S. unemployment rate will drop to 4.5% by year‚Äôs end, with pent-up demand and elevated savings boosting spending by Americans.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI gave a rosy outlook today but it‚Äôs only an outlook,‚Äù Bullard said. As for a policy change, ‚Äúthe chair has wanted to start that conversation only when it‚Äôs appropriate and not get ahead of ourselves even though we do have high hopes the pandemic will come to an end.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Bostic emphasized that the labor market still has considerable pain, especially for lower-income workers and minorities, and that it would take a long time to regain the 10 million jobs that have been lost.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúJust to remind you, our mandate is full employment,‚Äù Bostic said Thursday during a virtual speech to the Atlanta Fed‚Äôs banking-outlook conference. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not full GDP. It is not the size of GDP. So this disparity is something that is important and something we are going to have to continue to watch closely.‚Äù",finance

Overall a fantastic quarter/year but I question their ability to continue to grow revenue in a rising interest rate environment and shrinking real estate market. Leadership clearly is aware of the problem and are working on ways to grow but I really don't have a ton of confidence that this will be possible given that the historical growth in these arms has been minimal and throwing more money at the problem isn't necessarily a solution.

solar,Advice on if I should take the plunge as a new homeowner. California resident,"I've gotten two quotes for solar panels from two different companies, both seem to be highly respected and trustworthy. I purchased my first house last year, doing some light remodeling until I'm experienced enough for the big jobs. I want solar for the added benefit of a stable monthly bill and for the green energy. 

I've only had a few months of energy bills for this house, but I did provide bills from the place I was renting previously which was only 100-150 sq ft smaller. My bills for the summer last year were a little high because we were growing medicinal  planets inside, but i don't think that affected too much. More than likely we will grow more, but not at the energy level as before. 

Here's some data.

House is 1300-1400 sq ft.

Past three months of bills and energy use:

$54/494kw, $69/646kw, $57/525kw.

There is a $30ish dollar infrastructure charge that goes with each of these bills. So I am paying about $80-$120 a month. This is over winter so i am assumed Summer will be much more. 

Off the bat, the loan rate is going to be more than than my winter payments but probably the same for summer. There is no prepayment penalty with the loan so I have the plan to pay it off as soon as possible. 

I was quoted 14 panels at a 6% interest rate. These panels will provide 532kWh/month - 707kWh/month. According to the salesman of course. 

Price is $31,850. There's the $6600 tax credit, and an additional $6000 off if I let them advertise and try to sell to three friends/family. I'm not counting that as a guarantee. I'm looking at around $25,500 for the panels.

My monthly bill would be $126 (if i pocket the tax credit, $241) at a 25 year loan. No prepayment penalty remember. 

I'd still pay the $30 infrastructure charge, so roughly $156 a month. Still cheaper than my summer months when I was renting. Peace of mind knowing my budget is stagnant throughout the year though.

Seems smarter to save for a few years and purchase the system in cash or find outside financing. I talked to one of my banks and they only do $20,000 to be paid back at 84 months. I'm going to keep shopping at my other banks though, but to be honest its either cash or the solar companies financing.",energy

dogecoin,A few lessons learned from a newby DOGE trader on Coinbase,"So, I'm in on DOGE, and the advice on the boards for how to use Coinbase  specifically is very well written and accurate. However, I made a few  embarassing mistakes that I thought I would share in case other people  are looking into this option:

* I used ETH as the coin to purchase on Coinbase. ETH is (as of right now) about $1630. BE CAREFUL with the coin you choose as a jumping off point into DOGE. Fractions of a huge coin can be tricky to navigate.  I have a seperate banking account, used for this purpose alone, tied to Coinbase. I would advise setting up a separate account before you start investing/buying until you are comfortable with the method to get DOGE. I made a couple of errors when attempting to buy ETH, and quickly drained that account by accident. If you have a separate account with only what you wish to invest, Coinbase will simply return 'Insufficient funds' if you go over your balance.
* Selling coin can be a lengthy process before you are able to convert to fiat cash. So, when I goofed (see previous point), and accidentally bought more ETH than I'd initially wanted to, I had to wait about a week after selling before I could recover those funds back into the account. Except for the selling fees, I didn't actually lose any monies, but my stupid self had a few thousand dollars stuck in Coinbase's account and locked up for that length of time.
* If you manage to avoid the above pitfalls, I would recommend transferring a very small amount (I did $50 to begin with) relative to the size of the initial investment to get the hang of using Changelly. It takes a little bit of practice; I wouldn't suggest risking an accident with your entire investment.

personalfinance,Condo in major city. Can we afford?,"I'm admittedly nervous about this whole process... but I feel i've done my diligence, and looking for any advice you all may have.

Major city in US

At my prior job I made 95k (+25k bonus) so \~120k all in. I just accepted a job \~ half a year ago where I'm making 125k (+75k bonus). My s/o makes 60k a year. I have \~35k in cash saved, I am currently saving 19.5k per year in my 401k (from first 3 years of employment I have 40k in 401k). I have 15k in an emergency fund. My s/o has \~10k saved up, but I am helping them begin to put more down towards the 401k.

I have \~53k in student loans I am aiming to have paid off in \~8.5 years. We currently pay $2350 in rent in a major city. We are looking at a 400k condo that will cost us \~$2,700 per month per a mortgage calculator I built. We are able to put 5% down (considering the cash i have saved). Tack on student loan payments of \~$750 a month and we are at \~$3500 a month to live. According to my budget, which excludes my bonus, we are able to save \~2.5k a month after all living expenses (although it certainly doesnt feel that way :) ). I do expect a bonus in the range of $24,000 after taxes this year, and next year that will be closer to that $75k (pretax) i mentioned earlier.

I grew up with very little money, and that has caused me to be very frugal in my adult life. The last thing I want to do is be stressed and house poor, but i do not want my money to sit idle because i am frugal in nature. I feel as this is a great time to invest in a condo in a major city considering the flight to the suburbs re: covid as well as interest rates. My s/o and I are also ready to have a place of our own.

Please lend some insight as to anything that I am missing. I appreciate all the help. If there are any other subs you think i would get more feedback on, please let me know.",finance
stocks,Scotts Miracle-Gro ($SMG) - A Play on Cannabis [Hawthorne Gardening],"Scotts Miracle-Gro CEO, Jim Hagedorn, calls the ‚Äúpot business‚Äù, in which he intends to invest ‚Äúlike, half a billion‚Äù the ‚Äúbiggest thing I‚Äôve ever seen in lawn and garden.‚Äù 

**Hawthorne Gardening Co**

Formed in October 2014, Hawthorne Gardening is The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company's subsidiary for **cannabis growers** and one of the first major investments by a major United States corporation in the cannabis industry.

On February 3rd, 2021 SMG [Announced Third Quarter Financial Results, Increased Fiscal 2020 Guidance and Approval of Special Dividend](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/hawthorne-gardening-q1-revenue-grows-71-to-309-million/)($309 million)

HIGHLIGHTS
- Company reports first-ever profit for fiscal first quarter
- Full year sales guidance increased; Non-GAAP adjusted EPS guidance reaffirmed

&gt;First quarter sales for the Hawthorne segment increased 71 percent to $309.4 million driven by strong demand in all categories of indoor growing equipment and supplies. U.S. Consumer segment sales increased 147 percent to $408.2 million. Consumer purchases of the Company‚Äôs products at its largest retail partners increased 40 percent in the quarter. A significant portion of the sales increase for U.S. Consumer is attributable to replenishing of retail inventory

*‚ÄúOur year-round commitment to driving the conversation with consumers will include our first commercial specially produced for the Super Bowl. That kind of reach, coupled with our data-driven and highly targeted approach to social media, is key in our efforts to retain the millions of new consumers who have entered our category over the past year.‚Äù*

&gt;Hawthorne Gardening was created ""to meet the demands of hydroponic growers (a.k.a. cannabis growers) ... [it] markets itself [to them] using language that's in line with the free-spirited, artisanal cannabis farmer.""

In my opinion, with [cannabis legalization](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260844/cannabis-legislation-congress-democrats-congress) on the horizon and many Americans still in quarantine, people will turn to homegrowing &amp; DIY hydroponic projects.

**Cannabis Lobbying**

Did you know...

Scotts Miracle-Gro was the main financial supporter of push to legalize weed in New Jersey:

https://mjbizdaily.com/scotts-miracle-gro-leads-funding-to-legalize-adult-use-cannabis-in-new-jersey/

&gt;The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company has emerged as the primary financial backer of New Jersey‚Äôs cannabis legalization effort, donating **$800,000** to two campaign committees formed to back the Nov. 3 ballot question that would amend the state constitution to allow cannabis to be bought and sold for recreational use.

&gt;Our viewpoint‚Äîcannabis legalization

Forty-six states have now elected to end prohibition of cannabis and adopt alternative means of regulating its production and distribution within their jurisdiction. Their ultimate objective is responsible production, distribution and consumption of cannabis and combating illegal drug abuse. There are now roughly 15,000 licensed cannabis businesses in the United States, 200,000 people employed in the industry, and more than 2 million medical cannabis patients served by the industry.

- *We believe the time has come for the United States to create a legal marketplace as other countries have already done. Given the current political backdrop, however, we recognize this is unlikely in the near-term. That is why we believe‚Äîat a minimum‚ÄîCongress should honor the principles of federalism and states‚Äô rights by passing legislation that respects the will of voters and state legislatures that have elected to adopt their own approach to authorizing the use of cannabis within their boundaries.*

- *We also believe the federal government should allow this industry to function like any other business. This means state-licensed cannabis businesses should have access to banking and other financial services, operate with the same tax structure as other businesses and not be threatened by federal prosecution if they comply with state laws.*

They got what they wanted, 3 days ago, [New Jersey governor signs law decriminalizing marijuana use for those 21 years and older](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/02/22/politics/new-jersey-marijuana-legalization/index.html)

Further, in markets where cannabis is legal, it allows law enforcement resources to focus on more serious crime. The alarming truth is that between 2001 and 2010, there were more than 8 million cannabis-related arrests in the United States. Approximately 88 percent of those arrests were for possession crimes, which generally involve only small amounts of cannabis. Prior to any state legalizing adult-use cannabis, states spent a combined $3.6 billion per year enforcing cannabis possession laws.

**Conclusion**

I would typically throw out a few (call)option plays, but, there is just no liquidity. We are approaching a solid buy opportunity as the yearly would indicate &gt;90% oversold.  Healthy retrace almost complete, imo.

From what I can find online it‚Äôs an annual rate. So if I‚Äôm understanding correctly they short 1M shares when the price is $40 than the interest on that is $7,700/week. Even if the interest rate fluctuates with the share price and it goes to $200 than a 1% interest rate would only be $385,000/week. Still a ton in normal terms, but for a billion dollar hedge fund seems easy to wait out unless the price stays abnormally high for a significant amount of time. What am I missing?

Hopefully the questions aren‚Äôt too stupid, we are still learning everyday about this process. Thank you! 

We locked our rate on Feb 4th with an interest rate of 2.5, no point no fee for a single family home. Today, when we get our final closing disclosure, rate is still 2.5 but with point and a fee of $1775. The reason was even though the house is a sfh, on title and legal documents it is identified as condominium or detached condo. We asked our lender in writing right from the moment we knew it was listed as condominium if this would effect our interest rate. He said no because in reality it is a sfh. But now, turned out it is effecting us. 

He then offer us a 2.625% interest rate and $700 credit which we could put towards closing cost. We are thinking about negotiating the fee with lender, maybe 50:50, has anyone done this with their lender before? No one said negotiating is prohibited so we were just thinking why not? Or should we go with his offer for 2.6% and a $700 credit. Number wise, the 2.5% makes sense in the long time but we have to put down more money at closing. The 2.6% sounds good right now at closing because we would pay less. But in the long term, we technically pay more for interest rate. How would you decide which situation is better for you?

stocks,Feedback loop(convexity hedging) is ongoing in the treasury market due to mortgage-backed bond investors. Be careful guys.,"There comes a point in any big selloff in Treasury bonds when the move becomes so pronounced that it starts to feed on itself. Increases in yields force a crucial group of investors to sell Treasuries, which in turn leads to further increases in yields. Two months into this rout, that moment appears to have arrived, and it‚Äôs beginning to send shudders throughout all corners of U.S. financial markets.

The forced sellers are investors in the $7 trillion mortgage-backed bond market. Their problem is that when Treasury yields -- which strongly influence home-loan rates -- suddenly rise sharply, many Americans lose interest in refinancing their old mortgages. A reduced stream of refinancings means mortgage-bond investors are left waiting for longer to collect payments on their investments. The longer the wait, the more financial pain they feel as they watch market rates climb higher without being able to take advantage of them. Their answer: unload the Treasury bonds they hold with long maturities or adjust derivatives positions -- a phenomenon known as convexity hedging -- to compensate for the unexpected jump in duration on their mortgage portfolios. The extra selling just as the market just as the market is already weakening has a history of exacerbating upward moves in Treasury yields -- including during major ‚Äúconvexity events‚Äù in 1994 and 2003.

This go around, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs massive presence in the mortgage-bond market -- it‚Äôs adding about $40 billion of the securities each month to its balance sheet -- has created something of a stabilizing force that has kept the market‚Äôs hedging needs in check. Even so, waves of mortgage investors adjusting their portfolios could still have an outsized impact on rates that reverberates across asset classes, market watchers say. ‚ÄúEveryone -- except the Fed -- is a convexity hedger at some point because as your portfolio keeps getting longer with the rise in rates it will become increasingly painful,‚Äù said Joshua Younger, head of U.S. interest-rate derivatives strategy at JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp;amp; Co. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more flexibility now for those who need to hedge so rates rising won‚Äôt cause the train to go off the rails. But even a train on the rails can be difficult to stop.‚Äù

Ten-year Treasury yields surged as much as 0.23 percentage point to a more than one year high of 1.61% Thursday before the selloff eased. Overall convexity hedging needs are likely at peak levels near the 1.6% area, Morgan Stanley strategist Guneet Dhingra wrote in a note to clients, potentially creating further upward pressure on yields in the middle of the Treasury curve. Five-year yields climbed even more than long-term rates, jumping as much as 0.26 percentage point to about 0.86% before paring their ascent. For Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho International, the spike in five-year rates is a warning signal that the selloff is going beyond a repricing, toward a convexity move, suggesting U.S. stocks and credit spreads will suffer further. The Nasdaq 100 fell as much as 3.7% Thursday, its biggest intraday drop since October. 

Read more: Treasury yields surge past 1.6%, sounding alarm for risk assets 

Still, few expect to see anything like what occurred in 2003, when convexity hedging helped fuel a roughly 1.5 percentage-point increase in 10-year Treasury yields over just two months, triggering widespread losses for bond investors. That‚Äôs because roughly a third of all mortgage-backed securities are now held by the Fed, which doesn‚Äôt hedge its duration risk, and another third by U.S. banks, which also largely don‚Äôt. Back in 2003, before the Fed started buying mortgage bonds to help stimulate the economy, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owned more than 20% of the market and were major convexity hedgers.

Nonetheless, there are enough mortgage-bond investors that do hedge to raise concerns just as yields threaten to become unmoored. Bank of America Corp. last week estimated there to be north of $60 billion of convexity hedging needs in terms of 10-year equivalents, the bulk coming from mortgage lenders, which must hedge their loan pipelines. The fact that investors are on high alert for mortgage-bond hedging effects despite being aware that non-hedgers now own the lion‚Äôs share of the debt should help ensure future portfolio adjustments are more ‚Äúorderly‚Äù than in years past, according to Mahesh Swaminathan, a securitized-bond strategist at Hilltop Securities. ‚ÄúThe focus now on this risk is positive for the marketplace and from a big-picture standpoint,‚Äù said Swaminathan. ‚ÄúThis will prevent the situation of people being so far off sides that they have to make a sudden and huge adjustment. People are being vigilant about potential duration extension in the mortgage market.‚Äù


*My take:* while I don‚Äôt have any time machine, I don‚Äôt think this rise in yield will sustain as FED continues to abolish the free market. So, I think FED fund rates won‚Äôt rise and the yield in treasury will fall pretty quickly and we will have negative real interest rate in the future.

It logically follows that this is probably a good opportunity to buy the dip.

CryptoCurrency,Theoretical use case : Voting,"I have been reflecting quite a bit on crypto in the abstract lately, and what other use cases might be viable. In essence - the whole point is to produce a safe and secure way to keep track of a ledger. And while it's true that ledgers are exceptionally important in the world of finance, they're also the system used to keep track of nearly all forms of democracy.

By that, I mean that sending someone one dollar is essentially the same as sending them one ""vote"". Both require high degrees of safety, security, anonymity, and trust.

&amp;#x200B;

To that end, here's is a basic proposed system for voting via crypto-ledgers :

A government issues an ID card to a citizen, which guarantees them the right to vote and all the benefits of citizenship. Attached to this ID system is a crypto wallet. Importantly, this wallet is only able to receive transactions from one source (the federal government), and is only able to send transactions to one of a few sources on a few days each election cycle (which represent the voting bins of various politicians, and which are wallets owned and controlled by the federal government). These voting bins are only allowed to receive tokens from citizens, and only able to transfer tokens to the federal government.

When it comes time to vote, the federal government distributes a single vote-token to each citizen. Then, on voting day, transactions are open and each citizen can transfer their vote-token to a voting-bin. Verification occurs from 33% through the federal government, 33% through local governments (regional, state, etc...), and 33% through an independent election certification board. These contracts serve to verify citizenship (stopping election fraud), and to ensure that votes go where they should (meaning each vote is counted and recounted thousands of times). A totality of consensus must be met before the transaction of citizen vote -&gt; voting bin occurs.

To fund these elections, as is tradition, the federal government pays out money (in this case, some side token like BUSD, etc) to miners (who verify the legality of the election).

I'm not sure BTC or ETH could handle something like this (due to fees and speed). But since Cardano is supporting native tokens and is getting babel fees, it seems like a solid use case.

Not only is it safer and more secure than traditional voting, it's also decentralized - so we don't have to worry about fraudulent elections in developing or corrupt parts of the world. Also, individuals can track their own votes, the votes get counted thousands of times, and the votes are counted by multiple different sources to guarantee accuracy. It seems like a no-brainer.",cryptocurrency
investing,I believe KWG Resources Inc (CNSX:KWG) and Noront Resources Inc (CVE:NOT) are a great long-term investment opportunity. But what do I know. I‚Äôm just an unemployed banquet server.,"Normally I would be very skeptical investing in penny stocks but I have stumbled upon these two companies trading at pennies and can‚Äôt figure out why this isn‚Äôt the investment opportunity of a lifetime. ¬†  

‚ÄúNoront holds eight mineral deposits of chromite, nickel, copper, zinc, platinum, palladium, along with 100 documented mineral occurrences with showings of gold, titanium, vanadium, diamonds and cobalt.‚Äù I bought a little bit of NOT in 2014 at 62 cents after news broke out that Cliffs Natural Resources announced they would abandon its $550-million investment in the Ring of Fire and sell it to Noront Resources at an eventual 95% discount.¬† Noront had a 90% claim to the Ring of Fire with a ‚Äúplan to mine just under one million tonnes of chromite annually, producing enough semi-finished ferrochrome to supply half of the U.S. stainless steel industry.‚Äù¬† At the time of my investment it seemed like relationships with First Nation people was hindering any progress of the mine. ‚ÄúThe reason nothing was happening in the Ring of Fire has nothing to do with the value of the deposits. It is entirely due to the inability of governments on all levels, including First Nations, provincial, and federal, to reach consensus on land tenure and development plans.‚Äù¬† Fast forward to 2021 and I‚Äôve lost over half of my money as Noront is now trading at 30 cents.  

Since I bought NOT, the Canadian government has promised to fund the roads needed to start the project.¬† ‚ÄúThe planning and construction is being overseen by a combination of Martin Falls and Webequie First Nations and the Ontario government.¬† Progress on getting the roads built has been slower than Noront would like, but the company anticipates all the environmental assessments wrapping up by 2023, followed by permitting and two years of road construction leading toward a 2025 completion.¬† Also, holding a 10 percent stake in the Ring of Fire, KWG Resources, is now forging ahead with a $2 billion railway that would run 330 kilometres, expanding the rail infrastructure in the region for the first time in decades.¬† I did not buy any shares of (CNSX:KWG) and at the time of writing this KWG is trading at 3 cents.¬† How is this possible when there seems to be so much in the pipeline for these two companies?  

‚ÄúCopper, aluminium, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, and nickel are required for a range of low-carbon technologies, making them crucial elements for realizing a low-carbon future,‚Äù according to the World Bank Report: Minerals for Climate Action: The Mineral Intensity of the Clean Energy Transition.¬† Three of these minerals, chromium, nickel and copper can be found in the Ring of Fire.¬† Both Noront and KWG would seem to benefit from a move towards low carbon technologies and could reap the benefits with an increased need for these minerals. ¬†  

One of these technologies can be seen in the emergence of electric vehicles. ¬† Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees improved batteries, more readily available charging infrastructure, new markets, and price parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles as major drivers. The study finds that EV‚Äôs hit 10% of global passenger vehicle sales by 2025, rising to 28% in 2030 and 58% in 2040. ‚ÄúA quarter of the cost of an EV is the lithium-ion battery, while four-fifths of the cost of the battery itself is the minerals, metals and chemicals going in it.‚Äù¬† Canada Nickel chief executive, Mark Selby, said ‚Äúit‚Äôs become very clear that there‚Äôs large portions of the periodic table for which the United States has no local source of supply.‚Äù There seems to be a heightened U.S. government interest in securing supplies of critical minerals used in everything from EV‚Äôs to advanced weaponry.¬† If the U.S. would like to limit their reliance on China for these commodities it would be beneficial to work with Canada to export these materials. With such a close proximity to the automobile factories in the United States there would also be huge savings in transportation costs.¬† Even Elon Musk is asking for it by tweeting, ‚ÄùI‚Äôd just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel.‚Äù And in another tweet, ‚ÄùWherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and go for efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.‚Äù¬†  

As demand for nickel grows the price will continue to rise as the supply gets scarce. In the last year alone nickel prices have gone from 5.01USD/lb to a high of 8.93USD/lb.¬† This increased price for nickel can only bode well for KWG and Noront.¬†  

Just recently, Noront Resources landed a new strategic partner in Wyloo Metals, the mining division of Tattarang, one of Australia‚Äôs largest private investment groups. Wyloo was looking to make some strategic investments outside of Western Australia, particularly in nickel. In looking at investments for a ‚Äòdecarbonized‚Äô future, Wyloo is on a global hunt for nickel, lithium and all the metals they think will be important in a low carbon future, particularly in the electric vehicle battery space.¬† This investment reflects the long-term collaborative strategy to support the discovery and development of the next generation of mines required to meet the growing demand of critical materials needed to power the decarbonization of the global economy.¬† Wyloo also has a good reputation in dealing well and honestly with the indigenous populations in Western Australia. They will be a great asset in continued negotiations with First Nations people and help facilitate sustainable mining operations in the Ring of Fire.  

It‚Äôs clear to me there is a lot of value in these companies at such a low share price. With KWG building a railroad and Noront building a road, strategic partnerships can be made between both companies. KWG also holds patents to a cheaper and cleaner ferrochrome process that could be very useful to Noront. It may be very likely that KWG could be a takeover target by Noront at some point in the future. But for now it may be beneficial for both companies to develop the required infrastructure they will both need to thrive in the Ring of Fire.¬†  

To me it seems like investing in these companies is a no brainer and sure to payoff in the future. Am I missing something? Why would someone pay $100,000 for a bitcoin when you can have a share of KWG for 3 cents and Noront for 30 cents?

CryptoCurrency,"Compound interest, Capital appreciation, and the unique dual investment opportunity presented by staking.","I noticed in the comments of a recent post about staking that there was some confusion about what was actually earned when you staked your coins so I thought I‚Äôd help clear that up, and do a bit of a deep dive on similar investments and give some examples of how they compare. 

Note: This is not investment advice, I‚Äôm just going over general investing principles. Always do your own research and as has been said many times before when it comes to staking- not your keys, not your coins. It‚Äôs best to stake yourself if you‚Äôre able to, but make sure you trust the exchange and consider the risks before staking there.

Compound interest

Staking some coins offer compound interest. For example, let‚Äôs say you buy 100 coins of coin A worth $10 per coin for an investment of $1,000. Coin A offers you 7% APY (annual percentage yield) for staking and compounds (pays out) every month. APY assumes you reinvest those payouts, so if you stake for a full year you will now have 107 coins. If you do this for five years you will have 140.26 coins. The reason this is 140.26 and not 135 is because subsequent years build upon the new number of coins you start each year with. 

If the coin value stays the same then you‚Äôre $1,000 investment is now worth $1,426. Remember that your increase in value here is based solely on receiving more coins and not on the value of the coin changing. This type of investment this is most similar to is probably bank CDs. CDs normally provide a compound interest rate higher than a checking account rate in exchange for locking up your funds at the bank for a certain period.

Capital Appreciation

Next, let‚Äôs say you buy 100 coins of coin B for $10 a coin for an investment of $1,000. Let‚Äôs say that the value of coin B appreciates 11% over the course of a year and is now worth $11.10 per coin. If each year it increases an additional 11% from the previous year then after five years the coin will be worth $16.85 per coin. This brings your 100 coins to a total value of $1,685. 

Similar to compound interest, the amount is larger because it builds upon the previous years gains. Capital appreciation is normally associated with stocks. 

How proof of stake combines the two and why that‚Äôs a big deal.

Lastly, let‚Äôs say we have coin C which we purchased 100 of, for $10 a coin, and a $1,000 total investment. Coin C pays you 7% APY  for staking and appreciates in value 11% per year. After one year you have 107 coins worth $11.10 for a total value of $1,187.7 bringing your real return for the year up to 18.77%. After five years your $1,000 investment will be worth $2,363.38 which is more than double the original investment.

But wait, isn‚Äôt this like a stock paying dividends? 

No, when a stock pays dividends, the price of the stock decreases by the exact amount of the paid dividend, so it‚Äôs really just paying you part of what you already own. That‚Äôs one of the interesting things about these proof of stake coins. To my knowledge there isn‚Äôt really anything that offers a dual return like this. 

Hopefully this helps illustrate the potential of investing in proof of stake coins. Keep in mind the numbers used in these examples. Higher staking rewards and higher return potential is out there depending on where you invest so you could see even better returns. Also, keep in mind that if you continue to buy coins as you hodl your returns will increase faster as well.

CryptoCurrency,"The reach of the SEC, the power they take and how it effects the cryptospace","With the recent Ripple lawsuit and now the message that the SEC should investigate, as they say; the market manipulation of Elon Musk over Dogecoin, i was wondering what the reach is of the SEC and how it works. As a european citizen i sometimes find it hard to understand how the US regulations work (also with taxes).

How much power does the SEC hold and does it only apply in the US and US company's? Here is some information i found, but i thought it would be nice to make it a **discussion or informational post.**

**What is the SEC**

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is an independent¬†federal government regulatory agency responsible for protecting investors, maintaining fair and orderly functioning of [the securities markets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/security-market-usa.asp),¬†and facilitating capital formation. It was created by Congress in 1934 as the first federal regulator of the securities markets. The SEC promotes full public disclosure, protects [investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) against fraudulent and manipulative practices in the market, and monitors corporate takeover actions in the United States. It also approves registration statements for bookrunners among underwriting firms.

**The reach of the SEC**

The SEC has broad-ranging authority to investigate and prosecute securities fraud and to use its investigatory powers on behalf of its foreign counterparts. Section 21(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (‚ÄúExchange Act‚Äù) permits the SEC, in its discretion, to provide assistance ‚Äúwithout regard to whether the facts stated in the request would constitute a violation of the laws of the United States.‚Äù

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission, does not believe that is limited by borders. It has explicitly claimed to have worldwide jurisdiction over violations of United States securities laws, and has exercised that authority in recent actions against allegedly wrongful ICOs conducted abroad, in which United States persons purchased coins from non-United States organizations.

**What does this mean for cryptocurrency**

When a US citizen is beeing effected by a something that against the Secruities Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC has the authority to act and investigate on it.

If an issuer is selling coins or tokens into the United States ‚Äì even if such coins constitute a relatively small percentage of the worldwide offering ‚Äì the SEC will take notice. If the offering does not comply with U.S. securities laws, it is at great risk of enforcement action by the SEC.

The SEC sees itself as world police and will act as such. It would be wise for cryptocompanys to consult  with a U.S. securities or enforcement lawyer, as probably most did.

**Current events**

Do you think the current events of Ripple and Elon Musk is just a way for the SEC and US the show they have some form of authorisation of the cryptspace? Even if they wont succeed, it has a impact on the space.",cryptocurrency

Hello again, you might recognize me from my previous posts like telling you to short QQQ this morning or buying banks before or wallmart or deere or a number of shit for which i clearly get no love on this sub. Tards are a tough bunch in love i guess.

Today i want to explain to you why gold is a piece of shit and why you should short it.

Gold is bot for a number of things, the $SMH industry uses a little bit of it and of course jewelry.Sources of gold include a 2% yoy increase from the ground and then recycling depending on seasons.

All of this is marginal and doesn't matter to prices.

The biggest traders of gold are

a) Central banks : These are the guys who really drive it and give the tone

b) Gold bugs retailers

c) HFs CTAs and Macro people like me.

So how do these people trade it ?

The CTAs are momentum driven and you can model when they are long or short, a good attempt at this is done by societe generale here

CTAs have been short gold since the start of the year and their signal is getting stronger and stronger as these guys act like kinda anti martingales .

they will keep selling any rips for as long as their signal says short.

b) This is you guys, retailers and other tards who just go on hype and like to jump in when the shit has already been moving up 5% - nothing wrong with that just stating facts

a) CBs + Macro HFs + me: Gold is seen as another currency pair against the $ : **XAUUSD**

**The fair value of a currency comes mostly, on a short term basis, from the carry we can earn on it.** for gold that depends on whether the curve is in backwardation or contango

you can see that right now that gold has a healthy fwd roll since APR 22 is near 40 bucks higher. one way to make $ out of this (if you have a vault, like JPM) is to buy it now, store it for months, sell it later. (assuming prices don't move against you ! )

Outside of that gold really has no yield, unlike say the $ if you use it to buy treasuries and such. without going too much into carry trades (trying to keep the audience in mind) what matters is various metrics of carry as gold competes with the other currencies. At the core of it, the best proxy is to look at the real US $ rate.

and then we can look at gold vs other currencies, the best proxy for that is the $DXY.

Both of these are gonna move in a way that fucks gold even more.

First you have to realize that we are entering a tightening cycle, the dovish FED brrr brrr is behind us now (yes really). The next step is not when more Brr QE/rate cut but when Tapering and when rate hike ! **so the best, whatever you think, is BEHIND US. We are now beyond PEAK DOVISHNESS. Clear ??**

And not to help matters Papi Biden si gonna unleash a 2 Trillion stim on top of another potential 2Tr infra stim that is gonna send US GDP to upwards of 7% yoy increase next year if not more (I think with a good infra plan we can even reach 10). **NO ONE IN THE WORLD** is doing anything REMOTELY similar, the US ECONOMY IS GONNA BE THE BEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD FOR THE NEXT 2/3 YEARS WITHOUT COMPARAISON AT ALL.

""But bruh, ur a tard, wutabout inflation ? ""

Inflation only really matters to us if it is long lasting. one time stuff doesn't matter in the long run and has to be faded.

THIS IS VERY BULLISH $ and REAL RATES THUS **BEARISH GOLD + CTAs ALREADY BEARISH GOLD**

***What can change this outlook ?***

Powell implements YCC (not happening so far)

or

we do get the 15$ min wage thing (not happening ever)

if any of these happen go long with all you have. esp the second one.

TLDR : 150 GLD PUTS Cuz King $.

I am short GLD outright.",finance

personalfinance,"I want to fix my credit, but I'm overseas without a US bank account, should I pay for a debt resolution service?","So, I have four collections, a large federal student loan to take care of because I want to move back to the US in the next year with my family. I have a good job now, but I don't want to pay too much into these collections since I'm setting aside money for the student loan.  

Collection 1: $8700 from a car that was repossessed 6 years ago. They auctioned it off despite me trying to work with the bank (was fired, unemployment didn't pay enough for rent + the car) and the $8700 is the deficit from what they got at the auction.  

Transunion says it will drop off ""estimated"" by February 2022. I have never made a payment with them, or contacted them, but on Credit Karma it shows as ""updated"" in May 2019, what does that mean?  

Collection 2: Cell phone company for $900. From almost 7 years ago. Transunion says it should drop off in August.  

Collection 3: $140 from when I went to the emergency room and they didn't cover something my insurance should've covered. This one is from 2016 so I don't think I can wait it out and I definitely owe this one.  

Collection 4: $600 credit card. I wanted to pay... I won't get into why but I couldn't pay due to ""technology issues"". This one, I do feel responsible for. It's from 2017.  

Federal Student Loan: Defaulted back in 2017. $50k + $12k collection fees. I am just finishing rehabilitation so the collection fees will go away soon.  

What I would like to do:  

Write letters to the collections, ask for a settlement amount or a pay for delete. However, I'm worried about a few things.  

1. I heard that if I try to dispute, I risk them updating the debt and the clock starting over for the statute of limitations. I really can't afford the $8700 one. Is it true that if I say in the letter, ""I'm not acknowledging the debt, I'm merely asking for a settlement amount so I can remove it from my credit history."" will allow me to avoid that problem?  
2. I'm worried about writing in because I live overseas. It's very hard to send mail so I would prefer to be able to do this over the phone or by email.  
3. I'm considering paying for a credit monitoring service. Annual Credit Report keeps flagging my requests as suspicious because I'm overseas. I have to call in and they can't send them overseas so I have to request they get sent to my mom's house and she will scan them for me. This is too delayed and annoying for me. I want to be able to check weekly.  
4. Should I go from small to large? Pay the $140 in full for a ""pay for delete"", and then try to negotiate the $600 and $900 one so that the only one left is the $8700 one?  
5. Even if I get a pay for delete, I'm not sure how I can pay since I'm overseas. Would they be able to do a settlement agreement with me using my credit card to pay? (I have credit cards in the country I live in, and it's 0% interest if I pay in full by the monthly statement period... Ironically my credit overseas is stellar... Amazing how good a college graduate's credit is when they can start on a fresh slate without debt).

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-26-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday‚Äôs tech rout

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were choppy as tech stocks tried to recover from Thursday‚Äôs rout that dragged the Nasdaq down 3.5% for its worst single-day performance since October. Tesla fell slightly again in Friday‚Äôs premarket, a day after sinking 8% in a brutal week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday sank 559 points, or 1.8%, from a record closing high the previous session. The Dow had its worst day in nearly a month and so did the S&amp;P 500, which lost almost 2.5%. The culprit behind the selloff was the rapid rise in bond yields.

&gt; * All three stock benchmarks were tracking for weekly losses. Ahead of Friday‚Äôs trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was clinging to a gain for February, which started off strong. The Nasdaq was down nearly 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 both remain solidly in the green for the month. However, the S&amp;P 500 was off almost 2.7% from its last record closing high, also on Feb. 12.

*****

&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield retreats slightly from one-year high

&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield retreated Friday morning, but remained above 1.4%, after surging to 1.6% in the previous session to its highest level since February 2020 and more than 0.5% higher since the end of January. The spike in the 10-year yield, which is used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans, has been driven by expectations of improving economic conditions as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out, as well as fears of higher inflation.

*****

&gt; # 3. House to pass Covid bill; Senate official says no minimum wage

&gt; * Inflation worries are being stoked on the thought that the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus bill ‚Äî which is seen passing the House on Friday ‚Äî on top of accelerating growth could overheat the economy. Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to push their relief measure, including a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour, through without GOP support. However, a key nonpartisan official, the Senate parliamentarian, ruled Democrats cannot include the minimum wage increase in the bill. The decision means the Senate will likely pass a different version of the bill than the House, and representatives will have to approve the plan a second time.

*****

&gt; # 4. FDA panel to vote on J&amp;J‚Äôs single-shot Covid vaccine

&gt; * A key FDA vaccine advisory panel is set to vote Friday on whether to recommend approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Covid-19 single-shot for emergency use, which would help pave the way to for a third preventive treatment in the U.S. While the full FDA doesn‚Äôt have to follow the vaccine committee‚Äôs recommendation, it often does. During similar requests by Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, the FDA authorized those companies‚Äô two-shot regimes a day after the panel of outside medical advisors backed emergency use authorization.

*****

&gt; # 5. DoorDash stock falls after company drops first results since IPO

&gt; * As more and more Americans are vaccinated and the economy continues to open up more fully, companies like DoorDash, which has benefited from the stay-at-home trade, could get hurt. In its first report as a public company, the food delivery service old shareholders it expects some of the tailwinds it experienced from stay-at-home orders across the U.S. will turn around once the country gets the virus under control. Shares sank 10% in Friday premarket. Even with that drop, DoorDash would still be up nearly 50% from its $102 per share offer price back in December. While DoorDash late Thursday reported $970 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which beat estimates, it also reported an adjusted per-share loss of $2.67.

stocks,What caused stocks to dump yesterday: the unwinding of $50B worth of bonds,"Last week and earlier this week, I've been posting warnings about watching out for increased volatility leading into March, and particularly toward the end of March, which is the end of Q1. We're going to see unwinding of massive positions in the pandemic and tech stocks that were successful in 2020 as institutions and professionals will be forced to change their portfolios to more value oriented stocks that will perform better in high interest rate conditions: commodities, energy, high free cash flow businesses, industrials and financials. I refer to this as ""rotation"" where portfolios evolve from being focused on one sector or asset class to another over time. This Spring, these rotations may not occur in a slow, calm and orderly way. 

Monday, as I said in an earlier post this week, I liquidated most of my positions in the hot stocks of 2020, including EVs, and began focusing on interest-rate proof businesses. These are businesses with lower long term debt, good free cash flow, actual positive profit margins, and good balance sheets. I'm just holding long positions in outright cash purchases of stock, so I don't have complicated positions to ""unwind"" (I just sell a stock to get out of a position). However, institutional and professional investors, and hedge funds, have more complicated and leveraged portfolios. 

We can't expect the unwinding of positions of so-called ""whales"" (big players) in the market to always be orderly or calm as the end of Q1 approaches. 

Yesterday's market dump appears to have been triggered by one or more whales forcefully selling $50B of bonds into a reluctant buyer's market. The below is a good article from Bloomberg but it's premium content so I'll summarize it below because it answers the question, *Why are bond yields spiking despite the Federal Reserve setting its interest rates to banks so low and WTF is going on in the bond market?*

[Chaotic Treasury Selloff Fueled by $50 Billion of Unwinding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/chaotic-treasury-selloff-fueled-by-50-billion-position-unwind)(Paywall)

* **A massive dump of $50B in bonds suggest one (or a few) positions were unwound by one or more whales**  

&gt; ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt an orderly selloff and certainly didn‚Äôt appear to be driven by any obvious fundamental continuation or extension of the reflation thesis,‚Äù wrote NatWest Markets strategist Blake Gwinn in a note to clients. 

* **""Fundamental decoupling"" between low interest rates and a heating economy**

Bond and lending pros are rejecting the Federal Reserve's low-interest view, which is at odds with 6-7% growth projected due to stimulus plans and rebound from the pandemic and Powell's talk of ""maximum employment"" plans

&gt; The bond market‚Äôs divergence from a fundamental backdrop was most evident at the shorter-end of the curve. Eurodollar contracts -- which are priced off Libor -- collapsed in record volumes as traders repriced their expectations for the path of Fed rates with few obvious catalysts.

* **What exactly happened?  5-year Treasury notes jumped 22 points, and spreads associated with those notes jumped 24 points**

&gt; The main protagonist in the bond market was the five-year Treasury note, a maturity often associated with long-term Fed rate expectations, where yields closed 22 basis point higher on the day. The so-called butterfly-spread index -- a measure of how the note is performing against its two- and 10-year peers -- jumped 24 basis points, the worst daily performance for the sector since 2002.

&gt; Markets now see a Fed hike by March 2023 compared to mid-2023 previously, and have priced in rates over 50 basis points higher by 2024.

&gt; But in remarks this week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell offered reassurance that policy would continue to be supportive and look beyond a temporary pick-up in inflation, especially from a low base. While Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida expressed cautious optimism on the outlook, he said it would ‚Äútake some time‚Äù to restore the economy to pre-pandemic levels.

* **Bond buyers who disagree with the Fed were ""on strike"" yesterday and created a ""liquidity drought""** 

&gt; A number of more ‚Äútechnical-style‚Äù factors were in the mix, against a backdrop of a good-old-fashioned buyers strike...

&gt; A lack of bond market liquidity, just when traders needed it most [i.e. during a big dump of $50B in bonds]

* **Also high frequency trading exists in the bond market too, apparently, and they suddenly disappeared yesterday in a market that was used to their presence, at the same time buyers thinned out**

&gt; ‚ÄúWe think that a steep decline in market depth contributed to the outsized moves in yields today,‚Äù wrote JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategist Jay Barry in a note to clients. Barry showed how the share of high-frequency traders in the Treasury market -- which has been on an increasing trend -- tends to retreat rapidly as volatility spikes.

I expect to see more volatility as positions from 2020 unwind and people create whole new portfolios for post-pandemic 2021. This is a good time to look at which stocks are the ones doing well each day and why. 

Disclaimer: Not a financial professional

Edit: I plan to reenter tech stocks hardcore once these whales are done with whatever BS they do at the end of every quarter whenever there are big changes.

Edit 2: Here's an addition of more material offered by /u/TomatoeHaven from other references (I have not checked them)

**What impact, if any, does the Fed have on Treasury Yield?**

Note: Treasury yield briefly topped the 1.6% level on Thursday and traded at its highest level in more than a year, raising concern for investors across asset classes.

‚ÄúTo be sure, if bond yields continue to rise and there is a smooth rotation out of growth and defensive stocks into value and cyclical stocks, the Fed will remain sanguine,‚Äù strategist Albert Edwards of Societe Generale said in a note. ‚ÄúBut the risk is growing that with so many bubbles blown by the Fed something will burst soon.‚Äù

Historically I've used AMEX HYS because they're reliable and have had a nice APY on their savings accounts. However, they have steadily reduced that interest rate over the last year to the point where I'm looking for alternatives (currently at .50%).

The [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/emergencyfunds) suggests that this shouldn't be a deterrent to me but I hate the idea of losing money to inflation. Bonds tie up the money for too long (and kind of defeat the purpose of keeping a stash for an emergency) and CD Ladders seem ok but they require some work and, ideally, this would be entirely passive.

With that said, I'm wondering what you all do with your emergency funds beyond what's mentioned in the wiki?

Thank you!

Banking,Wife's Chime account not cooperating with fraud. We don't know what to do.,"So my wife has a Chime account that she's been saving all of her work money in. A few days ago someone got into her account and took all of her money.

The night it happened she checked her phone after work and it had a bunch of notifications that the info on the account was attempting to be changed. She contacted the bank right away. The thief changed her phone number on the account and accessed all of her money and spent it on some bitcoin site.

She filed dispute through their customer service and sent back forms last night, and this morning they denied her claim and said they can't help her. 

She had contacted them immediately after this happened, saved all of her notifications about the account change attempts, spent hours on the phone  and they still won't help her.

Aren't there federal policies for this bank to be liable for this kind of thing? They said they can't help or open this dispute without any new information. There is no more information. It's cut and dry what happened here. 

Can anyone help me to figure out what the next best thing to do is? She's out over a thousand dollars and I can't just let this happen to her.",finance

personalfinance,First Time Request for Financial Advice,"Hello everyone,

This is my first post in this thread and on reddit! I'm healthy and single, nearing the end of my twenties with an MALA (basically in philosophy), teaching at a low-tier high school, making $42k/year with mediocre benefits.

I have just about $70k at 5.75% APR in federal student loans and $20k at 2.9% APR for a car I bought. I've managed to hoard $25k in savings (low-interest savings account) and currently take care of my demented grandma in exchange for room and board being mostly free.

I've received offers to teach at a higher-tier charter school for $50k with better benefits but more duties or online for $45-50k with no benefits and fewer duties.

Although people think I'm a good teacher and I enjoy working with students, what I'm really about is writing, which is why I haven't pursued a PhD. I have a novel I'm revising and 10 stories I'm shopping around to get published.

My goal is to become a full-time writer and work in publishing, film and tv, theater, etc. regardless of how difficult it is to break in or get to know gatekeepers. I've acted, directed, and done creative work all my life to positive feedback, just lacked the network and chose to pursue a degree for academic purposes rather than to break in to the industry.

Would it make sense to save most of my money till the loan freeze expires in October? Should I accept the online job and sell my car to get rid of the monthly loan payments? Any more general advice would be appreciated, as would clarifying questions.

Thanks,

personalfinance,Capitalizing low interest mortgage,"My wife and I are expecting to move cross country summer 2022. Is there any particular way to optimize/capitalize on the low interest mortgage environment?

Is it transferable in any way, as in could a buyer purchase your mortgage rather than getting their own and us selling ours?",finance
personalfinance,"Pretty sure I missed the mortgage refinance boat for now, should I keep looking?","I started the process about 3 weeks ago to refi my loan of 140k that has 25 years left at 4.35%.

Got 2 offers where the interest rates weren't exactly where I wanted (3.15% and 3.25%) one had 3k closing costs one had 7k closing costs including points, so I planned to keep shopping and bump my credit report and wait for it to update, then I got busy, but yesterday I got another offer, after rates have spiked, and it's 3.25 with 7k closing (3k in escrow) buying no points.  This offer would save me $200 a month, and would pay for itself in 34 months, which compared to what I was expecting a couple weeks ago is about twice as long of a break even point. (plan on staying in house anyway)

Not sure if $200 a month with a 3 year break even point is worth adding 5 years to my mortgage.

So should I keep applying?  the reported rates of the 2 banks I was thinking were both 3.25, even if I get that offer and closing costs were less I feel like it's not really worth it.  Maybe I take the credit check ding (NBD) and wait, see if rates drop, if not wait a few years and get into a 15 year FRM.

&amp;#x200B;

Update:  Went ahead and applied with one more bank, got pretty similar terms a bit higher interest rate and higher closing costs.  Talked it over with my wife and we decided even though we would save money in the long term we would rather just hold out.  on close comparison the most we would save is $160 a month, which isn't nothing, but pretty hard to justify financing $7 or $8k in closing costs.  I know financially it would be better to not worry about paying off the house early, and invest savings instead, but I like the idea of making progress toward a payoff date.

Thanks for all the advice.",finance

We just closed on a house and have a $279k mortgage at 2.25%. We can comfortably afford our monthly mortgage payment. I'm getting a lot of different advice - some are saying to pay off the mortgage asap for security, some are saying to throw everything into retirement since the interest rate is so low.

Is the answer that we do both? Slightly increase our mortgage payment to shed a few years off  &amp; slightly increase how much we're putting into retirement?

Bitcoin,Stimulus checks and Bitcoin,"As you know the US government at some point soon will be sending 1400$ stimulus checks. Here‚Äôs a few ways  it‚Äôll affect Bitcoin. 

1. The obvious, people get checks people spend said check on Bitcoin. More Demand= price goes up (in simplistic terms) this is good timing as we‚Äôre currently consolidating and forming a solid floor of around 50-45k give or take which means we should be ready for another nice little bull run. 

2. Right now evidently stock prices are inflated. Even with the pullback the entire market is inflated as result of long standing bailouts and relief packages for big companies. As of right now all this extra money the fed printed and distributed has gone to the big corporations and in turn into their stock price causing it to shoot up. This inflation hasn‚Äôt affected any ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù yet because the amount of actual stimulus money said normal people have received is a fraction of the amount that the fed has printed and distributed to big corps. When the stimulus starts to hit (many many billions of dollars) this is when inflation actually kicks in as now this money is being properly injected into the economy (albeit likely for rent and groceries which hands much back to larger corporations) but it still will be at least partially used to purchase goods of a limited quantity. More money circulates the economy and eventually actual inflation will occur. This is part of the benefit of Bitcoin as it is a hedge against inflation. People will see the inflation and see the benefit of Bitcoin snd will eventually come join the good side.

If any inaccuracies are present here please let me know. I‚Äôm only 17 and am very interested to learn more.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Why I believe VGX is an incredibly solid alt coin to buy and HODL 'til the end of this bull run,"VGX token has had the highest return of any crypto currency YTD, including Bitcoin as you can see here: [https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/) (scroll down about halfway). It's increased over 3900%.

**So what is VGX token?**

VGX is the native, utility token for the Voyager app. Voyager is a crypto broker. Because they are a broker they connect to multiple exchanges. They're like the [Hotels.com](https://hotels.com/) for crypto coins. They charge no fees and no commission. Like other brokers, they make their money on the spread. They are also publicly traded so regularly release reports on profits, growth, AUM etc (more on that later).

They also offer interest on the crypto you hold with them. 5.5% on BTC. 8.5% on USDC. 7% on the VGX token. You don't need to stake or lock up the tokens to earn this interest, either.

And, because they're a broker, if an exchange goes down they just route you through to another exchange, giving you constant access to the market.

**So how does VGX fit into all this?**

As I mentioned, VGX is the native token to Voyager. So what does it do? Well, Voyager recently announced their upcoming loyalty program which requires users to hold certain amounts of the VGX token to qualify for bonuses and rewards. The current levels are 500 VGX, 5,000 VGX and 20,000 VGX and these levels will be reviewed quarterly.

**Here are some of the benefits holding VGX give users of the Voyager app:**

* An interest rate booster on the crypto you hold, up to an extra 1.25%.
* Cashback every time you buy or sell on the app.
* No fees on the Voyager debit card.
* Cashback every time you use the Voyager debit card.
* High referral rewards.
* Lower withdrawal fees.
* Access to the new desktop app.
* Cashback whenever you use their new Send-To-A-Friend feature (think Venmo for crypto).
* Loads more...

As you can see, holding the VGX token is a no-brainer for users of the app. The interest boosts alone are huge, even without all the other rewards. The utility of this token is through the roof.

**So if it's already increased nearly 4000%, why would I buy it now?**

Good question. As we know, alt-coins react to news events surrounding them. It just so happens that Voyager and VGX have a LOT of key events coming over the next few months that will directly impact the price of the token.

**Here are some of the upcoming events that will boost VGX's value:**

* Voyager currently only operates in 49 US States. They are soon to roll out to both Europe and Canada, opening up their potential market by nearly 800m people.
* They are soon to launch Crypto to Stock trading. This is a game-changer. Users will be able to buy traditional stock like Apple and Tesla directly with BTC or other crypto.
* Currently, due to the token they inherited in the past, Voyager token is listed as BQX on Binance. This has prevented many people outside of the app from even knowing how to purchase the token. This is due to be updated to VGX in the next month or so meaning the token will be listed as VGX across all exchanges.
* They are launching margin trading on the app soon.
* The new loyalty program has been announced but not yet implemented. When users realise they can earn 7% on VGX they hold, 8.5% on USDC, 5.5% on BTC, 4% on ETH etc without staking or locking up their tokens, there will be a huge surge to the app.
* They have scaled at an incredible rate. Over the Robinhood fiasco weekend, then signed up 1,000 new customers a minute. They scaled their framework over the last month or so and will soon be able to support 100m concurrent users.
* They have raised an incredible amount of capital recently and because they are publicly traded, they release monthly reports on their growth, profit, AUM etc. Every time this happens the stock and token go up.
* They will soon release their new Venmo system allowing users to send crypto to other users, off the blockchain with zero fees, instantly.
* They will soon release their Voyager Vault, an enhanced version of the Ethos wallet they inherited - a self-custody wallet for all users.
* They will allow all holders of VGX, regardless of whether or not you can access the app or not, the ability to earn the 7% interest via a Metamask based web-portal that launches soon.
* The company is run by an incredibly experienced team. Former CEO of E-Trade and Lightspeed Financial Stephen Ehrlich as well as former CTO of Uber Oscar Salazar to name but two.
* They have designed an app that is focused on retail investors. It's simple to use. It's easy to use. It's intuitive. Because they are publicly traded they have to abide by all regulations, making them a safe choice for new customers to the crypto space, and as you know, there are a LOT of them this bull run.

**So what are the price predictions for VGX at the end of the year?**

Market cap is $1,520,381,680.  

Circulating supply of VGX: 222,295,208.  

VGX currently costs $6.63 at time of writing. That's mainly down to BTC's dip (a great time to buy). There are a number of predictions for VGX come the end of the year from reputable sources across the market that all range from **$35-$75. I personally see it hitting at least $50 by EOY.**

**HOWEVER** the EOY price isn't the only reason this is the best token to hold. Remember, you will earn 7% compound interest on all the VGX you have and there is no minimum amount to qualify. You could hold 1 VGX and qualify for the interest. Let's say VGX hits $25 and you hold 5,000 tokens. That's an extra $1440 a month just for holding on to your VGX for the first year. That's passive income.

In my opinion, holding this token is a no-brainer. There is a limited supply, the company is experiencing incredible growth and the utility of the token is through the roof.

Obviously DYOR, this is not financial advice, it's just my opinion!

**TLDR: This token has grown 3900% already making it the biggest gainer YTD of any crypto currency, including BTC. It should hit anywhere between $35-$75 by the end of the year and you will earn 7% compound interest a month just by holding the token. No staking. No lockups. No brainer.**",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I open a Roth IRA or focus on my student loans? Or do something else with my money?,"I am 22 years old and have been working full time in my job for 1 year after graduating in December 2019. Here are my current stats:

Current Salary: $41,608 before tax

Take Home: Around $2,600 a month. Depends on overtime and hours in the pay period.

Rent: $350 (live with significant other and roommate, but this might go up by a couple hundred dollars when we move to our next place)

Other Expenses: \~$250-300 a month (my parents pay for most medical expenses and health insurance, so my expenses are limited)

Student Loan Minimum Payment: $313 (I currently pay around $1500-$1800 a month now though)

Private Loans: $17,566 with a 5.64% fixed interest rate. Started with $28,400 8 months ago.

Federal Loans: $23,247, interest rates range from 3-5%. Currently not making payments due to the COVID interest pause.

High Yield Savings Account: $10,000

Other Savings in Regular Account: $3,475 (currently so high because I just got $2,000 from my tax return)

Amount in 403(b):  $3,315.38. I put in 2% and employer matches 300%

I keep getting suggested to open a Roth IRA. However I'm not sure if I should be focusing instead on my student loans since I have alot. Now that I've saved up a bit I'm not sure if I should focus all of my extra money on my loans. Or if I should be doing something different entirely. I would love to hear what others think the best and smartest strategy might be. Thank you!",finance

Forex,"EURO PRICE OUTLOOK: EUR/USD EDGES HIGHER WITH BULLISH OUTLOOK INTACT, FOR NOW","The US Dollar enjoyed a bout of strength to begin the year as EUR/USD endured a pullback toward support around the 1.20 area. Renewed Dollar weakness has seen the pair recover somewhat allowing EUR/USD to snap the downtrend. Now with the Fed and ECB committed to remaining accommodative, the longer-term trend that has unfolded since March 2020 may be poised to continue.

That being said, there are threats to EUR/USD strength that should be considered. First and foremost is the staggering economic projections coming out of the United States. Should reality match estimates, the United States would handily outpace the Euro area in terms of recovery and growth ‚Äì a theme that would likely give rise to US Dollar strength.

Another concern is risk aversion. US equities are encountering considerable turbulence in recent sessions as US Treasury yields continue to tick higher, prompting investors to reallocate funds as risk-free rates rise. If equity weakness were to gain steam and risk aversion spike, traders may flock to the Greenback in search of safety.

Together, the two fundamental possibilities pose a real threat to the continued uptrend of EUR/USD, but the technical outlook remains encouraging and further stimulus in the United States could see prolonged USD weakness. Thus, Dollar strength is not a foregone conclusion by any means and EUR/USD gains remain on the table.",finance
Bitcoin,BTC Is Going To Send People to the Funny Farm,"BTC's road to the moon will be wrought with insane volatility and I fear that it's going to send many retail investors to the funny farm.

Please understand, this is the just the opinion of one man, and I'm mildly mentally challenged.  

The proof lies in the fact that I'm paying my wife's boyfriend to borrow his computer to type this out... That said...

I believe that we're about to embark on a period of increased VOLATILITY in Bitcoin and due to the actions of the Treasury Secretary over the next 4 months.  

She's spitting out $1.1 trillion, roughly $250 BN per month in QE.  This is on top of the Federal Reserves $120 BN.   

So, as this money sloshes around the economy, we'll see increased volatility in bond yields, and increased volatility in bond yields will impact the stock market.  Bond yields go up, stocks go down, and vice versa. 

*The stock market and BTC are correlated, so, while we will see BTC on an upward trajectory, the peaks and troughs are going to be rough.*  

A lot of retail investors will have their rear ends handed to them as they'll continue to buy at local tops and capitulate at local lows and I wonder what the long term impact will be on retail overall.  

What do you guys think the impact of an insanely bumpy BTC ride will have on retail?  How many people will be able to stomach 40% dips followed by parabolic run ups, then subsequent 40% dips?  How many of you are ready for this?

stocks,A Slap Back to Reality,"Obligatory: This is not financial advice. I am not a ~~cat~~ financial advisor

&amp;#x200B;

I believe, in a time like this, a lot of people need a fresh glass of some ice cold water...

# Splashed right into their faces.

Tl;dr Ape explanation: I want GME to moon, but I am concerned about people being fed false information. 1. The claim Melvin said they didn't close their short position at the hearing is a lie. Their opening statement specifically had them saying they DID close it. 2.  The strategy of ITM calls boosting the price was tested last time &amp; failed last time. These are covered calls. 3. There isn't enough of a short interest to force the price up by holding. The profit comes when HF close positions, but you won't know that happened until it's over.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to see GME rocket to the moon. And I believe there is a scenario where that can be possible. But I want to go over the popular scenarios that will deceive you into believing THEY are the scenarios that will lead you to the moon. This is not a bear post against GME. This is reality.

* This is for those of you newcomers who thought you missed out on the last GME wave.
* This is for those of you who were stuck holding the bag last time (me, included) and are looking at profiting from this time to make that money back.
* This is for those of you who just didn't learn your lesson, and need a reminder of what went down last time.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, there are scenarios where GME can be squeezed. But what scenario is that? And what scenarios are not that?

&amp;#x200B;

1. First thing first, I want to stop a lie that I have seen spread like wildfire. The blatant lie that Melvin Capital, during the Gamestop hearing, admitted to not closing out their short position on Gamestop. This is not true. Now, I am going to assume whoever came up with this lie, did it as a *valiant* effort to help boost the price of Gamestop, and probably hoped no one would call them out on their BS, because nobody else decided to waste their time, watching a 5+ hour congressional hearing about stocks. Those are about the two most boring things in the world, combined. But, you don't even have to get that far into the hearing to call this lie out for the BS that it is. In Melvin Capital's opening statement, within the first minute of it, they state they closed out of their short positions in GME days before any restrictions were put on it. You can look up videos of the opening statements, yourself. I won't baby you that much. So, in conclusion, don't rely on the scenario that Melvin never closed out their short positions. It's a lie and it needs some water doused on it.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Scenario Two, possibly the most believed strategy on GME Thursday/Friday: ""Keeping the price over **(insert dollar amount here),** by Friday close, makes **(insert number here)** of calls ITM, and when they cover, the price is going to rocket!"" Now, I am not going to say this scenario is impossible, but it is not very likely, and it is what got many people burned the last time. Yes, it is true, keeping the price over a certain price, making a lot of calls ITM, can be good for the stock... **IF** those calls aren't covered calls, which I believe that almost all of them are. The week ending Jan. 22nd, there are probably a lot of naked calls. That hurt the sellers, bad, when GME closed at a very high price. Nobody expected it. That helped it a lot the following week when we saw the big spike. But then, let's run down what happened that following week. Yes, RH restricted buying on Thursday, 28th, which I do believe stopped the biggest of the squeezed, but it would not have played a role in the ineffectiveness of the ""Calls ITM"" strategy that followed. That Thursday, the price plummeted into the $200s. That Friday, you heard a lot of chatter of ***""As long as we can get the stock up to $310, a lot of calls will be ITM and we will be golden, my fellow apes! Get it to $320 and that's bonus points. That will be 90k calls that will be ITM and have to cover. That's 9 MILLION SHARES!""*** And yeah, A lot of that was true. There were 90k calls that would be ITM if we closed above $320. And you know what we did? We closed above $320. We closed around $328, in fact. This was it. Come Monday, that price was going to the moon. *""10k isn't a meme!""* We chanted. We couldn't be wrong. We did the maths. We had the DD. Diamonds don't crack, baby! Well, come Monday, there was no lift off. It was the Space Shuttle Columbia all over again. The stock fell, and it fell hard. Going back into the low $200s, dipping into the $100s even, before closing in the $200s. That's okay though. That's fine. They had until Wednesday to *actually* close on those Calls, you'd hear. So Tuesday came and went. Then Wednesday too. We never saw $300 again. In fact, by Friday, we were barely even seeing $100. So what happened? What went wrong? We had maths **AND** anime on our side. Well, what I believe happened is, those Call contract sellers learned their lesson that first week that ended Jan. 22nd, when they got screwed. They didn't let their calls be naked the following week. They bought up GME stocks when it was low at the beginning of that week, if they didn't already have them. This allowed them to resell those stocks at $320 and under, making them the big winners in all of this. But that meant these weren't NEW stocks that would help us go higher. No, these were stocks bought on the way up. They helped us peak but wouldn't help us go ***over*** the peak. So, when those calls executed, there were suddenly a lot of new holders of GME stock. Holders who saw their stocks were worth $300-$320. These weren't diamond handers, like you or I. These apes wanted their bananas ***NOW.*** So they sold when they got them. Gotta cash in those profits at some point. As WSB loves saying ""*You can't lose if you don't sell""*. Well, you also can't win if you don't sell. So now flash forward a month later, and the same theory is being pushed. ""*Keep the price over $100 and we will rocket to $800 come Monday. No, scratch that, $1000. No, wait, even better. $69,420!""* You hear in the echo chamber, bouncing off the walls like GME does in the first 30 minutes of market open. That's not going to happen. These are covered calls that are ITM. You're not forcing anyone to buy new stocks at the current price. You are just buying stocks for $50-$100 that were already bought at $40-$60 and are keeping the stock price stagnant. And none of this is even mentioning that the amount of ITM calls this time is like a third of what it was last time. So, do not rely on this strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Scenario Three: *""tHeY hAvE tO cOveR. tHeN wE cAn sEt oUR oWn pRicE""*. This is probably the most ignorant reason, and is why I typed it out like that. Yeah, I'm mocking you. Get over it. it is true, they do have to cover eventually. But not with your stocks. GME short interest is somewhere around 45-50% (too lazy to relook up the actual number), and this is after new reports showed 1.3 million more shares were shorted on Wednesday. Now, yes, that is a high amount of short interest. But that isn't high enough for the **""Diamond Hands""** approach. There's still 50ish percent of shares out there, not shorted. And yes, Diamond Handers hold a lot of those, most are going to be held by institutions and those institutions are about the money, not the message. They see a 3x profit? They sell. They sell to whoever is willing to buy. Could be more Diamond Handers, could be hedge funds. But eventually, Apes are going to run out of money to buy and hold with. That's when the Hedge Funds can swoop in, buy up these stocks, cover their short positions. The people they borrowed from might not be Diamond Handers, and end up selling to more Hedge Funds. When the short interest is only around 50%, you can't win with the Buy/Hold strategy. When the short interest is 50%, the short squeeze happens and you don't know it happens until it is over and the Hedge Funds have covered. You win by riding the wave up as Hedge Funds cover and then you get out near the top. That's the end of your ride. The ride doesn't just keep going up. You can only set the price when you own most of the market, and in this case, we don't. And on top of all of that, you also have people who are doing this with their bill money. The 1st of the month is coming up, that's a lot of rent needing paid. No shame in needing to sell so you can pay your bills. But, that's more shares that will flood the market. Probably a fraction of the actual amount of shares out there, but pennies add up to dollars eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

And those are the three scenarios in which you have a higher chance of losing than winning. Again, I cannot stress this enough: I **DO** believe a short squeeze can happen with GME. But I do not believe it is any of these three scenarios that will make it happen. I'm just tired of seeing people being fed these these  delusional optimistic claims that throw truth, history, and **REAL** DD &amp; common sense out the window, treating GME more like a pump n dump than an actual short squeeze.  it's okay to drink the Kool-aid, but maybe check to make sure it isn't spiked first.",finance
personalfinance,Should I take advantage of solar tax credits to minimize tax burden?,"I recently switched jobs, and when I did I rolled over my pre-tax pension into my Roth IRA. I was told that it's industry practice to withhold 20% of my pension for taxes when rolling it over to a Roth account. However, the state must've screwed up because my full pension amount was transferred into my Roth, no taxes withheld. 

I've calculated how much my husband and I will owe next year on top of what we're currently withholding and it's about $4500. We've created a sinking fund to cover the taxes when we file next year.

However, it occurred to me that we could take advantage of tax credits so that we spend that money on something we benefit from rather than giving it to the government. We've been curious about solar panels for a couple years and have done some research, which is as follows:

Cost of panels: $13,000-$15,000

Solar tax credit (22% now, possibility of going up to 30% under Biden administration): $2,860-$3,900 for $13,000 panels; $3,300-$4,500 for $15,000 panels 

State RECs (paid in 1st year): approx. $3,000

Net metering: assume electric bill drops to $15/month- basic charge for being on the grid.

Increase in house value: approx. $6,000 (conservative estimate)

So it looks like financially we'd break even with the panels. We're thinking about waiting a few months to see if the federal tax credit will be extended, and then choose a contractor. We've received quotes before, and the contractor always offers financing that's equivalent to the reduction in electricity usage. So we were planning to put a down payment equivalent to the amount we'll get as a tax credit, accept the financing from the contractor, then use the REC check to pay off more of the panels. At that point we'd only have a loan equivalent to 50% of the panel price, and our monthly expenses wouldn't be more than what they are now. 

Our cash outlay is the same whether we pay the taxes or get solar panels, but at least if we get panels we're increasing the value of the house, extending the life of our roof, and eventually saving money on electricity once the loan is paid. 

Our two concerns are: whether our math is wrong or assumptions are invalid, and it's actually not as attractive as it seems; and we've heard the financing provided by solar panel contractors is predatory. We originally wanted to wait until we could pay cash, but this will probably be the only year where we'll have to save money for taxes and we have access to it. 

Can anyone point out flaws in our plan? Pros and cons of each?",finance
personalfinance,"Want some outside opinions on my budget‚Äîstarting a new job, planning a wedding, and saving for a house","Hi! I‚Äôm starting a new job with a pretty significant salary boost so I made myself a hypothetical budget. I‚Äôd love some outside opinions on my budget, retirement contributions, and expenses.

Background: I (24F) live in a very HCOL area, split all expenses with my fianc√© (24M), and am saving for a wedding this year. I know this sub is hostile towards weddings, but a big party is important to us and we‚Äôd like to do a nice vacation after, pandemic permitting. I have about $10k in student loan debt that‚Äôs currently in pandemic deferment as a federal loan, so not making payments on that until September minimally. We have a car loan that‚Äôs also about $10k with a 3% interest rate. No CC debt or other debts. 

Gross Monthly Income: $8440

Pre-Tax Expenses
Health Insurance: $85
Dental Insurance: $12
401k: $844 (10%, employer matches 7.5%)

Net Income After Tax: $5,550

Post-Tax Expenses
Roth 401k: $422 (5%‚Äîshould I contribute to an IRA instead?)
ESPP: $253 (purchased at a 15% discount)
Rent: $1650
Electric: $40
Internet: $30
YouTube TV: $27 
Phone Bill: $100
Cooking Gas: $10
Netflix: $10
Spotify Family (I pay for my siblings): $15
Food: $500 (dining out + groceries) 
Clothes: $100
Cat Expenses: $100
Renters Insurance: $20
Car Payment: $195
Gas: $50
Gym Membership: $80
Entertainment/Misc Categories: $550

This leaves me with about $1300 at the end of the month to contribute to savings/investing. Right now, that money is going into a HY savings account for wedding and honeymoon expenses. After that, we are planning to save for a house down payment. 

Does anything in this budget look off to you? Should I be allocating my retirement savings differently? I want to make sure I‚Äôm properly preparing for my retirement goals while also balancing an high cost of living and saving for more immediate goals.

cardano,Future DeFi on Cardano,"Did you read IOHK‚Äôs latest research paper on Standardized crypto-loans on the Cardano blockchain? Link to the research paper and a short summary below:

[https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/standardized-crypto-loans-on-the-cardano-blockchain/](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/standardized-crypto-loans-on-the-cardano-blockchain/)

I believe it is fair to say that Marlowe primarily will be used to create P2P smart contracts. In terms of loans and lending, a collateral will definitely be required until more sophisticated KYC and DeFi credit score services are established and pooling of loans become more usual. Atala PRISM, hello? :)

Initial Cardano P2P DeFi/lending applications that will be utilizing Marlowe will thus primarily give borrowers access to liquidity (without them selling their crypto) and lenders to earn interest.

Marlowe does not (without workarounds) allow contracts that run indefinitely. It will make a pre-defined finite number of interactions with its environment before assets being held by the contract are returned to its participants.

I really like the prospects of ‚Äúrole tokens‚Äù in Marlowe contracts. Contract participants will be able to sell its share in the contract, by selling its role token. For those that are familiar with Interest Rate Swaps, a role token could thus be used as such Swap. It could open up for some serious trading volume.

What kind of DeFi would you guys like to see on Cardano going forward? I would really like to see pooled lending in the future, without collateral requirements. But it would probably require some kind of sophisticated credit score services.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Chasing Mortgage Interest Rates,"I don't want to get into the weeds about my personal situation, so I will try to keep it general.  Should a person try to chase down these low interest rates if at all possible as opposed to waiting and having to pay the higher, normal ones?

I live in FL, USA. I am saving for a house, even if I have to go with an FHA loan/$10k down.  It would probably take me a year to save \~$30k (still probably not enough for a traditional mortgage).

There is a builder here who, because I am a referral, has great perks and discounts they offer me, but won't be ready for new sales until at least April.

Should I try to chase these currently insanely low interest rates and get something now (going the FHA route), assuming that by April or summer they will be back to way above 2.5-3.5% again?

P.S. I know a large refrain here will be ""save $50k plus 6mos savings and then you're ready"" but that's not in the cards for most Americans.",finance

personalfinance,Dental school debt,"Hey all! My gf is a recent dental school graduate, she has about 250k in subsidized and unsubsidized debt. 

Unsubsidized 184k- interest rate 6% 

Subsidized HPSL loan 53k- interest rare 5% (grace period ending this may)

Both loans are currently on standard payment plan (10 years). I have been research the avalanche vs snowball method of debt repayment and have also learned about risk tolerance/aversion. Because the sheer amount of her debt is so staggering I thought it more prudent to refinance whatever loans were able to be refinanced and do a long play strategy....paying the monthly minimums and investing the ""rest"". I understand refinancing would forfeit the benefits of the federal loans however...

 Even if I fully supported her and took over our COL; we could MAYBE pay the loans off in 5 years? We are both 28 and have been in professional school prior to this so neither of us have any real retirement savings/etc. We both will make around 100-120k after taxes. Hypothetically we could just contribute enough to get employeers match to 401k but we are behind the 8 ball as it as and I had aspirations of maxing our contributions. I don't want to delay any more time that are monies could be invested and compounding in order to pay off the debt I think. 

**I did a search of this topic before posting but wanted to specify what everyone was referring to when they say ""invest the rest"". Is this just retirement investing, maxing 401k and contributing to Roths (if possible) or are we talking like brokerage ETFs (3 fund accounts)?** She would have to invest at least as much as the minimum payment into her investment so the ROI exceeds her interest rate on her loans right?

stocks,"S&amp;P 500 is NOT going to crash... For Christ's sake, stop with the fear-mongering about the doomsday coming.","So many analysts have been saying lately that the market is heavily over-valued amid the pandemic and is due for a crash or major correction at least. In all honesty, they themselves are not sure what's going to happen and are simply rolling the dice, hoping that the outcome will be in their favor so that they will be given astounding credit in the media just in the case the market does fall, which it won't.

The government is printing more money in a matter of days than it has in 10 YEARS. Money supply has gone up so fast and the market is going up an insane amount for the same reason, accounting for the huge deflation in the value of the currency. I hate these analysts with every fiber of my being because they think that they can time the market, but they know deep inside, that they are wrong and are misguiding everyone. This can't be compared to the 2008 crisis because the fed and government are doing everything they can to support the ETFs by not only printing more money but also putting in policies to make this a fail-proof market. Why don't people understand that the government is printing money so that normal retails investors keep pumping money back into the market? This was all part of the corrupt government plan. The stimulus check is meant to save people who don't have jobs, but the government is literally giving it out to the people who DON'T need it. I know so many people who have enough wealth but still got the stimulus check. Guess where they put the check? INTO THE STOCK MARKET!!! The only way for the stock market to go is up. If you still don't believe me, keep waiting and missing out. This is the best and safest hedge against inflation.

As always, the poor people that don't invest NOW will be left out in the big game of investing and later on realize the grave mistake they put themselves in. The rich people always benefit and the stock market is living proof of that.

personalfinance,"Stagnant Money, How to Not Be a Small-Time Scrooge McDuck","Our details (will edit here and also clarify any further clarifications needed in comments):

* Late 20s couple, married, both work full time, one child (6 mo).
* Comfortable with our life insurance coverage
* No debt except mortgage. Recently refinanced for that sweet pandemic IR.
* Both contributing up to employer match on 401(k) and husband has an ESOP. My 401(k) is a Roth and in whatever S&amp;P 500 index fund they offer... can get details if anyone cares. Tbh I don't know what my husband has, guess I should look into that.
* I have an HSA with twice our family deductible in it and am still contributing $100ish per paycheck in it. (It is a blended deductible insurance plan and all three of us are on it.)
* Have 2x+ what we need in our emergency fund in our bank accounts (9 months' budget including our spending on entertainment, restaurants, etc. that of course we'd cut if one of us were to lose a job, etc.). We have some local banks with some respectable APYs so we get 4% on up to $15K on one and between 1 and 3% on $40K on another.
* Looking to buy a new (likely late model used) vehicle for husband here pretty soon and depending on interest rates, will either pay cash for the whole shebang or overpay monthly payments to pay it down within a year (see bullet directly below).
* The big one: I am *highly* risk averse. Husband is not as much, but he's not a finances guy and cedes all $ responsibility to me, I just consult him before making a big decision. I know that I need to diversify but the thought of sending money off where I can't get to it easily (as in write a check easily) makes me itch. I know it's dumb to let the $ sit essentially stagnant in bank accounts.

My query:

I've read [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and we're up to step 4/5 and this is where I get cold feet. All my life I've been a budgeter, saver, etc. and known that even with my hangups I/we ""should"" invest in some mutual funds or *something* ever since I was in college getting my econ degree. (I will also note here that the requisite finance classes I took made me supremely disillusioned about actively trading/playing the stock market. I know it's a hobby for some people and they manage to beat the market etc. etc.)

Are there any other small-time Scrooge McDucks out there who can help me get started? So many times I've gone to the Vanguard (etc.) website to buy into a Roth 401(k) and talk myself out of it. Then I see ads for more ""accessible"" products like E-Trade and Betterment 401(k)s but talk myself out of those assuming that the fees are probably higher or something (apropos of nothing) and wonder why no one on here really talks about those.

vet,HELP. Forstering neglected 35 day old cockatiel,"From what I learned he was being fed 8 cc every 5 hours at 30 days +.

I got him handed to my yesterday and the guy said his next feeding was in 5 hours. I fed him les than 8 cc at 11 p.m. and today at 12 p.m. his crop is not fully empty, I acted on panic and fed him the 'papaya cream' people use to empty sour crop. It's only been a few minutes.

For context:

I'm a nursing student NOT A VET. And my neighbor has a cockatiel pair and the bred and only hatched one tiel. The male flew away (is know to do that and comes back after a few days) but the female stayed behind and totally neglected the baby, refused to go into the nest box and did not fed the baby, so we had to take the baby out and start him on hand feeding.

He took handfeeding fine even if he hadn¬¥t been handled but now I'm scared and think he's in danger because of how stupid we'd been. I just couldn't let him in the cage and let him die as the mother was not caring for it anymore.

Edit: it's been 12 hours since last feed and looks the same, he is picking at the wood shavings though as if he¬¥s looking for food.

Edit: Edit: should I let the crop go back to normal after feeding the papaya ? Which would mean waiting a few hours more, i dont knowy how many

investing,Dividend Stock Carry Forward Trade (yielding ~700% return),"In the spirit of generating tax efficient passive income, I have executed a dividend stock carry forward trade (essentially using margin loans to purchase dividend stocks to make money on the spread).¬†¬†I would like to get this group‚Äôs opinion on the strategy. Please let me know your honest feedback and any big issues you see with this.   


So here is the trade: 

* I took out a $500k margin loan at Interactive Brokers (‚ÄúIB‚Äù) 
* The interest rate is roughly 1.25% (yes, that is correct, 1.25%) 
* I used the proceeds from the margin loan to purchase $500k in ETV (Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunities Fund) which is a Closed-End Fund 
* My purchase price in ETV is $14.80 
* The fund pays a monthly dividend of $0.1108, which equates to a 9.0% yield 
* The interest on the margin loan is \~$520/month 
* The dividend income is $3,743/month 
* This nets me $3,223 in income 
* Now most of the dividend payment is classified as ROC (‚Äúreturn of capital‚Äù), which means it is not taxed (more [here](https://funds.eatonvance.com/media/2551.pdf) on how this works) 

So here are the pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs of this trade:   


Pro‚Äôs 

* **Incredible return** \- I‚Äôm making \~7x my borrowing costs on this trade ($3,743 / $520 ¬†= 720% return) 
* **Passive income** \- I would categorize this as a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù strategy as the income is completely passive; all you need to do is monitor the ETV dividend and stock price each month 
* **Tax efficient** \- because most of the dividend payment is classified at ‚ÄúROC‚Äù, the majority of the dividend payment is not taxed at all 

Con‚Äôs 

* **Margin Call** \- If there is a sudden drop in ETV‚Äôs value or if IB changes their margin requirements there will be a margin call. To mitigate this, I have only taken a margin position where a 50% drop in the security will require a margin call. I can‚Äôt do anything about IB changing it‚Äôs margin requirements. 
* **Margin Loan Rate Changes** \- This rate is variable and can change at any time. Because IB margin loan rates are based on the Fed Funds rate, this is likely to go higher in the future (as we have historically low rates today). Looking at the fed funds rate [over the past 20 years](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart), they have been as high as 4%-5%. ¬†However, even if the margin loan rates go to 4% the return is still 200%. Also, IB has never had rates this high as far as I can tell. 
* **ETV share price can fall** \- ETV stock price can fluctuate up and down; given the volatile stock market this is a big unknown; if you look at ETV‚Äôs performance since inception (June 2005) the stock is down 1.9% annually. ¬†What got me comfortable is I ran a few scenarios and if ETV‚Äôs stock price drops 3%/year for the next 5 years, the return is still 478% 
* **ETV can cut their dividend** \- There is no guarantee that ETV will continue to pay a dividend; the last time they cut their dividend was in Sept 2010 (a 17% cut), but it has been steady ever since. I ran scenarios and even if there is a 22% cut in their dividend the return is 547% 
* **Worst Case Scenario Can Happen** \- Suppose IB raises its margin loan rates to 4%, ETV‚Äôs stock price drops 3%/year AND they cut their dividend by 22%. I would consider this the doomsday scenario. Even if that happens, the return on this trade is 100% 

I would love to hear this group‚Äôs opinions on this. I used this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TbnLYuqJAN1E_uv8_Tlxeyp3D5Bi83F-gdE2MQ_cGA0/edit?usp=sharing) to run the scenarios. I‚Äôm sure I have not thought about all the angles on this. Thank you.",finance

Major city in US

At my prior job I made 95k. I just accepted a job \~ half a year ago where I'm making 125k (with a considerable bonus that I exclude from my budget as it is not guaranteed) . My s/o makes 60k a year. I have \~35k in cash saved, I am currently saving 19.5k per year in my 401k (from first 3 years of employment I have 40k in 401k). I have 15k in an emergency fund. My s/o has \~10k saved up, but I am helping them begin to put more down towards the 401k.

I have \~53k in student loans I am aiming to have paid off in \~8.5 years. We currently pay $2350 in rent in a major city. We are looking at a 400k condo that will cost us \~$2,700 per month per a mortgage calculator I built. We are able to put 5% down (considering the cash i have saved). Tack on student loan payments of \~$750 a month and we are at \~$3500 a month to live. According to my budget, which excludes my bonus, we are able to save \~2.5k a month after all living expenses (although it certainly doesnt feel that way :) ). I do expect a bonus in the range of $24,000 after taxes this year. Next year it will likely increase to 75k pre tax. The only reason i include this is for a better understanding of my financial situation. I exclude this from all my budgeting as its not guaranteed.

I grew up with very little money, and that has caused me to be very frugal in my adult life. The last thing I want to do is be stressed and house poor, but i do not want my money to sit idle because i am frugal in nature. I feel as this is a great time to invest in a condo in a major city considering the flight to the suburbs re: covid as well as interest rates. My s/o and I are also ready to have a place of our own.

Banking,SunTrust Closed My Account and I Can't Bank Anywhere! Need Some Advise!,"Hi. I'm new to this Subreddit and was composing this post since I'm having trouble opening a bank account. I needed a bank account that's Zelle compatible since the people I rent a car from to do Uber owed me money for a wheel alignment and that's the only money transferring app they use; thus, I tried to open a SunTrust account despite being in NYC and I thought everything was going well. My initial deposits were accepted to open the checking, savings and Money Market accounts and I also was able to receive my reimbursement. However, I noticed my online banking account wasn't working and the phone reps told me that my account was closed due to fraud but they didn't provide additional details. They told me that I could come into a branch to open another account but I think the nearest branch from me may be in the DMV area and I wouldn't wanna risk driving all the way down there just for the same thing to happen. I'll try to reach out to them again since the call dropped upon asking them if there was another way around it but I think this may be taking place due to two situations, my ex-girlfriend was using my old checking accounts to kite checks from KeyBank along with Citizens Bank and it triggered the Chexsystems back in 2018-19'ish. And then about 5 years ago my mom had told me to come over since there was a check mailed out to me and she thought it was from my HMO, Affinity Healthcare when I was on Medicaid but the check actually said Affinity Federal Credit Union. I foolishly deposited this check in my TD Bank account but then they told me that this was a fraudulent check, unbeknownst to me and that account was closed as well.

I just want to know:

1. What can I do in regards to SunTrust because I was looking forward to banking with them especially for their Zelle Pay?
2. What can I do to rectify that fraud situation that I think keeps popping up from Chexsystems since this is preventing me from opening anything with a bank and even some credit unions sadly?

P.S. Thank you always in advance for taking time out to read this and for any input. Also, Zelle won't let me use their external app and I keep getting a C-201 error code whenever I enter my number.

TDLR: I needed a bank that has Zelle; SunTrust has it but they closed my new account due to fraud but I didn't do any fraud. What should I do?

Full text: 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2021-35

Washington D.C., Feb. 26, 2021 ‚Äî
As part of its continuing effort to respond to potential attempts to exploit investors during the recent market volatility, the Securities and Exchange Commission today suspended trading in the securities of 15 companies because of questionable trading and social media activity.

Today's action follows the recent suspensions of the securities of numerous other issuers, many of which may also have been targets of apparent social media attempts to artificially inflate their stock price. The SEC continues to review market and trading data to identify other securities where the public interest and the protection of investors require trading suspensions.

""The SEC's recent suspensions of trading in nearly two dozen securities ‚Äì including 15 today ‚Äì are one facet of our ongoing efforts to police the market and protect investors,"" said Melissa Hodgman, Acting Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""We proactively monitor for suspicious trading activity tied to stock promotions on social media, and act quickly to stop that trading when appropriate to safeguard the public interest. We also remind investors to exercise caution and do their diligence before investing generally, including in companies promoted on social media.""

Today's order states that trading is being suspended because of questions about recent increased activity and volatility in the trading of these issuers, as well as the influence of certain social media accounts on that trading activity. The order also states that none of the issuers has filed any information with the SEC or OTC Markets, where the companies' securities are quoted, for over a year. As a result, the SEC suspended trading in the securities of: Bebida Beverage Co. (BBDA); Blue Sphere Corporation (BLSP); Ehouse Global Inc. (EHOS); Eventure Interactive Inc. (EVTI); Eyes on the Go Inc. (AXCG); Green Energy Enterprises Inc. (GYOG); Helix Wind Corp. (HLXW); International Power Group Ltd. (IPWG); Marani Brands Inc. (MRIB); MediaTechnics Corp. (MEDT); Net Talk.com Inc. (NTLK); Patten Energy Solutions Group Inc. (PTTN); PTA Holdings Inc. (PTAH); Universal Apparel &amp; Textile Company (DKGR); and Wisdom Homes of America Inc. (WOFA).

The SEC also recently issued orders temporarily suspending trading in: Bangi Inc. (BNGI); Sylios Corp. (UNGS); Marathon Group Corp. (PDPR); Affinity Beverage Group Inc. (ABVG); All Grade Mining Inc. (HYII); and SpectraScience Inc. (SCIE). Each of these orders stated that the suspensions were due at least in part to questions about whether social media accounts have been attempting to artificially increase the companies' share price.

Under the federal securities laws, the SEC can suspend trading in a stock for 10 days and generally prohibit a broker-dealer from soliciting investors to buy or sell the stock again until certain reporting requirements are met.

The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy recently alerted investors to the significant risks of making investment decisions based on social media.",cryptocurrency

Need help resolve this issue.

I signed a lease with an apartment agency but before taking possession covid happened and I end up canceling the lease before even taking the house possession by giving them 60 days written notice period. Now, my lease says that if I give 60 days' notice then I am not liable for anything. But, however, they kept on harassing me about the money which I kept on refusing. In the end, they said that I should give them 1 month's rent plus utilities since they found someone for lease takeover after that. I refused, as suggested by my attorney.

Now, after eight months I get a mail from debt collection, National Credit Systems saying that I owe them the money. And the reason they stated is due to vacating the apartment without notice. I never took possession of the apartment and I have filed a dispute against it but so far I have not been lucky getting rid of this account from my credit report. I have submitted a copy of my lease and written notice to the reporting agencies.

The bill would then head to the U.S. Senate, with many lawmakers aiming to pass the bill before a mid-March cliff for when current pandemic-era benefits are set to expire.

Treasury yields were mostly lower today at 1.424% at the time of writing but continue to hover near one-year highs. Treasury yields are the interest rate the US government pays on its debt obligations, such as bonds. Very basically, rising Treasury yields affect the stock market in two ways: (1) it makes Treasury bonds more attractive assets for investment and (2) raises the cost of borrowing money for companies, which is why high-flying tech stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday.  Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management said, ""Driving rates higher has been a combination of higher growth expectations as well as higher inflation expectations. Until recently, market participants have been able to digest the upward drift in long-term rates, but it appears that the next leg up in interest rates is a bigger bite to chew. Looking at where real yields were at, they were simply too low when considering growth expectations, and it‚Äôs likely that long-term real yields will continue to drift higher as economic data improves."" In other words, expectations for more growth in the market, combined with inflationary fears are lowering demand in bonds, which in turn raises the yield.

Unemployment rate is still extremely high and if we experience another crisis the Fed has little options left to contain a collapse. Natural human behavior results in people vastly under-estimating the chances of a low-probability high impact event occurring. This is the exact reason why the pandemic occurred as people disregarded the reality of the situation.

CryptoCurrency,They all follow the King; BTC's troubling relationship with Alt-coins,"I'm going to start this post in the worst way possible; by making a prediction:

BTC is going to start rising to new highs starting tomorrow morning

This based on a troubling and painful truth BTC is now in the control of institutional investors and traders. The recent downturn of BTC in my opinion was the result of moves by ""traditional money"". The almost uniform movements of BTC with the SNP500 (TESLA in particular) is the best example

Furthermore the fall of ETH and the major of Alt-coins proves another hard truth; 

""There is only one cryptocurrency; BTC"" 

What I mean by this is that while the majority of Alt-coins may proclaim to be alternatives to BTC. In truth they are the lords/ ladies in the court of King BTC. Their value, usage and future all depend on the pleasure of the King. If he is low they are low. If he is high they are high 

I know what you are thinking; "" BTC is the industry standard so it leads the pack"". Wrong! 

ETH, XLM, DOT and Dogecoin are all different and each on paper based on their individual markets shouldn't affect each other. As an example in traditional fiat currencies the CAD$, US$ and ‚Ç¨ don't suddenly fall because one of them did. The same happens in crypto. Recently XLM was all over the place but this didn't affect ETH or DOT. However they all followed BTC, why? 

Because BTC is what is giving them value; similar to the gold standard

Not to say that ETH is backed by reserves of BTC. But that ETH is backed by the public perception of BTC and not it's own value. In other words ETH is significantly worth far less without BTC. If BTC fell to $20, 000 (55%) with ETH current hold of being  0.35 to 0.4 of BTC it would fall to $800-$700 ( 65%). If BTC fell hard and fast enough it might wipe out the entire Alt market. Which is insane 

The main reason for this insanity is the sad reality of most Alt-coins. They don't address the fundamental issues with BTC; primarily scalability. They gain value by marketing that they do or in the case of XLM promote ""instant wealth""

Now that billions of institutional funds are  deep in BTC their influence is being felt. BTC as an alternative to traditional money should: 

1) Gain value when the stock market falls 
2) Gain value when fiat currencies fall
3) lose value when the stock market rises 

The fact that BTC is following the stock market shows that it is no longer being dealt with as an alternative. But rather as an "" asset in a diversified portfolio with stocks and commodities"". This brings horrifying implications to the table. Most large institutions currently are both morally and financially bankrupt. If they feel that they may be in trouble they will liquidate BTC stay above water 

This is the truth behind TESLA's purchase of $1,5 billion BTC. This isn't an investment but an emergency fund out of the reach of the SEC and FED. When they do inevitably do hit a wall due to their over valuation, below target sales and executives antics. They will liquidate their BTC, tanking the price. This being safer than raising funds through shares or loans. I suggest that anyone who isn't aware to go look up TESLA'S financials

Regardless of what some may say we still live in reality and stocks just don't go up without fundamentals. Especially if you are a car manufacturer ( yes they make electric cars but that doesn't make them IT) 

So my prediction is simple one; the stock market will be closed tomorrow. The big boys will be home for the weekend. BTC won't moves much and the price will go up so Alt-coins will go up. The weekend acting as a 2 day pre-market.

If you still think I'm full of it; just do a BTC 24/5 9:30 AM to 4:PM ( Stockmarket hours) VS SNP500",cryptocurrency

TIPS are the only vehicle that I can think of that would appreciate over time, but this is determined by CPI which may not even be an accurate measure of inflation if the government has a perverse incentive to report lower than required inflation as this would result in a smaller debt servicing by the government.

personalfinance,Old escrow and new mortgage refi?,"I am 9 years into a 30 year mortgage, at 3.75 interest rate. Since rates are lower now, I applied through my current lender for a refi. The rates seemed similar to what I saw searching around. I got 2.25 for a 15 year mortgage. I'll be paying more than my current amount but I'll be done sooner. 

I've refinanced a few times before- once on this property. I always used a broker; this is the first time not. I don't recall ever having to pay a large amount of cash to close. When I investigated, it seems that there old escrow is being used to reduce the amount of the loan and then I'm being asked to pay it again so the new loan has enough. I asked if we could just leave the principal as is, and the bank rep responded that ""to reduce the funds needed to start up the new escrow account, we take your current escrow account and use those funds to reduce the payoff of your current loan. If we did not do this, your funds to close would increase significantly.""

I can't understand how applying our existing escrow to the old loan would affect the cost of setting up new escrow, other than that we would have that cash to offset the new account. Does this make sense and I just don't understand?

As a sidenote, I am under the impression that modifications are only for people who are struggling- but please let me know if anyone thinks I should be looking into that for my current loan.",finance

[CNBC: Dow drops more than 460 points to end losing week on rate fears](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/stock-market-open-to-close-news.html)

&gt; All three major averages posted weekly losses as fears of higher interest rates and inflation deepened. The S&amp;P 500 slid 2.5% this week for its second negative week in a row. The 30-stock Dow fell 1.8%, and the Nasdaq was the relative underperformer this week, losing 4.9%.

&gt; The weakness in the broader market came even after¬†the personal consumption expenditures price index¬†indicated subdued inflation in January. The PCE index, which the Federal Reserve watches closely, rose 0.3% for the month, slightly ahead of the 0.2% expectation but was up just 1.5% year over year, matching Dow Jones estimates.¬†

stocks,"Stock Market Isn't Overvalued - Bond Rates at all time lows, Stimulus coming","**1st point**: Recently did some research for a college course where I analyzed the Buffett Indicator. For those unfamiliar with the metric, it divides total stock market cap by current US GDP. According to Indicator, the market is overvalued higher than it ever has been. However, if you calculate the correlation between the 10-Year US Treasury bond and the Buffett Indicator over the last 50 years, they are negatively correlated with a coefficient of -.9 (-1 would be perfectly inversely related). Basically, when bond yields are low, the Buffett Indicator (and stock valuations) are higher. If you look at the data from the "".com"" bubble in 2000, bond interest rates were still at 6% (average for last 50 years) which means low yields weren't what was juicing the market. We are not in a similar situation as back then. Currently, bond yields are at all time lows and investors have no choice but to put money into stocks if they want a decent return. As low as rates remain at all time lows, the stock market isn't about to crash. 

**2nd point:** More stimulus checks are on the way. While there are many Americans that need this stimulus for everyday expenses, there are also millions of financially stable people who will be getting the stimulus even though that don't need it. Where do you think all this money will be going? If I had to bet it's mostly going into the stock market. 

**Summary** \- Quit listening to fear mongers talking like the market is about the crash. Even if it corrects 10%-20% we will be fine. The data backs this up. The best time to invest for the long term is and always will be right now. Get in the market and dollar-cost average is it starts to fall (which I don't see a major fall happening until bond rates increase significantly).

I'm 22, in school. I made some money last year at an internship. I told my mom, my mom told her accountant that I was working, and he told her I should file my own taxes. She told me he said I should file by myself 'independently', and I took that to mean I should file as an independent.

I thought that was a little weird, but went ahead and filed my taxes last week with IRS freefile, through turbotax. The majority of my 2020 income was made in another state, where I'd gone for my internship, so I used turbotax to submit my federal, resident state, and a nonresident state return at once; all of them as an Independent.

A few days my mom started talking to me about leaving her health insurance plan because me filing as independent killed her APTC and her premiums this year will triple. She was hoping I could find something cheaper to lessen the burden. I tried researching market plans, but the lowest plan I qualify for would still mean paying 150+ on top of the new high premiums for the rest of the family.  It looks like the best thing to have done was file as a dependent.

Now I'm trying to see if filing a 1040X can fix this. I know they're meant for income mistypes and the like, can I use one to essentially rewrite my entire return with myself claimed as a dependent? Is this actually the best choice of action, is there another way to increase my mom's APTC?

I want to remind people before the year 2000, we had a 20 years bullish run. Its totally not impossible we get to 2030 with no crash, especially now that the feds baby sit the market.


Secondly, we have extremely nice upcoming market conditions. Stimulus checks will either get people to spend money to stimulate the economy, or get them to invest, both will help the stock market. The media is somehow trying to make us believe this is bad, but i think its just bullshit. Inflation has been ultra low for way too long, and feds actually want it to increase. They said many times they won't increase rates before 2023.


Thirdly, i also think we have more upcomming money sources coming into the market than ever. People from other countries invest in US stock market. With all the GME hype, more people than ever are joining in. Again media trying to twist this to say its ""bad"", but obviously it isn't bad.


Another point is, crashes usually happen for a reason, its not random. You can google any of past market crash and find the exact reason it happened. None of these factors are happening right now.


Another point is, there is a key difference between today and 2000. In 2000, the overvalued .com companies which had PE ratios of 200.... were literally worth nothing! These companies had never made a single profit! Once people realized they invested massively in a .com web site worth jackshit... they sold it obviously. They had no reason to hold their shares.


Now check this image about Nasdaq's PE Ratios: https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150305131443-nasdaq-pe-780x439.jpg


Obviously, you can see the 2000's pe ratios were stupid. This graph is from 2015 when it was at 31.7. What is it today? Nasdaq PE ratio as of February 25, 2021 is 38.5!!!!  5x lower than the 2000s. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NDAQ/nasdaq/pe-ratio


Its irrelevant if the big hedge funds remove their money from apple and want to scare you into selling your shares. Apple is a massive amazing company that is really worth a lot, and they do make tons of profits. Its not comparable in any ways to the dot com bubble. If other people are stupid and sell their shares, SO WHAT? You will just be able to buy into this amazing company for cheaper.



So hold your shares and stop worrying about a 2000 level crash, its not happening.

The CPI isn‚Äôt showing the real story with regards to inflation, and they know the majority will have know idea what is going on beneath the surface. 

Look at the prices of literally every commodity compared to 2019. And now, the fed changing the way they report m2 money stock data by reporting monthly instead of weekly.  I can‚Äôt say for certain if this is nefarious, but I have a feeling they don‚Äôt want to spook the market by having as real time data as possible.  

Satoshi maybe didn‚Äôt realize the impact they would have on such a broad range of people.  

Hard money always wins, and I choose the hardest, most inflation resistant money that has ever been.  All hail Satoshi",cryptocurrency
stocks,Why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run [Long post],"Wrote this for wsb, but it also goes here, I guess.

TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.

# Premise:

Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.

But let me try to explain nonetheless.

1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn‚Äôt have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn‚Äôt have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.
2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.
3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.
4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)
   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.
   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.
      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.
5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).
6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.
7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.
   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income. Just for clarification, there is lots of asset inflation, for example, bonds are very inflated.
8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.

# Conclusion

Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:

This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.

Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return(just like Munger said) in this decade, yet I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to a stranger on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)

Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.

* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.
* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.
* Black swan events.
* Think of something yourself man!

It seems like a reliable site from what I have seen.. But the thing is the interest rates for this site and pretty much all similar ones seems rather low when taking into account the negatives of such a move; I'd be transferring my coins from my wallet to a third party and leaving it there for months, and interest rates at just 5% and would end up being lower when transaction fees are taken into account.

CryptoCurrency,The real Dread Pirate Robert's from Silk Road.,"I just want people to know before they see the Silk Road movie although Ross did not deserve the sentence he got he also was not an angel.
I am worried the film may paint him as one and say the FBI made up everything. They didn't, but they did pull some major f**kery.

Ross accidentally hired a FBI undercover as a hitman, which is one of the main reasons he eventually got caught. He actually thought he killed someone not once, but twice.
However the second time is much lesser known and I doubt this will be in the film.  A couple of Silk road users formed an incredibly elaborate, multi month scam on Ross. Pretending to be a hitman, a gang of bikers, and a victim.

The original messages to Ross were a man saying his partner has stolen his account, and his drug money, and now his suppliers are going to kill him. 
He then convinced Ross to talk to the '' stolen account"" in question and later the suppliers he was told were "" hells angels""

Ross later offered these Hells Angel's 150k in BTC. To kill the original messenger. Because the other 2 had worked out a deal with ross to sell drugs through silk road. Then just like the fbi did. Sent ross fake photos of the ""dead"" guy. 

In neither case were either of these real hitmen. No one actually died. IN america hiring a hitman even if they are real, but dont actually kill or harm anyone the sentence is only 7 years. 
Even if they do kill someone. It's up to 15 years. This means even if Ross was charged with hiring a hitman twice, which he wasnt.(second case wasnt even a charge)
He should of gotten 30 years. Instead they charged him with a bunch of money laundering crimes and gave him multiple life sentences without possibility of parole. 

Ross even offered to rat out other owners of the silk road as a plea deal, which I also doubt will be in movie. They denied every plea deal he tried to make. He will spend the rest of his life in prison on completely unprecedented sentences because the Feds needed a scapegoat and boogie man for the entire, and still very alive and well, deep web crime industry.

Bitcoin,Mechanics of borrowing against bitcoin,"So now that Michael Saylor is our new god I have found myself in a couple of conversations about never selling, and borrowing against Bitcoin. A few things that people have been saying here don't seem to make sense to me, and I have got stuck in circular arguments with evangelists too many times not to seek further clarification.

So I'd like someone who has actually done it explain some of the real world mechanics and advantages to me.

Say I want to borrow $1 million to buy a house, a regular home loan needs to be paid monthly and you need to have an income that is sufficient to cover the repayments. Holding Bitcoin does nothing for you in this case unless you sell it.

Putting some or all of your BTC up as collateral is the next step. But the loan repayments still need to be accounted for, so all I can hope for in this case by offering collateral, is to get a slightly lower interest rate? This also puts the BTC at risk if the price drops so extra collateral might be needed, or you face getting liquidated. Point is this is a risk that needs to be managed.

I have been stuck in arguments with people who insist that the answer is to take out a second loan to pay off the first one but anyone with half a brain can see that at some point the loan needs to be repaid, and leveraging the hell out of everything you own is a great way to bankrupt yourself.

From what I can tell, this idea of borrowing against your bitcoin is not the silver bullet to tapping into this huge source of money that people seem to think it is. The only people able to do that are ones who already have a large enough income to service the loan to begin with.

If you find yourself in a position where you're holding a life changing amount of BTC then I cannot see a way of capitalising on it in full without selling at least some of it.

personalfinance,First-Time Car Buyer. I got a loan from the dealership through Westlake with an APR of 18.99. Wondering if I should refinance?,"Title is my main question. I'm not too sure how much I need to specify, so I'll try my best to get as much relevant info as possible here. 

I bought a 2013 Honda Accord with ~90 - 100k mi on it I believe. The total cost was 10k, but with the interest and everything, it bumped up to 13k. The length is for 5 years, and like I said, APR is 18.99%. My base annual pay is just shy of 25k. 

I don't have any credit cards and this is currently what is mainly generating my credit score (from what I understand, which to be fair isn't much, but that's why I'm here).

I heard that getting the loan refinanced can really help if you're money situation changes, or if the interest rates get lower. So I was wondering if that is something I should look into. Also if it would be possible to do something like this and pay off the principal first, but that isn't really my concern. 

Thank you for any help on the subject!

investing,My thesis on the Market. A Bull gone bearish (in the short term),"The Endgame of the US

I hate being a bear, but I have been calling this since last year. I don't have a degree in finance, nor any real world experience working at any institution. But I use data, deductions, patterns and correlations to draw my predictions for whatever I think about. I've been predicting a massive fall since March of last year. When I saw the fed stimulus, it only confirmed to me that the damage was done. A plethora of factors go into my deductions. I won't go too deep into it, as I can write over a page about each reason and the chain of effects, but I want to rattle them off and name a few. Thanks to Jake Tran for the charts 

&amp;#x200B;

* **A stimulus could kill the USD from an inflation perspective.** Keyne's Economics theories justify a stimulus in a point of reccession (hence we get the fed pump), but overdoing it can spell disaster. Lowering discount rates leads to lower interest on loans, which leads to increased borrowing. The more money you spend (if the value of the USD is constant), the person on the receiving end earns more money. Every dollar you spend, someone else earns. So if people get more loans, they get more credit. More credit means people spend more, meaning other people earn more. Banks begin to issue more loans, and they issue them a lot because they begin making money in volume. A stimulus or wage increase at this point in time would be detrimental to the USD and would punt us over the edge. We have reached the end of the road.

[Nearly 40&amp;#37; of all circulating USD was printed in the last 12 months ALONE](https://preview.redd.it/ixa96zb5yyj61.png?width=1754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab97494997bd217b1fbe116cb058e83dd789bdb6)

&amp;#x200B;

* **There is another bubble. It is about to pop.** Here's the deal: The fed already pulled out its trump card, and its running dry. Discount rates is the tool they use to manipulate interest rates and hence loans. The drop from 3% pre-Covid to 0.25% is what stopped the market pullback of March 2020. This causes a massive increase in LOANS, increasing the price of HOUSES and STOCKS. **Increased loans causing house prices and stock prices was the fundamental reason behind the bubble forming for the The Great Depression and the 2008 collapse.** Think about the roaring 20's for the great depression, and the runup before 2008. Both precursors with massive spikes in prices for both sectors before crashing.If we start falling again, the FED cannot drop much past 0.25%. There is no room left for the discount rate to fall. So, the only option left is to just print money and pass it around through stimulus or welfare.

&amp;#x200B;

[According to FRED, the 2008 crash had the rate at 0.5&amp;#37;. Then it became 0.75&amp;#37;, and with the Trump administration, he slowly began raising it again to a peak of 3&amp;#37;. This gave the FED its Trump card \(ironic haha\), and they dropped rates to 0.25&amp;#37;. \(https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/INTDSRUSM193N\)](https://preview.redd.it/1b1dakvz5zj61.png?width=1749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e7433ac99829befcf207276d39d31223e0e3a22)

&amp;#x200B;

(I want to also point out that from 2009 to 2015, the fed kept the rate at 0.5%. The market was well, increasing it would crucify the fed though. This led to opulence in the market)

&amp;#x200B;

As people begin to borrow less, less circulates. No new money into the market means people don't see their incomes as high as they were. Stocks wont grow as much as they did, and people who get nervous begin to sell. Then the effect cascades and you get a stock market crash. Remember because one person has less spending, the next has less income. This is not isolated-it's all connected.

[1930s stock market crash causes bank runs, increasing failing banks and a collapse. 2008 also saw lots of banks defaulting, but this is to illustrate the next set of events after a market crash. ](https://preview.redd.it/vrtpnj946zj61.png?width=841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de3d9807ccfb3d639e32deace1194ac19cd1bb61)

* **It's apparent that China is America's next competitor.** Global control over the export industry/labor, complete control of their own population, strong government etc. China is steamrolling. See ""[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides\_Trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides_Trap)"". A war from a rising country that matches the relative standing of another country is likely, so relations with China are likely to worsen.

Now for a couple of rapid fire points

\-**The govt 7 year auction being amiss.** This is basically a time the govt gets people together to buy their bonds - a place where there weren't many people interested in buying. To attract buyers, they pump the 10 yr bond interest. 10 yr bonds raising like crazy, potentially signaling dangerous  inflation. These are tied to 30 yr mortgage rates, which also go up. As mortgage rates go up, less Americans are interested in opening mortgages on homes. With a booming real estate, this could very well mean a significant slowdown of home buyers. Also, the amount of old homes refinancing also decreases. Meaning banks need to wait longer to finally close out their investments. The duration of mortgage backed bonds goes up. To counter this they sell long-dated treasury bonds, increasing the yield to get buyers and the cycle ping pongs until...you get it

\-**We have a reduced economic strength. Weaker workforce, reduced stream of goods and services.** Yet stocks were going up.

\-**The debt to pay for this growth is high again.** Again, this is due to LOANS BEING RAMPANT! Just like in the 1920s and 2008.

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Stocks are trading at an average of 40 times their earnings.** Stocks usually see 16 times earnings. The only other times this happened, the 20's, 2000s and 2008, we saw pullbacks.

\-**We are seeing an increase in political tensions (populism index), and the income ability for the top 0.1% is similar to that of the wealth of the bottom 90%.** This is something we haven't seen before, only once in the 30s. Social unrest from populism is not good for the economy.

If this bill passes through fully about 34% of all US dollars would‚Äôve been printed in the past 12 months. So my question is are we gonna see inflation and how bad could it be? I understand there are ways to counter this like quantitative easing( no clue really how it works) and what not but with the feds also saying there going to keep interest rates though none of this really makes sense.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin will solve the climate crisis,"Bitcoin has received a lot of criticism due to its energy consumption and contribution to climate change. This might be a fair criticism, but I want to offer a different perspective that I would love some feedback on. I argue that bitcoin actually can trigger the paradigm shift that we need to solve the climate crisis. 

In my opinion there are two main reasons for man-made global warming.   
1. Fossil fuels  
2. The monetary system

Most people will agree on the first reason, not so many on the second, so let me elaborate. 

The monetary system that runs the world is backed by national central banks, FIAT money. The government controls the creation of money and the fiat currencies have some stated goals that heavily influence how they are designed and managed. The typical goal is to manage the inflation in a country and this is done (simplified) through deciding the interest rate. The government wants to have inflation to reduce its debt burden and keep employment at a decent level. 

We as a population have taken out our increased productivity not in increased leisure and free time, but in increasing consumption. This all stems back to the government's goal to keep employment and growth high. But do we really need employment this high? Some growth is good, but now we have growth because it is needed to keep our financial and monetary systems floating. Without growth the system will crash. 

With bitcoin as a complementary currency we are free to do what we want with our money. They will store value in spite of inflation. Because there is a finite supply it cannot be manipulated to boost unnatural growth in the economy. If bitcoin gets widely adopted it will reduce the central banks ability to use monetary policies to boost their economies (because this will depreciate FIAT against bitcoin). This will in turn lead to less government boosted growth, fossil fuel consumption and climate change.

In the 30‚Äôs of the last century it was extremely easy to take out a loan because of the interest rates at the time. This money found its way into the stock market. When interest rates went up people pulled out their money, stocks fell, people couldn‚Äôt take out any more loans so businesses failed, banks collapsed and eventually this would become what we now know as the Great Depression.

In 2020 we saw that the US printed as much as 40% of all dollars that were ever made in a single year. This was partly distributed in the form of stimulus checks.

4) Institutional money is sitting on enormous long term gains from March of last year that they are going to trim and rotate into different names over time. Plus end of quarter is typically rebalancing time and you see an uptick in volatility. 

Just my two cents, more selling is coming but likely to return to regularly scheduled bull market after.

Edit: Seeming as how this thesis went correctly so far. I will note that I plan on buying a good deal next week as I think we will retest highs before the end of May. When we retest I am going to half cash.",finance

So it looks like this:year 1 January balance: 0 interest: 0year 2 January balance: 5000, interest: year 1 balance x7.25%= 0year 3 January balance 10,000, interests: year 2 balance x 7.25%=5000x 7.25%etc...

CryptoCurrency,Now is a great opportunity to try defi if you've got a Ledger,"With gas fees back into relatively sane numbers, now is a good opportunity to give it a shot.  During the last rally interest rates on Stablecoins through Compound were as high as 12-15% on some days with an overall average of 10%.  There is no guarantee it will return to those numbers, but if you're a believer now is a good time to enter because of the relatively low gas fees.  If you're interested in doing this, here are the steps I used to setup a loan on my Ledger, which in my opinion, is the safest way to do it as you can call back your funds at any time directly to your Ledger, not through a Defi exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Have a Ledger and setup an Ethereum account.  If you hold ETH and don't want to use the same address for lending as your cold storage, just make another one.
2. Send a small amount of ETH to this address to cover the gas fees associated with setup.  (First gas fee)
3. Go buy your Stablecoins of choice.  DAI, USDC, or USDT.  I personally would stay away from Tether because they've been shady and it sure doesn't look like it's fiat backed like it's supposed to be, but that's just me.
4. Send the Stablecoins to your ETH address on your Ledger.  When they are received, you'll see a drop down pop up under your ETH wallet in Ledger Live. (Second gas fee)
5. Go to ""Lend"" in Ledger.  Choose your Stablecoins and hit Lend, then go through the steps to establish the lending account. (Third gas fee)
6. Once the lending account is setup you manage that account and choose deposit, then choose the specific amount of Stablecoins you want to lend to Compound.  (Fourth gas fee)

That's it!  You're officially earning interest on your Stablecoins through Compound, through your own Ledger that you control.  Based on current gas fees of about 100 gwei you can expect to spend about $100 if fees to get this account setup (guesstimates here).  About $10 per send for ETH and Stablecoins and about $40 each for setting up the account and actually lending (smart contract fees).  Based on the fees and rate of return you hope to get, your mileage may vary in terms of how much you want to lend.  I'm of the opinion that there isn't much point of putting in less than $2,500.00 in Stablecoins into a loan due to the gas fees and variable interest.  Assuming you can get an average return of 10% over a year, it would take you 5 months to recover the fees and start earning on that account.  Mileage will vary based on actual rate, how much was invested, and your total gas fees to get started.",cryptocurrency

If we do buy a home we are planning to keep this home as rental income as the area is a pretty desired neighborhood with more demand for rentals than supply.

Solve.Care is a global healthcare blockchain technology company that was created early 2017 by Pradeep Goel. (Yes, they are already around for 4 years).

Some background of Pradeep:

&gt;I‚Äôve spent more than 26 years in healthcare IT. During this time, I have built four healthcare IT companies. Several have been at the top of Deloitte's Technology Fast 500, INC500/5000 fastest growing companies lists.  
&gt;  
&gt;From 2012-2017, I worked with healthcare initiatives of two US Presidents to design and build several public solutions. Including Medicaid, Medicare, social services, children‚Äôs health, mental health and other's. Now I am excited to work with blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.  
&gt;  
&gt;My latest project Solve.Care has gotten press because we have a real business contract for a blockchain company. Solve.care is a global Blockchain ecosystem. Including solutions for data coordination, administration, and payments of healthcare. Solve.Care platform is designed to enable insurance companies, government agencies, hospitals, physician practices, pharmacies and employers to create care networks that engage everyone involved.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 15, 2017  The Solve.Care Foundation announced an innovative platform for care coordination, healthcare and benefits administration, based on decentralized and distributed computing technologies. [Source](https://solve.care/press-release/solve-care-unveils-plans-to-redefine-healthcare-and-benefits-administration/).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;‚ÄúIn the US, more than $3.2 trillion is spent each year on a healthcare and benefits administration model that no one seems to understand, and even fewer like. And it can cost as much as 30% to administer. Solve.Care platform aims to reduce this cost from 30% to 3% and to bring transparency and accountability to the system,‚Äù said CTO Vadym Vorobiov.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months later a multi-year contract for its decentralized healthcare administration platform was signed with [Arizona Care Network (ACN)](https://azcarenetwork.org/), a leading accountable care organization (ACO) in the US.  ACN manages value-based care contracts for its network of more than 5,000 physicians covering 250,000 members. [Source](https://solve.care/press-release/arizona-care-network-acn-adopts-solve-care-platform-for-streamlining-healthcare-administration-and-payments/).

This was just the start. CEO Pradeep Goel went to speak about their solution worldwide and how Blockchain would benefit Healthcare in general at several conferences including:

* [HIMSS Saudi Arabia Conference and Exhibition 2018](https://solve.care/press-release/solve-care-is-presenting-its-healthcare-on-blockchain-solution-at-the-biggest-healthcare-conference-in-the-middle-east/)
* [Blockchain Solutions World conference in Barcelona](https://solve.care/press-release/solve-care-cto-presents-healthcare-on-blockchain-solution-at-the-worlds-largest-industry-event/)
* [The Distributed Health ‚Äì Nashville conference](https://solve.care/press-release/solve-care-ceo-pradeep-goel-to-speak-at-government-meets-blockchain-healthcare-conference-in-nashville/)
* [Healthcare Unblocked 2018 in London](https://solve.care/press-release/solve-care-ceo-pradeep-goel-to-speak-on-making-healthcares-blockchain-revolution-real-in-london/)

&amp;#x200B;

The hard work paid of because Solve.Care got noticed in the healthcare industry and signed partnerships with:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lyft**:  The second-largest ridesharing company in the US.  The integrated solution will empower Solve.Care wallet holders with greater access and control over healthcare-related transportation. [Source](https://solve.care/press-release/solve-care-leverages-lyft-to-improve-access-to-medical-care-with-first-of-its-kind-blockchain-and-ridesharing-service-integration/).

* **HMS**: They have been providing HIT services to the US Federal Government for fifteen years. The company is one of only two prime contractors on the nationwide VA Home Telehealth program and the prime contractor on the nationwide VA Rural Health program. HMS has performed HIT services for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and other Federal Government agencies. [Source](https://solve.care/press-release/solve-care-partners-with-hms-to-bring-innovative-blockchain-platform-to-us-federal-sector/).

Success kept coming and Solve.Care signed a second client. Leading pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim from Germany.  [Source](https://solve.care/press-release/solve-care-partners-with-leading-pharmaceutical-company-boehringer-ingelheim-to-launch-care-network-for-patients-with-diabetes/).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Diabetes Care Administration Network will provide patients and providers with information about diabetes and its associated risks, prevention, symptoms and care coordination using Solve.Care‚Äôs blockchain-based platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Not long after the Lyft partnership came a [partnership with Uber Health](https://solve.care/press-release/on-the-road-to-better-care-solve-care-partners-with-uber-health-to-deliver-medical-transport-service/). The biggest ridesharing company in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Dan Trigub, Head of Uber Health, said: ‚ÄúEvery year, an estimated 3.6 million Americans miss their medical appointments due to a lack of reliable transportation, with the cost of missed primary care appointments estimated at US$150 billion annually. At Uber Health, we are always looking for ways to ensure that transportation is not a barrier to care. Via our HIPAA compliant solutions, we are working to facilitate rides for patients who might not have access or the ability to use smartphones and to improve access to care for patients with mobility issues. Our partnership with Solve.Care supports our efforts by bringing innovation to the healthcare space and driving greater access to care for patients.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The company kept growing but then The COVID-19 pandemic hit the world. On May 22, 2020 Solve.Care announces the Launch of Global [Telehealth Exchange](https://gthe.solve.care/). [Source](https://solve.care/press-release/solve-care-announces-the-launch-of-global-telehealth-exchange/).

With the introduction of GTHE, anyone seeking healthcare will no longer be limited by physical or geographical barriers. Users will be able to consult medical practitioners anywhere in the world through their computers or personal devices.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;GTHE will provide physicians who wish to practice telemedicine the opportunity to be listed on the global blockchain registry. Once listed, they can publish their profiles, rates, availability and readily accept appointments. As it is an open system, third party telehealth solutions will also have the opportunity to utilize this registry.

While working on a Telehealth solution Solve.Care signed 2 more clients for their new solution [Team.Care Network](https://teamcare.solve.care/).

&amp;#x200B;

* Angel Kids Pediatrics - Florida, US. [Source](https://solve.care/press-release/angel-kids-pediatrics-implements-blockchain-healthcare-solution-from-solve-care-to-help-mitigate-spread-of-covid-19/).
* California Charter Schools - California, US. [Source](https://solve.care/press-release/california-charter-schools-roll-out-blockchain-protection-measures-against-covid-19-spread/).

&amp;#x200B;

Healthcare workers use Team.Care Network, a blockchain workforce management solution, to manage COVID-19 and wellbeing reporting.

On December 23, 2020. Solve.Care welcome the firsts Physicians to Global Telehealth Exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In continuing its mission of revolutionizing how healthcare is delivered and accessed, global blockchain healthtech platform Solve.Care today announced the activation of the first batch of physicians on its [Global Telehealth Exchange (GTHE).](https://gthe.solve.care/)  
&gt;  
&gt;A first-of-its-kind landmark deployment of blockchain and digital currency aimed at enabling patients to easily access healthcare services anywhere in the world, physicians have now been listed on the GTHE blockchain registry.

&amp;#x200B;

Physicians from 28 countries begin setting up online practices, breaking down geographical barriers between doctors and patients.

As you can probably tell, Solve.Care is already changing healthcare with their blockchain solutions. The SOLVE token is key because it is needed for all transactions in every platform and GTHE.

Bitcoin,What is the intrinsic value of BTC? I don‚Äôt think I get it!!,"Ok so some questions for you!

1. How can BTC become a workable currency given its crazy volatility? Is the answer it will become stable? Why, mass adoption?

2. Why would BTC be mass adopted?  What are the unique selling points of BTC above and beyond fiat currency like the $? Why would I use BTC instead of the $?

3. What is the value of the Blockchain? It‚Äôs the most secure so stealing BTC is very difficult? What else?

4. BTC as ‚Äòmoney over IP‚Äô - BTC will make sending money anywhere in the world very cheap? Well right now you need to pay a fee to someone like Coinbase to buy BTC to send. The receiver needs to pay someone like Coinbase to convert their BTC to a currency they can spend in most shops. 

How will that change, mass adoption so eventually you just keep, receive and spend BTC for every day life with no conversion fees?

So again, ‚ÄúBTC will work if everyone believes it will work‚Äù??

5. ‚ÄúBTC will decentralise money, disengaging money from reckless government monetary policy like quantitative easing‚Äù

How and why would governments ever give up their power in such a way?

Further, society needs taxes to pay for all the essential unsexy stuff. If our money is decentralised how will we pay taxes and how will society function?

personalfinance,Best strategy to handle my student loans?,"I will be graduating college in May and starting work at my new job in June.

My salary is: $110k/yr + $40k cash starting bonus split over 2 years  + $135k stock grant split over 4 years.

My outstanding student debt will be: 

$20,516 in low interest federal loans.

$20,702 in higher interest private loans.

Unfortunately my job will be in a high COL city so my rent is going to be $1500/month + $400-$600/month for food.

My current plan is: 

Take my $20k cash bonus that I‚Äôll get right away and just throw it all at my private loans. From there, I‚Äôll just put $500-$1000 toward my federal loans every month. I don‚Äôt want to pay those off super fast just in case the $10k forgiveness actually happens.

personalfinance,Should I pay off most of my debt at once?,"Delete this if I'm breaking any rules, but I figured I'd ask my question to get a more personalized answer. 

I'm 36 and over the past 3 years, I've gone from working check to check to a salaried job. I've been absolutely terrible with my finances my whole life and have had the goal to dig myself out of this hole to be free of debt. No savings, no retirement plan, and I'm sure over all of the jobs I've had over the years, 401k stuff is probably floating around for me that I should probably look into (No idea where to start). As you can see, I'm a manchild. haha. 

So here is my break down:

I have just over $22,000 in my bank account (I got a massive bonus last year to thank for that)
My debt includes the following:

* Apple Credit Card - $1200 (19.99 interest)
*  Chase Credit Card - $1500 (24.99 Interest)
* ECSI Loan - $2300 (12% Interest)
* Main Chase Credit Card - $6800  (22.24 Interest)
* Stafford Loan - Roughly 60k

Monthly Income: $1300 Bi-weekly ($2,562-3,843 depending on if I get 2 or 3 paychecks in the month)
Monthly expenses:
* $194 on Main chase card
* $44 on Secondary chase
* $94 on ECSI loan
* $40 on Apple card
* 0 on Stafford
* roughly 600-700 on rent (I do the grocery shopping for my rent split on top of $200 upfront) 
* total - $972-$1,072

Because of Covid, I haven't touched my  Stafford loans. My idea was to knock out the first 3 loans right this moment ($5,000) then spend the next 6-8 months paying down my main credit card until my Stafford loans kick back in. That way, the only debt I'll be paying off would just be my student loans.

I have the means to do this but because I've been so bad with my finances most of my life.. and the fact that my bank account is over 20k when just 3 years prior I had never had it above 2k I'm sort of paralyzed in how to proceed. I want to be debt-free but also be able to save, and invest the money I make.

I'd appreciate any advice.

investing,Potential lose decade coming: Where to hide,"Having lived through a few bear markets, wanted to share how I'm positioning myself for future headwinds:

- The Federal reserve can no longer significantly raise rates without threatening solvency of US treasuries.

- Big tax increases (corporate, wealth, and estate) are now political fair game to deal with a mountain of government debt and income inequality.

- A sizable portion of the S&amp;P 500 is sitting on nearly dot-com era price/sales ratios. Newbie investors do not realize that chasing after returns in early growth industries has not historically paid off for anyone other than very early investors (see what happened to Amazon, Cisco, Microsoft, AOL, Yahoo 1998-2002). 

- Many new disruptive technologies are actually going to deflate &amp; shrink industry profits, rather than increase. EVs for example will kill the car maintenance business, and they are actually easier to make (lower barrier of entry) than gas-engine cars.

- Mutual funds are now seeing systemic outflows due to baby boomers retiring. 

- Contrary to popular belief, index funds are not certainly guaranteed to go up. See Europe or Japanese lost decades.

In light of this, I present where I am focusing my equity allocation: 

&amp;nbsp;

**Climate Change Value**

While I would love to invest entirely in core renewables (wind, batteries, solar), I hate to say that I cannot do so due to their present valuations. Instead, I would like to point out a few sectors that are under appreciated:

* Regulated Utilities: Utilities have been beaten up over the last year, even as rates have decreased. Further, I expect that they will be given incentives to clean up their grid. Note that they will have some immunity to increases in corporate tax rates, as public utilities often pass some of these costs through to their customers.

* Natural gas: There is no credible math that natural gas demand will decline in the next 10-15 years. If anything, we need more as coal is replaced and EV vehicles require more electricity. Expect a double-down on investments to run natural gas with fewer carbon emissions.

* Property reinsurance: Climate change will bring more natural disasters...and while these will cause short term damage to insurance companies, it ultimately  will result in a bigger market as well as higher rates. 

* Food: Look for chicken, eggs, plant products as they are significantly more climate friendly than beef/pork. Look past 'Beyond Meat' and instead for established companies at fair valuations.

&amp;nbsp;

My utility picks: AEP (top pick), AEE, AES, EXC, DTE, CMS. Avoid companies with wildfire risk or a politically unfriendly atmosphere. 

My reinsurance picks: RNR, Y

My natural gas picks: WMB, NI

My food picks: INGR, SAFM, CALM

&amp;nbsp;

**Anti-Growth**

What is ""anti-growth""? Stocks in industries that are shrinking. Why anyone would want to hold one of these, it's simply because of limited downside IF we are in fact in a valuation bubble. The game is to bleed these companies out for their last remaining dividends. Example: if a company has a half-life of 15 years, but dividend pays out 8%..you still come out decently ahead even if NAV shrinks 50% over that time. It's a bonus if the company can turn around their boat from decline to growth but not necessary.

My picks: Tobacco industry (MO, PM, BTI), health retail (WBA, CVS), mid-stream oil transport (MMP, ENB, TRP). 

- edit: a bunch of CVS/WBA folks have pointed out correctly that these companies are still healthy and growing. All true, the point I am making is their stock price is quite depressed per recent history, and IMO its partly due to sentiment on the shift from retail to online. For the record I think CVS and WBA are undervalued. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Emerging Markets**

This has potential to be the long term money maker. Let's face it however...emerging market and especially China accounting standards are trash. They lie, and they do not consider it cheating, they think they are being ""clever"". This is not all too different from where the US was many years ago however. I'm betting that as emerging markets continue to develop, then there should also be small yet steady improvements in their accounting standards, transparency, and valuations. This will require time and patience. 

My ETF picks: 

- AVEM (instead of VWO) for a moderate tilt towards fundamentals without any major sector bets. The ETF is run by a smart group of folks (Avantis), many of them formerly from DFA advisors.

- DGS: By only holding small companies, this ETF is able to avoid the lofty valuations of China's big tech darlings. Small companies are more likely able to hide under the radar of government control, and are well poised to take advantage of organic domestic growth that will be happening across the Emerging sphere. Further, the dividend strategy lowers risk of fraud, as you cannot easily ""fake"" dividends.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conflict Hedge**

China represents roughly half of the Emerging Market portfolio. With Chinese exports equal to about 7% of US GDP, any conflict is extremely unlikely, yet with so much $$$ invested in non-free countries, I am obliged to hedge my bets with a few holdings that will do well in the case of a Cold War 2 or Taiwan-China conflict. My rule of thumb is $1 of conflict hedge for every $5 in China exposure. Individual stock picks are my preference of choice here.

- Arms race stocks: Stay away from IT contracting or ship building, the game here is to invest in companies that will benefit most from a high-tech arms race with China. Unmanned air/sea and hyper-sonic are the future.

- Domestic materials: Stocks that have been beaten down due to Chinese exports.

My picks: LMT, NOC, LHX, EAF

&amp;nbsp;

**Developed Ex-US Markets**

Provides some insulation from US stock valuations and future corporate tax increases. Europe in particular gets to play neutral in any future US vs China disputes.

ETF picks: VEA as core. AVDV for a small value tilt. 

Individual picks: I've got a few big bets on UK healthcare companies that are hurting due to Covid fallout. SNN in particular makes about 1/3 of their revenue in sports medicine and they have been reeling.

A special note on max draw downs and risk. When there is a market crash, EVERYTHING goes down. This portfolio will not evade that. Frankly, I don't care about another 2008 or 2020 crash event (30-60% crash) so long as it recovers within a 10 year time frame. My objective is to reduce the probability of a lost decade(s) ala Japan 1990-2010, or a loss that is not recoverable at all. All that said...no promises. I am not a financial advisor, so I must say that this is not financial advice. This is simply how I am investing my money currently, and even so it only represents my ""risk-on"" portion of my savings. I have the other half of my savings in relatively riskless assets (FDIC insured CDs, etc.) or lower risk assets (low duration bonds). Please do your own due diligence.

cardano,15 Reasons why i hold ADA in the long term..,"**15 REASONS WHY I HOLD ADA IN THE LONG TERM:**

Good afternoon folks, I'm the operator of Adazul Brasil Pool \[ADABR\].

It's been a while since I wanted to put up a post like this and now with the break of ATH, here it goes ..

The text can be a little long but it only shows how Cardano in THIRD is very far from being speculation, momentary or artificial pump. Cardano is a very well thought project.

*As you already know, this is not an investment recommendation, but only what I think about Cardano project in the long run.*

**REASONS:**

1 - Year 2021+ bullish market due to the roadmap as a whole.

2 - Cardano exceeding expectations regarding delays. However, delaying a good project is much better than rushing a bad project. There was a recovery in market confidence during the Shelley era.

3 - Second stage of three (2/3) of the GOGUEN era will be launched now March 1st on the main-net. These are NATIVE TOKENS at Cardano, unlike its direct competitor Ethereum, native tokens will not need to be created via smart contracts, but via a monetary policy script that will dynamically define rules for creating and burning tokens. In other words, tokens that will be created on the Cardano blockchain will not have a gas system resulting in infinitely lower fees than your competitor. Another factor is security, as the tokens that will emerge are not generated by smart contracts, all tokens will have the same security as the Ouroboros protocol. All of these reasons and more will attract many dapps developers to Cardano, consuming rival market caps and attracting foreign investment.

4 - The GOGUEN Era has a roadmap with more than 30 sprints, resulting in several 'mini-launches' and good surprises along the way. This creates a bullish climate for every ERA-related month.

5 - Total decentralization of the blocks production of the pools will occur on March 31 at epoch 257. Currently 83% of the blocks are produced by the pools, after epoch 257 all the blocks produced will have been generated by the pools. This generates more bullish weather in March and for the future.

6 - The Cardano Eras are NOT delivered in a linear fashion, this means that major updates are worked on and delivered in parallel with the development of the project. This generates constant deliveries along the way and consequently increases the market value.

7 - More than 70% of all ADA tokens are currently delegated to stake pools. This results in a greater shortage of ADA tokens in circulation and also creates low price volatility. The tendency is for this value to increase as people are being educated in Cardano.

8 - Having passive gains with the best existing proof-of-stake protocol (Ouroboros), you invest in ADA so that it generates more ADA. Unlike proof-of-work where you need to invest in hardware to mine, in Cardano the investment in the currency itself generates new currencies, in addition to the market appreciation. This creates yet another incentive to hold.

9 - Be part of a stake protocol that does not hold your coins, unlike other protocols that when you stake your coins are stuck for days or even years. And you can still do it directly from your wallet without the risk of sending your ADAs to anyone. Coins never leave your wallet and never get stuck. This will attract many people to the protocol.

10 - In the near future it will be possible for a single wallet to delegate to multiple pools, this will further increase the power of decentralization and the market will see this very positively.

11 - Cardano uses HFC (Hard Fork Combinator) which means that all large deliveries that require changes in the protocol will be delivered simultaneously without crashes or restarts. This is very well seen by the market as it does not generate fear or concerns about how the blockchain will behave post or during major updates. An example was the shift from the Byron era to the Shelley era.

12 - Along with the GOGUEN era, the Cardano project invests heavily in frameworks, tools, languages ‚Äã‚Äãand business models so that it is extremely attractive for developers and investors to start projects or migrate to Cardano. An example of this are Plutus, Plutus Core, Haskell Language, MARLOWE, KEVM, IELE .. I will not go into each one as it would generate a long content. Just keep in mind that the Cardano project is designed to attract as many devs, projects and ideas as possible, this is very positive for the market as migrations to Cardano are becoming natural due to so many benefits, it is just inevitable.

13 - Voltaire, the governance era. As already said, the eras are developed in parallel and the Voltaire era promises as much as the others because it will bring a voice to any individual who holds ADAs. In other words, in this era individuals will be able to use their stake to vote on projects and even changes in the blockchain itself. This makes the project sustainable over time, adapting to the needs of the coming years.

14 - In the Voltaire era, we will have the treasury. A small fraction of the fees for all transactions will go to some kind of 'public treasury' that will store the funds to invest in projects voted by governance. Imagine how attractive this is for people with smart ideas who don't have the money to start their projects. It even becomes an incentive for projects to migrate from other blockchains to Cardano due to the strong focus on keeping projects on the network sustainable.

15 - Intense scalability of transactions with the implementation of Hydra. There is no specific date yet, but Hydra will bring a second layer over the layer where the PoS consensus is used. In other words, with Hydra each pool will have the ability to add a new 'head' (analogy to the mythological Hydra head) to handle transactions, each head would have the ability to handle 1000 transactions per second (TPS). If we multiply by the number of current pools Cardano would be able to handle more than 1 MILLION transactions per second. For comparison, VISA processes around 2000 transactions per second. Imagine when the market understands this.  


&gt;\[EDIT\]  
16 -  **And most importantly for short-term investors - ADA** is not listed on CoinBase yet. u/umniaproblema  
&gt;  
&gt; How i missed this :O  
This is definitely a positive point for anyone thinking about investing in the long and short term. Listing in another exchange may add up to millions of dollars in Cardano's market cap 

*Something missing? Any corrections? Do you have your own reasons? Leave it in the comments!*

I decided to contribute in some way, the way I chose was to be a pool operator.

As a pool we are contributing to network security and maintenance.

I also decided to give back to the world a little since Cardano is so connected to sustainability, with that, my pool destines **30% of the rewards to NGOs that work in the preservation of wild animals.**",cryptocurrency

investing,Ignore the Talking Heads; How to Actually Invest in the Surge in Lumber Prices,"I‚Äôve been following the surge in lumber for a while now and after seeing the talking heads offer dogshit advice on how to play lumber, I got riled up and felt the need to chime in for those looking to invest in companies that *actually* will be riding this wave.  I‚Äôm not here to recommend any particular stock.  I just want to post on why there‚Äôs a surge and what type of companies are most likely to benefit from it because I don‚Äôt see any good discussions on this topic in the mainstream financial media.

**Understanding the Surge in Lumber:**

The price of lumber is at a historical high right now and may continue to grow because of a confluence of factors that have led to very low supply and a concurrent very high demand.  When we talk about a surge in lumber prices, we are talking about cut and prepared wood.  We are not talking about the logs that are initially harvested prior to being processed into lumber.  It is an important distinction because the price of logs is not soaring along with the price of lumber due to a glut of supply. 

After the crash in ‚Äò08, homebuilding was slow to recover and has not kept with pace with demand.  In 2020, demand for more housing surged when homeowners began looking to move out of the cities into homes with more space which in conjunction with the pandemic‚Äôs surge in home improvement projects created a massive demand for lumber.  

On the supply side, temporary mill closures from Covid, as well as some permanent mill closures from lumber‚Äôs crash in price in 2019-2020, closures in British Columbia due to the pine beetle crisis as well as other random reasons, have resulted in a decrease in the supply of lumber in the US and Canada.  There are only so many sawmills in North America and those limited number of open and running mills has created a supply chain bottleneck.

Despite these surging prices, because of how low interest rates are, home building so far has continued to surge and this will likely prevent the price of lumber from having any hard crashes for the near future.  

Also, despite these high prices, homebuilders are still making money.  Case in point, Toll Brothers still blew away analyst expectations in their Q1 earnings through increased sales and home deliveries despite this surge in lumber prices eating into their bottom line.   

Now, the ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù in click bait articles like to point to January‚Äôs 12% drop in single family housing starts in January as evidence of decrease volume, but they are leaving critical information out. (I.e. CNBC).  

First, TOTAL private housing starts only dropped 6.1%.  

Second, while housing starts declined in from December 2020 to January 2021, housing permits shot up almost 10%.  For those new to this, permits typically occur 1-2 months before the start of construction of a home.  

Third, January/February are always the worst months for homebuilding for a very obvious reason: winter weather.  
Lastly, a comparison of total housing starts from January 2020 to January 2021 shows only a 2.3% decrease in January 2021, but when you compare the difference in housing permits for those two months, January 2021 shows a 10.4% increase in permits compared to January 2020.  

So, right now we are on track for a significant jump in housing construction, and thus even more demand for lumber, that will be realized in the next couples months; important considerations that are noticeably absent from talking-heads clickbait.  So while there was a small blip in housing starts in January 2021‚Äîand February will also likely be rough‚Äîcome March/April, housing is on track to take off even further, despite these high prices.  

**How to Invest in the Surge:**

Will lumber come back down? Absolutely.  The billion dollar question is are when and how far. But because of how long it takes to build new production capacity and the fact that the demand for news homes is not going away any time soon, the entities who actually produce lumber will probably have a great year this year, maybe even next year as well, depending on demand.

There may be many good reasons to invest in companies like Home Depot, Lowes, and lumber liquidators, but those are not the companies that are going to actually benefit from a surge in lumber prices.  Why? Because they have to pay for those elevated lumber prices since they don‚Äôt produce their own lumber.  
Additionally, companies with tree farms that sell logs to lumber companies are also not going to be seeing much price improvement from a surge in lumber prices because there is a massive glut of supply, particularly in the south right now.  The sawmills are already mostly running at 100% capacity already.  
If you want to invest in companies that may benefit from this historic surge in lumber prices, then you should invest in companies that actually make lumber.  You would think it is obvious but apparently it isn‚Äôt to CNBC‚Äôs analysts.  

Many lumber companies are privately owned, but there are some publicly traded companies as well, such as West Fraser Group (WFG), Weyerhaeuser (WY), Canfor (CFPZF), Interfor (IFSPS), and Resolute Forest Products (RFP), to name a few.  Each has their own pros and cons, but all of them are already seeing benefits from the surge in lumber in 2020 which was much lower than current prices.    

That being said, these companies‚Äô earnings will also be affected by the operations costs related to the other wood products they make such as wood pulp (which was low in 2020 but surging now), tissue, and newsprint/paper (which tanked in 2020 due to the pandemic).  Some of these companies may also have some of their earnings weighed down by other costs, from debt they accrued during 2019 and 2020 when lumber was historically low or depreciating assets (common for the industry) which can be a big drag on non-adjusted earnings even though these actually don‚Äôt result in any lost cash flow.  

Also, some of these companies are not traded on NYSE so you have to buy OTC shares if you want to invest in them in the US exchanges.  So you need to do your DD in deciding which, if any, of these companies are worthwhile, undervalued or fit your investment strategy.  

While I have my own guesses on which may be the better value play for 2021, that‚Äôs not the purpose of this post.  I‚Äôm not here to pump and dump.  I am just tired of seeing talking heads/shills in mainstream financial media promote the same stocks that actually have no ability to benefit from lumber‚Äôs surge.  If anyone‚Äôs interested, I‚Äôll share my position and the reasons for it.  I don‚Äôt trade options so I have no clue how these companies would fit into various option strategies.  Also, I am not an industry insider or financial analyst.

Bitcoin,Any other Canadians buying bitcoin because there is no alternatives?,"Canadian home prices have 3x since 2006.  In markets with jobs for young people houses have more than 5x in that time.  Anytime asset prices in Canada are going to fall the Bank of Canada is ready to step in and lower the short term interest rate and purchase long term bonds to suppress the long term yield.  Despite low unemployment, low inflation and a booming economy they wouldn't even raise rates past 1.75% in 2018/2019.

This has been great for people born before 1990 as they can use their assets to get loans to purchase more assets while the debt is inflated away by the Bank of Canada.  But unfortunately for people born after they have not had the same opportunity to enter the asset market because wages haven't kept up with asset inflation let alone CPI.

The Bank of Canada has cheated an entire generation.  They expect us to now spend 45% of our income on housing to give boomers a golden parachute to retirement. Even as rates rise they will just implement yield curve control to keep rates low.  

I am done with this system, I refuse to play their game anymore.  I'm all in on Bitcoin, they can feel free to devalue their currency to keep bailing out asset holders but I won't be on the wrong side of that anymore.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Calculator or formula for taxable income reduction vs 401k contributions?,"My wife and I underwithheld by a combined $2k for 2020.  This isn't a problem but I was wondering if there is a calculator or form somewhere that will show if it's possible to, instead of increasing our withholdings, simply increase our 401k contributions to reduce the taxable income to the point we break even?  Or is that even possible?  I know it would have to do with what bracket we are in.  I need something that also takes into account both incomes as filed married joint.  I believe there is a savers credit that may factor into it as well.   We are both at 6% pretax contributions so nowhere near the max, but not sure if the amount of pretax deductions required to offset the taxable income would require a significantly larger payroll deduction compared to just having additional tax withheld.  I like the idea of keeping my money and making it work for me as opposed to sending to the feds. 

Any simple way to figure this out?

**So to answer all the responses, yes I filled out the new withholding W4 last year.  I filled it out for both of us and followed the directions and it underwithheld us.  Part of it appears to be my wife making significantly more last year than the previous year due to overtime and raises.   As I was filling out our taxes on the software with my income entered it was right where I told it I wanted to be, just $1k overwithheld.  As soon as I plugged in her W2 we suddenly owed $2k.  It's like the new W4 didn't take into account both incomes?   The new one is waaay more confusing and involved.  I never had an issue with the old single page simple W4.  I've been using it to successfully come as close to possible to break even for both of us for many years.  Now all of a sudden I'm getting bad info from the new one.

Update 2 :  I think maybe what happened is on the new W4's filled out for the 2020 tax year, I accidentally had the dependents listed on both W4's.",finance

solar,Do I suck at math or is this an absurd quote?,"Shine Solar (Arkansas) sent me a few quotes for different sized systems. The purchase price (including survey and installation) for an 8.7 kW system (29 300-watt panels) was $67,000. After federal tax credit, that‚Äôs $50,000.

So when I calculate $/W, should I be dividing 50K by 8700 W? That gives me almost $5.75 per watt, which (if I‚Äôm doing this right) is WAY more than what I‚Äôve seen elsewhere on this sub. Seems like under $3/watt is what most folks here are shooting for.

personalfinance,Is Synchrony Bank's savings account good for a young adult who infrequently makes purchases and wants ATM access?,"I recently turned 18, so I'm going to get a bank account that I actually own, rather than one that's primarily owned by my dad with me only having secondary access, now that it's legal to do so. My current bank account sucks, so I'm looking for alternatives to it because I'm switching accounts anyways.

As of right now, I don't actually buy anything very often as my dad pays for most of my existence except for things that I want but don't need, and is expected to do so until I graduate college. That said, I would still like to grow my money so I have a better start when I do eventually need to pay for my existence, so I want a high interest rate. Additionally, I sometimes use cash for more informal transactions (and, more importantly, I have too much cash under my bed that I need to deposit), so I'd like ATM access.

Given my situation, I think an online savings account with ATM access is the best option for me, because an online savings account will have very high interest, and I don't anticipate going over the limit of 6 transactions per month for a while. (I don't make that many purchases, and I can make them with cash or a credit card, in which case according to my understanding the withdrawal or the monthly payment on the card only counts as one transaction on the account no matter how many things I pay for with them.) However, support for ATMs on online savings accounts appears to be relatively rare, and the only ones I could find which had what I want were Axos and Synchrony.

I decided to read reviews, and Axos had almost no good customer reviews (despite shilly sites calling it the best bank ever) and lots of bad ones related to days-long server outages, actions taking weeks to happen, and them stealing people's money which seems to have started in 2018 when they got bought out by someone. So although they offer a better interest rate than Synchrony (0.61% vs 0.5%), I don't think I want to deal with them. Almost all the reviews I could find on Synchrony were roughly evenly split between people complaining about their credit cards scamming them with hidden extremely high interest rates and people saying that those people just didn't know how interest worked and were blaming the bank for their incompetence. Either way,  I'm not sure if I'll be getting a credit card at all in the near future and probably won't be getting it from them if I do. However, I couldn't find much of anything related to the savings account, the service I'm interested in. Also, the nearest Accel ATM is a 20 minute drive away and in the city, which I think might become inconvenient.

So is Synchrony Bank's savings account the best thing that's available for what I want? Are there better options that I overlooked? Or is what I'm looking for not actually the best thing for my situation?",finance

personalfinance,"HELP!! ~8yrs in arrears on taxes, ~20k in medical debt","Hello PF community,

For myriad reasons I am in a terrible hole financially and don't even know where to begin digging myself out. I'm happy to discuss the ""why""s with anyone, but I'll leave that for PMs. Please, please, please don't judge me. 

So, in a nutshell, I'm going to be 9 years in arrears on my taxes (state, federal, all of it), years for which I have not even filed. I also have, at this point, probably \~$20,000 in medical debt. No credit cards, no house or really much of anything to my name save for the clothes on my back. 

I'd desperately like to somehow dig myself out of these financial holes and become a fully-fledged decent citizen again; one who pays all taxes on time, owes little to nothing in debt, and has decent credit. I really have no idea where to begin, or if it's even possible for me get back on the level with things. 

I currently have a decent (but not great) job and rent a place to live, but beyond that little else. 

Is my best course of action regarding the medical debt simply to declare bankruptcy? Is it even possible to settle up somehow with the IRS given that I have probably very shoddy records of any income in the last 9 years or so? I've had relatively little income in that period of time, sustaining myself mostly on inconsistent employment and money from my parents. 

I was never looking to try and scam anyone and certainly never intended to not pay my fair share in taxes and such. It just kind of...well..happened that way, for reasons as I said I'm happy to discuss but probably only gum up the works in this forum.

1. Loan amount of $290,147 at a 30 year fixed rate at 2.625% with closing costs of $3 (Much of the closing costs have already been rolled into the new loan balance). Total savings cost would be $24,023 at 10 years according to the Zillow refinance calculator.
2. Loan amount of $288,633 at a 30 year fixed rate at 2.75% with no closing costs (Much of the closing costs have also already been rolled into the new balance). Total savings cost would be $22,368 at 10 years according to the Zillow refinance calculator.

Because of the cost savings at 10 years I'm leaning towards option 1 with the 30 year fixed rate term at 2.625%. I've heard from others that it's better to take a higher interest rate with $0 in closing costs but looking at the cost savings 10 years down the line it looks like I would come out ahead if I opted for the lower interest rate but higher closing costs. Wanted to get some input from everyone here thanks!

Edit:  With the 30 year fixed rate at 2.625% total closing costs would be $9,651. For the 30 year fixed rate 2.75% total closing costs would be $5,077.",finance
personalfinance,Add on to house or sell and buy bigger?,"Currently have a 2 bedroom 1 bath house, expecting second child later this year, so we need more room. Looking to add a master bed/bath, or sell current home and buy a 3/2. 

We paid 640k 4 years ago. Put 20% down. Current market value is between 740-800k. 3 bed 2 bath in our neighborhood are around 1M. If we add on, I imagine it will cost 150-200k. 

We refinanced last May and our interest rate is 30 year fixed 3.25%. I believe current interest rates are slightly lower, but likely increasing soon. If we add on, we could use 100k in savings, but we would need a heloc or something similar to pay the rest, which I believe is prime +1 or something. So we would be financing 50-100k at that rate. 

Is it better financially to add on and finance 100k at a higher rate? or is it better to sell our current home and use the equity we‚Äôve made, plus the 100k in savings for a new down payment on what would likely be a 1M or so house, at a 30 year fixed rate of whatever the rate is at that time?",finance

Forex,EURO PRICE OUTLOOK POSITIVE,"Members of the European Central Bank‚Äôs Governing council, including President Christine Lagarde, Germany‚Äôs Isabel Schnabel and Chief Economist Philip Lane, were all stressing last week that they are closely watching Eurozone sovereign bond yields ‚Äì code for warning the markets that they don‚Äôt want them to rise too far too fast.

Schnabel went even further, saying the ECB will fight any big increase in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates as that could choke off the bloc‚Äôs economic recovery. The recovery appears to be lagging the US anyway, yet Eurozone sovereign bond yields still tracked US Treasury yields higher and that is positive for both EUR/USD and the major Eurozone cross rates such as EUR/GBP.

The increase in yields can be seen in the chart below of the 10-year German Bund yield, the benchmark for the Eurozone.",finance

investing,Why Forward and TTM PE ratios have become increasingly irrelevant in today's environment,"**Forward PE ratios are not real-** I'll start with forward PE because it is one of the most frustrating ratios. When you look at forward snp500 PE ratios on Yahoo finance or Macrotrends, you are comparing actual forward earnings, to estimated forward earnings. Here is a fun statistic, 80% of snp500 companies beat q4 2020 earnings. Let me emphasize this, \*\*forward earnings are always wrong\*\*. The deviation varies, but it is not the correct number. In this market condition, we are clearly in a phase where the market is pricing higher than expected 2021 earnings. This may be because of a faster than expected vaccine, more than expected stimulus, or maybe just irrationality‚Ä¶ but it is expecting higher earnings. So when you are comparing historical forward PE to current, it‚Äôs not correct.

**Lower interest rates**\- Yes, this is an obvious narrative that has been pushed by the bulls for months now, but it has some truth to it. Lower interest rates mean a lot of things for companies. They can take on new debt or refinance current debt for lower interest rates, which means more money to invest in themselves for growth, or return more cash flow back to shareholders. Lower interest rates also have an effect on buy and sell-side analyst price targets. When modeling a price target, many analysts use discounted cash flow models or equity risk premiums to discount forward earnings to a present value. When interest rates are lower, the risk-free rate is, obviously, lower, which equates to a lower equity risk premium, hence, a higher price target. What else do higher interest rates mean? More spending from the average consumer. More debt is taken out- which is seen by historically high inflation-adjusted margin in stocks and record new home sales - which leads to more spending, which trickles down to the bottom line for snp500 companies, making trailing twelve-month earnings pretty irrelevant. If comparing historical pe ratios was a science experiment then the price would be a plant, sunlight would be earnings. We would be comparing the growth of plants v sunlight. In this experiment, we would want to keep all other factors constant, like room temperature, time spent exposed to sunlight, amount of soil, etc. But in our funky, weird, irrational, science experiment we are changing the amount of soil (interest rates), and here is the funniest part, people call it investing.

**The makeup of the snp500 companies**\- Another good reason historical PE ratios really mean nothing is that the quality of earnings has been pretty dramatically increasing. Over the past 7 years, the FANG % share of the snp500 market cap has gone from about 3.5% to around 12%, adding about a 1.7 forward earnings difference attributable to the FANG names. But, even this does not tell the full story. A significant makeup of the snp500 market cap is high growth names- relative to the snp500 earnings growth- not mentioned in that last example. Examples are Tesla, Amazon, Visa, Disney, Nvidia, Mastercard, Paypal, etc‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs very easy to justify the snp500‚Äôs rather rapid rise of P/E ratio over the last decade by just the quality of earnings. These large-cap companies are taking away business from small, not snp500 companies. Which is a large factor in why the economy suffered in 2020 but Q4 2020 earnings were positive Y/Y. Another key point is that P/E ratios do not tell the full story for many companies. Amazon trades at a 90 PE, Tesla trades at a 1000 PE, Nvidia trades at 70 PE, NFLX 80, PYPL 70. Why? Because they have pretty significant 5-year earnings growth rates.

**The rise of intangibles**\- Companies are increasingly being valued by assets not realized by GAAP metrics. Intangible assets are one of the reasons price to book value has been a horrible performer the past 10 years. Companies are increasingly spending money on certain technologies that are producing 0 cash flows but will produce serious amounts of cash flow in the future. Let me give a good example. Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated on the 2020 Q4 earnings call ‚ÄúWe are in preliminary talks to license autopilot‚Äù. Currently, autopilot is a free option producing 0 cash flow but has required significant CAPEX to create. We know this is an asset to Tesla and will create cash flow into the future. Autopilot, arguably, is producing earnings for the company right now, since it‚Äôs a selling point on their main products. But this does not show up on any income statement or balance sheet. This is simply an example to show how GAAP metrics do not do justice to many companies. An example like this can be pulled out of almost any snp500 company. 

**Stock buybacks-** SNP500 company‚Äôs buybacks basically fell through the floor in 2020. There is a quite obvious reason why this happened, a ton of uncertainty in the economy so companies temporarily suspended stock buybacks. As we all know, stock buybacks artificially increase EPS since the company is retiring shares, just like secondaries artificially decrease EPS since it‚Äôs dilutionary. Stock buybacks are expected to not only pick up in 2021 but expected to accelerate to historical highs. Making TTM PE ratio's not telling the full story on stock prices.

**PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS-** This statement is a disclaimer on almost every, 10k, 10q, institutional note, and blog post. But investors seem to take that philosophy and throw it out the window when it comes to price ratios. If you had looked at historical earnings ratios in May 2009, you would have sold all your stocks and crawled under a rock. Since then we have missed the greatest bull market in history. If you would have looked at historical PE‚Äôs in 2014, you would have said to yourself, the market is overvalued, I will sell and wait for a dip. Well, in that time, you would have to wait 4 years for a 20% decline and get this, you would be paying a 40% premium, not including dividends gained. A 20 PE ratio today does not mean it won't be 30 in the future. 

**A number without context should mean 0 to you-** One of the most well-known philosophies in investing is to not chase yield. A higher yield almost always means higher risk. If it didn‚Äôt, everyone would be buying 10% dividend-yielding stocks, not realizing earnings have a higher risk of falling, or maybe debt payments are starting to drown the company, etc. And the same vice versa, nobody is selling Microsoft because it is paying a lower dividend relative to the snp500. MSFT is just a higher quality company with a lower payout ratio. This logic should be applied to PE ratios as well. A low PE ratio should almost be alarming. Stocks like Walgreens or Abbvie trade around 10x forward earnings while Microsoft and Apple trade at around 30x forward earnings. Does this mean we should go and sell MSFT and AAPL to buy WBA and ABBV because it‚Äôs a 3x better deal based on pe? No. This is not financial advice saying to buy or sell any of these companies. I'm a fan of all 4 of these companies, I‚Äôm just making a point that not contextualizing why these companies have different earnings multiples leaves you ignorant of your investments.",finance

personalfinance,Is upgrading to a larger home for our small family worth the extra cost?,"Thanks to everyone in this forum for helping strangers on the Internet navigate tough personal finance decisions. I have been combing over this forum for the last few weeks and have found incredible value from all of the advice and conversations taking place. It's so strange that money is a taboo topic in the United States and such a shame that it wasn't better taught in our public education system decades ago. Now an army of millennials are relying on each other to manage their money--perhaps better off with more salient advice then generations before.

**TL;dr:** We're in our mid-30's bringing in \~$200K, should we sell our first home in order to buy something larger in a more desirable part of town, or just soak up the benefits of a lower mortgage payment in our smaller house in the less desirable community?

**BACKGROUND:** In 2017 we built our first home for a net cost of \~$325K with some great incentives from the builder that helped us equip it with the best finishes (engineered hardwood throughout, upgraded trim, semi-professional kitchen, etc.). The lot is in a great place in the neighborhood, on a street that isn't quite as dense as others in the neighborhood and directly across the street from the swimming pool and amenity center. The community is master planned with running trails, fishing ponds, and lots of green space and young trees that will later (if maintained) create an impressive landscape.

Since moving into the house, we had our first child, and things are getting tight. The living space (open concept) has been taken over by toys and it isn't possible for us to keep it clean enough where we would feel comfortable entertaining friends and neighbors. Luckily, Covid has let us off of the hook for this for some time. Because we both work from home (me permanently, my wife due to Covid), we would like to keep the house clean and organized, with everything in its place, but our problem now is that there isn't a 'place' for everything. We believe that having a bonus room would allow us to keep our main living space clean(er) and restore some of our calm/sanity.

**CURRENT HOUSE:** Built 2017, 2,200 sq ft, paid $325K, refinanced down to 20-yr at 3.5%, currently owe $256K. The house is one story and has 3 bedrooms, office, and only 2 baths. 2 car garage, covered patio, and small front and backyards with irrigation system. Valued at \~$400K on open market, but getting offers \~$390 from OpenDoor. (Equity estimated \~$110-140K)

House is situated in far away suburb in large metropolitan area. Master planned community with ponds, running/biking trails, and two amenity centers is surrounded on one side by light industry (quiet distribution centers), a power transformer station on the other, soon to be a 2-lane parkway connecting other distribution centers and a cargo airport, and on the other side open land that is soon to be developed into cottage houses for rent.

The house sits within the city limits of a major city, but is \~45m from downtown in traffic. It neighbors a quiet desirable city/suburb. Because of the location, the neighborhood is an ""orphan"" without any nearby city services, but treated as an outsider to the small suburb city it sits next to.

**'FUTURE' HOUSE:** $648K New build 3-story brownstone/townhome at 2,700 st ft in the heart of downtown of the small suburb, so there is potential to really be part of the community. 4 bedrooms, 3.5 baths, bonus room, and covered rooftop patio. and builder is willing to give us $20K in incentives.

**FINANCES:** We bring in $200K+/yr, owe about $10K in 0% CC debt for large purchases, lease two SUVs at \~$500/mo (we don't have time to deal with maintenance, and have found this to be the most cost effective solution giving us piece of mind--not here to debate this decision, however we may decide to live with one car once the first lease expires as everything will be within walking distance).

Current mortgage, including taxes, insurance, and HOA is \~$2,500/mo

Future mortgage, if we take this house, would be \~$4,000 on 30yr at 2.875%

If you use the 28% gross pay calculation, this is within our means.

**MOTIVATION:** We're betting on this little suburb to become a gem of the metro area. Older homes are already being demolished in the downtown area to make room for larger/more expensive homes. A major hotel project, which would be just a couple of blocks away, is on ice due to covid, but shows the interest in this area. Our current house feels too small and we don't like that it is situated in the 'big city' limits and next to the electrical grid, warehouses, and soon-to-be neighboring rental home community (although we think rent prices will be \~$1,700-4K there).

**QUESTION:** Should we ""suck it up"" where we are, save up the extra $1,500/mo ($18,000/yr or 9% of our annual gross pay), or ""strike while the iron is hot"" to take advantage of the available home, current pricing, and low interest rates, while also improving our happiness/confidence through a home that we truly love in the heart of a growing picturesque neighborhood?

If you recommend we stay--for how long? To what end? 

**OTHER GOALS:** I anticipate ""it depends"" questions on some of these items, so here's a summary:  
**Retirement:** me: maxed out at $19,500 401k; wife: working up to $19,500 once CC debt is paid off  
**Healthcare:** HDHP w/ maxed out HSA  
**Education:** \~$400/mo into 529 for 2-year old's college fund; all student loans are paid off",finance

personalfinance,How to target high interest student loan debt? Snowball or hit them equally?,"Question: Should my wife and I use the snowball method to tackle her three Sally Mae variable interest student loans My? Or should we hit each one equally?

Background: My wife and I have collectively nearly 500k (440k hers, 60k mine) in student loan debt. Luckily 420k is currently government loans, but 80k is through Sally Mae with variable interest rates. This 80k is broken into 3 loans, two of which we were able to put on a deferred plan (pay only interest for a year) and the third we had to put into forbearance for 3 months. 

We do not have a lot of income. We live in Chicago and due residency requirements she isn't making a lot. I'm making mid 40s.

Our goal is to pay as much as we can against each of the three loans each month. We have budgeted ourselves to live off of our base incomes (I can get OT and she gets commissions off of therapy hours and testing clients she brings to her company). The extra money I am planning on using to pay against these three loans. This includes the extra paychecks we get (3 paycheck months) our extra income on top of our base salaries, and my bonus each year (1.8k). 

Should I use the extra money to target one specific loan and zero it out or should I pay equally across all three? The loans percentage ranges from high 7-8 and have roughly the same amount of 26k.

I feel like it's a no brainer to hit then equally, but I figured you kind folks are smarter than me and would have better insight.

Now lets go further with the trade I took and published last week.

Some problems occurred during the position. We had a very difficult sitution on the risk sentiment. The SPX has fallen and as we can see in the picture below. The stock index is very inflated and overvalued. It is true that the U.S. has recovered very well from the crisis, but the S&amp;P 500 has skyrocketed too optimistically in recent months. The reason for this was, among other things, the fiscal and monetary measures of the government and central bank, which has fully exhausted their instruments to support the economy. This caused a strong loss of purchasing power and the flight into gold, bitcoins and companies that still had not fully recovered. I had this circumstance in mind and therefore monitored the risk sentiment and the stock index. When I saw how the Tesla share has crashed sharply, my assumption was that the bubble has now burst and took the price crash of the Tesla share as an early indicator.

&amp;#x200B;

[As the SPX fell \(orange line\) it led me to close my position early at the point where the red circle is.](https://preview.redd.it/r33i660oi7k61.png?width=2696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4c508eb688ef75378d1d4c818fc35c1aeae9e32)

[The Wilshire 5000 Index is widely accepted as the definitive benchmark for the U.S. equity market and is intended to measure the total market capitalization of most publicly traded companies headquartered in the United States.

[You could argue that the US10Y bond yield has not fallen as an early indicator of growth in the United States. I was overcautious at the time. Now 2 days later what I had prepared myself for has happened. We see that the stock index has fallen back to the level of the last low and that this time the 10y yield also has gone down a bit and the copper price, which can act as a world economic barometer. As a result, the flight to safety increased sharply and the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen gained in value.](https://preview.redd.it/cklgevocn7k61.png?width=2696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9173741c7cf13620fcfa834e943f25c7084d584)

Now you know why I closed my position early and why as you can see in the first picture the EURUSD which had the potential to rise further suddenly crashed so hard.

We discussed the pros why SPX could fall further. Now lets talk why it could rise or at least go sideways. And how we can anticipate on that.

[The New Zealand Dollar is the best currency you could take to go long. We have Good PMI Manuf. The Consumer Confidence is stabilizing. Last GDP reading was high and their main export multinational company in the dairy industry based in New Zealand Fonterra is hotter than GME. The 2y bond yield of New Zealand is relative to the current official cash rate very high as you can see it is scored with 5 points in the excel sheet.](https://preview.redd.it/sliho8e1q7k61.png?width=2614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d7730d2a0eea14174f58183fadf22a1fb692a3d)

&amp;#x200B;

[The reason for the high probability of an increase in the interest rate is that the RBNZ is very concerned about the house price growth in New Zealand. Don't forget that New Zealand is the place to be for the high society as it is a green and clean country. You wonder why every rich guy wants to build and buy properties there? Well remember, the  New Zealand dollar used to be a relatively expensive currency. With its high interest rates it is also quite expensive to borrow money and build there. In times like today when interest rates are cheap you want to take the chance to borrow and invest a lot in real estate in New Zealand. Think of the time in a few years when the interest rates rise again sharply in New Zealand and the house prices explode, because building houses again becomes difficult \(less supply in the future\). All who had invested then will yield incredible returns. The RBNZ would like to act against it in order not to have the event in the year 2007 and 2008 in their own country.](https://preview.redd.it/oo93q0hqr7k61.png?width=1922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b41d4adf581e9f61c853b76d2c450019b070fb7f)

The same counts for **emerging market currencies.** In my opinion, China is not an emerging market lol

What we want to see for our high rewarding trade is the SPX finding its bottom. What speaks in favor of it? In the chart above you can see the DOW JONES TRANSPORTATION AVERAGE (DTX) in green. According to the Dow Theory, the Dow Jones Transportation Average is considered a leading indicator of the U.S. economy and thus also of the stock markets. Some technical analysts are particularly concerned with the index. Economic development is reflected in the order situation of logistics companies. Required raw materials have to be brought to the production plants long before the final product is transported to the end consumer. That is why the transport index is considered by many analysts to be an early indicator of economic development. It didn't fall beneath the last high (blue horizontal line).

[If the US10Y \(yellow line\) doesn't fall beneath 1.36 and copper \(purple line\) also starts to stabilize, then we could see the stock index building up a bottom.

If you want to understand why a currency moves one way or the other and what the backgrounds are. If you are interested in finding a more professional approach to participating in forex trading, then I can help you gain interesting insights. I can show you on what to look at and what factors play a role that can cause a currency to leave its current fair value and find a new fair value. I will share my screen with you and others where you can watch live what I am looking at and how I form an opinion about the currencies. In a group on Discord you can try to find and share with me and others interesting approaches that you have created yourself after learning how to do it.

**Who can participate?** You are a member if you are seriously interested in contributing. If you can do the tasks you have been given independently and share them with everyone in the group. If you have time at least 3 times a week to discuss promising trades and the current economic development in group calls.

For this you need **at least one** of these disciplines:

\- An understanding of economics and the **ability to do extensive research work.**

\- A good knowledge of Excel

\- Good knowledge in Python (web scrapping) or statistics with R

\- Similar skills that can help the group

You can see how much effort goes into each of my trades. All this comes from a one man job. I want to have a group of people who all do a great job evaluating the market. Just like the principle, 10 eyes see more than 2.

**If you think you have what it takes and you also think you can inspire me in the analytical and fundamental then write me a personal message with what discipline you can convince, why you are motivated enough to be active in the group, and maybe even what you have to show.**

**I have send a dozen people my excel sheets. How many people have asked me how my Excel sheet is structured? None of them. If you dont have questions. You are not inspired and not made for the group.**

economy,Debt! The smart way to get organized and how to Pay Off Debt Fast and Smart,"I think a real problem now a days isn't that people are more and more reliant on debt, I think its that most people don't know how to get organized to pay off that debt.

There are definitely different forms of debt. Some debt is good debt and other forms is bad. If you ask me, the line between good debt and bad debt should be drawn at where the debt is leaving you with a deficit at the end of the year instead of a surplus.

I like to think of things in terms of percentages. Let's say you can consistently grow your finances; albeit through a job, investments, real estate, or anything else; about 5% per year. With that, you should not be holding too much debt that is higher than a 5% interest rate.

And that makes sense, BUT most people have a tough time looking at debt is in terms of percentages and like to focus on dollar amounts.

Let's take a mortgage for example, most people might see a 30 year $400k mortgage loan at 3% interest and immediately panic, but when they see $500 credit card debt at 24.99% interest and be completely fine.

See with a mortgage, at 3% interest per year, you would only need to grow your own finances by 3% per year. Knowing that housing values grow 6% per year would mean you're already winning by 3%. On the other hand, credit card debt with a 25% interest, you'd need to grow yourself 25% per year. Thats insane.

Needless to say, high interest debt is much worse than low interest debt. But I think most people understand it in principle (no pun intended), but hardly put it to work.

personalfinance,Getting taxed on RSUs(USA)?,"I am currently living and working in NYC, and when I joined my job, I was awarded couple hundreds of stocks which will vest in periodic intervals over the next couple of years. On my 2020 W2, on box 14, I have line for RSU with value 85K which corresponds with the value of vested stock units in 2020. However, these value of stock units seemed to have been considered as income on my W2. But those stock units are in my brokerage account- I haven't sold them so I actually don't have money for them. What's more, when I go to do my taxes, it says I owe $6K in Federal taxes. However, every time the stock vested, my company took some amount of stock units and sold them off for tax(at a whopping 22% tax), so I have already paid tax on vested units. So for example:

    Box 1(Wages, tips, other income): $222,647 
    Regular Income: $137,000 
    RSU: $85,000 
    Taxes Paid: $47,000 

So it seems vesting stock units pushed my income level to another tax level(even though I actually don't have liquid money for the stocks) and the tax that I have already paid for my regular weekly wages + stock vesting isn't enough to cover the tax liability at that level. Is this a normal scenario? Shouldn't the taxes being taken out when the stock vests be enough cover the liability? If the stock tanks, wouldn't I be paying taxes for money I don't have ?",finance

personalfinance,My Top 3 Personal Finance Tips,"Thought I would share my top 3 personal finance tips that have helped me in my life:

**1. Live within your means**

To most in this sub this will seem obvious; however for many it is not something they deliberately consider. Someone who earns $50K/year and spends $40K of it is much better off in the long run than someone who earns $100K/year and spends $102K. It's not uncommon to see people with high paying jobs with flashy cars and lavish lifestyles that are actually swimming in debt and struggling to stay afloat. Often it is the people who live modestly who have a higher level of wealth from building up savings and investments over time. As a general rule, you should try to save 20% of your income for the future. Savings should be invested (there are plenty of subs on that topic so I will leave it at that), which will lead to wealth accumulation over the long term.

**2. A dollar saved is like $1.50 earned**

Personal income tax rates vary depending on income and state, however using an average rate of 33% means you would need to earn $1.50 to have $1 in after tax income. Hence, it pays to be careful with how you spend your after-tax dollars. Here are some tips:

\- price match on big ticket items, particularly at big box stores that offer lowest price guarantees. Some of these stores even offer additional discounts if you find a lower price, which can benefit those who identify a big price discrepancy. There are several phone apps that can help expedite this process.

\- if you are looking to buy something but don't need it urgently, check several stores online and track prices for a few weeks to ensure you are getting a good deal. There are also several price tracking websites that will show you product prices over time on major sites like Amazon.

\- wait for sales. I generally buy clothes only 2-3 times a year during Black Friday and other clearance events. I also buy after the season ends or is about to end. February/March is the best time to look for a new winter coat, boots etc. while Fall is the best time to buy a new air conditioner or lawn mower. 

\- buy used, particularly for large depreciating assets like cars. There is little difference between a brand new car and a 2-3 year old car, with the exception of price. According to the book ""The Millionaire Next Door"", 37% of millionaires buy their cars used.

**3. Organize and manage debt by interest rate**

Debt can be a useful tool if used for investment purposes, such as to invest in yourself by helping pay for higher education, or to invest in the purchase of a place to live. Debt is bad when it is used for consumption, such as entertainment, vacations, or even daily essentials, all of which should come from your cash earnings. Credit card debt and pay day loans are by far the worst, with interest rates in excess of 18-20% in most cases. If you find yourself with too much bad debt, here is what I would suggest to get out of debt:

\- list out all of your debts including balances owing, interest rate, and minimum payments

\- sort the list from lowest interest rate to highest interest rate

\- only make the minimum monthly payment on the lowest interest rate items. In some cases you may be able to go to the lender and ask for payments to be deferred or reduced to help minimize this repayment.

\- move down the list and ensure you make the minimum payment on all debts. Paying each month will prevent your credit scores from dropping too low.

\- take any excess cash you have each month and apply to the last item until it is fully paid off. Keep working up the list until all of the high interest debts are fully paid off.

\- avoid declaring bankruptcy at all costs. Bankruptcy will permanently show up in your credit checks and can even prevent you from getting a job in the future (many employers perform both criminal and credit checks as part of their standard hiring procedures).

ethereum,Duty to Stakeholders,"I have become quite concerned with a couple things that came up in the EIP 1559 Community Call.

1) When some of the Devs were making arguments, they kept pointing to the fact that ETH has a responsibility to their investors and stakeholders as to why EIP1559 should go through. This is actually quite concerning because does that not then make ETH a security? Seems like ETH is starting to enter some muddy waters when using arguments like ""responsibility to investors"".

‚ÄúThe digital asset itself is simply code. But the way it is sold ‚Äì as part of an investment; to non-users; by promoters to develop the enterprise ‚Äì can be, and, in that context, most often is, a security ‚Äì because it evidences an investment contract.""

\-Director Hinman

2) Another extremely concerning aspect of the call to me is the idea of ""Economic Hardening"". This is kind of an extension of the first point. But how on earth can devs make the argument that playing central bank with supply (token burning) is a legitimate solution because of their responsibility to investors and holders of ETH while also claiming not to be a security?

3) If they are changing the monetary supply now, how are we to ensure the monetary policy won't be changed in the future? Isn't the whole point of the Crypto movement to get away from unstable monetary policy? If so, why is it ok for ETH to play central bank?",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,"""The"" Reason to Never Sell BTC","I'll never sell any of my btc, and I will continue to stack sats indefinitely (dca ftw). My reason is simple, and when I share it with people I know, I can see the light bulb moment in their eyes.

Why would I ever sell an appreciating asset that I could borrow against for cash at low (or even market) interest rates? Why would anybody? The answer is they probably haven't thought about their coin as collateral. 

Everyone I know that has ever financed a house did so by getting a home mortgage. Notably, the houses they bought always served as the underlying collateral for the home loan. And we all know what that means: default on the home loan and the lender(s) will eventually foreclose on the roof over your head. 

Enter bitcoin. 

Consistent stackers with diamond hands can obtain a home free and clear by using enough of their coin as collateral for the home loan, instead of the home itself. Do you still have to make regular loan payments? Sure. But guess what doesn't happen if you get sick years later and can't make those payments? Guess what happens if you default? That's right. Your roof stays over your head. Presumably, your coin collateral will be in escrow. And if you default, the lenders will foreclose on the coin collateral. Fine. At least you still have your home. I like that piece of mind.

Another scenerio. 

You or someone you love gets an awful medical diagnosis. They need expensive surgery. You don't have the cash. But, damnit, you've been stacking sats for years and your hands are made of cold hard diamond. What do you do? Sell your coin? No. Once again, you borrow against it. You'll get all the cash you need or, if not all, a helpful chunk. Pay for the surgery. And do your best to make the payments so you don't default and lose your coin collateral. But guess what? If you do default, you're not put in a situation where you may have to declare bankruptcy. You'd just lose your coin collateral. Not the end of the world.

To each their own. But examples like those above are why my hands are made of solid diamond. I will never sell one effing sat. Not one. Because they're too valuable. To me, btc is akin to a Vincent Van Gogh painting hanging on my wall or a faberge egg. Hard and scarce assets likely to appreciate considerably over the next 30 years. Longer, many argue.

I'll keep every sat and pass them all down to those in my family and friend groups that understand how to wield the coin.

business,Trillions to be added to SLR Calculation on March.31st: Is this a good thing or a bad thing?,"I'm no expert, but shouldn't any large changes to the supplemental leverage ratio be viewed as a negative catalyst for the stock market?

Risky Finance took note of this back in November, writing that regulatory capital had been decreased by as much as $3 trillion for the 6 largest banks due to the feds forbearance measures in response to the virus outbreak..

&gt;**‚ÄúThe biggest forbearance measure was a move by the Fed in May to exclude treasury bonds and** **central bank** **deposits from the leverage exposure measure. That wiped $2 trillion off the** **SLR** **denominator, including $619 billion at JP Morgan alone.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;**""Just one of the regulatory changes implemented by the fed in the response to the economic shutdowns would have reduced the denominator (total assets) for calculating the** **SLR** **by $3 trillion for the 6 largest banks (regulatory balance sheets)...""**  
&gt;  
&gt;**""...without three critical forbearance measures, some banks such as** **Citigroup** **or Goldman Sachs would have been just 30 basis points away from the minimum, which would prompted the Fed to restrict their trading and lending activity.‚Äù**

To calculate the SLR , just divide the Tier 1 Capital by a bank‚Äôs assets.

**Tier 1 Capital = reserves, common equity, plus retained earnings and certain instruments with discretionary dividends and no maturity.**

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-leverage-ratio.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-leverage-ratio.asp)

In the past, when the banking industry was much more competitive, it was common for banks to market themselves on their surplus (reserve) in order to attract new customers.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1823156?seq=1#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1823156?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

Changes to the leverage ratio can lead to very large increases--or decreases--to a banks‚Äô ability to lend. To put that into perspective, according to Thomas Hoenig, a former Vice Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, if share buybacks of $83 billion, representing 72% of total payouts for the top 10 BHCs in 2017, were instead retained, under current capital rules, **this could have increased small business loans by $750 billion, or mortgage loans by almost $ 1.5 trillion...**

[https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/07/run-dollar-due-panic-or-greed](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/07/run-dollar-due-panic-or-greed)

But how does this affect the stock market, you might be wondering?

Well, if J.P. Morgan is going to be adding roughly $619 billion back to the assets used for calculating this leverage ratio, it should theoretically reduce the amount of credit that will be available for investors to speculate. This, of course, would not be a good thing..

[Nick Panigirtzoglou](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nick+Panigirtzoglou&amp;rlz=1C1NHXL_enCA704CA705&amp;oq=Nick+Panigirtzoglou&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), a top analyst at JPM, seemed to support this idea back in November when he argued that lockdowns could actually become a bullish signal because they would increase the likelihood of more quantitative easing from the fed.

&gt;**""Although it has had a negative impact in the short term, the reemergence of lockdowns and resultant growth weakness could bolster the above equity upside over the medium to longer term via inducing more QE and thus more liquidity creation.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.nxtmine.com/in-moment-of-brutal-honesty-jpmorgan-says-economic-disaster-and-more-lockdowns-will-be-great-for-stocks/](https://www.nxtmine.com/in-moment-of-brutal-honesty-jpmorgan-says-economic-disaster-and-more-lockdowns-will-be-great-for-stocks/)

If a top analyst at America's largest bank believes that quantitative easing is more important to the stock market than real tangible business activity--even during worldwide pandemic related economic lockdowns--than it only makes sense to assume that any kind of drastic changes to the SLR should also have some kind of impact on equity markets as well.

**May 15, 2020,** **Federal Reserve** **Press Release**

&gt;""For purposes of reporting the supplementary leverage ratio as of June 30, 2020, an electing depository institution may reflect the exclusion of Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from total leverage exposure as if this interim final rule had been in effect for the entire second quarter of 2020. Because the supplementary leverage ratio is calculated as an average over the quarter, this will have the effect of maximizing the effect of the exclusion starting in the second quarter of 2020. The agencies are not making similar adjustments to riskbased capital ratios because Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks are risk-weighted at zero percent.""
