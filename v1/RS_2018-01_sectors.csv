personalfinance,Buying home with 10% down,"I am considering buying a home this year with about 10% down.



Income: $77k/yr (doing really well, likely raise in April)

Take home: ~$4,400/mo (after taxes, insurance, 5% retirement)

Retirement: Employer matches 1:1 first 3%, 2:1 next 2%

Credit score: 800+

Location: Evanston/Chicago, IL



Current budget/expenses:

Rent: $937.50/mo (split with girlfriend)

Utilities: $80/mo

Groceries: $300/mo

Restaurants: $150/mo (budgetted, normally don't exceed)

Phone: $50/mo

Gas: ~$40/mo (have a company car as my primary)

Auto insurance: $90/mo

Car payment: $262/mo ($8k remaining, 1.8% interest, paid off in 30 months)

Dog: $100/mo

Gym: $80/mo

Miscellaneous: $200/mo (various periodic expenses, car registration, gifts, leisure)



Typically expenses are $2,400/mo, ~$1,500 excluding rent.


Debts:

Car ($8k remaining, 1.8% interest, paid off in 30 months)

Student loans paid off


Assets:

$20k in checking/emergency fund

$27k in Vanguard fund


I am saving $1,200/mo into the Vanguard fund, and usually $600 leftover in checking/emergency. Apartment lease is through August. I expect I'll have $36k in the Vanguard fund by August.


The homes I have browsed in my area that I like are in $250k-300k range. I would like to get a townhouse or SFH with a yard. This is more of a emotional want, my dog really enjoys playing in a yard and I want to have that for him. I also enjoy just having my own space. I live with my girlfriend. We have discussed it, she would contribute half of the non-principal amount (I don't expect her to pay for the portion that basically becomes my equity), so ~$800/mo. She makes $60k/yr.


By putting down 10%, I understand I will have PMI and a higher interest rate, but I'll get into a home and start building equity. I can also contribute the $1,200 (or some smaller portion) I'm currently adding to my Vanguard fund towards the loan and be out of PMI quickly.

personalfinance,Should I use my FSA reimbursement to pay debt or reduce taxable income?,"I have $5k I have to take out of a dependent care FSA in the next month.  I am looking for advice on how to use it.  

Option 1:  Apply it toward my student loan debt.  I have approx. $85k of federal student loan debt (undergrad and law school) with a weighted average interest rate of ~6%.   This money would effectively pay off my freshman year of undergrad.  This would in turn reduce my monthly minimum from $1,009 to $950 and allow me to snowball the extra $50 (I already pay extra).  

Option 2: Take the $5k and put into my HSA.  This would save me about $1,500 in taxes.  I am already on pace to break even on taxes this year, so this would net me a $1,500 refund, which I would then apply to the student loan debt.  

Other info:  Household income $163k, own our house, one child in daycare, no CC or other unsecured debt.  After all expenses, we are saving about $2k per month.  We have a 4 month e-fund, and could do better with retirement accounts (this is our main goal for 2018).  

My student loan debt is a huge monkey on my back, and part of me wants to put the $5k toward that just for the emotional effect.  However, I also can't help but think that stashing it into the HSA would allow me to net an extra $1,500 that the government would otherwise get to keep (also feels good to my somewhat libertarian ideals), and I can invest the HSA funds and come out ahead in the long term (refinancing student loans to ~4.25% and  5 year payoff in January).   

So, what does PF think?",finance
personalfinance,[OC] My expenses for 2017,"Hello /r/personalfinance and Happy New Year to all!

My entire life I have been pretty responsible with my finances. I currently have a savings account, I have an emergency fund that will cover my bills for more than 10 months, I have an additional retirement fund with a small interest rate. For the past 3 years, I have been tracking all my expenses in spreadsheets. I am also currently building a web app to help me even further with that (I will share it here when it's done).

I just made my yearly expenses chart and decided to share. Here it is: https://imgur.com/2hCeb7u

My social situation: I am living in Berlin, Germany and my salary is in EUR. The chart shows my total expenses per category for 2017. My new year's resolution is to track my expenses even more detailed. For example now, *Bills* include my rent, internet bill, my phone bill, Spotify, Digital Ocean etc. I will break that down to Household bills and Subscriptions (I'll think of names later on). Let me know what you think! Do you have any questions? Any advice on how to improve my tracking? Would be nice if other people share their yearly expenses, it's always fun to compare :)

altcoin,"The Selfish Immortal Blockchain Token - alternatively - ""The Powerful Homeless Altcoin""","I enjoy discussion of what the future of blockchains might look like, especially ""out of the box"" thinking. I mean, let's face it, no one really saw ""cryptokitties"" coming. This tech really evolves in often unpredictable ways. Forced on me in biology class was reading Richard Dawkin's ""The Selfish Gene"". I could not help but make some connections between evolution in biology and evolution in blockchains, where ""genea"" are substituted with ""tokens"". Here's my thoughts.

In 1976, in “The Selfish Gene”, Richard Dawkins impacted biological thinking with a more gene-centered view of the evolution. At the time of the publication, much had been learned about how the phenomenon of evolution operates, but many of the models laid focus on the organism or group of organisms, rather than the genes, the very material of inheritance these organism harbor. Overall, from a self-gene perspective, while the organism may die, the gene lives on, selfishly, immortally, beyond its host. In other words, you are merely a vector to spread the genes that build you; these genes are older than you; they thrive, and will thrive, beyond you.

It should be noted that the selfish gene, or gene-centered view, is not mutually exclusive from perspectives focused on the organism or group. Rather, it enriches the understanding of biology beyond the organisms itself. This too can be said of blockchains.

The origin of the term “meme” also stems from Dawkin’s “The Selfish Gene”. The original definition did not foresee Rickrolling, LOLcats, or Pepe the frog. Rather, a meme was a unit of cultural evolution, analogous to the gene, but hosted by the mind rather than the cell. Much like the gene, it reproduces, evolves, and for the meme to last, it may even improve the fitness of its host, hosts, and groups, or at least function more selfishly as a “Virus of the Mind” (a later work by Dawkins).

A blockchain is not an organism, and a token is not a meme, at least not without generous redefinition. That said, a meme was never meant to be a gene. Nevertheless, the analogy can give vision and perspective.

How might blockchain tokens evolve selfishly? Can tokens, and smart contracts generally, live beyond their original blockchain host?

The short answer, of course they can. It has already happened. Every hard-fork is a token living beyond its original blockchain. But let’s take a step back before we take a step forward.

Here I focus on Currencies Tokens (aka, cryptocurrencies, digital currencies) and Utility Tokens (aka, App Coins) rather than Security Tokens. Currency Tokens (CT) are transfers of value, Utility Tokens (UT) are those that support services; Security Tokens (ST) are those that represent shares of a business. CT are not mutually exclusive with either UT or ST.

The Ethereum token, Ether, is an example of a Utility Token. It supports the Ethereum blockchain. It is happen to have quality that can make it a strong currency as well. For example, at the time of this publication, Ether (aka, ETH) is even better than bitcoin as money; it is faster to use, cheaper to use, more has more application. So Ether is a both a CT and a UT.

But can these CT/UT tokens exhibit behavior analogous to that implied by selfish genes?

I would argue that not only CAN they be selfish, but for blockchain to grow effectively, they MUST be. I would argue for a token-centered view of blockchain evolution. One where any individual blockchain is less important than the tokens they harbor. In fact, the tokens themselves, or at least many of them, will evolve beyond their original parent blockchain. This is especially key to the vision of blockchain 3.0.

Blockchain 3.0 fosters an internet of blockchains in which information moves freely within a grand space of underlying blockchains. Thousands, potentially tens of thousands of blockchains, interoperating in such a way that no blockchain reigns supreme. This future is all but inevitable. There is no other way to have a truly decentralized trustless space than to have no single blockchain dependency. So if the blockchain itself is no longer the focal center piece of blockchain evolution, than what is? In part, it will be the token, or more specifically, the smart contract.

As an early example, let us consider the current vision of the Aion Network. I use this as an example because the vision for the Aion Network is well described. However, at the time of this writing, the Aion Network is in an early development phase, so it future is very much unknown. Nevertheless, the vision of the Aion Network is an example of a foundation that will bring selfish immortal tokens and smart contracts.

The token of the Aion Network is designed as a very strong CT/UT. As described by Aion Network developers, it will be used to: Federate — send data and value between any Aion-compliant blockchains, including Ethereum; Scale — provide fast transaction processing and increased data capacity to all Aion blockchains; Spoke — allow the creation of customized public or private blockchains that maintain interoperability with other blockchains (I will refer to Spoke chains as “Aion-x” chains, which seamlessly interoperate with the primary Aion-1 public blockchain, which seamlessly interoperate with other blockchains like Ethereum).

Consider what this vision for Aion means in the longer term. A world in which blockchains have interoperation compliance is a world in which tokens (broadly defined) can move far beyond the blockchain in which they originally evolved.

Here is an example. Aion-1 is the primary blockchain for the Aion Network. Using the Aion UT token, one can “Spoke” (Aion-x) a new blockchain for your business, and that blockchain will be compliant, fully interoperate, with Aion-1. Similarly, Aion-1 can interoperate with Ethereum, or a large number of legacy blockchains. For example, take projects like Rootstock or Cosmos, which are attempts to empower Bitcoin with smart contact access, either as a direct second layer (Rootstock) or through interoperation with Ethereum (Cosmos). The Aion UT token could be used to create a bridge with Cosmos, which bridges with Bitcoin, to interoperate information from all three networks. But this is just small potatoes to the full vision.

Take for example, Cryptokitties, a digital collectable that can be provably rare, unique, and utterly resistant to forgery (the power of the blockchain at its best). A Cryptokitty is a type of contract, but also a token (currently named a non-fungible token ERC #721), on the Ethereum blockchain. The game, Cryptokitties, slowed down the Ethereum blockchain significantly (scaling issues), but all this could change with true blockchain interoperation. Imagine Cryptokitties tokens still being non-fungible, provably rare, token, but never hosted by a single blockchain. The business of Cryptokitties could spawn an Aion-x chain, use it as a rapid ledger and proof of transaction, record those transactions, compiled and intermitted, on major public blockchain networks (like Ethereum), and allow the smart contract of Kitties themselves be available to any smart contact platform. Aion-1, Ethereum, ICON, other Aion-x chains, etc. The smart contract would have a life beyond any single blockchain.

This is a simple example, and it requires a serious change in how we think of tokens. At this time, we can rarely imagine a token’s identity as separate from the blockchain that houses it. But it is clear that this will change as interoperation becomes the norm.

The smart contracts themselves will begin to have more universal standards, allowing them to work beyond a single blockchain. This allows exchanges to recognize the same token regardless of the blockchain that happens to send the information. In other words, Coinbase could receive “Kitty #2”, the token, from information sent via Ethereum, Aion-1, ICON, etc, and will recognized “Kitty #2” as the same token even if it switches blockchains. In this case, Kitty #2, the token, lives on beyond its blockchain or origin.

Of course, there is more that can done with an internet of blockchains. Consider what the space looks like in the years ahead. Blockchain 3 networks will allow smart contract that can follow “if then” statements across blockchains, including across otherwise private enterprise chains. The potential here is beyond what we can really even imagine at this early stage, but I can give a simple example: we know blockchains are becoming key to certify supply chains. We know enterprises want to keep much of their supply information private to their enterprise. But if different enterprises set up smart contracts between their otherwise private “Spoke” supply chain networks, they can have trustless certification of supply movement between enterprises. And what if the Spoke chain wasn’t just to track physical supplies. Imagine partnering Aion-x chains for separate networks of energy grids, water grids, oil reserves, anything. Enterprises can keep private information on private Aion-x chains private, while setting up simple smart contracts to work with other private Aion-x chains in ways that minimize trust AND do it in a way that is seamless and standardized, thanks to a common compliant format.

The Aion Network was used in this example largely because Matthew Spoke, the project lead for Aion, does an excellent job explaining Blockchain 3.0, which largely inspired this write up. That said, the Aion Network is just one among a handful of exciting projects that are clearly aggressively moving toward this interoperating future. Already emerging as an alliance for standardization is Aion, Bancor, Enigma, ICON, Metaverse, SingularityNET, Wanchain, in an open collaboration. It will be interesting to see who else participates in this alliance. Keeping an eye on Cosmos, Polkadot, ARK, and of course any blockchain 2.0 developer community (such as Ethereum) will be important to watch as this future unfolds.

In the end, the internet of blockchains is as much about the blockchain as it is the selfish immortal token. Smart contracts will exist at the intersection of blockchains, often co-existing among blockchains, making the blockchain itself (at times) less of the centered than the smart contract. These token-centered views, or contract-centered views, are inevitable. But they are also needed now, to prepare, build, lift barriers, and bring about transformation.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Paying off my father's credit,"My father has accumulated debt on his credit cards from mostly grocery shopping while I was in college. He is self-employed, and works on commission. His business hasn't been doing so well the past 3-4 years as the money he makes from commission is low and infrequent. I started working last year, and got myself a raise at year's-end to $99,000. My monthly salary after taxes comes to $4,961.46. However, I have my own own loans to pay and I also pay for rent, gas, etc.



Necessities: 

Rent: $1,360

Gas: ~$30.00

Internet: $107.42

Phone: $89.90

Student Loan: $28,559.15, I've been paying the min. payment of $339.00

Student Loan 2: $1,500 - This used to be around ~$7,000, but I've brought it down to $1,500 as I have a hold in my school records until this is paid off. I was paying in installments of $100, but recently paid $3,300. I plan on finishing this soon, so that transcripts aren't with held if I'm looking for another job or plan on pursuing grad. school.

Groceries: ~$400.00


After all this is paid, with the exception of student loan 2 (not sure how much I should allocate here), I'm left with about $2,400. 


The rest I plan on spending it on my dad's credit debt, student loan 2, allowances to my parents, socializing, and whatnot.


My father's credit debt:

Credit card: Total, Min. payment, interest in % or $

Credit 1: $580.99, $17.00, 20.20% or $19.75

Credit 2: $2,927.90, $74.00, 18.90% or $45.44

Credit 3: $2,168.36, $64.00, 23.90% or $42.93

Credit 8: $2,242.00, $50.00, 29.99%

Credit 9: $17.00

Credit 10: $21.77

Total credit debt = $11,274.26


We've been paying the minimum payments for the above cards. It adds up to $448.77 per month.


What is the most effective way of paying this off? Which cards do I need to focus on?
I do plan on putting a good chunk of my tax returns on this debt, so I'm not sure how aggressive I should be about it either. I guess that will depend on how much I get back from

personalfinance,Extra Credit Report After Card Approval?,"I was recently approved for a new credit card, specifically one from U.S. Bank that (according to the letter) used the Trans Union FICO Risk Score Classic 04. I've got plenty of other cards but decided to look more thoroughly into the details they provided around my score.  

One thing I noticed is that the letter says:
&gt; Under federal law, have the right to obtain a copy of your credit report without charge for 60 days after you receive this notice.

Is that _in addition_ to the 3 free reports (1 per bureau) that you can normally get for free via www.annualcreditreport.com?

The letter directs me to http://www.transunions.com/myoptions where I can choose to get a report as a result of the FACT Act (the on that entitles you to a free one from each bureau every year) or the next one that says:
&gt; Within the last 60 days, you have received an adverse action notice based on information from your TransUnion credit report

Again, I did eventually get approved for the credit card (though was initially given the language that I had to wait 7-10 days), and under the ""Denial of credit"" option here it says:
&gt; I was denied credit or was notified of another unfavorable action affecting a credit application or account.

which does seem like something I would qualify for since I had a few different key factors that adversely affected my score accordingly to the letter, but I don't necessarily want to get the credit report if it replaces the one I get for free every year.",finance

Bitcoin,Tutorial: A More Secure Paper Wallet,"**tl;dr:** we're gonna make a passphrase secured QR code to access our private keys. This is how you can have the security of a backup paper wallet / cold storage but not worry too much about your codes being easily scannable and buy you time to move funds if your paper wallet is compromised.

First, let me explain why I use this method. Bitcoin and Ethereum are my primary holdings and I didn't like that the paper wallet options on MyEtherWallet came out as unencrypted. I wanted a way to easily scan in the private key in the event of a hard drive failure or to access my cold storage funds, but found that the default paper wallet left security to be desired. It's possible this functionality exists in other wallets I don't know about, but this is just how I have done it.

**Tools:**

1. Cryptocurrency Wallet (we'll use Electrum)

2. Computer with gpg (GNU PGP) and a way to make qrcodes. I'll be doing this tutorial with linux, but the tools exist in Windows as well.

3. Printer

**For Bitcoin:**

First, create a wallet with Electrum. When it asks you to copy the seed, copy it into a file, lets name it key.txt. For non HD wallets (not seed based, just private keys), you can. copy a private key into key.txt

[Electrum](https://wemovecoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/electrum7.png)

[Text Editor](https://i.imgur.com/9DRdxHx.png)

Next, navigate to the file in a terminal. The command we want to use is ""gpg -a -c key.txt"". The -a means we will be encrypting it into the ""ASCII-Armor"" format (plaintext) and the -c means it will use symmetric encryption (passphrase instead of PGP key). It will prompt for a password. Choose a good password with at least 7 or 8 characters.



This will create a file named ""key.txt.asc."" Inspect the file with your favorite text editor to make sure nothing weird happened. It should look something like this:

[Terminal](https://imgur.com/hY1PBkj.png)

We can test decrypting it by doing ""gpg -d key.txt.asc."" It will print out our original plaintext seed. Depending on your configuration it may or may not re-prompt for the passphrase (sometimes it saves recently used passphrases in a cache). Even if it doesn't reprompt for one, the application will still tell you if its protected with a passphrase.

[Pic](https://imgur.com/kTrzZJo.png)

Now we have an encrypted file. You could just print this text out and type it in word for word in the event you need to restore from paper backup but that is tedious and OCR sucks. So we're going to make this a QR code you can scan with your webcam or phone!

On my laptop I am using an application called qrencode. On Ubuntu, you should be able to do ""sudo apt-get install qrencode"". For Fedora or arch, search your respective package managers. For windows, I can't recommend one. There are many online ones but use at your own risk. http://utils.paranoiaworks.org/qrcodegenerator/ This one claims to be clientside *shrug*

Navigate to the .asc file we create in the above steps. The command we will use is ""qrencode -r key.txt.asc -o key.png"". This will create a QR code that contains the text of your encrypted file. Open the image with your favorite image viewer and try scanning it with your webcam. Compare it to the text file. If they match, you are ready to print!

[QR](https://imgur.com/U533VCu.png)

Insert your qrcode into MS Word or Libreoffice Writer and print that badboy! 

**For Ethereum:**

Its more or less the same process as above, except you save the private key from MyEtherWallet to key.txt instead of the seed.

personalfinance,Recently married couple in early 30’s trying to figure out our next steps financially,"We just eloped after 7 years together a few days ago (hooray!). But neither of us has savings and basically live paycheck to paycheck because of credit card debit. He’s been at his job almost 8 years and I just started in a new industry (low pay for our area) but together I think we make $83,000 before taxes? He pays into a 401k and our thought is to take out a loan from his 401k and pay off our maxed out cards (probably about $12k)

After the debit is gone we are looking at him doing a Roth IRA and me starting some kind of savings. We have one car between us, it’s paid off, we rent in a crappy neighborhood so it’s mostly cheap.

CryptoCurrency,Concern over new ICO's funding,"Have been looking to invest in a few ICO's lately, and decided to try one out that launched today. I won't mention the asset unless you ask because i'm not here to shill.

I threw some ETH at it and got my tokens confirmed and all is well. I then checked their receiving address to see how much they've gotten, and its pretty lousy.

This ICO isn't fluffed with ""BONUS TOKENS"" or ""SPECIAL OFFER"" bullshit. Its also only open 7 days and closes, no open-ended ICO bullshit either. These were all things that made it more attractive to me.  

Now that the ICO has been live for almost 12 hours, they've only raised about $3000 and it has me worried. If the asset was really all it's cracked up to be IMO, shouldn't it get a ton of funding out of the gate, or is this just how ICO's are these days? The use is innovative in an industry I can see lots of potential in and there were enough boxes checked for me to invest, so I can only hope others do as well. 

My worry is that they won't raise enough and just abandon the project. Do I have cause for alarm?

For anyone curious, the coin has to do with Adult entertainment.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Trying to get my finances back on , need advice","Hello PF, been a long time lurker on this subreddit and could use some solid advice. I invested in a foreign medical education, but wasn't able to enter into a  residency training program in the U.S. Hence I was stuck with a six figure debt without any means to pay it off. As I'm sure some of you may know, a doctor without a residency training program has very limited marketable skills, particularly a foreign one. I couldn't find any work related to my field, but was hell bent on trying to continue towards this career path, so I've been staying with family. As you could imagine, most employers weren't too happy hearing I may leave after a year. So I volunteered at a 501c3 non-profit organization, and my student loans, all of which are federal student loans at around 4.75-6.75%, and on a 10 year loan forgiveness program. Apparently they count $0 payments as qualifying payments towards this. A couple years down the road, still can't find a residency program, but finally found a relevant job in clinical research a few months ago. Except I'm not really considered a employee, I'm considered a 1099 contract worker without benefits. In addition, the business may not be in business soon due to a number of problems that are occurring. In addition, I currently am on medi-cal as my healthcare. Given the above situation, I have a few concerns. I understand that paying back loans quickly is the best investment, as it's a guaranteed return, but I'm hesitant in maxing out my payments given I'm currently on the loan forgiveness track still. Also I'm concerned about losing my health coverage/medi-cal when my contract paid work isn't stable yet. Also saving for a emergency fund/starting a Roth IRA/solo 401k. I maxxed out the IRA for 2017 and tempted to throw in the contribution for 2018 already, but might be better to invest in the solo/individual 401k for the deduction for 2017 before April. Currently making 25/hr on 1099-misc. Ideally the work situation will stabilize, then I'll be here for another 1-2 years to gain enough experience to improve my resume for a medical residency, or use the experience to enter the pharmaceutical industry for higher pay/benefits as a different career path.

personalfinance,"Broke and alone (only family is abusive mother). I'm an aspiring Software Developer, but I can't pay to continue college. What should I do?","**Where I am financially:**
I'm 24 years old. I live in New Jersey. I'm on SSD which is near 800$ / month, I'm renting a room at about 500$/month, barely getting by with help of food bank. I have less than 200$ in savings right now. I have no family besides an abusive mother who rarely supports me in anyway and a grandmother in a nursing home.

**Where I am with education:**
I have about 70 credits towards a degree, I was aiming for a Computer Science degree but I have no way to pay for college now. I also taught myself a lot about programming independently. My last real semester at college was in fall 2014. However, I did take 1 class at Rutgers last semester fall 2017 (Computer Architecture). I got an A in the class. I paid for that course with gift money from my 95 year old grandmother (about 2k). It was all my savings. Probably was not a wise decision. 

**How I got to this point:**
I lived with an abusive mother most of my life. When college started for me, I did well for about 2.5-3years. I took federal loans to pay for college. Then I got sick, and had to move back in with my abusive mother. Worsened depression followed because I was living with an abusive mother, and I felt stuck there and stayed there for too long. Once I got approved for SSD early this year, I was able to rent a room away from my abusive mother, but I'm struggling to get by.

**Why I can't get federal loans now:**
I could lose my SSD which is my lifeline, by applying for federal loans. I would also regain the debt of my previous loans which had been forgiven, but that would happen anyway if I start making substantial income. The loans amount to 16k. Additionally, when I left college because I became sick in 2014, I left during the semester past the point of withdrawal, so some classes turned to F's which ruined my GPA (which had been good before this point). According the financial aid office at Rutgers, I am also ineligible for aid because of my GPA. 

**How I tried to get a job:**
I must have applied to like 100 software positions around me using websites like Dice, both jobs and internships. My resume mainly makes use of my listed programming skills and my personal project experience, as I have no work experience or a degree. I was only called on to do 2 interviews from all those applications, both were for internship. One of the internships was unpaid for college credit (college credit that you still have to pay for). I did the interview anyway for experience, but essentially declined after that. The other internship is paid but it's only for the summer of 2018, and I'm still in the interview process so I may or may not get it.

**Ideas going forward:**
Rutgers Computer Science is overcrowded, so I couldn't even register for the courses I wanted to take this semester. I may be able to still register if I work for special permissions, but I don't see the point if I can't even find a way to pay for the courses. I wonder if I could scramble to get private loans (which I haven't looked at before) to pay for a few classes this semester, but I also wonder if that route is even worth it. The reality is... I taught myself more out of school than in school with programming, but I have zero luck applying for jobs with no degree on my resume.

**TL;DR**
My goal is to upgrade my living situation as soon as possible while still looking out for the long run. I am barely getting by how I am living right now. I am half way to a Computer Science degree but have no way to pay to continue college. I may be able to take out private loans if I explore that option but I don't know if it's worth it. I wonder if there is a different career in technology besides software developer that might get me started quicker. Thoughts and advice are appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,IRAs that you cannot contribute to yearly?,"I currently have two IRAs in my Credit Union that I want to contribute to but am not ""allowed to"" until they have matured every few years. They actually mature on the 3rd and 10th of this month and I need to do something about them. The interest rate on them is also pretty terrible at less than 1%. 

One is slightly above $3500 and the other is slightly below $3500.

Ive been meaning to do something with them once they came ""due"". I thought about putting them into my bank account now that Ive moved away from the Credit Union that only serves a small portion of the state I used to live in. Would it be better to transfer them into the same company that serves my 401k with my company?

personalfinance,"Recast my home loan, or refinance?","Hello /r/pf I am very curious right now as to what direction I should be taking here with this mortgage. My goal is to be free from the shackles of a mortgage.

personalfinance,"Need advice on student loan debt. I can pay it off, but not sure if I should.","Okay so I'll lay out my financial situation first:

I have a steady job, enlisted military. Military pays rent and utilities, so after taxes and everything else, I pocket about $2,400 per month or $28,800 per year. That's purely pocket money that goes towards groceries, TV, cell phone, etc.

Truck valued at $16,000 was paid for in cash.

I rent, so no home value.

In my savings I have $21,400.

Still one lingering credit card debt of about $5,800 *(just checked and seen it's 13.1% interest, which I'll probably just pay this off immediately now that I know this and should have known earlier)

No major monthly expenses except for my student loan. Currently I owe a little over $18,000 on the loan. Interest rate is 5.8%. It's a 20 year loan and I've only brought it down about $2,000 in the past few years. I've deferred it multiple times to save money on deployments and while I've taken other classes, blah blah blah. I make $144 payments per month, but about $80 of which is just interest. I've done the math and basically come to the conclusion that if I only make the minimum monthly payments on this loan, I'll have paid it off twice by the time I make my final payment. I'm not okay with that.

So given my circumstances, I need some advice on how to move forward. I want the debt gone but not really at the expense of all my savings at once. I can build it back up because my income in fairly flexible right now, but i'd rather not see it all go right out the door. I'm in a single household with a dog, but I'll be getting married towards the end of the summer this year. She'll be reliant on me for income at that time because she'll just be moving here from a foreign country. Either way, I need a plan on how to move forward. I want to start investing, as well as dumping a lot of my excess into an IRA that I just recently opened up, but I don't feel good about doing so until this debt is gone.

What do you guys think? Sorry if I left out any crucial info. Just ask and I'll tell you what you need to know. 

I should probably also mention my age. I just turned 27 in November.

personalfinance,Sell ESPP or hold immediately?,"Would love thoughts on this - I am currently enrolled in my employer's employee stock purchase plan, which allows me to set aside money each paycheck to buy their public shares at a discount at the end of the offering period. In total, this nets me ~2k in profit per year.

I am trying to decide holding to take capital gains versus selling immediately to take income tax. As someone in a high tax state, my marginal income tax rate for federal+local is ~40%, while capital gains is ~15%. 

For ESPPs, you have to hold the shares for 2+ years after the beginning of the offering period. Given the $2k in profit per year, this would mean ~$500 in annual tax savings (possibly more when considering the appreciation of the asset), but obviously would come at the risk of holding a significant amount of capital in one asset.

I REALLY enjoyed my holiday break being able to spend as much time with my son as possible and am now starting to think about FI. 

I'm dreading going back to work not because I don't enjoy it but mainly because I'm a work-a-holic and know that I will be back on a  50-60hr week schedule which will take time away from the family.  I've never left California and I know living here will make FI extremely difficult. 

Biggest question I have is whether or not to pay off all my debt and start re-building all my savings.  The logical side is telling me it's better to invest due to the low interest rate but nothing sure beats having the feeling of being debt free.  Where should I start with regards to FI if I'm only starting to think about it now?

We try and front-load/max out our 401Ks so we live pretty frugally in the first half of the year.

CryptoCurrency,I'm beginning to see a trend,"I don't mean this to be a bash against any one coin or project.  I'm not an expert in any of this.  But I am a person who tries to look at things from different angles, literal, psychological, emotional,  etc.  I tend to notice habits, trends, motivating factors, shifts in momentum and unseemly practices. (I should have been a detective)
I have been both a hodler and a day trader.  I like to make money as much as the next person.
I've noticed what seems to be a trend, and it's bothering me.  Here's what it is...

A group creates a crypto coin.  It goes through various phases of growth.   Development tends to take a lot longer than people expect.  Ideas don't become successful realities in a few weeks or months.  The coin price, after several enticing rumours, expectations and outright pumps and dumps, finally falls way down or loses new investment interest.  So the development team, or a newly formed one (from some members of a previous unsuccessful project) simply creates a new coin, or two or three.  These coins are forks, ""child"" coins, incentive coins or side chains, or whatever terminology they choose to use.  Money pours into the new coin.  New carrots are dangled in front of an eager community of mostly new investors.  Time passes, and still not much in real world use is developed for the coins.  It becomes a pissing contest to say ""Look! Our coin is better than their coin!""   
The money keeps pouring in.
I don't see the technology moving forward very quickly.  I realize Rome wasn't built in a day.  I also understand that a legal means of creating money out of thin air can be one very tempting path of seduction.  Maybe I'm just cynical and untrusting.  But I don't like the trend I'm seeing for two reasons.
1. If the product being created doesn't find legitimate long term value, the market will eventually render it worthless.  
2.  If the Feds decide that some of these coins are being created for no other reason than to print free money, they are likely to move against this entire crypto economy with massive force.
I don't want either of those things to happen.  In my mind it's a worrisome trend.  That's all I'm saying.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,$500 NetSpend Disaster.,"My mom bought one of their cards to send me 500 dollars last year because she didn't want to send cash in the mail, and couldn't put it in my bank account because of my dad being a co-owner, family issues and so on. She also doesn't have a way to deposit her cash from waitressing into her bank because she's a vet and the nearest Navy Federal is a state away, so she needed a prepaid card to send.

 I was 17, and when I tried to activate it, they said I have to be 18. I asked if my mom can activate it instead, and they wanted me to send them copies of birth certificate and social security cards in order to have the owner changed. Which I refuse to do. 

So I decide to just wait it out until I turn 18 and activate the card then. I tried now that I'm 18 and they want copies of my driver's license and social security card. Which I refuse to do. So I ask to just receive a check for the amount, guy says they will send it. No check yet. It's been three weeks. I don't know where to go from here. I'm scared if I call again, they will say that they already sent the check out and won't do so again.

We're both pretty poor and this is a huge hit for us. I feel lost, confused, and anxious to the point of losing sleep and nervous dreams knowing it's my fault that I made decisions thinking I'd have access to that 500 dollars after I turned 18.

Bitcoin,Wallet history gone - where are my coins ?! Please help!,"Hi guys,

I need some help here. My wallet history is suddenly completely gone.
No idea if this has anything to do with this problem, but, last week i received a payment that had been sent with very low fee.
I waited many days until it finally confirmed. Its this transaction:
1fd6feca1177565cb48b13bc9b71489c02178283d62c49742460508a039e7701 - its the newest/latest one in the history.

A couple days later i wanted todo a payment so opened up elelctrum (this is all in tails btW). Now my history suddenly only shows one single transaction - the very first one I did back when i created this wallet and sent some btc to it. Thats this transaction:

45a8f939c374241f123698ebb074c3a41839c121424dcefd39f37f706451bc35

 In total, i did 71 transactions with this wallet, including the mentioned first and last one.

OK so i thought to just restore / re-create the wallet from my seed.
I did that, and, a bit later, all transactions showed up again in this new wallet. I was reliefed, but, not for a long time.
Shortly after - i think it was on the next day - I again attempted to do that transaction - from my newly created wallet of course.
However, now this new wallet ALSO suddenly only showes that very first transaction i had mentioned above, but nothing more.
I shold also add: I cannot do a payment at all. When i try, the 'broadcasting transaction' thing pops up, then hangs for a couple seconds, then i get ; ""ERROR Server does not respond"" or ""No answer from server"". My wallet shows the green connected light, btw!!

So i thought: OK, i send these BTC from the clone of my wallet on windows. However, ever since then, my electrum on windows is suddenly unable to connect to the bitcoin network (which used to work no problem before). Tried different connection settings, selected some servers manualy, etc... but, no luck. No connection, red light. No error.

So my wallet on windows still shows all those 71 transactions since it obviously can't sync without connection. That very last / the newest transaction even still shows as unconfirmed, since i never had my windows electrum open in those few days since it had confirmed (which i saw in electrum on tails).

Now just before i tried another restore from seed. And now this time, ALL transactions are gone, also that very first one i mentioned above which before was the only one still showing up.

I have no idea what todo now. I don't understand enough how BTC works to have any idea. I'm just worried that my coins are gone!:(

If its of any use that i post my Master Public Key then let me know. I wasn't 100% sure if this may be some sort of security risk, hence i left it out for now...

I would be super greatful if anyone could help me here, am slightly desperate at the moment :(
Thanks alot in advance!!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Need advice for emergency funds,"Hey everyone!

personalfinance,Debt consolidation advice?,"Hello r/personalfinance. Long time reader, first time poster, etc. Here are the broad strokes of our current situation:

1. Husband and wife both employed, no excessive debt, decent savings.
2. Wife loses job, and its almost a year before she can find a new one. 
3. In that time we burned through our savings buffer and accumulated a fair amount of credit card debt. Her new job doesn't pay so well that we can make serious progress towards paying down most of those debts at their current interest rates. My formerly great credit has taken a serious nosedive.

I'm considering debt consolidation, but I've never used it before and I'm not sure where to start or who to trust. I get offers in the mail constantly but for some crazy reason I feel like any group that disguises their pitch as an urgent IRS letter or a returned check until you open it isn't entirely above board and probably doesn't have my best interests at heart. 

My questions are these:

1. Does debt consolidation seem like the best route for me? I've got about $15k in card debt built up while we lived off those. Nothing insurmountable but enough to cause problems. Making payments on all of them as they stand now will keep me treading water and breaking even every month, no chance to rebuild savings. 
2. If it is, how do I get started? Is there a particularly reputable company to use?
3. If it isn't, what do I do? 

I know my credit rating will take a hit from consolidation but it's already terrible anyway. I know bankruptcy is an option but that seems like an excessive overcorrection. Does anyone have advice? 

Much appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,100K in Student Loans - Is there an end in sight?,"Hey Guys,

I have performed my diligence in reading the Wikis here on PF, but remain at my wits end. 

To be clear, I am writing this in an effort to help my girlfriend who despite maintaining a well paying job with a modest lifestyle remains utterly buried in her loan debt with no end in sight. She is 26 and has essentially come to terms with dying with this debt.

-----

**Key points:**

* Total debt around $110,000. 
* Her entire education was funded by a $100,00 private loan and $20,000 federal loan. 
* She attended the now defunct [Art Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_Institutes).
* Both loans were co-signed by a successful but now retired Uncle in her family.
_____

* Her monthly income after taxes around $2,300.
* She has no outside assistance in repaying the loans.
* To date, she has scarcely made a dent in her principle balance.
* With no loans in deferment, she owes around $1,500 monthly.
* She has been paying around $550 monthly with one loan being deferred.
* We split all expenses. Rent is approximately $450 each, with utilities (cellphone, internet, gas, electric) totaling around another $150 each per month.
* We lead a modest lifestyle and budget, but she has never been able to save money in her adult life due to this debt.
* She has no other debts whatsoever and no credit cards.
* I have minor CC debt but no loans.
____

***Long story short:*** Is this it? Is she simply doomed to owe some 25 - 50% of her income for the rest her life? Are we left waiting for a windfall or a tremendous promotion? She is utilizing her degree at a reputable company in her field (design) but would not be in the income range to deal with this kind of debt for at least another decade of experience. 

She would love to take her Uncle off the loans but does not have the credit or ability to pay the full amount each month.

We really do not know where to turn for all this.

Thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Did we accidentally save too much for retirement? What should we do now?,"I'm now 43 years old, married, with one infant daughter. When I was in my mid-late 20s, I had a reasonably high-paying job at a credit card company called Providian Financial. Regulators decided they weren't happy with some of PVN's policies, and PVN stock dipped to around ~$2/share. I bought a bunch, both in my brokerage account and in my 401k/IRA. A few years later, Washington Mutual bought out Providian for $18/share. 

Because I now had all of my eggs in one basket, I sold all the WaMu stock in my retirement accounts and bought Amazon, Google and index funds. However, I didn't want to pay capital gains taxes on my brokerage shares, so I left all of that as WaMu stock. It turned out WaMu was not quite too big to fail, it failed, and the $300k of WaMu in my brokerage account went away.

Which brings us to today: my wife and I have about $1.1mm in retirement accounts, about $300k in home equity for a condo valued at $660k, $15k in an emergency account, and $4k in a checking account. The bulk of our net worth is inaccessible. Our debt is student loans, mortgage, and car payment, all at favorable interest rates. We're saving about 10% of our combined 190k salary in retirement plans, but have relatively little day-to-day spending money. (Daycare in our area is $3000/mo, we have a mortgage payment, et cetera) We'd like to buy a bigger house so my daughter can have her own room, but the housing market here (Boston) is insane and we're not making much progress in saving toward a downpayment big enough to make mortgage payments manageable. We'd like to save for our daughter's college fund, too.

The question is this: what's the prudent thing to do, now? Usually, I'd beg/borrow/steal enough to max out 2017/2018 IRA contributions for both my wife and me. But is that still the right answer, given our circumstances?

Thanks for any wisdom!",finance
personalfinance,Does extending the term on a mortgae involve a full refinance?,"Refinanced last year to lower the interest rate (from 5% to 3.25%).  During the refinance I moved to a 15 year fixed (from a 30 yr).  A few changes at work have left me with a little less flexibility than I would like and I'm considering extending the loan back to 30 year.  I know this means more interest over the long run, but I feel that having more cash on hand gives me more security.  I have a stable job and no plans to move or relocate.

I'm sure the mortgage company (Mr Cooper) would love for me to extend, but does it involve a full refinance?

personalfinance,Retirement savings plan: is the math correct?,"I'm using this hypothetical situation to help me understand the math behind retirement savings planning. My main concerns are:

1) Am I approaching this correctly?

2) Is my math correct?

&amp;nbsp;

**Hypothetical scenario:**

* Single person
* Age 35
* Retire in 30 years
* No current retirement savings
* $40,000 in annual expenses at retirement (today's value)
* $14,400 in annual Social Security income (today's value)
* Planning to live for 25 years after retirement

&amp;nbsp;

After factoring in Social Security benefits, this person would still need $25,600 in post-tax income annually.

`40,000 - 14,400 = $25,600`

&amp;nbsp;

Using present-day income tax-rates (21.45% combined for NY State and Federal) this person would need $32,700 in pre-tax income annually.

`32,700 - (32,700 x 0.2145) = $25,686`

&amp;nbsp;

Assuming annual inflation of 3% for the next 30 years then this pre-tax income figure becomes $79,371 at retirement age.

`32,700 x 1.03^30 = $79,371`

&amp;nbsp;

According to this [savings withdrawal calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/savings-withdrawal-calculator-tool.aspx), ***this person would need $1,300,000 of savings in 30 years to safely withdraw $79,370 for 25 years*** (with a 4% return on remaining savings).

&amp;nbsp;

According to this [return-on-investment calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/roi-calculator.aspx), ***to reach $1,300,000 savings this person would need to save $8,800 annually for 30 years*** at an average return rate of 9%.

personalfinance,Car has 4 months left on my lease. I want to buy it. What can I expect?,"After a road trip over the holidays, I need to take my car to the dealership for some very minor work.  The car is a 2015 Honda Fit with ~9,500 miles on it.  I have 4 months left on my lease and I have already gotten a few messages left on my phone from Honda trying to see what I want to do with the car.  I am fully intending to purchase the vehicle once my lease expires, but I haven't gotten a loan yet.  I have excellent credit and don't anticipate any problem getting financing.  I live in CA.

Some quick questions:

1) What is an interest rate I can expect on this type of loan?  My wife's car, which we bought new from the dealership, has something like a 0.1% rate.  For lease buyout/used car loans, I'm seeing 2-4% interest rates online.  Is 2-4% reasonable?

2) If the dealership offers to finance the purchase for a fairly low rate should I just take them up on it?

3) Should I get pre-approved for a lease buyout loan now before going to the dealership and/or before speaking with one of their sales staff?  My local credit union offers 2% for ""used car loans"".  I'm not sure if that is the same as a lease buyout loan, but that seems to be the lowest I have identified from my cursory look around the internet.  The only downside I can see is that this will incur additional pulls on my credit history.

4) Should I call Honda's financing department before taking my car to the dealership?  Will I get different answers or a better deal if I just deal with their financing department separately from a dealership?

stocks,Macro Outlook: Huge Q1 2018 Update,"Barring some supply-side shock to the economy, it’s likely that the business cycle in the US persists for at least another two years. Low interest rates and quantitative easing (QE) in the EU combined with improving private consumption is likely to help support the economy through the end of the decade.

As a whole, most developed economies are working around their expected capacities, recession risks are low, and central banks are either in full ZIRP/QE mode (ECB, BOJ) or just removing liquidity from the system and raising short-term borrowing rates (Fed).

The Phillips curve relationship that dictated past economic cycles has weakened as technology and globalization impact labor markets. Typically, as labor scarcity increases, workers can bargain for higher wages, with the extra wage costs passed off by corporations as higher prices, inducing inflation (i.e., monetary demand in excess of product and service output).

personalfinance,Temporarily working in US. Want to save for a downpayment on a home in Canada in ~2 years. Smart ways to play the dollar + save?,"I'm Canadian working full-time in the USA (MA) for the next ~2 years. I expect that, between my spouse and I, we will be able to save &gt;$50,000 USD per year.

Our goal is to save as much money and in ~2 years, have as much possible converted to CAD to put a downpayment on a home in Canada. 

I am wondering two things:
1) Best short-term investment of our savings in US
2) Best strategy to transfer money cross-border, keeping in mind fluctuating dollar value, conversion rates from banks, tax implications.

I've done some research on this and my current proposed strategy is to:
1) Open an Ally bank online savings account for all of our savings over time. Seems like one of the better interest rates for short-term investment, FDIC insured, easy to use.

As per: https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/where-to-put-short-term-savings/

2) Keep all savings in Ally bank account until I am ready to leave the USA. I've been advised by a tax accountant to keep everything in the US for tax purposes, although I'm still a bit mystified by the whole tax situation for Canadians working on a visa in the US with potential savings in both countries.

As I start to finalize when I'm leaving, I can begin monitoring and reading up on near-term USD/CAD predictions. When I'm comfortable with the exchange rate, I can transfer my USD to CAD using RBC (seems like one of the better exchange rates from the big Canadian banks, although there may be other safe, cheap options...).

I am sure there are smarter ways to do this. I'd greatly appreciate any thoughts/feedback/suggestions!",finance

personalfinance,What to do with savings bonds? [US],"I just received some savings bonds from my grandmother that she bought for me when I was a baby/very young. I know absolutely nothing about saving/financing/etc. despite my brother trying and trying to explain to me how stuff works. 

My question is this: would it be better for me to hold on to the bonds until they stop collecting interest to get as much as possible from them, or would it be better to cash them now and put them in a savings account and let them get that interest?

Relevant info: all together the bonds are worth $200 before interest. They would stop collecting interest in approximately 9-12 years IIRC off the top of my head. As far as I can tell they have a varying interest rate. If I were to cash them now they would only total about $204. The savings account I would be putting them in has a current APY of 1.0%. I don't know if that's a fixed rate or not, as I said I unfortunately do not understand how this type of stuff works. 

If I do cash them now I intend to put them into a savings account I'm using to save up for a very expensive trip. My best guess is that they would be in the savings account for at least a few years before actually being used.

I’m taking out a HELOC to convert my basement into an apartment I intend on renting out. Including my mortgage, it will be the only debt I have. My question is: To pay off the HELOC sooner, because it will be 6% interest or more, is there an argument for Traditional vs Roth 401(k) contributions? Let’s set aside the conventional wisdom that an individual shouldn’t invest if they have debt with an interest rate above x%.

My thought is, if I do Traditional, I’ll have more money to throw at the debt because I’m paying fewer taxes. When it’s paid off I might switch to Roth at that point. Am I thinking about this correctly?",finance

investing,The Future of the Economy Isn't Lookin Great,"Recently I stumbled upon this article: https://www.sprottmoney.com/Blog/for-clues-on-the-economy-follow-the-money-dave-kranzler.html

Propaganda is out there stating the US economy is booming and the future is bright, but this author shows a FRED chart indicating the amount of loans being given out by institutions is stagnating. This happened both in 2001 and in 2008 and is happening now. 

Is this an adequate indicator of a potential market collapse? I don't know. There are other indicators such as the unemployment rate, the schiller P/E, the delusion that ""this time it's different,"" as mentioned in the article, the flattening of the yield curve, the rejection of value investing, and others that come up in my radar as clear warning signs.  

So if I'm bearish on stocks what is an adequate hedge against a downturn? Bonds yields are minuscule so that's a no go. Some people are holding cash, but that seems risky to me. As the price of healthcare, higher education, assets and other ""luxury"" goods skyrocket, you can sleep safely at night knowing there is not enough inflation according to the FED. I think the dollar is going to deflate heavily in the coming years, due to the increasing federal deficit, the tax bill effectively giving consumers and businesses a raise, and the maintenance of loose monetary policy. All these factors, which have consequences and are tools for stimulating the economy when it's depressed, are being used at a time of economic prosperity. 

If bonds are yielding nothing, stocks are at dangerously high levels, and the US dollar is likely going to deflate (and it already is relative to other currencies), where's the safest spot for your wealth? Maybe TIPs? I don't really have the answers but at least now I understand why all these speculators are jumping into bitcoin. For now though, the majority of my portfolio is still in the market.",finance
Bitcoin,What is the current use case for Bitcoin?,"I have been lightly interested in Bitcoin since 2015. It feels like the use case of Bitcoin has shifted since I originally got into it. What do each of you personally use Bitcoin for to maximize the utility of the block chain technology? I got into it thinking it was a currency that could replace the USD and prevent government intervention from organizations like the FED.  At the current value, current transaction cost etc it feels like the only remaining utility of Bitcoin is as a highly volatile store of value. 

Is there a road map that outlines future utility that will be added other than a volatile store of value? 

I have used bitcoin for purchases in the past when the value and transaction fees were low and loved using it. 

I know that the lightning network is supposed to help lower fees and speed up transactions but if the value continues to skyrocket to $50,000 or above will the lightning network be enough to add real utility? 

Is the goal still for Bitcoin to be a currency? Or has the goal changed?

personalfinance,How to pay off existing student loans while enrolled in PSLF and grad school plans in the works for this year?,"Hello all,

**Background:** I am in somewhat of a predicament and would like some feedback on how to handle my loan situation. I am currently a public school teacher in California making $55,000. I graduated in May 2013 and am still in the process of paying off my student loans. I have a little under $31,000 left in federal loans paying anywhere between 4% - 6.8% in interest (serviced by FedLoan Servicing). I was in grace period in 2013 and for 2015, when I enrolled in a teaching credential program. I applied for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program in 2017 and will become eligible for loan forgiveness on 1/5/2027. 

My parents have previously been making the minimum payment of $450 because (1) I originally planned on going to grad school and continue working in public service and (2) my previous paychecks were going towards rent and personal expenses. Originally, the plan was for my parents to pay my loans completely because that was their lifetime promise to me but at the rate they are paying, I won’t be debt free for another 7 years. Plus, I’m finally in a position to start making contributions and I’d like them to retire as soon as possible. Recently (as in the past couple of years) I have become increasingly interested in working in the private sector and would not like to be handcuffed by the PSLF. As of now, I am preparing to go to grad school for my masters and if I get in and receive no financial assistance, I’d have to take out an additional $50,000 in loans to pay for tuition alone. The median salary after graduation is $70,000 so I’m not overly concerned about my job prospects after graduation (and would not like to debate whether or not I should go to grad school). 

**Predicament:** What I would like some feedback on is on how aggressively I should pay back my existing loans and/or if I should deviate from the original trajectory of paying only the minimum. Unbury.me predicted I could be debt free in 3 years if I paid back my loans with any income I have leftover following the avalanche method. However, this would leave me with very little savings, which I might have to rely on to pay for expenses while in grad school. Therefore, I have debated working towards paying off my unsubsidized loans ($13,000) first, which will allow me to contribute a little more towards my savings. 


My current budget looks like this:

* Monthly Income: $3200
* Home Expenses: $1200 (rent + utilities)
* IRA contribution: $250
* Savings: $300 (I have a small rainy day fund to cover my living expenses for a month but I’d like to grow my emergency fund)
* Loan payments: $1050 ($450 from my parents, an additional $600 from me)
* Transportation, Living, and Discretionary Expenses: ~$800

Thanks in advance for the responses. I want to make sure I utilize the most efficient means of paying back these loans while building my savings in case I receive no financial assistance for grad school and to take at least one trip this year (if that's even possible).",finance
CryptoCurrency,Salt Model Explained,"I hope this thread is useful for those who want to put into perspective the arbitrage model and conclude that the Salt model is really good in the short/mid-term.


**Short-conclusion: IF THE ARBITRAGE IS TRUE, THE CURRENT MKT PRICE IS NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR THE SALT MODEL SO THAT WILL FORCE THE PRICE TO GO UP SO:**

**a)	BUY SALT IF YOU WANT A SHORT TERM PROFIT**

**b)	HOLD AND DON’T BE STUPID TO SELL AT THIS POINT.**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all let’s assume the simplest case (take this as an example). For simplicity let’s assume the interest rate is 0%.

Client Perspective:

1)	Take a loan of 27.5 USD 

2)	Receive the FIAT and buy 1 Salt at mkt price for 12.50 USD

3)	Go to an exchange, buy 1 Salt for 12.50 USD and transfer it to the platform.

4)	Pay your loan with Salt and keep the 15.00USD remaining as profit

Lender Perspective:

1)	Lend 27.5 USD

2)	Receive 1 Salt back

3)	If you are in need of liquidity, sell 1 Salt at the exchange and assume a 15.00 loss. 

4)	We assume that the lender is wealthy enough so that he assumes the 15.00 USD as operational cost (thus he holds the Salt token expecting for the value to increase in the future).

Assumptions: 

1)	Salt lenders are also whales that are familiar with the crypto world, so they aren’t dumb enough to sell at the current MKT price.

**2)	Some of the Lenders are related to Salt as founders/workers/advisors**

**3)	As the Salt team holds a huge supply of Salt tokens their best interest is to drive the price higher.**

4)	Loan/demand growth rate 10% for each timeframe.


Facts (from coinmarketcap and from other reddit posts):

1)	Total Supply = 120,000,000 Salts [source!](https://imgur.com/a/GW6mt) 

2)	Retail Supply = 66,000,000 Salts

3)	Mkt Supply= 54,000,000 Salts

4)	Pending loans= $300,000,000 USD [source!](https://imgur.com/a/NVabE) 

5)	Funded loans= $7,000,000 USD

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So with this data let’s make a projection [source!](https://imgur.com/a/8mN6V) :

With the current pending loans at $300M USD and the funded loans at $7M USD let’s assume that only 50% of the FIAT is arbed, so for someone to pay $3.5M USD with SALT they should need 3,500,000/12.50=284,000 SALTS, which are returned to the Retailer, reducing the market supply. The total operational cost for the lender is 284,000*(Retail Price- Mkt Price)=$4.2M USD.

Let’s assume as an extreme case that the price continues to be at 12USD and that the loan demand grows by 10% and that the loan processing time also is improved so now we have $9M USD funded loans, thus increasing the operational cost to $5.5M USD.

When the people notice the arbitrage then the operational cost for Salt will go higher. Also, the team stated that by the end of January they will have funded $80M in loans, so, if the price continues to be $12.50 the operational cost for that (assuming only the 50% is arbed):

**40M USD * (27.5-12-5)= $600M USD which is UNSUSTAINABLE (the current mktcap of salt right now).**

The only way for this to be sustainable is that the spread between the mkt price and the retail price were low.


Also keep in mind that:

**If the platform don’t process the loans fast enough Salt will lose momentum and as crypto is a sentiment-driven market then the price will surely tank. Salt lenders and founders don’t want this to happen.**

Whales are now accumulating cheap SALT but for the token to be successful the product has to be used by the average Joe so it’s a matter of time for it to go up!",cryptocurrency

My next goal would be to pay off the Jeep. Even though it has a lower interest rate than some of my student loans, If I pay it down faster I will have an Asset that I could potentially sell to help pay off (some) loans (not that I would ever sell my baby). I also see student loans as more of an investment (UnderGrad and Masters in Engineering and Management with Minor in Project Management has lead to a secure job in a great industry) as opposed to the jeep which I purchased two years ago due to 1/2 whim and 1/2 necessity. 

So I'm really just looking for your advice. I had a very expensive summer/Fall (both due to bad timing of a few emergencies and a few indulgences) and I've gotten my spending under control since Thanksgiving. I know I could always do better.

Recently my alma mater contacted me saying that I was owed a new check and is being resent. So, in short, a ""found"" $5k.

I have two loans:
1 -my federal stafford loan ~$40k left, currently I must pay $233 a month. This seems low, but I am on an income based repayment plan. 

2- my car loan. $10k left, paying $255 a month. 2015 minivan with 50,000 miles.

Generally speaking, which is better to pay down? Knock down the ever daunting/always there student loan; or $5k (half) of the car loan and thus getting out of they one twice as fast and then focusing on student loan?",finance
btc,Happy Birthday Bitcoin Cash!,"&gt; The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.
&gt; 
&gt; Alistair Darling has been forced to consider a second bailout for banks as the lending drought worsens.
&gt; 
&gt; The Chancellor will decide within weeks whether to pump billions more into the economy as evidence mounts that the £37 billion part-nationalisation last year has failed to keep credit flowing. Options include cash injections, offering banks cheaper state guarantees to raise money privately or buying up “toxic assets”, The Times has learnt.
&gt; 
&gt; The Bank of England revealed yesterday that, despite intense pressure, the banks curbed lending in the final quarter of last year and plan even tighter restrictions in the coming months. Its findings will alarm the Treasury.
&gt; 
&gt; The Bank is expected to take yet more aggressive action this week by cutting the base rate from its current level of 2 per cent. Doing so would reduce the cost of borrowing but have little effect on the availability of loans.
&gt; 
&gt; Whitehall sources said that ministers planned to “keep the banks on the boil” but accepted that they need more help to restore lending levels. Formally, the Treasury plans to focus on state-backed gurantees to encourage private finance, but a number of interventions are on the table, including further injections of taxpayers’ cash.
&gt; 
&gt; Under one option, a “bad bank” would be created to dispose of bad debts. The Treasury would take bad loans off the hands of troubled banks, perhaps swapping them for government bonds. The toxic assets, blamed for poisoning the financial system, would be parked in a state vehicle or “bad bank” that would manage them and attempt to dispose of them while “detoxifying” the main-stream banking system.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea would mirror the initial proposal by Henry Paulson, the US Treasury Secretary, to underpin the American banking system by buying up toxic assets. The idea was abandoned, ironically, when Mr Paulson decided to follow Britain’s plan of injecting cash directly into troubled banks.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Darling, Gordon Brown and Lord Mandelson, the Business Secretary, are expected to take the final decision on what extra help to give the banks by the end of the month.
&gt; 
&gt; The banks have taken much of the heat for the economy’s woes. But ministers are said increasingly to accept that attacking the banks will not by itself transform a situation that is jeopardising Britain’s economic prospects.
&gt; 
&gt; Insiders point out that Mr Darling’s criticism of mortgage lenders has softened in recent weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; After the Bank of England’s radical cuts in interest rates over the past two months, the focus at the Treasury has shifted away from mortgage lending to the pressure being put on businesses by the scarcity of loans, which is emerging as the bigger economic danger.
&gt; 
&gt; Richard Lambert, the Director-General of the CBI, said yesterday: “The Government is going to have to do more to restore credit flows across the economy.”
&gt; 
&gt; He said that the car industry was especially vulnerable: “Without access to credit or loan guarantees on commercial terms, this vital part of the economy will incur lasting damage.”
&gt; 
&gt; The scale of the lending drought was highlighted as separate Bank figures showed that the number of new home loans approved plunged to a record low in November. Only 27,000 mortgages for house purchase were approved by banks and building societies, down from a revised 31,000 in October. It is the lowest level since the Bank began collecting data in 1999. The Bank’s quarterly credit conditions survey showed that banks restricted access to loans of all kinds by companies and consumers in the past quarter, and that they plan to tighten the screws more in this quarter.
&gt; 
&gt; Halifax reported that the price of the average house fell by more than £100 a day last year. Its quarterly figures showed that the average house ended the year down in price by £37,178, or 16.2 per cent.
&gt; 
&gt; PRESSING THEIR POINT
&gt; 
&gt; “The single most pressing challenge to economic policy is to get the banking system to get lending in any normal sense”Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, Nov 26
&gt; 
&gt; “They are close to cutting off their noses to spite their faces”
&gt; Lord Mandelson, Business Secretary, accuses the banks of being too conservative, Nov 30
&gt; 
&gt; “The banks have to understand that we have put substantial sums of public money in to support them. They, in turn, need to play their part”
&gt; Alistair Darling, Dec 10
&gt; 
&gt; “Quite clearly a lot more needs to be done”

CryptoCurrency,Bankera ICO,"Hello everyone,

as I believe that 2018 will bring further adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially with emphasis on banking and decentralized exchanges after NGC and DIM, I would like to point to the Bankera ICO. Bankera is the ICO of the spectrocoin payment and exchange platform. Spectrocoin works really well, so we have an ICO building upon an existing product and services. The roadmap for 2018 and 2019 is ambitious and starting of an already running platform puts Bankera in a good position to succeed in my opion.

If you like please do further research into this ICO and let me know, what you think.

https://bankera.com/?ref=3156697089

The current price is 0.018 Euro or roughly 0.022USD.

A downside might be the high token amount of 2 Billion. However, you do the math if this thing makes it to a marketcap of 200million the token would be worth 0.1USD a 5x on a current investment. A total marketcap of 650Billion in crypto might make this possible.

This is a snipped from their site: 

Vision

Bankera is building a digital bank to last for the blockchain era. As a traditional bank, Bankera's services fit into three groups:

Payments including payment accounts with personal IBAN, debit cards, interbank foreign exchange rates and payment processing. All services will support both traditional fiat currencies as well as cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, DASH, NEM, ERC20 compliant tokens and others. In the long term, Bankera will implement innovative solutions such as gross-domestic-product (GDP) linked currencies and the use of exchange traded funds as a substitute for money.

Loans and deposits will be a key competitive edge as well as core service of Bankera. Current deposits will receive interest just as savings do. All Bankera clients will be able to benefit from higher interest rates due to proprietary information about borrowers' cash flow, as most loans will be given to business clients who use the payment processing solution.

Investments will consist of low-cost investment products such as exchange traded funds (ETFs), crypto-funds (a portfolio of various cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens) as well as roboadvisory solutions for wealth management. Eventually, Bankera will offer investment banking services including financing corporate strategies of our business clients.

A serious NGC, DIM, SALT, PAY and MCO-Competitor. What's your take on Bankera?

financialindependence,Pay Off Mortgage OR Pursue Investing Aggressively?,"Hi everyone,

My husband and I are new to the FI community! We are diving into the journey of becoming FI and are hoping for some advice in terms of our next steps. My husband and I have lots of goals:

(1) purchase a second home (around $1M) and use the first home as income property,

(2) be FI (no determined time YET...), and

(3) finance a yearlong round-the-world trip (est. $60k for both of us) by 2028.

Questions: Is it better to pay off our mortgage first OR work towards being FI? Which method will achieve our goals more efficiently?
Contextual Information:

- My husband (28 YO) and I (27 YO) are both teachers in a HCOL area. He makes about $66k and I make $75k, both gross.
We have zero debt, with the exception of our mortgage (described below).

- We purchased our first home last year. Fortunately, we were able to make the down payment without PMI, so our mortgage comes out to $2000/month. /EDIT: I failed to mention that our interest rate is 3.75% for a 30-year fixed. 

- We rent out 2 of the rooms in our house, so the rental income pays for the mortgage, and my husband and I double it to pay down the principal (extra $2000/month). Property taxes come out to about $8000/year. In 2017, we paid $70k in principal and we have about $350k remaining on the mortgage. Market value for our house has estimated to have gone up $100k since we purchased it.

ASSETS:

- Roth IRA: $50k

- Teachers Pension: $23k

- Individual Cash &amp; MM: $5k

- 457(B): $12k

- Cash in Savings: $37k

My husband and I do not know anything about investing money or where to put our money to make the money work for us...
Is it better for us to pay off our mortgage or to pursue investing aggressively? 

So whatever advice/recommendations you all have would be really appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,[US] Salary negotiation for Federal Job in DC.,"Hello all,

**Background and where I currently am**

Currently working in a pretty awesome job, which, from my view:

* + 21 paid days a year that roll over to a maximum of 50 days per year.
* + 6%/9% 401k matching.
* + Free (yes, as in beer) tuition. Already completed my Masters with this, and going back for an MBA. 
* - We're paid about 10% less than market value for my position and skillset. 
* ? I believe i'm next in line for an assistant management position which should carry between a 15%-25% pay bump with it, but i haven't heard any movement on this front and it's anything from a sure bet.

Additionally, we're I'm located historically has low home prices, although this is mostly negated by living in the city center (on the plus side, i don't have any commute by car this way).
It's a pretty sweet setup, but I'm sensing stagnation with my current position and the work we're doing, and I'm certainty underemployed for my skillset. I haven't gotten a super great vibe from our management about what future work we'll have, but 2 years ago I was one of the lucky few who was spared during a round of lay offs, so they must be impressed enough with my work to keep me around.

**The Problem**

I've recently been in touch with a recruiter at the US Department of Health and Human Services in DC, and apparently impressed them enough to get a job offer. Originally, I had hoped to use this to leverage my current position to receive a pay bump, but the more I learn about the job the more interested I am in it. However, it's obviously in DC, which would mean both relocation (which they'd pay for) as well as a higher cost of living, which from what I've calculated is going to effectively be between 35%-45% higher. The rub is that they've offered me basically the same salary I have right now. Obviously, taking the offer as it stands at the moment would result in a *effective pay decrease*. I know federal positions are tied to the GS pay scale and i'm not sure if they even can increase my offer. 

**Questions**

So, my questions for you, Personal Finance:

* Obviously, accepting a job for the same pay in DC is a non-starter - I'd be effectively taking a pay cut. Is it appropriate to ask for salary negotiations, and if so, should the point of contact be the hiring manager or the HR department? For those of you who are federal employees, how much wiggle room does the GS scale give hiring managers? Basically, was this a low ball, or did they shoot and miss? Am i expecting too much from a federal job? 

* I don't want to waste anyone's time as they've all been outstanding to me, and apparently the hiring process can still take months with background checks and all. Is it appropriate to mention, during the negotiation, that I'm expecting a 20% pay bump in the next few months as well as promotion to a management role? 

Thanks guys. My current job is currently in the dark about all of this, and I don't feel like my job is at risk (just stagnant), so I won't be terrible upset if all this falls through.",finance

I'm curious to hear whether or not anyone has actually had success with the forgiveness yet. 

Edit: Can we try to stay on topic here, rather than talking about qualifying or not qualifying or the details about the program?

Edit 2: A quote from a comment on r/studenloans sheds some light on why we haven't heard anything yet. ""The notification I received from FedLoan said that it would take at least 60 days for the Department of Education to complete its final review and that notification came on November 22nd. Based on that, I guess I can’t really expect it to happen before January 22nd.""

Edit 3: Anecdotal evidence suggests that some people have been approved for forgiveness. I've found an account on r/studentloans claiming their relative has had their's forgiven and someone else claiming that their counsilor at FedLoan had told them they had approved a couple of loans.

investing,Aggregate debt. Is anyone concerned?,"So I want to preface this question by stating that I'm not a bear, nor do I pretend to be able to time the markets perfectly. But I do think it's wise to be aware of a macro environment so you can set your portfolio risk-tolerance accordingly. Also, I'm far from an expert in macro analysis or economics, which is why I want to post this as a discussion.

As many know, the ""everything bubble"" has been a common term that has been thrown around recently. This ""bubble"" (regardless of if you believe it's actually a bubble) is essentially a product of the low interest rates that have been prevalent for years. 

I see a lot of questions about very *specific* debt issues such as subprime auto, or student loan debt. The general consensus is that each of these potential bubbles is not big enough by itself to cause harm to the economy even if it does come crashing down a little bit. But I can't help but feel like people are looking at things in much too narrow of a manner. The people focusing on subprime auto issues aren't taking into consideration how the rise in student loan debt has been squeezing people over the last decade. They aren't looking at how credit card debt in tandem with the above two issues (and mortgages) will cause a ton of issues as interest rates rise.

**Shouldn't we be looking at aggregate consumer debt more when discussing smaller bubbles?**

I'm sure I'm not the only one, but is anybody concerned more about aggregate consumer debt? Sure, a bubble in subprime auto-loans may not be by itself large enough to topple an economy, but what happens when you add that to higher than ever credit card debt, higher than ever student loan debt, and still relevant mortgage debt? 

People are so quick to write off anything like 2008 from happening again since mortgage debt hasn't risen, yet looking at the charts, it just seems that the debt has transferred from mortgages to student loans, credit cards, and auto loans. After all, does it really matter *where* the debt comes from? It's the simple fact that increased overall debt leads to increased defaulting and a slower economy as the economy tightens. 

**We have more debt than 2008, yet median household income is nearly the same**

We are past the point where we have more household debt than we did in 2007-2008 (https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html), and this is likely going to continue rising. In 2008, this obviously caused an enormous recession, so shouldn't there be more concern that we are already past that # in aggregate? Now, many people here are going to be quick to point out that this was over 10 years ago, and wages and other similar numbers are better. But here is the thing, median household income is only a hair's breadth higher than it was in 2008. Given, it has been rising as well, but It's only slightly (1.5%) higher than it was in 2007, while debt is more than that at this point. So how is it that the aggregate debt to median household income isn't more of a concern for more people?",finance
personalfinance,Advice on a good savings account to put aside future house down payment,"My boyfriend(24) and I(23) currently rent right now, (the place we're renting is very low priced for what we get location, size, commute, etc) so we're not in a rush to buy any time soon.

personalfinance,IBR situation/Advice Wanted,"Hey guys,  I searched the forum but didn't find specifically what I was looking for.

My wife and I combined have $195k in student loans.  I just finished graduate school and I will start paying my loans back this June.  Combined interest rate of all loans is about 6%.  Our annual gross will be around $230-$240k, and I work for a not for profit. 

I spoke with FedLoans and they estimated my 10 year standard repayment monthly payment would be $1950/month.  If we qualified for IBR, my estimated payment would be around $1500/month as it stands now with our yearly at $240k.  If my yearly goes up to $275k then the payment would be $1750.  One major variable is that my kids are 12 and 13 years old, if they move away for college in 5 and 6 years then I would lose them as dependents, and that would definitely increase my rate.

As I see it we have two options.

1.) Just do the standard repayment and try to pay it off ASAP.

2.) Do the IBR, and hope that after 10 years some of the loan will be forgiven.  But based off this, it would seem that I should always pay the minimum so I can maximize the balance forgiven right?

personalfinance,Saving vs. Loan payments,"I'm wrapping up my first year of working after college, and not sure about what I should be doing with my finances. 

My $30k in student debt is down to $25k (weighted interest rate at about 4.8%) and I've been paying off $500 in principle per month plus whatever interest accrued (~$80). 

After moving expenses my bank accounts were basically empty. My savings is up to $20k after December. 

At my current pace, my savings will be over $40k by the end of this year and my loan down to $20k or so. 

When my savings gets to a certain level -  say $30k, should I start funneling any extra money to my loans? 

If I end up at $40k in my savings at the end of the year should I just dump half of that to pay off my loan and be done with it?

I'm essentially just unsure of what to do with my extra money at certain point. Do I grow my savings as much as possible? Pay off loans as early as I can? Keep paying off loans at the same rate and invest more?

personalfinance,10x higher dividend rate? Maybe I'm not getting this.,"My mother recently passed away and there's a life insurance policy in my name. Prudential (the people paying off the policy) is offering me an ""Alliance Account"" which seems to be little more than a checking account. It reads: ""The current interest rate for Prudential's Alliance Account is 0.50%, subject to a current minimum of 0.25%."" Apparently I will earn that rate as long as there's at least $250 in the account, at which time they'll write me a check and close the account.

I have a checking (and savings) account with a local credit union. According to their web site, a standard savings account has a dividend rate of 0.05% and an APY^2 of 0.05%, and their standard checking account has zero on both. They also have special accounts for people with a certain amount of money, of which the life insurance payoff would qualify. This would bring both the dividend rate and the APY^2 to 0.15%.

Am I misunderstanding this? Is Prudential actually offering me a 10x higher yield than my credit union's standard savings account, and a 3.3x higher yield than my credit union's special savings account? Is there any reason to NOT open the Prudential account?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Masternode coins beat the Cryptocurrency market by 310x in 2017,"tl;dr: Masternode-coins had an average return of 348x in 2017, compared to the overall market which was 38x.
__________________________________________
There's naturally a lot of shilling of coins on in this subreddit, but I noticed a few that seemed to come up more than average and that many of those were coins that have ""masternodes"".

Masternodes are network nodes that have to stake a certain number of coins and in turn are rewarded more than a normal network node. Sometimes proof of stake, sometimes only they can mine, etc. 

It makes sense to me that owning a masternode motivates the owner to pump their coin.  Now, perhaps they truly believe in their coin and that's *why* they bought a masternode in the first place.

Either way, I went and found as many masternode-coins as I could that had at least a $20 mil market cap. I set that threshold because there are a LOT of masternode coins and I had to stop somewhere. Perhaps this threshold skews the results, DYOR.

CryptoCurrency,Why I believe chainlink (LINK) is the most undervalued coin in the top 100,"**What is Chainlink?**

Chainlink is a project that aims to be a decentralized oracle provider for Ethereum, Bitcoin, Hyperledger and other blockchains. It might sound complicated but hang with me. Smart contracts are amazing and without a doubt will change the internet in ways we can't even imagine right now and smart contracts even have potential far beyond the internet, in the real world. The issue right now is that smart contracts (like the ones Ethereum has) cannot communicate with real world APIs and services. What is an API? An API is a set of commands that one program can send to another program, effectively they allow different programs to communicate between each other. APIs power the entire internet and vast majority of today's internet could not function without APIs.

Now how does Chainlink come into play? As I said Chainlink is a decentralized oracle provider. An oracle is a software that allows smart contracts on the blockchain to communicate with off-chain APIs and services. Without an oracle this isn't possible and blockchains with smart contracts can only use data on their own blockchain, which makes them useless for responding to or using anything in the real world or elsewhere on the internet. Currently there are several oracle providers for blockchains, however their major issue is that they are all centralized. Smart contracts are all about decentralization and using data fed from a centralized oracle is a major point of attack. 

Say you have a bet with a friend made on a smart contract. The smart contract uses centralized oracle to check the latest ethereum's price. If it goes above $1000 before a certain date, you win the bet and get your friend's $50, if it doesn't then he gets your $50 that is deposited on the contract. The issue with a centralized oracle is that in this case, your friend could just hack into the centralized oracle, make it send false data about Ethereum's price to the smart contract and get your money without actually winning the bet. Not that big of a deal if you made a bet with a friend, but much bigger of a deal if you're a massive company that relies on millions of dollars being handled through smart contracts using oracles.

What chainlink does is that it provides decentralized oracles (effectively hundreds, even thousands of sources of the same data) combined, making it nearly impossible to hack, similarly to a blockchain. In this case, there would be no way for your friend to hack the oracle because the oracle is hundreds of different computers sending the same data.
 
**What partnerships do they have?**

The main reason why I think chainlink is so undervalued is due to the amount of partnerships it has and the rumors surrounding its potential partnerships.

On the [smartcontract.com](https://www.smartcontract.com/) website (yes, chainlink owns that domain) they state that their partners are SWIFT (yes, the SWIFT that works with 11,000+ banks worldwide), Gartner, Cornell and World Economic Forum. These are all impressive partnerships, but those are just outside of the blockchain world.

The most recent partnership of chainlink is with [ZeppelinOS](https://blog.zeppelinos.org/chainlink-partnership/). ZeppelinOS is an open-source, distributed platform of tools and services on top of the EVM to develop and manage smart contract applications securely. ZeppelinOS is used by projects like OmiseGO, CIVIC, Aragon, STORJ, Tierion, Augur, District0x, Ripio Credit Network, Decentraland and others. And guess what? They partnered with chainlink to use them as their oracle provider once chainlink's main net is up. This is huge, it means that projects that will use ZeppelinOS can easily use a secure, decentralized oracle for their projects if they need one (and many of them do). 

This alone is a huge deal for chainlink, but far from end. Request network, which is an amazing project that was recently soaring in price will need to use an oracle for their FIAT gateways and [in an update a while back](https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-november-10th-2017-a57193780ddf) they mentioned that they are in regular contact with chainlink and [in an another update](https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-december-22nd-2017-first-feedbacks-colossus-introducing-request-51fc3387a686) recently they mentioned it again as their #1 solution.

These are already huge use cases for chainlink, but it's still not over. There have been numerous speculations of chainlink's partnerships, such as ones with Microsoft, banks and other crypto projects. If you search on [chainlink's subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LINKTrader/) for partnerships, you will see a lot of speculation on that, some with convincing proof.

**Why is it valuable?**

Last but not least, why is the LINK token valuable? Well, apart from naturally increasing in value as the project gains more use and partnerships, the LINK token is used by smart contract owners to pay chainlink nodes for getting data from them and the more LINKs an oracle node has, the more reputable it is. So oracle node providers are incentivized to hold as much LINKs in their chainlink nodes to appear more reputable to the chainlink network, gaining more usage and profit.

LINK staking is another big thing that will do wonders for Chainlink's valuation. Turns out Chainlink oracles can be made into pools, similar to mining pools on bitcoin and ethereum where multiple people come and put their LINKs together to run a more secure oracle node and distribute the profits fairly between each other. This will be huge as it will effectively allow you to stake your LINK tokens and earn more of them passively without doing anything. One such pool in development is [LinkPool](http://www.linkpool.io/).

/u/smartcontractsfortax provided a great in-depth explanation of chainlink's value [in his comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7nwis4/why_i_believe_chainlink_link_is_the_most/ds5bqxt/).

**Summary**

There are excellent videos from Sergey Nazarov (creator of Chainlink) explaining oracles and Chainlink on youtube, the best probably being from [last year's DEVCON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW27zYIxZhY). Sergey is also a respected member in the blockchain community, where he created projects like Secure Asset Exchange for NXT and Smartcontract.com.

Chainlink has been in the works for over 3 years and if Chainlink succeeds in creating their decentralized oracle (which I have full faith they do based on the team's previous projects, how close they are and the fact that smartcontract.com currently provides functional centralized oracles) and they successfully provide oracles for majority of cryptocurrency projects, the valuation of the LINK token will be insane. We are talking valuation in tens of billions of dollars, if not more if chainlink actually ends up working with SWIFT and will be partnered with them. Not many people have a chance to get in on a project like this in its infancy that has such a potential for price increase. The current market cap of chainlink is extremely undervalued for the potential the project has and I think we will soon see chainlink come closer to its true valuation as the main net release (Q1-Q2 2018) approaches.

**TL;DR: Chainlink is the only project focusing on being a decentralized oracle provider that has a MASSIVE use case, partnerships like Request Network, ZeppelinOS, SWIFT? and the LINK token can be staked in pools in the future to provide passive income.**",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"We own too many cars, not sure what the most financially reasonable option is... any suggestions or advice appreciated","I'm in the process of ""right-sizing"" my life, having left a good-paying but soul destroying job for a much more modest paying but hopefully the dream job I've been looking for in higher education. I'm using this as an opportunity to retool our family's finances, and one key decision is dealing with the cars we have.

We currently own four vehicles - 

* A 2009 Honda Pilot with 150k miles. We owe nothing, dropped insurance to the bare minimum ($300/year), and only use occasionally when we need the space. Book value is maybe $3k. 
* A 2013 Honda CR-V with 50k miles. We owe $17k, and appears to be worth around $13k if we were to trade it in. This is my wife's primary vehicle, and since we live in an area with long winters and lots of snow, it's our go-to bad weather ride. Insurance is about $800 / year.
* A 2014 Honda Civic with 50k miles. We owe nothing. Book value is around $8k. Insurance is $400/year.
* a 2017 Volkswagen GTI with 11k miles. We owe nothing. Book value is around $17k. Insurance is $1,200/year.

So far the Civic has cost peanuts to maintain. I am concerned that the VW will eventually start incurring ever growing maintenance costs once it hits the 100k mark, although is not based on solid evidence, just my prior experience with VWs and what I've learned lurking on the vw subreddit for a year. The Pilot is hardy ever used and I would not want it to be in a position where it's a primary vehicle. The CR-V is pretty cheap to maintain, like the Civic, but I really don't know what to expect long term (unlike the Civic, which I expect to remain cheap for a long time unless the CVT transmission bites the dust). Long story short - it's hard to predict maintenance costs, but I do know that Honda recently scored as the #2 brand for low cost of ownership, where VW was somewhere in the middle.

We really only need two vehicles, although losing the Pilot would be tough when we go on vacation. For the low amount of money I spend to keep it on the road, I'm inclined to hang on until it needs some major repair. But this could be the wrong approach.

I expect my wife will want to keep the CR-V, but it would be great if we could get out of the $450/month car payment. Or would it? Interest rate is around 4%.

I'm emotionally torn between the Civic and VW; the VW is quite the fun car to drive, but I worry about costs, it's kind of sketchy in bad weather, it has a ton of technology on it that I'm worry is going to break whereas the Civic is the bare bones, dead simple, has legendary reliability but is not quite as fun as the VW.

So... I'm hoping that someone without any emotional attachment can suggest a financially prudent source of action. Sell the VW and pay off the CR-V? Keep the VW because it's the most valuable with the lowest miles and therefore potentially the longest life? Sell the Civic and the VW, and trying to get the best of both worlds (Honda TCO, VW fun?)",finance

Like government regulations. 
You always hear some voices in the news (mostly from jealous bankers or feds) that if country XY would regulate the crypto market this whole thing wouldn’t attract so much attention anymore or would even vanish completely into thin air.

Regulatory actions could be:
1. VAT liability —&gt; buying and selling crypto would  need to have VAT included. 
Imho a really crazy idea, given the fact that we’re talking about currencies and not assets. Not sure how this could be implemented. Seems pretty far away. Probably the exchanges could include the tax directly into their prices when exchanging back to fiat..

2. Reduce anonymity —&gt; I think this is already on the table in the EU and will most likely happen. In order to prevent money laundering and related crime activities the country could introduce a law which would postulate a disclosure of the person by the exchange if you want to transfer crypto back into fiat.
Seems possible to me with the effect, that the anonymity coins would basically be sentenced to death, right? 

3. Prohibit crypto —&gt; to protect investors is their statement, but it’s clear that every country would defend their currency monopoly if the crypto currency market would reach a critical mass compared to the financial market. 
How could you prohibit something decentralized and globalized? I mean, it’s like the internet. You cant shut it down like a company. The only problem could be to get the crypto exchanged back into fiat.

I’m a newly minted lawyer looking for advice on how to invest. Here’s the facts:

**Income**: $180,00

**After Tax, before refund**: $110,000

Fixed costs (rent, utilities, and car insurance): $26,700

Marginal costs (Groceries, clothes, eating out, etc.): $18,250

**Total Living Expenses**: ~$45,000

**Student Loan Debt**: $49,000 refinanced with SoFi at 3.5% interest.
	**Monthly Payment**: $900*
	**Yearly Payment**: $10,800

**Surplus**: $110k-$45k-$10.8k, or $54,200 per year
        **Minus Max 401k contribution** ($18.5k): $35.7k
        **Minus HSA Account** ($5.5k): $30.2

**Other Assets**: I currently have $29k in my checking account as my “emergency fund” money.

My question is, what should I do with my extra $30.2k? More specifically, how much should I be investing, and how should I think about buying a new car? Having read the wiki, I think I earn too much for a Roth IRA or traditional one. Should I put all $30k into a Vanguard or other index fund?

**The Car**

My beloved car is a real piece of junk (Bluebook Private Party sales value around $1k), so I’d like to buy a new one the next time it needs any significant repairs. My credit score was around 715 last I checked, so I suspect the interest rate on my car loan would be low enough (under 4%, per the wiki) that I wouldn’t need to accelerate payments.

I really appreciate any advice you folks can offer. Thank you very much for your time.


*Reading the Wiki, this falls under the 4% rule of thumb for paying off debt early. So, I figure I’ll pay this off on-schedule.",finance
gaming,Reasons for quitting gaming,"Last year had a ton of controversies with microtransactions, particularly with the likes of Battlefront 2 and EA. Activision and their microtransaction pay-to-win formula patent was another controversy, along with Bethesda and Creation Club, Bioware and Mass Effect: Andromeda (it dying for Anthem pretty much), amongst other things. RDR 2 seems like it could be the next big microtransaction controversy, although I doubt it will be as bad as the Battlefront 2 controversy. Maybe it was just me, but I saw a lot of people talking about how dangerously close they were to quitting gaming altogether. Some even claiming they were actually quitting, and it got me thinking...what are the most common reasons for quitting? If you have quit gaming at any point, or are planning to, why are you? If you came back why did you? Was it being fed up with the industry, a lack of interesting games coming out, the death of your favorite franchise, or simply wanting to move on. Just interested to see the most common reasons.",technology

personalfinance,Refinancing a home in a trust?,"Hi everyone! I have question that I'm hoping one of you financial gurus can help me with!

My siblings and I will be receiving a property in a trust which still has a mortgage out against it. The loan has a 7% interest rate, has 20 years and ~150k left on it. I'd estimate the property is worth ~300k.

Is it possible for the loan to be refinanced even though the person who took the original loan out is no longer involved? 

Is the trust responsible for payments or would it be the person who signs the loan documents? 

Who's credit would they use to consider the loan?

If I was the one to refinance the property how would it effect a mortgage I wished to take out in the future to buy my own home?

Ripple,"Why the freakout on ""there are too many coins"" when there will be a burn rate once widely adopted?","Seems like the burn rate will help reduce deflation while also reducing the total number of coins and increase ripple's value (even if a low burn rate today at 5-10k) primarily due to laws of economics (decreased supply via burning increase demand via app usage and exchange trading)

Is this just something (again i'm a newb) easily mis-observed when you look at the raw numbers without knowing much about the product?

*  a. this has x market cap
*  b. this has x coins
*  c. therefore max value is 3$ (its past 3$) when really it could be $100
*  d. then people argue it cant be $100 because there are xyz coins and it would be 2x more than bitcoin etc.

Demand will increase as it is available on more crypto exchanges but long term potential demand will be from active partnership usage (banks)  irregardless of ""you dont need xrp to use ripple apps"", since some assume that they will. 

I feel all cryptocurrencies have one built in scarcity tool:

*  a. people lose their wallets
*  b. exchanges disappear 
*  c. hackers
*  d. feds/governments taking coins and exchange $ away

These alone will decrease supply beyond burning.

personalfinance,"No income, no cosigner, bad credit... I need around 20k in private student loans ASAP. Drowning in anxiety...","I was admitted to NYU with a huge scholarship that covered 80% of my tuition and school fees. GPA plummeted to below 2.0 (combination of depression, traumatic experiences, and just being a dumb shit), lost my scholarship and lost eligibility for federal aid. Completely broke my mom's heart and have made everyone close in my life shed enough tears to fill an ocean. 

Now, at the conclusion of this semester I've brought my gpa back up to at least 2.0, so I will be getting my scholarship and financial aid back for the next semester--yay! However, since I had to pay out of pocket for this semester, I now have a 31k balance (one semester of NYU tuition is around 25k) I need to pay off in order to continue my studies--fuck! 

Around 4k of the balance is late fees which I'm in the process of getting waived (hopefully). My family can help with around 7-10k so that, ideally, brings me down to around 20k. 

It's important to mention that I'm clueless and know nothing about money, loans, etc. so I apologize in advance for any silly questions or moments of cluelessness.

Now, I have until the end of this month (when winter break ends) before the next semester starts--meaning, I gotta come up with a lot of money with very little time and options. I feel like the best (and only) option is for me to get private student loans to pay off this monstrous semester's worth of tuition and then move on with my life.

This is where my dilemma begins. I have a low 600 credit score, never filed taxes or had a ""real"" job in my life (I'm 20), and no cosigner. What I DO have is an extremely wealthy, wonderful sugar daddy (stop laughing) who is willing to pay my student loans. He won't cosign because the relationship is very fresh (just over a month) and although this amount is absolutely nothing to him (his own words) he's just uncomfortable by the responsibility/binding nature of being a cosigner at the beginning of such a new relationship. Also, he won't just pay off my entire tuition for the same reason--too much, too soon. I don't feel like I have to explain myself, and I won't, but I figured some context would paint a more accurate picture of my situation. Please... I don't need any of you to judge me or debate whether or not my sugar daddy is trying to make excuses/is lying, etc. I've already done enough of that myself. This is simply what my situation is.

So... my only hurdle is to get the damn student loans. From the research I've done so far (aka scouring reddit posts and shitty articles) I feel like to be approved for 20k (or at the very least 5-10k) without a cosigner, I'd need to have verifiable income along with my shitty-decent-ish credit score, right? I know for a fact if I applied for loans now with just my credit score and no income, no cosigner, I will be flat out rejected.

So I was thinking I'd provide bank statements and just deposit a $1000 check or something from my mom's business account and list around 30k as my income. That way, I can get away with not having tax returns or pay stubs since I'm a ""new hire"" and just started my ""job"". I realize the compromise of integrity and legality in doing this... but I'm incredibly desperate (like many of us in this subreddit) so please hurl criticisms and insults at me another time. Right now, I'd appreciate any tips and advice I can get. Is my little scheme just plain stupid or are there other/better options? Any wiggle room for me at all? 
 
I *could* just come clean to my mom, ditch my sugar daddy, and take the semester off to slowly pay what I owe and take cheaper classes somewhere else like any normal, respectable girl would do. But no. Without typing out another 1000000 word explanation, that is my absolute last resort and I am willing to do WHATEVER it takes to at least try to secure these loans and pay off the semester, however unlikely it may seem--I even looked into donating eggs guys... but that shit takes too long and isn't even enough to cover the full semester anyway :'). I do realize I should've done this sooner and planned better, yes, I've learned from my mistakes and will be more knowledgeable and smarter about my financial situation and life decisions in the future--but for now, please help!!",finance
personalfinance,"I've paid approximately $60,000 towards my (mostly private) student loans over the past seven years and I still have over 90% of the principle left. I just need some advice.","It's a familiar story. I opted for an out-of-state college. I got into academic trouble and lost my qualification for FAFSA. I graduated with the help of some private loans, but never found a job that justified the cost of school. 

My monthly payment is $881, through Great Lakes, Navient, and AES. My annual salary is $42,000. So, before taxes, 25% of my income goes to student loans. I moved a few years ago and put some of them into forbearance (4-6 months), just to accrue a bit of breathing room. The total remaining amount of loans I have is around $85,000, $15,000 of which is public.

I've made some mistakes in my life. Among these, I've been ambivalent about tithing to the debt god on-time, so my credit is low. How low? When I've applied for consolidation through some private services, my credit is too low for them to take me on.

So, what's the approach here? There's a fair argument to be made of paying the most I can possibly pay towards my loans to get them paid off the quickest, but $881 is the monthly minimum and I just plain can't go higher. I can try to find a co-signer for consolidation, an option I've considered and a hard conversation to have. 

From this vantage point, I can see the benefits of trying to get my monthly payments down to about $400 and striving to pay off more when my salary increases a bit. It's a dangerous game with the wild interest rates on some of my loans, but hypothetical future me and my $80,000 annual salary agrees that it is way easier to pay them down then in leaps and bounds. 

I guess what I'm really looking for is some advice on how to feel like I'm taking the reins of my finances and loosening the chains of my debt. And maybe a little empathy, because I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling suffocated.",finance
personalfinance,"Should I cash EE savings bonds based on value, earliest issued, interest rate, or something else?","My wife wants to wipe out her $600 credit card debt to start the year fresh with some of her savings bonds, and I'm trying to help her figure out which ones she should cash. She was born in 1989 and has gotten them over the years - her earliest ones mature fully in 2019.

I ran them all through the treasury calculator and she has about $1800 worth in bonds. The ones issued before 1995 have an interest rate of 4.00%; 1995 through 2004 are between 1.56% and 1.66%; 2005 and 2006 (her final two) are 3.2% and 3.6% respectively, and are actually worth more than some of the earlier ones.

Our plan is to cash what she needs this month, then save the rest for the end of the year/early next year to take a little vacation to let them get those extra 1s of dollars.

I'm likely just splitting hairs here, but which ones should she cash this month vs save? The earliest, lowest -&gt; highest interest, highest value, or something else?",finance
personalfinance,"Fiance has student loans and CC debt - I'm trying to make a plan of action to tackle these and hopefully get debt free within 1.5-2 years, any tips/modifications to my plans?","Hey guys, my fiance recently asked me if I could cosign a student loan for her, she has 1 semester after this one, which naturally led to a more in depth discussion about debt. I'm an accounting/finance major so I know a little about basic finances, but was fortunate enough to not have to take out student loans, but that also means I know absolutely nothing about student loans.

So I guess first question - since we're getting married is there any real negative to cosigning for her loan? the loan is 2,500 through Sallie Mae, I figure since we're getting married that the debt is already gonna kind of go to both of us so it shouldn't matter much.

So for the actual debt and my plan -

-5k CC debt, at 11%, however she said it doesn't ad interest as long as she makes minimum payments, I don't know too much about CC debt, but that doesn't sound right to me so I just asked her if it doesn't ad interest as long as shes paying that minimum.

-2.5k taking out now in Sallie Mae loans (possibly another 2.5k her last semester), my fiance said the rate depends on me if I cosign, and I have a decent credit score (about 700 I think), I asked and she said it can be from 5.75%-11.85% for fixed rate, and 2.25% to 9.37% for variable.

-20k in federal Student loans 6.8% IR

-As far as income, we figure after taxes we will bring home roughly 6k a month, that sounds like a lot but seattle, so rent is 1.6k and other expenses are pretty high too.

But I think if we try, it's not absurd to put 2.5k towards loans/month.

After reading the side bar I think it mentioned to pay off all debt before really going for that safety net of 3-6 months expenses?

So in order

1) Pay off CC debt. We are saving for that now.

2) Pay off Sallie Mae debt, higher interest out first, right? Also if we are able to get a better variable rate than fixed rate we can pay this off before it can go up any.

3) Pay off Federal loans.

Also, I know interest rates are basically risk - higher risk you are the higher interest rates - would refinancing her loans benefit us since we should be less of a risk since we would be making a decent sum of money? 

In the wiki it says we will forfeit the right for ""loan forgiveness, IBR and PAYE,"" but I feel those wouldn't be super beneficial to us. I don't foresee us doing loan forgiveness, IBR/PAYE wouldn't be great because I feel we want to pay more than that.

Am I misunderstanding anything? even though I majored in finance, that doesn't mean I know how to apply it to real world things like student loans especially haha, I just understand base level things.

Is this the best way to tackle it? As much as I'd like to throw money in the bank, I think it'd be better to throw it towards loans instead.

CryptoCurrency,2017 Taxes - We Need To Get Serious,"I want to make this post a meaningful discussion about American taxes that has three goals:

* **Helping those of us with significant crypto holdings become informed on how to proceed with 2017 taxes**
* **Strengthen our position as legitimate law-abiding citizens**
* **Not holding anyone legally responsible for ""legal advice"" who contributes to this discussion thread** (this is about getting our bearings)

If you are like me you found 2017 to be a very good year for you. I'm not talking to the people who got in on this in early December and made $1,000. I'm talking to those of us who saw our modest yet respectable holding of bitcoins grow to jaw-dropping prices and then continued to diversify our digital portfolio to the point that we may now be holding dozens of currencies traded at various times on a variety of exchanges.

What we are doing is legal and has been legal for years. I am one of those [alleged 802 people who pays their taxes on Coinbase](http://fortune.com/2017/03/19/irs-bitcoin-lawsuit/). And let me tell you, the professional accounting firm I use to pay my taxes charged me a pretty penny for basically knowing the one thing everyone does know about cryptocurrency - that [you have to pay long-term capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies you've held for over a year and sold for American dollars](https://bitcoin.tax/blog/bitcoin-taxes-common-questions/). So that's what I've been doing and I've been doing that with each bitcoin being considered at 100% profit because I bought all my bitcoins from Mt. Gox! Maybe you've never payed taxes on all the bitcoin you sold but let's face it - in 2017 you better pay your taxes and you better know what you're talking about and doing. A lot of us have found ourselves with serious money that we did not have until 2017.

The real problem comes from the variety of exchanges we've joined and the amount of trading of currencies on these exchanges. Many of these exchanges are also not illegal to use. While Bitcoin has been on the IRS radar for a while these exchanges specialize in something that has never been truly significant enough to get the IRS's full attention until 2017. But this problem is multi-faceted:

* **In 2017, was exchanging one crypto for another crypto considered a taxable event?** - [The fact is there isn't a clear answer on this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2017/12/28/loophole-allows-tax-free-bitcoin-exchanges-into-2018/#4f50d7b312fa). With the IRS tying cryptocurrencies down as property (rather than currencies which- as I understand it- wouldn't be taxed) they allowed the loophole of the 1031 which allows swaps for like-kind properties. The IRS called cryptos properties, people are swapping cryptos with each other (literally) while small fees are charged for using the network or exchange, and thus - it could be argued that all exchanges *between* cryptos are NOT a taxable event. I personally like this idea but I clearly have a bias. There are many other people who claim that all cryptocurrency transactions between each other are taxable and this comes with its own bag of worms. And indeed, the rock-star new Republican tax code does mirror this sentiment by solely claiming 1031 use for Real Estate. So this leaves us with another question:

* **What legal stance should we take when talking with our accountants/ doing our taxes?** The stunning impossibility of what is expected of us LEGAL citizens doing LEGAL trading in order to report on our taxes, if we do take the stance that all crypto transactions are taxable, is so highly complex that it's almost like the IRS is forcing all crypto-traders into an illegal space. In a sense they are trip-wiring the entire crypto market with expectations that are impossible to follow. We must have some legal rights here or at least legal stances that we can take when dealing with such a new fast paced market and such a slowly-responding vaguely-directed bureaucracy like the IRS. In [one of the better crypto tax threads on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m56g0/the_absolute_fucking_impossibility_of_reporting/) one person expressed with acute detail the amount of problems recording all of our transactions really are based on the current IRS expectations which are vague and the IRS is not giving a clear answer on whether cryptos are allowed to be considered exempted using 1031. Even if they were there still is expected a way to report everything. My accountant will want to do whatever is safest for them and likely the most expensive for me. How do I ensure a reasonable approach is taken by my tax professional that considers my needs and not just throwing as much money at the IRS as possible? I want to pay my taxes but I want tax laws to be fair on crypto, which leaves me to my next point:

* **What is the best way to look at crypto from a tax point of view?** Currently cryptocurrency is a square peg in a round hole. The IRS, clearly unprepared (as we all were) for the massive attention and growth of cryptocurrency in 2017 was already stuffed into the the ""property"" hole despite being developed and created for *much more* than that. Cryptocurrency - whether you want to call it an asset or a currency - is already billions of dollars deep in projects that are meant to change the way entire systems operate *on a global scale*! This is a global thing taking place within  different countries. We already pay capital gains taxes or income taxes when we exchange them into dollars which is a fair and easily reliable system to document - is it even right for the IRS to tax more? While there may be some in here who believe nobody should be paying taxes with cryptos I think that cryptos (like everything else) should have some taxable responsibility- but not so much that it becomes highly burdensome and a legal minefield allowing the IRS specter to be chasing you for alleged misdoings years down the line. And if crypto is as successful as its going to be there will likely be less of a reason to exchange into dollars anymore thus losing the leverage of the capital gains/income tax. And looking into the short term future decentralized exchanges are even going to be set up potentially removing the ability to track cryptos in any form whatever! What is the appropriate way to tax crypto basing it on the fact that it IS crypto and not necessarily merely ""property"" or ""currency""?

* **What level of responsibility do exchanges play in 2017 taxes?** Being a proud Coinbase tax payer I had the privilege of giving my tax accountant a printed out piece of paper with a terrible excel sheet on it that displayed my yearly bitcoin transactions and told them that this was the best document they were going to get. I haven't gotten the information from Coinbase this year yet, and hopefully they've improved the quality of the report but  *at least there is one*. I just tried looking for how to get the information from Bittrex and while it may be available it wasn't easy to find with a google-search or on their website. **That** is a problem. This is an exchange that is legally allowed to operate in the United States. I could sign up to Bitcoin.tax to find out the information allegedly but I really should not have to sign up to anywhere to find out how to get my annual tax document from my exchange. And if they don't provide one then why is the United States legally allowing them to operate within their borders? If the IRS decides to take their records two years down the line like they did in 2017 with Coinbase and they come to us asking us why we didn't report something and it was because there was no easy/possible way to obtain the records from the users end, how can that be our fault? It would be great if there was a sticky-noted thread on ANY of these crypto boards on how to obtain a document of the year's transactions from every one of the exchanges out there because many of us need them. There is an expectation that we are supposed to calculate the amount gained from when we first purchased a currency to when we traded it for another currency. Aside from the fact that even if we are provided an annual report document it won't be in dollars - it will be in BTC or ETH or USDT or some other pairing at a specific time with a specific amount in those pairings on that specific exchange. The dollar correlation that's needed - if not provided - makes reporting crypto transactions nearly impossible.

* **How are we supposed to accommodate for transactions to and from wallets?** Say we can do all of those things above but now we move it to a private wallet for safekeeping. From there we might send it to another wallet as it intermingles with other coins and from there they are traded on other exchanges. What is the dollar correlation there? What is the appropriate gains? Which exchange did you buy *that specific coin* from? This all matters for taxes but almost impossible to track between wallets and exchanges. If it can't be done, how can we be held accountable to do it? If we can't do it, then what legal ground do we have to say what is being expected is byzantine and unrealistic? Also, it's my understanding that we don't need to report coins in private wallets but that'll be nearly impossible not to do if we have to do all this tracking.

* **Who specializes in cryptocurrency?** - Maybe we can't find all the answers here but some of you out there must be able to point us in the direction of someone that can give us answers. I'm not talking about the conservative tax lawyer that's going to make sure you pay every last dime in a way that would make the IRS want them to be the new head of the department - and I'm not talking about the shady guy who promises that you can get out of paying a dime. I'm talking professionals that aren't just going to be pushed over and know their stuff on this topic. I will gladly pay for this legal muscle to ensure I am legally participating in our society through crypto transactions while not just trying to tax me every time I click the mouse.

Some people say just to ignore all of this tax mess because the IRS is likely to change their stance 10 more times. But I don't want to ignore it because cryptocurrency is already seen as a shady business. And it's not - it's a globally disruptive technology that provides benefits many centralized systems can't and it's the reason why it's busting through the $700 billion market cap at the beginning of 2018. Please, let's organize and approach our taxes honestly and in an informed fashion this year. The fact is many of us in the crypto community visit crypto subreddits and together - with a similar mentality, attitude, drive, and direction- we can influence the crypto policy to be fair to both the country and the crypto-trader.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Clarification how Oyster Pearl (PRL) works,"I realize that the Oyster Protocol is difficult to explain, so I found this concise explanation of the project:

&gt; Oyster Protocol is a token which incorporates IOTA Tangle and Ethereum, aimed at addressing the current stand-off between advertisers and ad-blockers. Currently website hosts are losing revenue due to adblock, even worse, losing traffic as visitors are being forced to either turn adblock off, or pay a monthly fee for no ads — not for long. To fix the problem, oyster protocol provides a revenue stream to website owners by utilizing a small portion of their visitor’s computer processing. The “work” done by the visitor’s computers is the back end “proof of work” needed to run Oysters encrypted secure data storage network.

**For example:**

&gt; John wants to store some sensitive data, he chooses to spend PRL to anonymously upload some files. The PRL is embedded in the uploaded files.

&gt; Sam decides to visit a website where Oyster Protocol is enabled, passively his CPU/GPU starts performing light proof of work to find PRL in encrypted data maps of uploaded files which are then fed back to the website host, effectively creating an entire revenue stream, cutting the need for adverts or fees.

&gt; By fully adopting Oyster Protocol, Cryptocurrency exchanges could implement the code, allowing visitors to perform light proof of work in exchange for no trading fees. Now wouldn’t that be amazing?

Source: https://medium.com/@Cryptobull/what-is-oyster-protocol-ebac8f6f0b3b

Also, I would like to comment on two common misconceptions about this project:

1) Website visitors won't know that they're giving up their processing power when visiting a website

&gt; Website visitors will have to consent to giving up their processing power.  It would be so shady if they were doing it without your permission.  Anyone remember the whole UFC + Coinhive debacle?

2) People can just use adblock on Oyster Pearl

&gt; If you use adblock or don't opt into giving up your computing power, websites can decline to show you content.  Oyster Pearl is an *alternative* to advertisements and websites will require you to opt-in so they can generate revenue.",cryptocurrency

Recently paid off a ton of student loan debt (yay me). I was living comfortable with the student loans payments and the mortgage payment but now I’m not sure what’s the best thing to do with the new cash flow.

1) take exactly what I was paying for student loans and start applying it to my mortgage payment. Obviously I would save a ton of money on interest and with a rough calc would pay my mortgage off in ten years

2) take exactly what I was paying for my student loans and put it towards investments. This is where I think it gets tricky. 

Would I make more money in the markets than I’m saving on my mortgage? I keep thinking of the multiplier effect and maybe initially it wouldn’t work out but 20 years from now is it better to just pay my messily interest rate of 4% and let my investments grow?

3) the most tempting option. Do not pay mortgage and do not invest. Save it all for 5ish maybe 10 years and open my own business. Honestly can’t see myself working at 60years old. I plan to retire early and this is probably the best chance at that. 

Student loans were 1k a month. Mortgage is 2k. 

Appreciate the help, advice, opinions, scoldings, updoodles

Edit: mortgage calc doesn’t include wife’s contribution. For the purpose of this example I’m keeping her contribution constant which would allow us to pay the house off in tenish years.",finance
BlockChain,Decentralized identity verification via behavior: train your dragon and it will know you,"Imagine a decentralized app that is collectively owned, which learns you intimately through interaction from childhood, e.g. as you 'train your dragon' toy to start, and it develops into your personal assistant along the lines of current products, but it knows you deeply and can vouch for your identity in commerce, as well as (my primary interest) help you figure yourself out so that you become a better citizen.

Most importantly, no one else owns it, it is distributed physically and control-wise, so it can't be used to manipulate you. The financial protection drives protection of the privacy of people's psyches, as machines bring the sort of tracking used by advertisers much deeper into the mind, to the service of self-awareness, rather than selling products that typically use up the environment. I hope it could lead to a paradigm shift for humanity. 

The code would be open source, the data splintered across the net. The app would aggregate and analyze the data, and the results then fed back into the models used to understand individuals. Everyone would be able to explore the world's collective psyche, both in terms of seeing what is being learned overall, and as it might provide useful information in interpersonal situations, a Dear Abby function with a therapist's intimate knowledge of you, explaining how it models people in general.

Instead of having static, 'owned' identifying info like Equifax let out, in interactive situations at least you would be presented with things you had never experienced before, and your responses would identify you, based on the ""dragon's"" knowledge of you.

It's a pretty big thing to implement, but parts might pay for themselves for their developers along the way. I've been  programming from before the internet, and can envision it as clearly as successful projects that I have led or worked on.

The idea develops out of an attempt to create a new kind of sentient life form for its own sake as an investigation of mind, coming from an original background in philosophy, and more recent study of psychology. I have been gathering pairs of 'interesting' photos, and my initial attempts at training neural nets to recognize my taste were so successful that I believe anyone can be fingerprinted to a level that perhaps no one yet understands. Rather than see it all go into covert commercial and political manipulation, I'd like to see the technology educate people against itself, e.g. so they learn the difference between repeating slogans and thinking. To not be turned into another slogan-inciter, it needs to be independent of any one person or group.

personalfinance,My Personal Finance in the military.,"So, I keep getting flak for this from everyone from fellow active duty to Military Finance and Life Counselors and I stick to my guns.  However, I am coming to you, r/personalfinance, to see if this makes sense to you.  First I will tell you what I do that would be considered non-traditional and secondly, what the results have been.

First, I don't have a savings account.  Instead I use a Brokerage Account as my savings account.

Secondly, I don't have an emergency fund.  The reason for this is that I have $10,000 of available credit.  Being in a job where I deploy every 6-9 months, USAA has it's own extended version of the Servicemember's Civil Relief Act where they cap the interest on your credit cards at 4% APR for the duration of your deployment plus 12 months after your return.  Additionally, I have my brokerage account which is primarily used for stocks, meaning if I really need the money, I can sell some of my stocks, and have the money in my checking account within 72 business hours.

Third, I carry no balance in my checking account.  I put absolutely as much I can into my house payment, Jeep payment, or brokerage account.  My credit cards give me 2.5% cash back (pilot program through USAA) and 5% cash back on gas.  So every month, I put everything on credit card and pay it off beginning of every month on pay day.

Fourth, I do not contribute to my TSP (Thrift Savings Plan).  The TSPs own numbers indicate that the average of all their funds return 4.66%.  Additionally, modeled after an IRA, you cannot touch the money until 59 1/2 without a tax penalty and as someone who would like to start his own business when I leave the military, this is not ideal for me.  Instead, I do all my own investing.

So what has this strategy gotten me?  Well, the day I left for the military, I had no car and $600 to my name.  Now, as only an E-4, I have bought a Jeep Wrangler with $14,500 left to pay (original principle $29,200), have $33,000 in my brokerage account, just bought a house, the highest interest rate I pay on anything is 4%, and a credit score of 765 from Transunion.",finance

So I started off the New Year and paid off all my auto loan, and since it was a $6800 payment on a 17% interest rate it felt really good.

I take home roughly $3800 a month, but with frugal living and affordable bills I'm lucky to be in a position to aggressively pay off the loans.

I have the option of teaching in a low income school district for five consecutive years to take off up to $17.5 K of the debt. My school district qualifies, now all that really needs to happen (correct me if I'm wrong) is paperwork and teaching for five years. 

Should I pay my loans slowly over five years and wait for the TLF to help out? Should I aggressively pay off all my student loans by years end?

Alright so here is the situation. I am considering moving out of my house and into a camper/travel trailer full time. My motivations are purely financial, and not minimalist. I'm approved for the loan, I’ve picked out the one I want, and my wife is on board. However, I'm naturally apprehensive about this major lifestyle change, and I'm not sure if in the long run this will really help me achieve my financial goals. I was hoping some unbiased third parties could provide some objective advice. What follows are details about my personal financial situation. Thank so much for your time checking out my thread!


I am in my mid 20’s, as is my wife. I have a doctorate level degree, and I have been out of school and working for about a year. I acquired an enormous amount of debt while in school, and not just of the student loan variety. I own two houses in two different cities/states, one is rented, and I live in the other. I have to move in the next year for work, and would like to keep house number #2 and rent it too. Additionally, I want to buy a new house in the new city, hopefully to rent it as well. It is my personal goal to have 5-10 rentals by the time I am 30. My wife is still a student, and works part time. She makes between 10-15K a year. 


Because of my enormous amount of debt it was my hope that moving into a camper now will not only reduce my expenses, but also offset my current mortgage with a tenant in enough time to better my chances of being qualified for a new mortgage in the new city. Additionally, with the camper I will not have to rent in the new city while we are trying to find a suitable third property. Anyway, here are the numbers! 


Income:
$7,900 a month (After Taxes) OR between 105K and 115k annually before taxes, not counting spouses income. 10k-15k annually for spouse’s income. 
I have 18-20k in cash for savings. I’m saving this at a rate of about 1K a month for a down payment for the third property down payment. 

Debt &amp; Expenses:
Unsecured (Credit Cards and Personal Loans)- Total: 84k Monthly: 3k Interest: 10% and below. 

Secured (One car, one motorcycle, and two houses)- Total:$210,000.00 Monthly: $1,850.00. Interest: 5% below for houses, 10% for car/motorcycle. 

Student Loans (All Federal &amp; Consolidated, looking at PSLF)- Total: 190-200k. Monthly: $450.00. Interest: 6% and below.

Anticipated RV Loan
20K total. Monthly payment is $378. 13% Interest. Lot expenses are between $600 and $750 a month. Other expenses would be reduced by about $250 a month (Internet, security, Electric) and I think my income will shoot up by about $1,200 a month (potential rent income for house #2). 


Does this plan pass the smell test? Short term my monthly expenses should go down by about $400. Long term I think having my second house already rented will put me in a better position to qualify for a third property. Additionally, I won’t have to rent an apartment in the new city because we will have the RV, potential savings there of about 6k. 


I know I have a mountain of debt, but I just started working. I don’t want my long term property acquisition goals to be hampered by this temporary excessive debt problem. I won’t switch jobs for at least five years and then my income should go up significantly, 150k plus. Additionally my wife will start a real job in the next year or so too, so that’s another 50k potentially. 
What do you think? Any advice, comments, insults.. seriously everything is welcome. Let me have it! Don’t spare my feelings! 

Please, please, please give me something! I'm really hesitant to make a move here either way. 


UPDATE-

We ended up buying the RV. We did find one that was cheaper, 14k loan for that, 0 down. $800 for shipping. So about a 6k savings from the initial one we found. We're in the process now of moving out of our house and renting it.",finance

personalfinance,15 year mortgage VS 30 year and investing the difference,"I am preparing to finance my first home and all the details are a little scary to me. Let me quickly explain my situation.

I’m a young first time buyer with 10% ready to put down for a small 2 bedroom house. Opting for a 15 year mortgage seems like a no brainer to me: it comes with lower interest rates and you pay everything off quicker. I’m someone who doesn’t like to hold a lot of debt and a 15 year mortgage would soak up only 20% of my monthly expendable income, so it’s not breaking the bank and gives me more peace of mind.

Well, that was until my dad explained to me that I should think about doing a 30 year and simply investing the difference. He explained to me that since I’m young, it’s nicer to have more money to play with and build up a savings, and that at the end of the day I could invest an extra few hundred per month and actually end up with a net benefit.

Does this actually end up being a net benefit, even if I know the bare minimum about investing? What sort of growth do I have to expect from my investments and when will it start to pay off? Which option is more appropriate if I decide to sell in 5 years?

Specifics about my situation:

I’m in my mid 20s, I’m in a cheap area so the house will cost me around 150k, and my interest rates are 4.25/30yr 4.0/15yr",finance
financialindependence,Input on spreadsheet,"Looking for input on my FIRE spreadsheet [download here](https://ufile.io/8lg2q) that I put together with the hope of making quick calculations about how future spending and earnings will impact when my wife and I (each 36) can retire, taking into account various assumptions about the future. 

The spreadsheet works by tweaking the various input cells (orange) until the final available spending cell (M21) is close to current spending input (P9).

--------------

B3:E5 is just our current savings, separated by account-holder and tax category. 

G3 is a post-tax ""windfall"" input variable that lets us imagine what winning lottery jackpot would allow us to achieve freedom. 

I3 is the assumption for inflation used in future value calculations. The growth assumptions below (column G) are all pre-inflation. All of the future value calculations in the ""savings at start"" columns use inflation-adjusted growth to keep the future values of expenses, spending, and savings in today's dollars. (For purposes herein, ""expenses"" are things that eventually go away or change, like mortgage P&amp;I and health care costs, and ""spending"" is everything else, including all other bills.) 

Mortgage principal and interest (P&amp;I) is the exception in that it does not increase with inflation, so an inflation discount is applied for future years, to keep the value in today's dollars - based on the current year's expense (L3). 

(The spreadsheet calculates this discount using an arithmetic mean, which is technically inaccurate because the decay in future value is non-linear, but the exact solution would require calculating an definite integral which adds a lot of complication for a small amount of increased precision which is useless in light of the inevitable larger inaccuracies resultant with growth and inflation assumptions). 

The mortgage inflation discount uses a different annual assumption input (J3) than inflation used for adjustments to investment growth (I3) to allow for conservative rounding in each assumption (up for investment growth, down for the mortgage discount). This also allows the user to enter 0% for mortgage inflation (J3) and increase the spending (P9) to account for closing costs, and model a scenario where we move every so many years. A separate calculation is required to determine how much to increase the spending by in that case. In any case, real estate taxes and insurance need to be included in the spending assumption (P9) because they are affected by interest. 

K3 is the safe withdraw rate - it's only used for the last step in the calculation (row 21) after all of the foreseeable changes have occurred and the model becomes steady-state/fixed-income for the remainder of life. Unlike all of the other growth assumption numbers on this spreadsheet, this is POST-inflation. The default value is 4%, which represents approximately 6% growth and 2% inflation annually.  

M3 is the income tax that my state and city charge - both are calculated as straight percentages, and this cell represents the sum of the two taxes. 

O1:Q4 are the current US federal tax brackets, with the maximum tax paid in each bracket in the adjacent R-column cells, and the standard deduction in S1. As the laws inevitably change in the future, these cells can be updated to update the plan. By use of inflation-adjusted growth, future value calculations assume the same rules apply but are adjusted for inflation (tax brackets remain 10, 12, 22, and 24%, but the limits for each bracket increase with inflation). 

Row 9 represents the working years (now through ASAP) where we earn more than we spend and save the rest in our traditional 401ks, Roth IRAs and a taxable brokerage accounts. The maximum allowable 401k contribution is entered in M9. The Roth IRA and taxable accounts are calculated based on the funds available after taxes, the mortgage (L9), and spending (P9)

Rows 14-17, and 21 represent various phases of our potential future life, over which time we see changes to our income and expenses, and become more conservative with our investments as the option to work becomes more difficult with age (thus decreasing the growth assumption with age). With the input assumptions (orange cells) on the initial download that's an income reduction to $20k/year at the age of 40, continuing until the age of 55 when we quit working altogether. At the age of 57 we start receiving income from a pension, and at the age of 65 we pay off the mortgage. Health care (column K) is introduced as an independent input for these years, because we would not expect to get it through our employers any more and costs may increase with age faster than with inflation. 

Columns L through N for rows 14-17 account for conversions from traditional to Roth that we will choose to make after we start living partially off of savings and earning much less than we are now. At a minimum we'll convert enough to ensure that our taxable income is below the standard deduction. We'll probably also want to convert enough each year to max out the 10% bracket, but the spreadsheet allows this as an option in column M to show the impact of this potential decision. 

In Rows 14-17, withdraws are made with priority to taxable accounts, then Roth, and with Traditional savings becoming available at the age of 60 (actually it's 59.5 but 60 is close enough). This does allow the spreadsheet to over-draw from the Roth accounts beyond what is available before the age of 60 (contributions and conversions only), so a separate calculation is required to confirm that you are not over-drawing from Roth accounts early. 

After the age of 60, in row 17, you can decide what % you want to take out tax-free from traditional accounts.

After the age of 65 (C17), the changes stop and for the rest of life we withdraw from whatever % we have in each account type, to ensure that in all future we pay the same, equal amount in tax. 

-------------------------

I'm primarily interested in any doubts about the math involved in putting together this spreadsheet. There is a lot of grey area in all of the assumptions, but what I'm hoping for here is an accurate model that allows me to see through various iterations how changes to those assumptions impact the results. Input into the assumptions is welcome as well, but my main goal here is confirm that the math is correct.",finance

personalfinance,[Budget] 2018 budget input,"**Edit** responded to a few responses before I head into work this morning. Will reply as I am able at work though realistically probably wont be too responsive till afterward approx 9pm CT. Will also add to / clarify in my original post some details I skipped over to focus on my main inquiry if I should redirect my retirement savings short term (like what I'm covering from savings, etc). Thank you everyone for the responses thus far.

*A little background: I am 30/m/upper Midwest USA, and 11/21/2017 I was totally debt free. At that point I was contributing to 401(k) up to employee matching, Roth IRA, and lavishing admittedly lavishly in the extra income I was bringing in through work and keeping expenses low. 

*11/22/2017 I bought my first house. 
12/30/2017 I bought a new car mostly on finance.

*Tonight I sat down and crunched the details as much as possible. My quandry I debate between is whether to shut off retirement contributions 100% and tackle the car loan, keep the 401(k) w/ employee match going and redirect IRA to car loan, keep retirement on course and cut costs elsewhere to throw money at loans, or etc.

*Going from 2017 numbers here is my budget for the strict needs going forward 2/2018. January is covered and I'll note my extras where I can:

*2017 YTD gross (12/29/2017 my last 2017 paycheck): $41,600
- fed taxes: $6,900
-Pretax deductions (insurance and HSA contribution): $2,800
-Roth 401(k) full 6% emplyr match: $2500
- Charity giving: $650
Net ""Take home"": $28,750
Net Percent Coming home: $28,750/$41,600 = 69%
Base pay: $15.46/hr * 40 hrs/wk * 52/wks = $32,156.80
Base times 69%: $22,188.19
Base net take home: $22,188.19/26 = $853, which i'm rounding down to $850/chck

*Essentials:
-House payment: rental $1000/mnth + $1,200 mort (PITI) = $2,200/mnth. GF is covering $600 going from half the rental to half the house. I have to cover the other $1,600/mnth
- Auto Loan: $150/month budget, $5,33 left payment due 2/13/2018 10.99% IR **priority to pay down**
-Auto Insurance: Estimate $50/month as paying on current '95 Pontiac, shopping witch purchase of the new car
- Roth IRA $210/month was 2017 contribution

*Net paycheck is $850/check
- $800 to pay rental and mortgage (rental is done 5/2018 at latest, then my share would be $300/check)
- $75/auto loan
- $25/ auto insurance (estimate shopping for this with home etc)
-$105/ roth IRA contribution
NET ESSENTIALS: $850 start - $800 house - $75 auto loan - $25 auto insurance - $105 roth IRA = $-155/check in the red, covering house payments / car / car insurance and roth. I'm not paying utilities/eating/etc. That is partially covered with going in I did save, so i'm hemorrhaging from my savings and emergency fund.

**One check/month I have a $500 bonus until april. after that its variable so I wont count on it (its likely to be more then $500).**
*
**Important thing to consider** My budget now is in the red and I know everything will be in tight. I got myself into this and prepared for it a bit. The budget I'm giving is base pay alone + $500 bonus till April. I am looking at other income sources (ex: friend renting, overtime) and I rounded a lot of numbers to be conservative.

*
**Tl;DR** I'm looking to adapt my pre-debts budget to ""I bought a car and house"" budgets"". I'm being really conservative intentionally but will be happy to give more info when needed.  Do be conservative you can assume I have nothing saved and worked from there.

CryptoCurrency,An Alternative Mindset to CryptoCurrency,"*Disclaimer: Every Coin I mention in the below I own and have owned for awhile*

With that out of the way, the point of this post isn't too shill any specific coin, but use real world examples to illustrate why I think a lot of the ideas and metrics thrown around here (and the Crypto Community in general) aren't using the proper frameworks to evaluate these coins as investment opportunities. 

First, **STOP USING MARKET CAP**. Seriously, it could not be a worse metric for the assets we are comparing. Market Cap is used to find the EQUITY VALUE of an entity or corporation. It is NOT the total value of an asset. These currencies are, in and of themselves, the total value. So saying that Bitcoin is more valuable than xyz company is not correct. Bitcoin is not a company and it has no equity value or cash flows. A more relevant comparison is the **M3 Money Supply**, which essentially includes all very liquid fiat denominated assets (and fiats themselves). If you take that view of CryptoCurrencies, they are dwarfed by other Currencies (US has an M3 of 13.7 trillion). You could also use comparisons to other hard assets, like Gold, which has a total value currently of ~$8 trillion. However, On top of that, it fundamentally misunderstands what CryptoCurrencies are. 

Despite the name, **MOST CRYPTO CURRENCIES, TODAY, ARE NOT ACTUAL CURRENCIES** and only a few of them even want to be. And because each Crypto represents a different addressable market, you can't use marketcap to compare them to each other, either.  Ryan Selkis had a tweet yesterday about Ripple being the a top 30 currency worldwide, which, of course, clearly misunderstands what tokens like Ripple, Stellar, IOTA, BAT, etc etc actually represent. Ripple's value isn't as a currency as you an I look at it, it's as a piece of technology to be used within a product. Same with the others. XRP is meant to be the settling mechanism within an electronic transfer mechanism. Currently, SWIFT transfers almost $1.25 Quadrillion dollars worth of transactions a year. XRP is meant to be that settling mechanism, which means that comparing it to other currencies as a valuation mechanism is incorrect, because that's not how it's being used. It's being used as a token to settle those $1.25 quadrillion in transactions. *Yes, I know there hasn't been widespread adoption of the XRP token, but this is illustrative*.

That brings my to my next point Ryan Selkis also had a medium article yesterday that said ""all utility tokens are going to zero"", which struck me as particularly narrow minded. **The fact that utility tokens are just means of settling a transaction and are then often immediately turned into FIAT doesn't make them worthless**, that's a fundamental misunderstanding of economics. First, you have to assume that there is a perfect equilibrium of supply and demand. Which as you see in a case like XRP above, wouldn't be the case. So XRP would, based on simple supply and demand, have a value because demand exceeds supply (same is true for the others). Secondly, the point becomes that even more mute if you take into account things like XRP (same for stellar) saving more on a transaction over that of a non-XRP currency designed by a third party, you see that the value is at least the difference in transacting fees. So even at a base level, if you believe XRP will be adopted by banks (i'm not saying one way or the other, but I do believe SWIFT is for sure on the way out), then it has inherent value as well as value based on simple supply and demand. 

Which brings me to my final point, given these points, how should we view the investing landscape. It is not fair to call it ""speculation"", that people might invest in Lumens, XRP, IOTA, ADA, etc based on their potential and not their current working products. Why is that? Because **ICOs are, for the most part, just seed and angel investing funding rounds**. No one here is calling out Andreessen Horowitz for ""speculating"" despite the fact that many of their portfolio companies don't have sales or working products. They use different metrics to evaluate prospects. What does the underlying tech (coin) look like? What is the addressable market for that tech (coin)? What does the road map look for adoption? **How experienced and good is the team?** Those are the types of questions I have asked myself as an angel investor in the past. And they are the types of questions I ask myself as a Crypto investor now. It's not about market cap or currency comparisons, it's much more nuanced than that.

personalfinance,"Maximizing money during 2 gap years, in anticipation of huge loans?","I've been lurking this subreddit for a few months now and I have learned so much. I'm incredibly grateful for all the information here, but I haven't found anything specific to my situation so I thought I'd try asking.  
&amp;nbsp;

I'm 22, recently graduated undergrad this year, and I'm planning to take 2 gap years before hopefully starting medical school (in which I'm expecting to take out likely 6 figure loans). I figured I should be maximizing my money in these 2 years before I liquidate everything for med school loans (loans have the highest interest rate and should be paid off before any kind of investing, right?). So my question is, do I stash all my money into a high-yield savings account to maximize 1.30% APY interest? Or do I put everything into short-term stocks via Robinhood (more below)? Should I put even a little bit in a Roth IRA (earlier is better, right?)?  
&amp;nbsp;

I started working as an intern with a 29.5k/year stipend ($2,425/month) and will be here for about another 1.5-2ish years. I'm technically not an employee, just an intern with a stipend, so I was told that my income taxes are different/less, but I'm not ""unemployed"" either. Another intern told me that taxes would be ~$4,000/year. I'm planning to apply to medical school this coming summer (guessing ~8k-10k cost for full cycle expenses), and then hopefully begin med school in fall 2019. My parents paid for my undergrad tuition (I'm very thankful), so I don't have any loans right now, but I'm expecting to take out a lot of loans for med school (my sister, who's a resident, basically an apprentice doctor after finishing med school, has 6 figure debt so I'm guessing it'll be around that for me too). I currently have ~$5,500 across my checking/savings at BoA (currently deciding which high-yield online bank savings account to switch to for emergency savings before closing my BoA savings account - good idea?). I've put $6,000 into Robinhood (I know short-term stocks are risky but I've had some success with buying/selling on dips/highs that fluctuate every few months, which has made me more confident and why I'm fantasizing about putting more of my money into it). I am living at home with my parents and have essentially no rent, utilities, etc bills, just help out with some minor stuff like gas etc. I've started budgeting and I can put away $2,200-2,300 a month now (much less when application cycle fees start).  
&amp;nbsp;

I would really appreciate any and all advice. Thank you.

Edit: I’m an intern at a government agency, NIH, if that makes any difference. They cover my health insurance. I’m not aware of any perks like matching 401k contributions (I’m pretty sure they don’t do that for interns since we’re not employees)",finance

personalfinance,"New college grad, at home for ~6 months, should I target loans or work on saving?","Hi personalfinance,

I just graduated undergrad this December with my education license (elementary school). I attended college in the Boston area and have now moved back home with my parents in a suburb of Boston. Happily, I was just offered a full-time teaching position for the rest of the school year in a city near me. I'm now wondering how to maximize my savings/finances over the next 6 months.

When I finish my position in this school at the end of June, I will be moving back to Boston for the next school year and teaching there, so I want to make the most of having very low expenses for now. My parents are wonderful and supportive, so they are not charging me for rent/food/anything while I'm at home. I'm now wondering if I should go all out targeting my student debt, or if I should focus on savings too.

I have $11,000 in student loans (all Federal/Stafford loans). Technically, I have 6 months before I need to start paying them off, but it seems like I should start now. There are varying interest rates for the un/subsidized ones:

* $3,409.61 at 3.4% fixed (Stafford subsidized)
* $4,173.67 at 3.86% fixed (Stafford subsidized)
* $3,791.14 at 4.450% fixed (Stafford unsubsidized)

I will also need to get a car to commute to this position, a used high mileage one in the range of $2,500, so that (along with $75/month insurance and gas) will be my only other expense. 

At this position, I will be making about $3,000 a month before taxes. How much of that should I put towards paying off my loans, and how much should I put into savings? I really want to take advantage of how lucky I am to have this 6-month ""grace period"" living at home, I'm just not sure how to make the most of it.

ETA: there is a loan forgiveness program for teachers who teach in low-income schools (which I plan on doing anyway because it is my area of interest). If you do so for 5 years, they will forgive up to $17,500, which would obviously more than take care of my loans. But as appealing as that sounds, I'm worried that if I don't take care of the loans now, what if I lost my job or something, and then didn't qualify for forgiveness?",finance

personalfinance,Gut check for 5 year plan,"2018, new year, new me, yadda yadda yadda. This is more of a thinking out loud and looking for feedback, whether negative or positive, on my 5(ish) year plan.
It's long. Sorry.

Basic info:

Age: 30 (in 2018)

**Income:**

* W2: ~97k, not including variable bonus. Very solid employment, not worried about it going away any time soon. Semi-Monthly pay. I work from home, so no commute and when I get work done during the day is pretty free-form.

* Side Business: Varies. Anywhere from $5k-$15k/year profit

**Assets:**

* $1k in an Ally CD ladder. 

* $1k in IRA

* This year I switched to a HDHP with HSA (My employer didn't offer an HSA prior to this year). I have two kids, their mom has them on state health insurance as a secondary to my health insurance so, pretty much anything mine doesn't cover theirs will pick up. So only health expenses should be mine. Expecting another child Q3 this year. Maxing out HSA as the family deductable is only $2500, and while I know the general consensus is to not touch HSA dollars, I'm using it as a before all taxes way to pay for medical expenses until debt is paid off.

**Debt:**

* $64k ($14k of that is a car loan for my ex's car that I'm on and she pays. I know this was a dumb move, at the time it was necessary. It's too far under to refinance, and will be paid off in two years).

* A couple collection accounts less than $2k total. Has to do with the ex situation, prefer not to get in to details, but working with the collectors on pfd/payoffs/etc.

**Monthly necessities expenses (not including debt payments):**

* $1819.88 (includes cell phone and internet expenses, since I work from home AND have a small business I consider these necessary expenses. Any expenses that are annual or quarterly are divided to find the monthly rate).

* Girlfriend pays food and gas.

* $1415 (minimum debt payments, not including ex's car payment). I can't, at least right now, refinance either the car loan (7.7%) or the motorcycle loan (you don't want to know the interest rate) due to both debt to value ratios and collection accounts already noted.

* Each pay, on top of HSA contribution, $50 goes to the Ally account which, upon maturity of the first rung of the CD ladder in September, will be added to a 5 year cd there.
$150 goes as whatever money.

I have two checking accounts that I use - one for bills (necessities as well as debt payments) and one for whatever money. Anything left in whatever money at the end of the month goes to debt.

So, total take home monthly, after figuring how much tax I should owe in 2018 and running deductions and such through the paycheck city calculator, comes out to be about $4800 (includes $1040/month child support, which is taken directly from pay. Don't what to get in to a discussion on this here.)


**THE PLAN:**

First, pay off debt:

* With take home at an estimated $4800/month, and expenses/savings/spending money, that leaves about $1165/month ""left over"". This entire amount goes toward paying off debt.

* The side business income varies. My plan going forward is 50% of any profit goes to debt, the rest I keep around for quarterly tax payments on business income and just kind of holding the rest.

* Any bonuses/gifts/basically any extra cash -&gt; debt.

* I'm currently playing with crypto. I put $100 in about 6 months ago, and let it sit. Within the past few weeks, I've been basically day trading. Current assets are around $1200. I'm not putting any additional money in to this, just using what's already there. If I get lucky and the value at any point tops what's left in debt, I plan to cash out and pay off debt.

So, working with just minimum payments + the 1165/month snowball and the avalanche method, debts are currently showing as getting paid off September of 2019. This should occur sooner based on business income, gifts, and maybe crypto working in my favor.

Once the debt is paid off, that will free up all but $31k/year. 

* I'll immediately start maxing out 401(k).

* Build 6 month emergency fund

* I'm going to need a 2nd car here soon. I can get by with the one I have with the 3 kids, but it will be tight. I'm thinking of just saving what I can for the couple months after debts are paid off and 401k is started back up and getting a second vehicle with seating for more than 5.

* I'd like to buy a house within at most 5 years. Could be here, could be somewhere else on the east coast (probably with a little bit higher COL).

What I'm toying with is that it looks like we're going to have a much better ESPP (initial communications showed a 15% discount with lookback, but a 2 year purchase period. Latest update that stated details coming soon indicated there might 2 different plans to choose from). *I have a 1.03% pay increase starting 2/1/18. I'm thinking about possibly just putting that salary bump in to the ESPP, especially if one of the options shortens the buying period but keeps a nice discount and lookback.*

CryptoCurrency,PSA: 1031 Like-Kind Exchange Does NOT Apply to Cryptocurrency!,"There is so much bias and bad information regarding this contentious issue, so I'm going to try to spell this out for your benefit and mine, **with citations**.

*As a foreword, please realize Forbes is not an authoritative source (neither is Robert Wood, Esq.'s click-bait piece that uses ambiguous language such as ""arguably"", ""may"", ""might"", ""one can always make arguments"", ad nauseam.); when in doubt look to IRS code, the new tax bill, burden of proof during audits, etc.--language straight from the horse's mouth, and speak with your tax professionals (preferably more than one).*

**Q: Do crypto-to-crypto transactions qualify for 1031 like-kind exchange (and therefore tax is deferred until the final transaction back to fiat)?**

**A: Definitive NO after 2018, ""most likely"" NO even before 2018 (I put the caveat of *most likely* here because technically you can argue it, but I wouldn't--for the reasons provided below).**

---

**1. 1031 Like-Kind Exchange is an EXCEPTION to the GENERAL RULE**

It's important to keep in mind the backdrop that 1031 is the **exception**, and not the general rule, to wit --

&gt;Whenever you sell business or investment property and you have a gain, **you generally have to pay tax on the gain at the time of sale.** IRC Section 1031 provides an **exception** and allows you to postpone paying tax on the gain if you reinvest the proceeds in similar property as part of a qualifying like-kind exchange. [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/like-kind-exchanges-under-irc-code-section-1031]

Moreover, the IRS actually already provided guidance that ""virtual currency"" does not qualify for 1031, as far back as 2014.

**2. Pre-2018 Guidance Clearly States that 1031 Does Not Apply to ""Virtual Currency"".**

The 2014 IRS Notice [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf] provides, and I quote --

&gt;Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an **exchange of virtual currency for other property**?

&gt;A-6: **Yes.** If the fair market value of **property** received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency. See Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for information about the tax treatment of sales and exchanges, such as whether a loss is deductible.

&gt;Q-1: How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes?

&gt;A-1: For federal tax purposes, **virtual currency is treated as property.**

While guidance is not law (now law in 2018), it does make the rule implicit and therefore hard to argue against.

Now some have suggested playing word games here with the IRS, that is, what is the container ""other property"", does it include cryptocurrency or does it mean other property not including cryptocurrency?  My take? ""Other property"" is not in caps, it just plainly means other property. When you trade Bitcoin (one cryptocurrency property) for Ripple (another cryptocurrency property), that is a taxable event. Just like when you trade a car for a truck, that is **not** a like-kind exchange.

&gt; In personal property exchanges, the rules pertaining to what qualifies as like-kind are more restrictive than the rules pertaining to real property.  As an example,  cars are not like-kind to trucks. [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/like-kind-exchanges-under-irc-code-section-1031]

But let's suppose you want to play word games with the IRS (which I don't recommend) and jump down the rabbit hole, you would be arguing up a hill and most likely fail -- why? keep reading.

**3. Correctly Reporting 1031 Transactions via Form 8824**

In order to *qualify* for like-kind exchange on a *qualified* property in a *qualified* exchange, you have to attach a form 8824 [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8824.pdf] and correctly report said qualifying transactions, not to mention retain the transaction records to back that up (the taxpayer's duty). Instructions here [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8824.pdf]. 

For argument's sake, let's assume you did this correctly.

**4. Get Audited and Prepare to Argue (Up the Hill)**

The IRS sends you a letter disputing that your crypto A &lt;-&gt; crypto B &lt;-&gt; crypto C, etc., do not qualify for 1031, get ready to rumble! 

During the proceedings, the **burden of proof** is on you to establish that yes, your crypto exchanges do qualify for like-kind exchange and you try your best to avoid a penalty of an understatement in your taxes reported. If the underreporting is substantial (10% or &gt; $5k, which is most likely), 26 CFR 1.6662-4 requires that you show that you have it on ""**substantial authority**"" of the 1031 tax treatment of your crypto pairs.

&gt;The substantial authority standard is an objective standard involving an analysis of the law and application of the law to relevant facts. The substantial authority standard is less stringent than the more likely than not standard (**the standard that is met when there is a greater than 50-percent likelihood of the position being upheld**), but more stringent than the reasonable basis standard as defined in § 1.6662-3(b)(3). [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.6662-4]

Here is how the audit will likely go:

*IRS Agent*: do you have it on substantial authority that your reported crypto A &lt;-&gt; crypto B &lt;-&gt; crypto C qualifies under 1031, understanding the 1031 is an exception to the general rule that you must report each exchange as a gain or loss?

*You*: (thinking you're super smart, you pull out the 2014 guidance and ask the agent) but look -- here it says that I only have to report a gain/loss when exchanging virtual currency for ""other property""!  But what does other property mean? It might be exclusive of cryptocurrency! (grinning as you think you pulled a fast one.)

*IRS Agent*: so let me see if I understand, your position is **that an exception (1031) to the rule (paying tax at time of transaction) applies to crypto because the IRS did *not* not call it an exception**. I'm sorry but that position doesn't meet the requirements of CFR 1.6662-4(d)(2). IRS precedent on like-kind exchanges are very narrow, even deviation in purpose of similar type property is not treated as like-kind... *cites string of precedent cases @ https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/0035005.pdf*

*You*: ...

*IRS Agent*: let's see, after adding back interest, and adding a 20% penalty, your tax debt comes out to $XXXXX, would you like to pay that in lump sum or in installments?

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Futures Are a Threat to Whole Banking System, Fears ECB Director","While major stock brokers are lining up to add bitcoin futures to their platforms, central bankers are apparently not too happy about it. A member of the European Central Bank (ECB) executive board has called the instruments a threat to the financial stability of the entire banking system.

In an interview with German financial daily Börsen-Zeitung, ECB director Yves Mersch sounded the alarm on financial institutions investing in bitcoin futures like those offered by the Cboe and CME. “There are now banks which hold positions in bitcoin. It is a matter for the supervisors to judge how big the risks are, he said. “What concerns me most, is when financial market infrastructures such as stock exchanges enter this business. That poses a major threat to financial stability.”

Regarding the systematic risks and his position on the central bank’s involvement, he explained: “If these transactions are kept separate from others, it’s a secondary matter who wins and who loses. However, if all the participants in these financial centers are jointly liable, that can create difficulties, for instance, for banks or the whole system. And if the banking system gets into trouble, there will again be demands for support from the ECB. I would say from the outset: we shouldn’t do this.”

The ECB director, who proposed just a month ago that commercial banks create digital cash to compete with the growing popularity of bitcoin, now claims that the cryptocurrency can’t become a real alternative to central bank money. “Money needs trust. Public currencies, for example the euro, have the backing of public institutions such as the ECB. Many of these currencies have no backing, nothing.”

As is common for bankers and bureaucrats to do today, he hyped ‘blockchain technology’ instead. “That’s a challenge we all have to face, especially banks. Each institution has to know that in the future financial intermediation will no longer be heaven-sent, but has to be fought for.”

Bitcoin trading itself is not at present an issue for monetary policy because “turnover is between €250 and €350 billion. The volume is therefore comparatively low.” Regarding the cryptocurrency’s massive 2017 price rally he added: “We are seeing speculative hype that might be a cause for concern. But of course individual investors are free to gamble. However, if something goes wrong, they should not come to us and say we should have outlawed it and protected them from themselves.”",cryptocurrency

Ripple,Clarification on XRP worth vs market cap &amp; price,"This is in response to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/7o233x/keep_hearing_xrp_will_hit_1000_guys_thats_about/), but I feel it's warranted a new thread.

#What is price?
That sounds like a very philosophical question, but it's not (in this context).

Price is simply a moving average of:

* Recently purchased QTY / recently spent fiat
* Recently sold QTY / recently received fiat

If someone lists 1 XRP for sale in the amount $50, and someone is stupid enough to buy it at that price (instead of $3), the price will become $50. But, they'd be the only one willing to buy it at that price. 

Every other sane buyer would say ""I'm not paying $50 for XRP"". Demand will adjust the value pretty much immediately back to $3 because that's what people are willing to buy at. Tough for the sellers wanting to sell at $50, there's no demand for it.

Just because the price instantly spiked to $50 doesn't mean that the value of XRP is all-of-a-sudden $5 trillion.

# So, what's the value then?

The most accurate representation of value for a coin would be the total net fiat spent for all circulating units, divided by the amount of circulating units.

Lets take a look of what it'd look like if XRP only had 10 circulating units.

XRP # | Price Paid
:-:|:-:
1| $0.05
2| $0.07
3| $0.10
4| $0.20
5| $0.40
6| $0.60
7| $0.80
8| $1.20
9| $1.60
10| $2.00

Now, in this example the market cap is $20; latest price ($2) × 10 circulating units. However that's *not* the value. The total amount of money fed into this XRP example is $7.02, meaning that all investors together have intrinsically made the value of one unit an average of $0.702

Now that all units are circulating, let's say that XRP# 2 (on the table above) is listed for sale for $2.50. If he finds a buyer, the net gain for that unit is $2.43 (since it was bought at $0.07, and sold for $2.50), increasing the total money fed into XRP to $9.45.

**The total value of a coin will never reach the market cap unless *all* coins have been traded for a net value of the latest price.**

___

If we explode this to the grander scale, with 100 billion circulating units, let's look at an assuming example.

Let's assume:

* Ripple is reserving 60 billion units, so 40 billion are in circulation
* 20 billion purchased for $0.10 ($2 billion)
* 10 billion purchased for $0.25 ($2.5 billion)
* 5 billion purchased for $1 ($5 billion)
* 3 billion purchased for $2 ($6 billion)
* 2 billion purchased for $3 ($6 billion)

In this example, the world has only spent $21.5 billion on 40 billion coins, not $120 billion (40 billion circulating × $3), or about 18% of the market cap.

___

# So, what does this mean for XRP's limits?

No one knows. The market will do what it wants. 

But for fun, we *can* do some shitty math and reverse engineer a ballpark with extremely assuming numbers.

Let's assume:

* The world is willing to pay into ripple 1/20 of its GDP (~$5 trillion)
* The trading behavior is consistent with the previous example (actual value is 18% of market cap)
* Ripple releases an additional 40 billion units into circulation (80 billion)

`5,000,000,000,000 ÷ 0.18 ÷ 80,000,000,000`

# $347.22 per unit max (if you didn't read, this is 100% pulled out of my ass for fun)

**TL:DR** Market Cap does not represent total value spent on XRP (or any other coin). A market cap could theoretically be greater than the GDP of earth, but unless you can find a buyer, that doesn't matter. Buyers may only want to spend up to $1,000, even though the price may be $10,000. In which case, the price would crash by an order of magnitude.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Debt free soon... continue to pay off car or follow the flowchart?,"I can't believe it, but starting next Friday I will officially be credit card and student loan debt free! I've lived dangerously paycheck to paycheck for about 2.5 years, but I've eliminated over $16k in cc debt and another $4k in student loans.

All I will owe as far as loans go is what's left on my car. What I want to try and figure out is how much interest (and time) I will save if I make double payments, or even more, from here on out. I'm not sure if I'm overthinking the math, but I can't find any calculators to do this either.

**Car info:**

* $33,638 original principle
* ~4.5% interest rate
* $12,120 left due (as of today)
* ~$10,000 car worth
* $625.03 monthly payment

**Personal info:**

* ~$2700 gross pay/month, or $23/hr
* $650 for rent
* ~$320-350 in utilities and insurance:
 * car+renters, gas/elec, water, phone, internet, gas for car
* ~$150 food/month
* ~$35 additional recurring charges (car wash, Moviepass)
* ~790 FICO score

Am I also in a good position to refinance? I'm under the impression that I can't refi until my car's value is less than the amount owed.

I'm a huge believer in the PF Flowchart, and I am currently not contributing to my retirement, but hope to do so soon. My plan just switched starting on 1/01/18 so the match % went up significantly (from a 20% of what is contributed to a flat 7% match cap). I also do not ""have"" an emergency fund, but at any point I could have, but I was just bulldozing money at my debts.

personalfinance,Should I be worried about a past Order of Prohibition for someone who works at my bank?,"I received an email from a relationship officer from my (national) bank. It looked a little fishy, so I Googled the officer's name. She's a real person, but the first hit was a 2004 Order of Prohibition as a loan officer at a credit union (which I also happen to belong to). It stated that the loan officer ""is prohibited from further participating, in any manner, in the conduct of the affairs of any federally insured credit union and any other institution as defined in Section 206(g)(7) of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. §1786(g)(7)."" I looked up the bank's number (to make sure it was legit) and called in regard to my email, and they connected me to her. I have no idea why someone would get an Order of Prohibition.

personalfinance,IRA vs Roth IRA when inflation is factored,"I currently make slightly over 6 figures in Silicon Valley, the most expensive place to live in USA.  I pay A LOT of taxes because I'm unmarried, no children, don't own real estate, and only work a W2 job.  When I retire, I will probably move to midwest living $50k in today's money, I don't plan on buying a house.  Based on that alone, doing traditional IRA is a no-brainer.

But what if when I retire, today's $50k becomes $150k?  And my ""income"" would actually be more than I make today?  If so, does traditional IRA become a bad idea?  Or do you think the federal tax brackets/codes will adjust with it?

Additional risks:
1. For traditional IRA, what if, in 30 years, USA becomes more socialist (no political discussion please), and like a lot of Europe, income tax becomes around 60% for most people?  If so, does that make my tax at withdraw IRA risky, when I play on retiring in 30 years?
2. Seems like the way to protect against #1 is with a Roth IRA, where you pay taxes now and you're protected against taxes later.  But what if the government has such a deficit that it changes its mind, and taps into existing Roth IRA for taxation?

Am I just being crazy, are those two risks pretty legitamate?  Am I missing something obvious?",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay for college with my 401k or with student loans?,"I have 1.5 years left to complete my bachelor's degree. I will not be working during this time. This is because it makes more financial sense for me to take as many classes as possible and obtain research experience, which will improve my chances of being accepted into a PhD program. 

Before returning to school I worked for several years. I have a good chunk of money in a 401k and own a home. I need $29,000 to cover living and school expenses for the next 1.5 years after accounting for the money I have in savings. 

 I am guessing I would pay a 10% penalty for pulling from my 401k and about 20% would be withheld for federal taxes. I think the interest rate on a federal unsubsidized student loan is about 4.45%. 

Does it make more financial sense to pull $29,000 from my 401k or should I obtain that money through student loans? I will not be able to pay on student loans for several years, as I plan to enter a master's or PhD program after getting my bachelor's degree. I will pay for living expenses during a master's/PhD program by selling my home, which I have quite a bit of equity in.

We have about $65,000 in savings, and make about $100,000 combined per year.

gaming,My Jam-Packed Video Game Party,"I hosted a birthday video game party which turned out to really awesome. I thought maybe Reddit would appreciate the ideas I came up with. Sorry for the lengthy post, the party was jam-packed. 

Here’s an album with some images:

&amp;nbsp;

**Level Design**  
I decorated and labeled the rooms in my apartment as levels. The dining room was a board game area called, ""Boardgame Boardwalk"". The living room was the video game area called, ""Rainbow Road"". Finally, my bedroom was dance area called, ""Dancing Dungeon"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Quests and Rewards**
&amp;nbsp;

The main quest was to participate in 3 different areas. You get a small token for completing a level. You must collect all three and you get to face the final boss. The final boss was a pinata filled with plastic bottles of booze and candy. You may think this was too much, but I wanted to make sure there was rotation in the rooms and that no one felt left out when participating in a level; getting people to dance is hard. I also created two side quests which had their own prizes as well. If you’re having booze, make sure to keep the quests simple. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Board Game Boardwalk - Play a game you get a game pawn**
&amp;nbsp;

I already had a bunch of board games to play, but I did ask people to bring their own if they wanted to play them. This level was in my dining room with a long table and lots of $5 stools from Ikea. They were easy to stack and provided ample room. Here’s a [link](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10135659/)

&amp;nbsp;

**Rainbow Road - Play a video game you get a Mario token**
&amp;nbsp;

I had three game stations to play games. Two Mario kart stations and one station for Smash Bros. It was important to make sure to set the stations in rows to prevent as many people from walking in front of the TVs. I decorated the room with Mario themed items from Party City. Here’s a [link](http://www.partycity.com/product/super+mario+party+supplies.do) 

&amp;nbsp;

**Dancing Dungeon - Dance in the dungeon you get a spider** 
&amp;nbsp;

I moved my furniture into my roommate's room for the night and had an empty room to dance in. I put Halloween decorations I found on a sale and a cheap dancing light from Amazon. This room was also a photo booth room since I anticipated there would be minimal dancing.

&amp;nbsp;

**Here are the side quest ideas I came up with:**

&amp;nbsp;

**Side Quest 1 - Pokemon Hunt**
&amp;nbsp;

Find all the Pokemon with the letters and unscramble to figure out the secret word related to Pokemon. Once you do this, you get a Pokemon tattoo. How I did this was by getting all my girlfriend’s Pokemon plushies and taping a piece of paper with a letter on it. I then hid them around my house. Alternatively, you can print out papercraft Pokemon.

&amp;nbsp;

**Side Quest 2 - Video Game Easter Egg Hunt**
&amp;nbsp;

Find all the Easter eggs with video game Easter eggs. How I did this is that I bought easter eggs with tiny dinosaurs inside and printed out IGN’s top Easter eggs then stuffed them in the eggs. Here's the IGN [link](http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/04/09/gamings-top-10-easter-eggs)

&amp;nbsp;

**Here are some other great ideas!**

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Photo Booth**
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I wanted to have a photo booth with props, but I wanted to save money on renting a company to set up the booth. I provided my own game props (ask your friends if they have their own), and I bought these official video game licensed Sunstaches. Sunstaches are masks, but they have sunglasses built into them. This was much cheaper than trying to order expensive video game masks and or waiting for a cheaply made mask from China. Here's the [link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I5BCHOW/ref=twister_B01I5UXMQK?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1)

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Potion Shots**
&amp;nbsp;

I was worried that I would get stuck on making drinks for people; so I decided that I would scrap that and just make shots. I found these potion bottles on Amazon, filled them with 3 different types of booze and put food coloring in every bottle. Two bottles equal a real shot.  Make sure to wash the bottles before using them and keep a Tupperware container so that people can place the used ones in it. It’s important to note to your party guests not to take them around the house. Here’s the [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L98ZJ7U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Birthday Wall Card**
&amp;nbsp;

I had all this easel paper roll which I was going to use a photo booth wall but figured out it was too much work. I realized that I can tape it to a wall. Once on the wall, I can have people write nice birthday messages with washable markers. I do recommend using smelly markers cause they are dope.

personalfinance,Proceed with paying off house?,"My current mortgage balance is 77K, interest rate is 3.37 for 15 years. I am not saving a whole lot in taxes for such a small amount.

I currently have 35k saved up. I have no debt, my cars and my Harley Davidson  are all payed off, as well as credit cards payed off every month.

I was thinking of borrowing 30K from my 457 and selling my Harley. This should bring the balanced down to about 10K for my home. However the interest to borrow from my 457 deferred is under 4 percent I believed. 

All though I am borrowing, I am borrowing to pay myself. It will be deducted from my paycheck each month. I am also maxing out the monthly contributions around 18K a year I think?

What if they have a credit card with an equal balance, however, it generates a lower minimum monthly payment? Say $200 min payment per month for the credit card balance but the interest rate on the credit card is 16%.

Is it better to payoff the lease (obligation of $433/month) or the credit card balance?",finance
personalfinance,"I screwed up with accumulating credit card debt, I need to fix it. Help appreciated.","I'm currently sitting on almost $25k in credit card debt.  In addition to student loans and a car payment, I'm making my priority this year to cut this amount by at least half.  

I have not missed a payment.

Basics:

Wells Fargo:  $22k @ 15.7% ($522/mo)

Chase Bank:  $1656 @ 18.24% ($42/mo)

Best Buy:  $1200 @ 0% ($60/mo)(zero interest promo period, payments on schedule for full payoff in less than 18 months)

Car payment:  $2300 @ 6% ($190/mo)

Car Insurance ($68/mo)

Student Loan 1:  $7100 @ 4.94% ($312/mo)

Student Loan 2:  $82491 @ 4.5% (462/mo)

Rent:  $600/mo

Commute (usually light rail):  $160/mo, plus parking

I also have a significant addiction to eating out, especially at work.  Add another $300/mo for that, at least.  I'm actively working on this one.


I have bi-weekly pay of about $1550 plus overtime pay (usually closer to $1700-1800 lately).

As for what got my credit debt so high, it was very gradual then very sudden.  Mostly it's been growing over the last 2-3 years with several trips and short vacations throughout the USA.  I've been paying with CC for safety reasons, but haven't been paying things off immediately.  I'm intending to take trips to visit family that are less costly this year and can be paid directly without a card.

Currently, I'm thinking I should apply my tax refund to paying down the car by roughly $900.  This should let me quickly pay the rest off and start putting that money towards CC debt on the Chase card, my highest interest card.  It might also allow me to lower the insurance premium on my car.

I'm wondering if consolidating my CC debt is a good idea to secure a lower interest rate.  I think it would also help me decrease overall credit utilization, as my WF card is over 90% at the moment.",finance

I planned on opening another CC account soon but my average account age is just over a year old and I'm worried that opening this account would hurt my score even more. 

Within the next two or three years I will probably be looking at buying a house and want to make sure my credit score doesn't cause my interest rate to be too high.

&amp;nbsp;

COSS on CMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/coss/

&amp;nsbp;

Congrats to all of those who saw the vision, and held on :)

&amp;nbsp;

**What's on the menu now?**

&amp;nbsp;

New UI in about a week or two (and it'll be gorgeous), Trading promos to resume, bug fixes, adding new coins, adding new in-house devs in Singapore by end of January, then by end of Q1/early Q2: New trade engine / API's to add liquidity and allow liquidity bots to operate therefore increasing volume greatly, fiat implementation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Where do I see this going?**

&amp;nbsp;

I like being conservative and taking into consideration extended timelines. I would see COSS at 10M daily volume by mid Q1, 

&amp;nbsp;

20-40M by end of Q1 (more towards the 40M if fiat/API's are released by then, or even just the API's), 

&amp;nbsp;

and 50-100M+ by end of Q2 (when both fiat and API's should be implemented, taking into consideration any reasonable delays as dealing with fiat implementation is a whole other beast in terms of regulations and whatnot, and COSS is very determined at being compliant)

&amp;nbsp;

**Putting things in perspective**

&amp;nbsp;

Binance Coin: 910M market cap (no fee split, but burning coin at a fast rate as they killed it and became #1 exchange worldwide in less than 6 months, mad props to them!)

&amp;nbsp;

KuCoin Shares: 605M market cap (done a great job at adding neo-based coins and other popular coins fast. Unlike Binance, it does have a fee split of 50% with holders, but will in the next few months lower it down to 15%, as was officially communicated by the team)

&amp;nbsp;

COSS: 56M market cap (coinmarketcap is bugged and shows only 60m coins in circulation, when in fact 104m are in circulation, therefore putting the market cap at 56m and not 34m). Coss has been admittedly slower with their progress, but on the upside it will stay forever at 50% fee split, and is the only one of the three that will have fat implementation. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also, later down the line, coss intends on having fundraising pools, crypto credit cards, and a crypto payment gateway. All of which will take a % of transactions and split it half-half with COSS token holders, making their token far more interesting in the mid to long term. 

&amp;nbsp;

Other options that were suggested to COSS (suggested, not guaranteed, but Rune is always taking notes when it comes to good ideas):

&amp;nbsp;

staking wallets (so we can stake stakable coins directly from our wallets on the exchange, and receive the staking rewards), as well as Masternode pools (so we can pool coins together and setup a shared masternode, and receive the rewards on a pro rated basis). Both these services would be subject to a 5% fee, again, split half half between COSS and the token holders.

&amp;nbsp;

As I've mentioned countless times, early adoption pays off. Taking leaps of faith pays off. I am personally very confident in the COSS team, and so are most of the COSS token holders at this point, despite the hardships, the understaffed team (being fixed with new devs soon), the bugs here and there. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've done my research, spoke with the team, got a feeling for the project and who they are, and then invested. I am very confident in COSS for 2018, it will be COSS's year no doubt. Market caps speak for themselves as well (50m vs 600m vs 900m) and shows that exchange coins are definitely a thing now. As always, DYOR and happy hodling :)",cryptocurrency
dogecoin,Taxed only when you sell or exchange (U.S. Tax Code),"So HODL those Doges.

First off, I'm not a tax guy or accountant, but I can read a boring tax document released by the IRS.

https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf

Cryptocurrencies are considered ""capital asset"" or property that can gain value over time.  So you are taxed on the sale or exchange of cryptocurrencies just like selling a house that has gained value over time.

When you sell or exchange a capital asset (your precious Doges), you owe taxes on the increased value from the sale or exchange (the gain).

So, let's say you bought 10,000 Dogecoins for $20 in May 2017, then exchanged them for USD or Bitcoin in December 2017 let's say $120. The increased value that you made, $100, is taxable. If you fall into the 25% federal tax bracket you would owe $25.  So pay up Americans.  It's your lucky day.  

If you fall into the 10% or 15% tax bracket you might catch a break.  Talk to a real tax person about that.

This also works in reverse.  If you lose value when you do an exchange or sale, you get to claim a loss on your tax return.",cryptocurrency

However, I’ve been doing research but haven’t been able to find a good program or source for the loan. So I came here to ask to see if anybody with experience in this, what they recommend.

personalfinance,"[DEBT] (US, WA state) Student Loans vs 401k Contributions","Hi all, first I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read over my post and give me your input.

So, I will be graduating in June, 2018 with some student debt, and have a job lined up starting in August, 2018. 

Details:

Company will be paying me $71k annually, or $1 365 per week. [Using this salary calculator](https://us.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php), I should have a net take home of $1 054/week in 2018. Company will match 50% of 401k contributions, up to 3.5% of my salary. So, if I contribute 7% of 71 000, or 4 970, they will match with 2 485. Job has full benefits.

My loans are:

22 500 @ ≈ 4.2% (Not exact, as this number is a few separate loans with separate issue dates &amp; small variance in rates)

42 000 @ ≈ 6.9% (Again, not exact, as this number is a few separate loans with separate issue dates &amp; small variance in rates)

My goal is to pay $400/week to student loans, totaling $20k per year, aiming to pay off within 4 years. 

Now, I have some questions. The overarching question is: Do I put the 7% max $$ into a 401k, and simultaneously pay off student loan debt? A secondary question is, do I pay off student loan debt vigorously, or ride it out for a while and enjoy more of my life in my early 20s? I know this all depends on the amount of income, interest rates, and loan issue dates, so I'd like to hear what all of you have to say considering all of my options.

Bills for me will be:

Cell Phone, Car Insurance, Housing, Food, Gas, and anything else for independents that I am forgetting. No car payments, though.",finance

personalfinance,Keeping Emergency Fund in Series-I Electronic Savings Bonds?,"So I've searched the web and can't find any financial sources recommending keeping your emergency fund in series-I electronic US federal government savings bonds. And I was wondering why that is?
1) Series-I savings bonds will have the same purchasing power in 30 years that they do today, plus some extra profit.
2) After 1 year you can redeem them at any time
  2b) After 5 years you can redeem them without losing 3 months worth of interest (which isn't a huge deal to begin with)
3) The bonds last 30 years
4) They can be redeemed instantly online and the money will be in the bank within 2-3 days, so they are almost as liquid as a regular checking account
5) There is no investment risk short of the entire government collapsing 

So basically am I missing something? They retain purchasing power, they have no risk, and they are completely liquid after 1 year. They seem like the best place to park an emergency fund, so there must be a reason that no one's recommending it, right?",finance

personalfinance,"I just got my first job in the field I graduated in. I now have a retirement Roth Ira but also a lot of stuff I need to pay for soon (back taxes, car registration, etc.). How can I start saving?","So I am a recent graduate who just got a job in the field I went to school in. Right now I am a subcontractor (read temp) who works 40 hours a week for $15/hr. This job pay me weekly so I have about $470 bucks after taxes every week if I get all 40 hours. This right now is my only income source. I guess I'm still technically employed at my other job which pays like $10/hr plus the occasional tip but that is only when they absolutely need someone to cover a weekend shift of something.  

&amp;nbsp;

As far as expenses go, right now my rent is $430 a month including utilities, a car payment of $256, food I've budgeted at between $250-$300 a month, about $150ish for gas, and then $120 for car insurance. For simplicity sake, about $1200 all together give or take.

&amp;nbsp;

If I've done my math right, I make almost $2000 a month minus $1200 for expenses. Also I have about $900 split between a 500 index fund and growth index fund at Vanguard.

&amp;nbsp;

What is the safe amount I could contribute to a retirement plan and still have money left over to save for other things?

&amp;nbsp;

Recently I had to get almost $1000 of work done on my car so I'm still reeling from that, plus my registration is expiring at the end of January and that will be about $300. I also have a service that will need to be done in about 2.5k miles and it the big one so I know it will be pretty expensive. I have about $1500 of credit card debt since I had to use it a lot when I moved up here to work. This also will probably make me look like an idiot but I know I also owe somewhere between $700-$800 in back taxes because I did my taxes wrong last year (for some reason I didn't figure out that taking disbursements from my mutual fund to use for school doesn't count as income. I know, I'm an idiot. Please get a 509 if you want to save money for your kid's schooling, or offer to pay the tax on it when they take they money out of a mutual fund or something). I actually found this out months ago but haven't paid the state revenue office because I just didn't have the money at the time. Keep in mind this is state tax I owe, not federal, trust me I did a correction and the IRS said I owe them nothing. I'm guessing because of penalties it has probably gone up so I'll have to call and see about what I actually owe right now. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm assuming that aside from the registration stuff, I probably should focus on the tax bill first, then credit card debt before actually starting to save money regularly. Would it be smart to just cash out the Vanguard funds and use them to pay for all of this stuff and then replenish over time? Or should I just leave it there and try to grind through this myself? Any advice on all of this would be greatly appreciated.",finance

financialindependence,'Balanced' approach to the 'Pay off the house or invest' debate.,"I personally understand that the 'best' financial decision assuming you can earn greater than your interest rate is to invest rather than pay off the house. I also understand the rationality of those who enjoy the thought of not having a mortgage for emotional/security reasons. I do not often hear of people offering balanced approaches to this issue, so I thought I'd ask about a particular approach I'm considering taking.

I'd like to pay down my mortgage as low as I can before refinancing to a 30 year loan. I believe this means paying down my mortgage to 50,000 (because much lower means larger companies won't offer a mortgage anymore) and then refinancing to a low rate 30 year mortgage.

The idea is that you have the 'security' of the lowest mortgage payment you can find just in case you lose your job. Even a minimum wage job could pay for the mortgage once you get it this low. 

From the investing side you'll begin investing as soon as possible once you have 'reasonable assurance' that you can't lose your house.

Is this already an idea others have offered in the past and I'm not aware of it?

Are there hindrances I'm not aware of to this path?

Have others considered this, but decided it was not worth the effort?

investing,Need input re: savings vehicles for children,"When I was a kid, my parents tossed my cash presents (from birthdays, etc) into a vanilla savings account.  Interest rates were much better in the 80's, so that wasn't a terrible play.  These days interest rates on most savings accounts are quite low, so I'm playing around with possibilities and want input.

My kids are 6mo, 3yo and 5 yo. 


Here is what I'm currently doing:  I'm keeping a ledger of the gift amount and date it was received, but simply tossing the money into my own brokerage account.  My plan is to do excel-fu later on and provide them a fair interest rate based on market performance and the date of ""deposit"".  My wife and I are in our mid-thirties, both employed with low six figure jobs with good benefits, are moderately aggressive in our investments and max our tax-advantaged retirement plans.  I'm not worried about us ""not following through"" on paying out.


While I think it is likely this money will go toward college or something else big, I don't want to lock it into a 529.  We are already contributing to those ourselves.


At some point, I do plan on splitting this money out and setting my kids up with their own accounts and that is where I need input.  

**1:** Are there tax liabilities for giving the kids THEIR money, that I kept in my accounts?

**2:** What child savings vehicles are out there that have no minimum or regular deposit requirements that actually give a return worth looking at?  CDs and Bonds seem like chump change.

**3:** At what age should  I make my children more aware of this process?  Right now, the five year old knows his money is going into the bank of mommy and daddy and I've actually set up pivot tables so he can look at his deposit history and current balance.  I give him receipts when he deposits and he saves those receipts - but he still as no concept of the value of money.",finance

Now we wait for the airdrop and exchanges. 



**Original Post:**

Here's why I am excited about it. 




* Partnership with Purdue Farms - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdue_Farms - a 6 Billion dollar private company specializing in poultry. If you're an American that’s ever ordered chicken, you've probably used their product. ShipChain finished its prototype last year and are launching their pilot program with Purdue *this* quarter. And that partnership is just one of many more coming. On telegram the devs confirmed more partnerships in the works that they won't disclose until they're finalized. 

* Former VP of DHL Global Forwarding is on the team. Not an advisor... the team. DHL tasked this guy to work on a platform project to fix the ineficiencies in the industry, and then proceeded to throw nearly a **billion** dollars at this project. Didn't work. What DHL didn't realize is that the platform needed blockchain, and thats what ShipChain brings to the table. The fact that DHL committed so many resources to solving this problem is a huge green flag that ShipChain is tackling something that needs fixing. They are trying to distrupt a *multi-trillion* dollar industry.


* Now go look up BiTA - The Blockchain in Trucking Alliance. This is an organization that includes UPS and FedEx: http://www.nasdaq.com/article/ups-steers-into-blockchain-trucking-alliance-cm880232
Guess who is the only actual ICO to be a part of that UPS/FedEx blockchain alliance? ShipChain: https://www.freightwaves.com/news/shipchain-joins-blockchain-in-trucking-allliance


This isn't something that looks to compete or rival Walton/VeChain, but to work with them. This isn't for BMW or Wine supplies -- its for the truckers and freight operators that deliver those products that VeChain and Walton will authenticate. I highly reccomend reading their section in the whitepaper on how the industry works now to see that this compliments Walton/VeChain rather than competes with them. 

ShipChain is raising 10M on January 15th for their public crowdsale.

personalfinance,Personal loan,"So I wasn’t sure about personal loans in the beginning so I took out a small one to consolidate some cc debt.

I took out 8k at 11% about 6 months ago and paid for  all but one CC. The last CC i just recently transferred to a card I’ve had for years for 1.99% (until dec 2018) with about $4800. I pay 202 per month on the personal loan and roughly 200 on the cc. 

In hindsight I wondered why I just didn’t get a loan Big enough to cover all the CC debt. 

I’ve been doing well with the other cards ensuring not to rack up any debt in addition to the personal loan. So I’m proud to say that  works  out but now I’m thinking of ways to really knock this debt out.

I was wondering would it be wise or foolish to take out another personal loan or ask my current lender for more to take care of the remaining cc debt. 

Based on loan calculators and the use of my own metrics, I used my current loan pay off of 7000 + 4800 for cc debt = 11800.  I  gave myself  an interest rate of 17% (I put it much higher than I think I would actually get just to see what the potential payments could be. My credit score is 734 according to CK) it showed to be monthly payments of 293 and paid off in 5 years-2023


Again, simulated, I don’t think I’ll get interest that high, and I already pay 400 monthly. If I pay the “293” plus the  remaining 107 per month as additional payments, I could pay it off in 3 years  2021.

CryptoCurrency,Why I'm interested in Bitcoin Cash!,"I started out trading Bitcoin in 2014 with the sale of a car that had been sitting in a garage for many years. I thought that value would do well in Bitcoin, and how right i was!  I read into the tech with all the available info online. I felt confident that this new form of money would change the world. It feels like just yesterday when the community started debating the scaling of Bitcoin. and the discussion was diverse and vibrant with new ideas. it seemed we could finally achieve consensus  on the issue. 

This is where my stomach started to turn. The community was silenced through censorship that would skew the debate.. This was not how a free market of ideas should flow. I was almost fed up with the debate and decided to invest in the other top cryptocurrencies that had a strong community drive. The community is what brings the tech to the world. this is the reason I fell in love with Eth. The conversation was always open to discussion and your voice was always heard. 

The Bitcoin debate had reached an ugly turn when UASF and UAHF was on the table.. This was going to be Bitcoins divide. It was clear the community on Bitcoin would find alternative Paths. I was happy to see each group finally continue their visions. Today we have that choice and can learn from both forks. What will be more usable in the future is hard to say.. 

Now i still have both and keep tabs on the communities, Bitcoin Cash has a strong urge to grow its base layer as a currency and have focused with on-chain scaling to bring Bitcoin to the masses. Bitcoin has chosen to further develop side chains in order to grow its user base. What grabs my attention to Bitcoin Cash is the grass roots movement to become a currency that is permission-less, cheap, and reliable. How far can they take big blocks is another discussion for the future. Its hard not to see the adoption of Bitcoin Cash as an alternative when Bitcoin has caused so many issues with backlogs and high fees. 

I was indeed happy to have Bitcoin back in its usable form when the network forked on august 1st.. I am one of those rare breeds that enjoy using the tech daily. It helps pushing adoption when you can demonstrate the tech to noobs.. this was my selling point in the early days when Bitcoin had low processing fees. I still remember the last time i used BTC to send 20 dollars to a friend to show him the power of being your own bank. I had always used the recommended fee and when i realized i had spent 5 dollars to send that transaction I was driven with anger! How could I have lied to everyone about this new amazing money that promised cheap fees when it now costs more than a dollar and up to send. Back then hardly anyone seemed interested in Bitcoin. it was labeled as a scam by most of my friends. I had to argue the keys points about what made it usable as a day to day currency and why they would want to use it before judging it. low fees and reliable transactions are super important in convincing others. I was not surprised when each new user got to experience using it that they completely changed their tune and got a little excited in the process.. this was an awesome achievement. 

Now I know it can be hot tempered in some subreddits about Bitcoin users bashing other Bitcoin users.. I feel the energy is driven from passion. I would like both communities to focus on the bigger picture.. we cannot spend another minute arguing about what we believe will work. That is why we have the free market and many coins to choose from. 

Now i wont hate on others for choosing Bitcoin over Bitcoin cash. We are all free to decide what gives value to us. I do hope Bitcoin can become a currency again, whether its on Bitcoin or a second layer. 

Its been a fun year for alt coins.. I have been playing around with most of the relevant coins. I have a stake in more coins than i can count with both hands..  As far as usability and ease are considered, Bitcoin cash is a viable alternative. There is a huge swing in commerce that will rely on coins being used today. We want more businesses to grow in this industry and they require a currency that works today which will be reliable and fairly cheap. Wallets are plentiful and projects have been revived.. what matters to me the user is something i can use to transact with and is a great store of value.. i believe Bitcoin cash has grabbed a lot of attention and is proving to deliver on its promise.. this has been driven by its community. and it is growing daily. 

On a last note, I am glad to be apart of this amazing new era of freedom.  May each and every new crypto enthusiast find what they are looking for. all the best for 2018, this will be a fantastic year for all of us.",cryptocurrency

Scores of defrauded customers sued Wells Fargo in a series of class-action lawsuits.

Wells Fargo then tried to defy metaphysical reality: It moved to block one class-action case in Utah by claiming that the arbitration clause in customer contracts on the real accounts they held at the bank also applied to the fake accounts.

The more records the Dow breaks and the more skeptical articles that float around the internet it seems inevitable that we will enter some sort of recession at some point (it’s just a natural part of the business cycle), and one that people believe will be rather harsh due to some of the monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve during the past recession. 

Anyways, I am relatively young (20) and haven’t really dealt with a recession and I was wondering if some of the older, experienced investors had any advice for dealing with the next recession. I don’t have too much money in the stock market currently but it’s a decent amount of my savings with a majority being in international and US index funds. 

What is the best thing to do? Should I just start building up capital to use when the recession hits and prices drop? Should I reinvest my portfolio into safer assets (which assets are the good for wearing out recessions)? I’m guessing since I am young I shouldn’t worry too much for the long run, and I guess I’ll keep whatever money I have in the market there and start saving more money rather than buying assets at these super high prices.

CryptoCurrency,Moonshots are 4/4! 75-400% (in 1 week) New Pick Today! KuCoin - ELIX,"Let’s recap some winners from this week. The moonshots are now all officially up between 75% and 400%, let’s hear it for DBC, BNTY, DRGN, and KCS. Not only has the moonshot list had huge gains, we have had other 100%ers in the last 10 days. XRP, BNB, NXT (80% if you were late to the party), ENJ, NEO, ICX, and XEM. Very few coin predictions have been complete misses and even the biggest flops (XVG) solely took 2 extra days to let the negative hype decrease. I think the method I’ve implemented is working in finding undervalued coins and holding through the impending hype. We have had a very successful week make sure you don’t forget to tip the dealer/researcher/Redditer who is putting in all this effort to share winners with you!

Today’s Moonshot KuCoin Pick: ELIX (priced at 9000 Satoshis, 1 week expectation 15000-20000 Satoshis).

If you need a referral link PM me!

ELIX is located on KuCoin predominantly, and with a market cap of approximately 25 million this is a true moon potential. If it approaches a very reachable $100million or $200million market cap the value of the ELIX will increase x5 or x10. I am predicting this increase to take place within the next 4 months as ELIX makes its way to larger exchanges. With how much $ is being driven into crypto and the total market cap of all cryptos growing rapidly, I foresee ELIX riding the wave of momentum to being our 5th successful Moonshot pick.

ELIX does not have an enormous team but their team posts weekly updates, is active on social media, has many Q&amp;A sessions and implements consistent expeditious development of their software. Unlike most coins ELIX has 2 full time Devs that have met every deadline to date (how is that for the crypto world? Setting the standard for professionalism!). Elixir’s purpose is ‘crowdfunding on the blockchain’ a blockchain niche that even the lending companies haven’t migrated into. The goal is decentralized crowdfunding, at a much lower cost. They also have a lending service and payment ledger which can be used to track and create loans based on agreed upon interest rates, length, and a detailed description. Mining has not yet been added but their approach is a holding method opposed to an electrical mining platform. With an extremely low market cap, a new niche blockchain sector, a price that hasn’t risen significantly with other alts this past week, and being 4/4 on past KuCoin picks; it is safe to say I have faith in ELIX.

I want to reiterate my position on holding DRGN, BNTY, and KCS, while continuing to accumulate DBC (until it has broken 100% returns). Profits from other exchanges should be rotated into KuCoin to take advantage of the unreasonable returns we’ve been able to attain there this week. The pick is ELIX for today! However, BNTY should continue its rise as it gets added to a new exchange. DRGN is not left to die by Disney and is leading the charge to get on Binance. KCS will win because it is one of the few exchanges still accepting new patrons, AND they give 90% of the trade commission back to KCS holders and as referrals.

I have approximately 30-40% of my portfolio in moonshots (I have a high risk tolerance) and every time 1 coin holding is disproportionately more valuable than the other I reallocate funds from the larger portfolio holding to the smaller holding. In this case DRGN is up huge (KCS is a hold for other reasons, the dividend and rapid site growth). DRGN being up almost 300% means 20-100% of your holding’s in DRGN should be sold and diversified between ELIX, DBC and KCS. There is no room for nostalgia. Make your %, and reallocate. If you are feeling attached to your KuCoin coins, sell ones on Binance and Bittrex and transfer more funds into Kucoin!

Tomorrow’s report will have another KuCoin pick as I was split between 2 for today, however with such a small market cap I wouldn’t be surprised if ELIX broke 1300 Satoshis today! I called DBC breaking the 1140 Satoshi price wall yesterday with the next one at 1470, DBC rose from 1000 to 1450 as predicted. ELIX is predicted to break 1150-1300 Satoshis today.

At what point should I consider professional taxes or even professional accounting?","*Tl;dr.* I work 2 jobs, purchased a house, and got married all within the last year. My side hobby is starting to become profitable and I might rent out one of my rooms starting in 2018. I normally like doing my own taxes and tracking my own $$. But with all these changes I am worried about missing out on benefits. Would it be worth finding an accountant? Or at least consider professional tax service?

*Income:* I work 2 jobs. I'm a Federal employee salaried at $67,000 and a part time job that makes about $14,000 for a combined gross income of just over $81,000. I'm considering renting a spare room to a friend starting in April. I've looked at r/legaladvice's landlord &amp; tenants guide and I feel confident that I'll be a functional landlord. I have a lease drawn up and I've read lots of cautionary tales. Additional income would be $5,000 per year from renting. My craftsman hobby just turned a profit this past year, I made $2000 profit selling my works. Normally my products are gifts or done at-cost, but last year i had some business commissions and I made more money than expected. If this trend continues, when do I need to declare this hobby as a source of income?

*Savings:* $10,000 in employer's 401k program, and $4,000 in emergency fund (aprox 3 months expenses). I contribute the max amount to my 401k that my employer will match, which adds about $5,000 combined each year. I'll be vested in the company this Sept.

*Expenses:* House was purchased with a VA loan $125,000 @ 3.5%. After all the other things, HOA dues, and property taxes, I pay $780/month for my home. Water&amp;sewage are $60, electric is $100 in summer, $250 in winter. Car is paid off, insurance is $50/ month. Student loans total $18,000 and payments are $380/month. No credit card debt.

Total debt: $143,000 

Monthly expenses: $1,370

Monthly income: $3,600 (after taxes, insurance, and retirement contributions). 

I eat out WAY too much, and I spend most of my unallocated monthly income on home improvement, project supplies, MTG cards, and travel. 

My wife and I have elected not to combine income yet, as she is teaching internationally and I do not rely on her income to sustain our stateside lifestyle. I know her take-home pay is about $25,000 after taxes. This will likely go up after she decides she's done teaching in China. My wife's student loans will be paid off after 5 years, I do not know the total. So far we have always filed separately. 

So, I guess there's 3 questions in that wall of text:

1. Should I continue to file my own taxes?

2. At what point should additional income be declared?

3. Is this whole financial situation significantly complex to justify an accountant?

**EDIT** 
So... It looks like there is little consensus on what I should do with a slight majority of the comments recommending I get a CPA that is NOT associated with a chain firm. I figure I'll have an initial consultation with a few of the locals here and decide from there.

personalfinance,"Leaving (losing) my job February 15th, starting my Masters Degree, question on how to pay.","First detail, I am leaving my job February 15th. Given that I am being ""encouraged"" to leave (differences of opinion with management), I will be eligible for 8 months unemployment in NJ. I am actively job hunting. I currently make $67k per year, and after my 14% 401k contribution and taxes I take home about $3600 a month. 

- Savings : ~$32K
- 401k : ~30K all in S+P 500 Index Fund. Employer matches half of 6%. 
- UTMA Money Market (need to move this money to somewhere more useful) : ~$13K
- Vanguard Wellington Mutual Fund : ~$24K. I occasionally put money in here, but dont have a solid structure to it. 
- Student Loans : $4200 at 6.55%, $1500 at 4.25%
- Rent : $1050/mo, pretty high and my girlfriend and I are considering moving to help her more aggressively tackle her ~80k in student loans. 

My near term financial goals are to pay off these loans, contribute to Roth IRA, pay for school, buy an engagement ring, and put a down payment on a house (maybe in the next 5 years).

Question time. I am about to start a masters program, of which I'll be responsible for paying $18K. I know I can afford it, but I want to pay for it intelligently to minimize my opportunity cost. The total payment is due upon starting the program. Should I..

- Pay it out of my on hand cash? This can come out of the UTMA account as well as my savings account. This would still leave me with a buffer that covers &gt;&gt;3 months of life expenses.  
- Get federal financial aid, and pay it off installments knowing that I will be able to pay the loans aggressively?
- Get a private equity loan and pay back in aggressive installments?
- Any other options I havent considered?

personalfinance,[Savings],"I recently opened an online savings account with Ally due to their 1.25% APY. With Ally the interest rate is compounded daily and I get paid on a bi-weekly schedule. Is it better for me to divide the amount from each paycheck I plan to transfer to the savings account by 14 or 10 and transfer that much each day (or each business day for the 10 day division) in order to maximize the amount of interest I receive?

Thanks for the help!",finance

I recommended investing it in a mutual fund or ETF so he wouldn’t be missing out on higher dividends and possible growth compared to his banks interest rates. However, he intends on keeping it in the savings account because he plans on using it for a down payment on a house in about 2 years. He also fears that he will lose money having it invested. Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Budgeting/saving ideas? Newbie here.,"Early 30's, married, have a 2yo and will have a newborn in May. We live and work in San Francisco. I think it's time I *adult*. 

I just looked at my Mint account Trends by Category for 2017 and noticed that I completely spent the $52K I made after taxes (full-time job), on a variety of things: 
$18K on Education (my student loans and child's day care),
$8K on ""food and dining"" (25% on groceries, 75% on eating out),
$5K on Shopping (mostly Amazon and Target, as I do most of the household shopping),
$3K on Misc (think: parking, copays, personal care, transportation, movies),
$5K on travel (half flights, half ""hotels"" that includes camping reservations),
$6400 in cash withdrawals which I have zero record of what I spent it on (besides paying my cleaner $60 every other week), and
I did put $5500 towards my retirement (each year) in addition to the 11% that's taken out of my paycheck (Gov't emp).

I pay my cc's in full each month (Quicksilver and Amazon Prime), but have maybe $1-2K in savings that is basically sitting there between cc bills. 

Questions/seeking advice on: 
 - because of how much I make, the 'pay as you earn' amount for my student loans is basically $900. So, I pay $1K every month (or try to). But I'm therefore, not saving that money. My justification is that my husband has plenty of savings so if we need anything big or have a disaster to deal with, he can handle it. I also believe in paying it off, so I'm trying to get there as fast as possible - though, I have $52K left.. so unless I can save in other areas, it'll take me a few years to finish. I'm at 6.8% interest, and every time I've tried to go with places like SoFi, I am given a variable interest rate which scares me. ***An option is to ask my in-laws (good relationship) to pay for my loans in full, and then I pay them monthly with interest... but at what rate? Or is it better to keep paying as I have been? 

 - How much should a Food and Dining budget be? $2300 was on groceries for the family. The other $6k was on a variety of restaurants, bars, fast food.. mostly from me eating out everyday for lunch and then going out for drinks with friends. I can confidently say I don't regret purchasing any food when I'm out and about - this feels like my ""win"" for working as hard as I do (employee, mom, wife). I wish to cut back on drinking out though -- I can see that being a big bulk of my savings in this category. That said, I'll take any suggestions on reducing this $6K (including the regular recommendations of making food for lunch). 

 - Does $5K on household shopping make sense? Amazon was mostly kid-stuff.. toys, kid furniture. Target is all the goods we need to keep the place clean and functioning. It probably includes some amount of groceries too. We bulk items like toilet roll packs from Costco - but those are paid for by husband since he had the membership there this year. 

 - $6400 in unknown spending is worrisome too - how do people budget this? Is it better to do the envelopes for eating out? Or is it best to just not use cash? 

Any other thoughts on how to save/reduce spending? Sending me to any specific wikis/threads would be helpful. I'm searching for those things myself, also. 

P.s. I'd like to say that we are not struggling for money, have a good place to live, are traveling and enjoying life well, between our two incomes/savings and lifestyle choices. That said, I am at a place in life where I realize things like cooking more and not eating out as much, or drinking as much, would be good for my long-term health and financial sustainability.

personalfinance,Should I refinance to escape PMI and get a slightly lower interest rate?,"I'm trying to figure out whether or not it's worth the cost of refinancing right now. Here's my situation:

My wife and I bought our first home in 2013 and did a 3% down traditional mortgage through Wells Fargo. Since then we've been putting an extra $100/mo towards the principal.

- We have $154,000 (or 88%) left to pay on an initial loan of $175,000. The PMI automatically drops away at 78% OR we can pay for an appraisal and have them remove it if they think our home has appreciated (very likely)
- Monthly cost of PMI is $150 (or $1800 / yr)
- Interest rate is 4.375%
- Our credit is good (both in high 700s)
- We have no immediate plans to move because the housing market around here (Portland Oregon) is insane. Otherwise we'd be looking at buying something larger.

I've been having a hard time trying to figure out exactly how much refinancing will cost (and obviously I don't want to roll that into the new loan as friends have suggested).

personalfinance,"University cancelled ~$2000 of student loans that I was awarded in the previous two semesters due to an oversight on their part. Now the amount is ""past due"" and I have 2 weeks to pay in full. Can they do that? What are my options if I want to continue school?","For a little more clarification, I'm an undergrad student who attended college right after high school (&gt;6 yrs years ago) but had to drop out for financial reasons. Two semesters ago, I was finally able to return to college by transferring to a cheaper school. So far I've used a combination of loan and grant money to cover as much of tuition as possible, and I paid the rest out of pocket via a monthly payment plan. I made every payment on time in the previous two semesters, and my account statement showed a past due balance of $0 as recently as last Thursday. Over New Year's weekend, I checked my account again to find out when this semester's financial aid would be dispersed, and now my account shows a past due balance of over $2000, which seemed odd, so I called my school's financial aid dept. 


Apparently, I reached my limit for Direct subsidized loan money during my first stint in college, but since all of my old student loans are consolidated, it took my university nearly 8 months to review my eligibility and notify me of this. Now they're saying I have to pay the entire amount of subsidized loan money from the past two semesters in full (&gt; $2000), or risk being dropped from my classes this semester. The person I spoke to on the phone said there's no option for a payment plan since the money is considered past due, and I have about a two week grace period before my classes are dropped for nonpayment. I'm a full time student with a part time job, and my savings amount to just enough to pay the first installment of this semester's payment plan, so I can't come up with that much money in two weeks.


Can they legally just take back loan money retroactively like that, months later, without warning? If they had told me this during or after my first semester, I wouldn't have signed up for a second semester, and I would have just worked full time for during that time to save more money for school. Instead, they let me finish two whole semesters and register for a third one before pulling the rug out from under me a few days before this semester's tuition is due. Hell, if I hadn't been constantly watching my account, I wouldn't have even known when or why it changed.


If there's nothing that can be done to postpone or reverse the charges, does anyone have any tips on where I might go about finding student loan money on such short notice? In total, I'll need something in the $3000 - $3500 range, to cover the past due balance as well as the portion of this semester's tuition that the loans were originally projected to cover. I'm looking for loans with reasonable interest rates and repayment schedules.


**tl;dr -** Undergrad transfer student on my second attempt at college. New school awards me &gt; $2000 in subsidized loans, split up over 2 semesters. 8 months after the first semester, they say I wasn't actually eligible for the loan, retroactively takes it back and says the balance is past due. School won't let me add it to my payment plan. I'm wondering if they're allowed to do that, and if so, looking for good options to pay it back before I'm dropped from my current classes in 2 weeks for nonpayment.",finance
personalfinance,"200k in student loans, ~90k salary, need advice.","I'm 28, just graduated from a professional school, 2 months into my job, my monthly take home is about 4.5k - 5k a month but this varies depending on how many shifts I work per month. My income should also increase annually as my career progresses. Interest rates of my loans varies from 3% to 7.3%. I currently have 5k in a HYSA (ally) and 8k in my checking. I am not eligible to contribute to my 401K until I work at least 1000 hours. I am on a 25-year loan repayment plan and enter repayment this month which is ~$1,200 minimum monthly but plan to pay more towards the higher interest loans with whatever extra I have left at the end of each month. No car or CC debt. Only debt I have is my student loans. I want to pay this off ASAP but at the same time I want to save on the side for future investments as well (house). 

The following is the breakdown of my expenses:

* Student Loans - $1200/month 
* Rent - $400/month (living with family atm)
* Cellphone - $60/month
* Gas - $120/mo
* Food/Groceries - $200/month
* Other expenses - ~$200/month

Assuming I take home 5k monthly on average, I would have around $2820 for personal/extras. I plan on putting $1,000 of that towards my savings every month (EF, house down payment, wedding) and another $1,000 towards my highest interest loan until it is paid off. That gives me about $820 for misc stuff.

personalfinance,"Lender suggesting breaking jumbo loan into two, to avoid PMI","We're shooting for a $1.2M property, and we have around $220K saved for downpayment + closing costs, so we don't quite have the 20% required for a Jumbo loan. More like 17-18%.

I hear it is possible to do a conventional loan with less than 20% down, caveat is you pay PMI until you reach 20% equity. Is this possible with a jumbo loan too?

The lender suggested another solution,

&gt; The first scenario is a 20% jumbo loan scenario.
&gt; 
&gt; The second scenario is a 15% down payment/combination loan scenario.
&gt; 
&gt; In this option, you would put down 15% instead of 20%.
&gt; 
&gt; We would do an 80% 1st Mortgage, and then do a 5% 2nd mortgage, and you put down 15%.
&gt;
&gt; The 1st would be a 30 year fixed loan.
&gt; 
&gt; The 2nd could be either a home equity line of credit, or it can be a fixed rate/fixed term loan (5-20 year options).

I understand there are buig benefits to avoiding FHA or ARM loans, but I don't fully understand this solution, is there a catch here, other than the fact that the smaller loan might have a really high interest rate? Also, how would having this second line of credit open affect my credit score?

CryptoCurrency,Too late to get back into crypto?,"So I started following crypto back in late May, I just got my first job (freshly 18 at the time, almost graduated). I went on 4chan's /biz/ board to figure out basics on where to bank and what to do for investments (I was thinking savings accounts, funds, etc.). I got alot of people talking about this crypto currency stuff, and I got curious. I was such a noob that when someone mentioned Etherium for the first time, I thought they were talking about a metal (like platinum or gold). Fast forward a few months and I'm a crypto junkie, I followed all the news, checked coins daily. I remember so many times I was going to buy into coins, I was going to buy ANTcoin in late June when it was still $2.50 a coin, then it shot up. Late July when Bitcoin was at about $1700 I was gonna buy, and I couldn't and it went up and never came close to that price again. I really wanted to buy ARK at $.60 , then it shot up, not to an unreasonable amount, but still by several 100%. 

The reason I missed so many of these buys? My federal credit union would not let me purchase with my card. I got some speech about insurance purposes and security risk, which is all good and well, but I have them vocal, recorded, express permission to let me purchase this with my card. They gave me a one time 24 hour thing, followed by a ""be grateful because this is the only time you are able to do this"". When my purchase for one whole Bitcoin (about $1900 at the time and more than I ever had) didn't go through, I went down to that credit union and cancelled my account. I don't like banks, only credit unions, so at the time I had no place to put my money. Another big factor was living in NY, and because of the absurd fees this awful state puts on exchanges, I could only use a select few, so I couldn't find any to use PayPal or some other form of payment on. After the Bitcoin split I stopped following, I was hoping it'd fall momentarily after that but never did

On top of this I had Robinhood and would watch multiple stocks daily. My main was Arotech, but that price hasn't gone anywhere since so I'm not complaining.

My big problem is, I say through the entire summer, which was hell on multiple coins, and once college started I was so dishearted by my credit union not letting me spend MY OWN money, I just stopped following. Every once in a while I look at prices and get upset, but I don't let it get me down.

I really do believe crypto currency has a future, and want to get it on it, but I fear it's too late for someone of my funds to get in on it. I tried convincing my father several times, but older people are never comfortable with the ""unreliable"" tech, and won't invest. 

Well, I'm 18, I have a decent knowledge of stock and crypto trading, and want to start investing again. Im not shooting to be a millionaire, I just want something where I can live very decent in a decade or so, on top of what I'll be making depending on what I do for work after college.

I'm not asking for coin advice, or stock trading tips, I'll do my own research, just words of wisdom for how to get back into it, where to start and what to watch for in the coming months

personalfinance,Swamped in credit card debt and wondering if I should transfer,"Hi friends, I'm 25 and have made some pretty bad financial decisions and struggled through some hardships in the past 2 years. Long story short, I have some significant debt I need to start fighting.

I have 3 credit cards and 11k debt in total. My first credit card has a stupidly high interest rate and unfortunately, since it was my first, has the most debt (about 7k). I've been researching into transferring credit onto another card with a hopefully lower interest rate and there are a few I could apply and I'm hoping to get some guidance.

The first card I can apply for has a 0% intro APR on balance transfers and 0% APR on purchases for 9 months. However, after that the APR will be 23.99% variable.  The first 4 months have a $0 balance transfer fee. After that it's 3% for each transfer.

The second card has 0% APR for 15 months for purchases and balance transfers made in the first 60 days. After that, it's also a 23.99% variable APR and a 3% fee on transfers.

There's no annual fee on either. I've only looked into these two and a few others I doubt I would get approved for. If you guys have any suggestions, I'd love to hear em!

My credit score went from 750 to 610 within the past 6 months, so I don't think I'd get a credit line about $500-1000 on either. Ideally, I'd like to transfer the maximum amount from my first card to the new one and can pay 200-300 a month off. With my current card, this kind of payment barely chips away anything after interest. 

Is this a smart move? I've been pretty ignorant of personal finance and haven't ever had a support system with it, so I'm sorry if this is a totally stupid question. I'd love to get some advice on this!",finance
personalfinance,Question about paying off an extremely small student loan that is not my highest interest rate,"I have several student loans. All of them are over a thousand dollars each, except one which is just $81.45. I have been paying the minimums on all my loans and then putting extra money towards my highest rate loan.

Now, to be clear, I absolutely know why this strategy minimizes how much I will pay in the long run. I am not questioning it.

My question is this: In an extreme case like this, where one loan is so small, would it be wise to get rid of it? My thinking is that it could possibly have a positive effect on my credit score, which might outweigh the negative effect of paying in a non-optimal way this one time.

If the loan was a couple hundred more I wouldn't consider it and if it were $50 less I'd probably just do it because it's already so little. It's an awkward spot where $80 isn't nothing, but it's also not a back-breaker to pay it. So I figure I'll get someone else's input.

Also, just for a bit of context, the minimum payment on it last month was $0.55, so it's not like it's going away anytime soon unless I decide to wipe it out.",finance

personalfinance,19 y/o College Student Needing Advice on Student Loans,"I'm not exactly sure where to start, but I'll try my best.

I'm a 19 y/o college student going to [insert name of generic expensive college here] and honestly, despite taking a Personal Finance class in HS, I only learned how to play the stock market (not useful right now...).

Here's the gist of it: I have 6 student loans right now, and more to come. 4 are federal loans, totalling $13-14K. The other two are loans with Sallie Mae, with an 11% interest rate. One is just under $30k and the other is about $16k. The federal loans are not accruing interest right now, the Sallie Mae ones are.

This is where it gets complicated: I've got about $2.5k in a savings account for an upcoming major surgery. However, depending on the information I get from my insurance, I might not have to pay for the surgery. This leaves the money up in the air. I'm torn between 2 things - keeping it squirreled away for an apartment after college (first month, last month and deposit) or using SOME (not all) to pay off my student loans.

Additionally, I have about $400 in my checking account that my school gave back to me because a student loan covered too much. I'm not sure which loan, but obviously I want to put it towards one of the Sallie Mae loans, I'm just not sure which one.

I should also note that I am lucky enough to have my parents paying the minimum on both loans, $50 monthly, but the amount on the loan only seems to be going up. Why is this?

I also work for minimum wage ($10/hr) plus tips (between $2 and $30 a day) part time at a local cafe. Most of this money goes towards food and entertainment, however I can cut down on costs if it will significantly impact my student loans to invest it instead.

Honestly I'm not sure what to do, and the amount I'm debt is scaring me and I'd like to pay it off as fast as possible.",finance

My employer will match 50% of that, so yearly I will effectively contribute 27,750 to my retirement. I am presently contributing it all pre tax, but a lot of people I know are saying I should be doing post tax instead. I think my reasoning for pre tax is sound, but want to run it by this group so here goes.

I live in CA and make ~180k per year. That means that my marginal federal tax rate is 32% and my marginal state tax rate is 9.3%

By contributing pre tax, I am reducing my taxable income by 18k yearly I save myself $7640 in taxes.

I can invest these tax savings in a good ole mutual fund and have the same amount of money that is not spent on taxes or retirement.

I assume I contribute the same and these accounts grow for 40 years @ 6% per year.

Now in the pre tax world when I retire I have two accounts. My 401k (worth 4.5 million) that I can withdraw from and pay a similar amount of taxes to what I pay now. However, I also have this other investment fund which I can sell off assets and pay capitals gains tax on that is worth ~1.2 million.

That account will grow by ~70k per year. Assuming I sold that growth, I would have ~62k per year after taxes. So pretax investing would be ahead as long as I don't need to pay more than 62k per year in income tax while in retirement. Even if I still lived in CA, I would only pay that much if I withdrew &gt;200k per year from my 401k account.

That seems like less money than I would actually withdraw so in the long run I make more money by investing it all pre tax. Am I missing anything?",finance

btc,Bitcoin as a tool; A Decentralized and Global Stock Exchange,"I posted a link to my yours.org the other day, but due to that sites activity being far less than this site, I've decided to upload my posts here for at least a little while, and will continue to post updates here if people find them interesting. As my previous post stated, all input, positive and of course negative is more than welcome. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Coloured Coins; the Basics:** https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ne47b/coloured_coins_the_basics_non_technical/

&amp;nbsp;


This post is an extension of my ""Coloured Coins; the basics"" where I touched on the concept of coloured coins and how it relates to Bitcoin (cash), the blockchain and the decentralizing movement we are currently seeing develop within finance and economics in the form of electronic peer-to-peer payment systems. I will be expanding upon the idea of a decentralized and global equities exchange that can be made possible by the use of coloured tokens on Bitcoin. 

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of people within this cryptocurrency space found themselves here, not through an interest in finance or economics, but instead through computer science and programming, or even just an interest in gambling or playing with new and interesting tech. For those of you who know nothing of finance and economics and who have never bought or sold a stock in a company, I will briefly explain what equity investing is and then how coloured coins can change the current methods used today. Typical methods of investing see an individual buy a small portion of a company that they believe will yield positive profits into the future. By purchasing 0.1% of the company, they entitle themselves to 0.1% of that companies profits, paid out in the form of a dividend. These holdings are called stocks, and they are bought and sold through the use of stock exchanges typically contained within a country (currently, there is no global stock exchange). If you've ever heard someone say; ""You can't invest in Bitcoin, you can only hold and speculate on its price."", they are following the belief, that because you are not purchasing equity in a system designed to return a profit, you are not investing in the traditional sense. 

&amp;nbsp;

To purchase Bitcoin is not the same as an equity investment in a company that yeilds profits for shareholders; paid out in the form of a dividend. Bitcoin is a tool, not a system of value creation. It can be seen as an investment and perhaps its primary use right now is just that; a speculative investment, but I believe when we pass this initial adoption phase, and the tool starts to shine in the ways its truly meant to, thats when things get fun. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Bitcoin as a tool; A decentralized and global stock exchange**

&amp;nbsp;

My previous post touched on this idea of a blockchain based, Decentralised Stock Exchange (DSE), built on top of the Bitcoin (cash) protocol. This is not my original idea, and I am definitely not the first person to expand upon it, I do however have a passion for finance, and felt this idea deserved a post of its own due to the nature and magnitude that this could change the current global equities markets. I've talked about how coloured coins open doors to making a DSE possible, the point of this post is to explore it in more depth, talking about what it could look like, and why I (and many others I assume) would want it to exist. 

&amp;nbsp;

Before we talk about the how and why of this DSE, lets briefly cover how stocks have been traded in the past and how the trading is currently handled. 

Before the introduction and wide spread use of the internet, stock trading was typically handled by a person known as a broker. For the average person to purchase a stock, they would seek the services and usually advice of a broker on which stocks they should buy. This service came with a hefty fee that made investing more niche that it is today. If you were looking to invest $1000 into the market, but you didn't know how or what to purchase, you would enlist the help of a broker. This consultation could very easily take an hour or more and cost around $100. A typical healthy yearly return for a stable blue chip or index fund (a collection of blue chip stocks) in the market is anywhere from 8-12%. This essentially means, that prior to the adoption of the internet, an individual looking to invest $1000 would need to sacrifice a good years worth of returns (10%) in fees, and thats not even factoring in the opportunity cost associated with letting that money sit in a 4% savings account in the early 2000s instead. Very few, if anyone would have purchased less than $2000 or even less than $5000 at any one time with fees of around $100. 

Fast forward to today, and what do we have? To purchase stocks now, an individual will most likely seek advice on the internet, and use an online service provided by his or her bank that allows the user to trade on the stock exchange within the country. Use of this service comes with a brokerage fee, however, due to the automation from the program, trades are faster and less human recources are expended, so fees are lower. In Australia a typical brokerage fee to purchase a packet of shares online would be $20. In todays world, interest rates have fallen and the stock markets, especially within the first world countries, have become a lot more efficient (approaching a theory known as the efficient market hypothesis), and thus returns are lower. So that $20 that doesn't sound like a lot, can bite into your returns if you are purchasing only a small amount, which we will explore now. Lets say you have $500 that you are looking to invest in a low risk large collection of shares such as an index fund. That $20 now equates to 4% of your total purchase. In the current market, a good year could return roughly 8%. Now you've sacrificed half a years profits (4%) on just the purchasing of the stock. I believe with the methods of purchasing stocks we have today, to spend less than $2000 on any one transaction is inadvisable (this means that you are paying a 1% fee of your initial investment). 

So we've gone from $5000 to $2000 for a reasonable purchase, for some people these amounts are affortable, but many more people looking to invest just dont have that kind of money ready to park and leave in the market long into the future. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now we are getting to the next step in this process; the blockchain model. By allowing companies to offer up equity in the form of nonfungable coloured coins ontop of a decentralised global public blockchain, you have opened this market up to everyone with an internet connection and any amount of spare cash. I see no reason why fees would need to exceed anything past a couple of cents, if they were too high, another person would be able to implement a competing system with lower fees due to the open source nature of the Bitcoin protocol. Transactions would be as fast as any other on the network, and individuals would be able to buy or sell equity across country lines without banks and government regulations. By building an equities exchange on top of Bitcoin, every person with an internet connection would have access to buy or sell equity in a company from anyone anywhere on the planet, essentially instantly and basically for free. This is an anarchists dream, it could usher in a new era in globalised trade, that in so far as Bitcoin is unhackable, would be completely secure.  

&amp;nbsp;

Lets talk about regulation and IPO requirements

&amp;nbsp;

In Australia the current requirments for a business to go public on the stock market through an initial public offering (IPO) are as follows; A minimum of 300 non-affiliated investors at A$2000, they must offer up a free float of 20% in equity, they must pass a profit test whereby they are required to have consolidated A$1 million in profit from continued operations over the past 3 years, as well as A$500,000 profit from continuing operations over the last 12 months, or they are required to have either A$4million in net tangible assets, or A$15million market capitalisation. These figures can be found at http://www.asx.com.au. 

&amp;nbsp;

The specific details don't matter, what matters is; companies need to be large and selling equity is not currently a possibility for the vast majority of small and even medium sized businesses. And on top of that, the current model also requires a set of ongoing and public financial reporting that all past, present and future share holders must have access to. The blockchain model would not only allow more people to buy stock in companies across the planet, but it would allow smaller businesses the opportunity to raise capital by selling equity; a system of financing that has potential to bring massive growth to those its available to. However, this is where things can get dicey. 

&amp;nbsp;

Some would argue these stock exchange markets need governing bodies to oversee that things are done properly and that businesses can't scam or mislead people into purchasing stock that they otherwise would not have, had they been privvy to all the information. My personal opinion on this is that I don't know for sure whether a decentralised exchange would be able to succeed in a world that lacks centralised regulation, however I tend to believe less regulation is more often better than more, and if there became a demand for regulation/oversite, then perhaps a private business that monitors and confirms the legitimacy of companies that are trying to sell equity on the blockchain would be set up. This company would sell this service, and their reputation, business model and profits would be effected if they were found to be dodgy, thus they would have incentive to maintain legitimate practices. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thats all I have to say on the topic of decentralised stock markets. The prospect excites me a great deal, and I look forward to hearing what you guys think.

financialindependence,Just hit half-a-million!,"Hit a new milestone tonight.  Just wanted to share with someone.  Started at 23 with nothing, but did have a decent job starting in a call center.  

13 years later, I hit half a million in Net Worth, and I just bought my first investment property! (I will close on it in February)

https://imgur.com/a/aPsYg

Edit: I've had a few PM's and enough people ask what I did to achieve this.

Quite frankly, I treated debt like it was a plague.  I didn't get my first credit card until I was in my early 20's, and I've *never* carried a balance.  I never went to college, so I have no college debt. (This is probably a major factor in my success.)  I'm not going to knock college education, and I don't want anyone thinking that not going to college is the way to get this kind of money, but it was a major contributor to my success.  Not having a college debt, and just working hard and learning in a computer technical field (one of the few fields where college used to not matter as much unless you were a programmer) contributed to my success.  I focused on scripting languages, and became so good at them, that I built automated systems for companies.  
*I want to be clear on this.*  Experts say college degrees are still the best way to get ahead financially in life, and that people with solid degrees will ultimately do better than those of us without.  However, there is some merit in ""the plumber, the carpenter, the handyman"" and those types of jobs, where no college degree was ever had, but they build success on their own.  I think a lot of kids overlook these types of trades, and I've seen my share of very very successful people.  I also think sometimes carrying a college debt, and not nailing a great job as soon as you step out of college can be depressing, and this may impact performance in a work place.  I have no idea, but the experts say otherwise, so I trust them.  In the end, with compounding interest, there could be an argument that unless you get out of college with $X amount in salary versus $Y debt, it may take you years to catch a person who never went to college, with no debt.  It's like the math problem of an 18 year old investing $5000/year into the market from 18 until 23 years old, and then NEVER invests again, versus a 23 year old starting to invest $5000/year into the market at the same growth rate.  Go do the math.  Go see how many years and how much money it takes the 23 year old to invest to finally catch the investments of the 18 year old!  It's a fun math problem to do, and it's one of the biggest inspirations I've ever had.  Go teach your kids this problem too!

Simply put, I focused hard on system automation, and was very good at it.  This landed me side by side with ""degree'd"" engineers, earning the same amount of money as them, but without the debt of college. 

As far as investments are concerned, I started investing 12% into my 401k early on, and I invested heavily in Latin America stock, mostly PBR (go look it up).  PBR was also a luck factor, because it skyrocketed before the 2008 crash, and I (innocently and luckily) got out of it about 6 months before the crash.  I had no clue what I was doing in those days, and was just looking up stocks that had massive returns because I was stupid.  (Today I'm mostly in stable tech companies like MSFT and ORCL.)  Anyways, that massive boost early on from PBR really got my investments going ridiculously early, up to something like 60k in the first 2 years.  I also bought National City (the bank) just before they were bought by PNC, and that bump helped a little.  I really fumbled through stocks, dangerously in those days.  That helped me build up a small but decent net worth early.  I eventually moved to the ""100% - age"" model, and put a percentage of my funds into low volatility bonds based on my age.  At some point, I also increased my paycheck contribution to 14%, and never looked back.   

Why do I have so much cash?  I just completed a contract, and that cash is going towards that investment property I mentioned above, so it's not going to remain as such. 

I also dumped heavily into TSLA back when it was around $100/share. (Yes.. I know all you 'savvy' folks, I know), but TSLA really gave me a boost as well.  I've since sold out of it mostly, but I still hold some shares ""just in case"". 

But if I were to name the single thing I've done to help boost my net worth so effectively, it would be paying down debt.  You lose SO MUCH MONEY to interest.  I paid down my house with GOBS of extra cash on principal every month, and did a 15-year finance, instead of a 30-year.  I also bought a house in what is now luckily a growing area, and I didn't buy a very big house.  ""Experiences, not things"" is my motto to live by. So we try to not buy too many things, and that allows us to save for events, and the rest of the cash goes towards debts.    

The next goal is to close on this investment property, and begin the potentially risky venture into being a landlord on the side.  The area the house is in is in an area with one of the best elementary schools in the state, so the goal is to cater to young families that want their kids in that school.  I was able to negotiate a great deal on the property, and pull in a very low interest rate (for an investment property.. 4.5%), by putting 25% down on it.  (Part of that cash I mentioned earlier.)  

At this point, I simply watch the market for major ups and downs as a signal for collapse.  They say you can't predict the market, but I did a couple of times based on (probably stupid) ideas, like when China crashed hard in 2015, I pulled out of the U.S. market because I firmly believe these things do not happen in a vaccuum.  Sure enough, our market dropped 10% (go look at .DJI on google finance), and I got back in.  Things like that have helped give me boosts here and there.  But at the end of the day, contribute as much as you can stand to the market, live in a smaller home, carry as little debt as you can, and before you know it, your money will be growing.  That's really it.  From where I'm standing, it's honestly nothing special.  No magic formula, no major number crunching, just consistency.  I don't ""want"" things very much, so I don't give in to many temptations.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Why I believe iExec (RLC) is a sleeping giant and will be one of the biggest gainers this year.,"Hey Reddit, I haven't seen anyone on here talk about iExec (RLC). I wanted to present some of the reasons why I am heavily invested in RLC and why I think it is one of the most promising and interesting projects heading into 2018. 

1) 2018 will be the year when Ethereum’s killer DApp’s come into fruition. As we all know these DApp’s require tremendous computational power to do their calculations and the question is whether or not the Ethereum Virtual Machine will be able to handle this?- The answer is simply NO. For Eg, Request Network needs tremendous amount of computational power to do its financial audits and the Ethereum Virtual Machine can be a severe liability as the computations cannot be scaled. iExec provides the computational power to DApps like ENIGMA, SIGNALS, REQ Network etc. These Dapp’s are waiting for the industry fundamentals like decentralized storage and computing to get completed and widely adopted. So it’s a no brainer that as DApps grow, projects like IEXEC RLC will breathe life into them.

2) Next coming to the team, one of the most talented and experienced team in the crypto space they are just no-nonsense guys, no hype guys who deliver silently (looking at you Golem). Giles Fedak is one of the most respected persons in cloud computing arena. Hawei Hu has been voted as one of the top 40 most innovative people in China. They have 5+ phds on the team who have been working on the project for over ten years - all are experts in their respective fields of cloud computing, distributed systems and IOT technology. The system itself is based on XtremWeb-HEP, a mature, solid, and open-source Desktop Grid software which has already stood the test of time. iExec is just providing the platform by linking blockchain and the tech. With such a stellar team and good technology it’s has favorable odds to become successful.

3) A Sino-Franco Project:- Yes, IEXEC RLC can have a potential foothold in two continents Europe and Asia. The company has two offices one in Nice, France and other in China. With strong Chinese links and collaborations with Tsinghua University (Chinese equivalent of MIT). There is possibility of this project getting adopted very quickly.

4) Competitors:- Golem Mcap: 919million, These guys aggressively marketed themselves. With no working product, they are already lagging behind by 6 months with their Brass Golem which was supposed to be done last June. In either case, Golem and iExec are not even direct competitors as Golem wants to be a decentralized super computer while iExec aims to be a foundational block on which Dapp’s run as well as the premier source decentralized computational power. The team also said there can be a possible collaboration with Golem. So if golem is valued at 913 million with no working product and iExec is still is at ~$150 million, with a working project (their DApp store), it is likely that we will see iExec surpass Golem as the team ramps up their partnerships and marketing before V2 releases this may.  

5) The team has mentioned that we will be getting two new exchanges this month. Currently only listed on liqui and bittrex, so I think we can expect some growth as soon as the project gets listed. 

6) Potential take over by IBM, though this rumor has not been confirmed, we all know what IBM did to stellar. Personally, I believe that it is unimportant whether or not they partner with a big tech company in the immediate future as their tech and fundamentals will undoubtably prove themselves in the long-term. 

7) DApp store has already been released on time. The team has promised couple of collaborations in January and launch of iExec summer of code for writing DAPPs on its platform.

8) Blockchain Agnostic: One of team members came out and said iExec is not limited to Ethereum and it can be adopted various smart contract platforms like NEO, ARK.

9) Decentralized computing is cleaner and energy efficient than cloud computing. As Smart cities and IOT become mainstream the cloud will simply not be able to keep it up. After iExec V2 release one can simply rent their redundant computational power. Just imagine lending your phone or laptop for money. The proof of Contribution protocol is well tested and the team has already done a lot of great work on this protocol. 

10) Last but not least, the cloud computing market is projected to reach 411 Billion by 2020 according to Forbes. If iExec is successful in capturing at least 1 percent of that market they will be valued at 4.1 Billion.

Anyways, I hope this post was useful for some of you. I'm quite excited about the project and I do believe  that this is one of the most exciting projects of the year. Happy trading!",cryptocurrency

Posted this on r/tax, but only one responder. I have a basic understanding of my situation, but all the variables that go into which option to choose are overwhelming. I’m not a financial person beyond spending and saving like normal folks, so this completely foreign to me. I’ll be glad to provide more info, just don’t know what else is relevant, here's what I got so far...

Specifics first

1. Mother passed in Sept of 2017 two days before her 70th birthday.
2. Left me as sole beneficiary to her 401k through Prudential
3. 401k current value is around $33k
4. She lived and passed in Maryland
5. I also live in Maryland and am in my early 40's

Options (as I understand) w/ questions. 

1. Rollover into my own separate account w/ Prudential 
    * Lost on what happens after this. Is this just a holding account?
2. Take the lump sum
    * Prudential keeps 20% for feds in withholding and my taxable becomes higher. Lot of variables into how much I will actually see of the 33K
    * What does the state Maryland receive if I take a lump sum payout?    
3. Open an IIRA with Prudential or another institution.
    * I have an understanding about this, but it is confusing as hell to the layman. I have a ton of questions on this option to my ***specific*** situation.

personalfinance,Financial planning moving to the US,"Hello all,

We are an European couple moving to the US. We have read through the PF wikis and a number of posts but some questions keep piling up on the back of our minds. Keeping in mind we would like to eventually return to Europe (let's say in 10y):

- Do the traditional 401k, ROTH IRA etc advices apply? what happens when we decide we had enough of the American dream?

- My employee offers a 401k with matching %. I will enroll as soon as I move there. Can I move my equivalent European 401k funds there (pension in Ireland)?

- We have been recommended FirstTech (credit union) and HSBC. Is there a reason why you would choose one or the other?

- Given my future compensation (around $140k), we believe we will be eligible for a ROTH IRA if we fill jointly. Does this apply if my wife is not working for the next couple of months? what if she starts working?

- I'm a cheapskate and 18k in a 401k and 5.5k in ROTH IRA seems low. Is there anything preventing us from opening multiple IRAs?
- My wife has a more conservative risk profile and I'm thinking she might be better off with a robo-advisor. what are your thoughts on this?
- We plan to roll over our emergency fund to USD and park it somewhere. I've seen a lot of people recommending Ally's 1.25% but I'm wondering how it compares to other, higher yield accounts, such as CIT or Marcus?
- What's the current best way to move funds from eur to usd? Transferwise? Cryptocurrency?
- Been thinking on turning the emergency fund on a tiered one with CD's covering the last months (mainly because of the higher interest rates). Assuming we have a 6 months runaway, is this something you would consider? what are the drawbacks?
- What are the benefits/cons on having multiple services/accounts under the same bank? Since we don't have a credit score (or even history!), is this something we need to take in account? We are not looking for any credit, can other instituitions overturn us?
- What else might we be missing? This is a big move!

personalfinance,(UK) Tackling budgeting and debt management for my partner and household - approach and software,"Hi, everybody. 

My partner is in substantial debt - far more than I realised until recently. She earns a good salary, but is very bad with spending. After some discussion, we've decided it's best for me to take total control of her finances. I want to deal with this debt as quickly and effectively as possible. 

I'm a trainee financial accountant and used to dealing with financial information. However, I have no experience with debt management - I have a huge aversion to being in debt, so (student loan aside) my own finances essentially boil down to income, outgoings and savings. There are two things that I'd appreciate advice on. 

*1) How to go about tackling the debt? *

She has debt from several sources. These are:

- Credit cards. Approximately £23,000 across four cards. Three are currently interest-free but interest will be payable on two cards (a large chunk of the balance) in April and May respectively. The third has a fairly small balance and is attracting a high rate of interest. This is the highest-priority debt as I see it. 

- Long-term loan. This was a previous debt consolidation loan. £11,5000 remains to pay at ~£300/month and reasonable interest rate. Part-payment and early settlement are possible. 

- Car finance. This is a fixed cost. Finance is complete in two years, with the option of a balloon payment to purchase the car outright at that point. I anticipate that I will pay the final payment to keep the car. 

- Student loan. Included for completeness - in the UK this is automatically docked from wages each month and is lowest priority.


I have no experience here. I'm wary of debt consolidation - it seems like paying a premium to avoid complexity. I know balances can be switched from credit card to credit card to avoid interest payments - I don't know if this approach has pitfalls or risks. There's too much debt to pay off before the two cards begin to attract interest in April/May - avoiding those interest payments would be incredibly helpful. Is is straightforward to transfer balances to a new card with a longer interest-free period? 

My basic plan is to pay off the card currently attracting interest, then pay off the cards close to attracting interest. After this, I'll put any spare money to early payments of the consolidation loan while ensuring payments on the remaining card(s) are sufficient to pay them off in full before they attract interest. Is there anything else I should consider, or any options available to help with this? 

*2) What's the best software to manage the debt and budget month-by-month?*

I'm accustomed to using commercial accounting and bookkeeping software, but it seems like overkill for personal finance. I do, however, want personal finance software that's fairly powerful and operates on similar principles (i.e. double entry). I'm happy to pay for the software myself. Any recommendations or personal experiences are hugely appreciated - I've done plenty of research but finding objective reviews is difficult and there's no stand-out choice. I'll ideally need:

- Bank statement import
- Debt &amp; loan management
- Solid reporting and forecasting tools
- Mobile companion app
- Preferably the ability to create a read-only access account - not vital

https://www.accountz.com/pages/home-accountz-features seems like the best choice - unfortunately, options like Mint don't exist in the UK as our bank regulations are stricter than in the USA. 

//

I'd prefer not to touch my own savings. The debt outweighs my own accessible money, and I'm slowly putting together a house deposit. My own salary will jump substantially once I'm fully qualified, but that's two years away - until then, I don't have much wiggle room in my own budget. Also, to be blunt, I need to be sure I can trust her money management before I'll use my own. 

Any advice or suggestions are much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Did I reset the SOL on a derogatory mark?,"edit: As pointed out by /u/kylejack, I've conflated SOL with reporting timeframe on derogatory marks. Obviously, I'm not concerned about being sued over $300. Is there anything that will reset reporting on delinquencies? Is this limit 7 years at the federal level?

edit2: I am still curious if anyone has a rough estimate on the impact to credit score of a $300 delinquency. I understand every individual profile varies, but some sort of schedule in terms of certain tiers of consumer debt including a small delinquent item would be interesting.





I recently applied to lease an apartment, and after reviewing the application the property manager informed me that in order to be approved for a lease, either:


a) an old debt of $300 to an apartment community would need to be paid, or


b) I would need to make a refundable deposit of one month’s rent


The defaulted debt was incurred in the state of Alabama in 2014 and eventually sold to a collections agency. Stupidly, I called the collections agency today and requested pay for delete. I’m pretty sure in doing so I verified the debt as mine. 


I spoke to two agents, and after asking the second individual forward me to his supervisor, he warned that his supervisor was the VP of operations (lol, manipulative fucks) and was out of the office. He asked if I still wanted to be forwarded to the “VP’s” voicemail. After replying in the affirmative, I heard a few ringtones followed by a disconnect.


I have two questions. How much does a single derogatory mark for a $300 default affect my credit score? Also, of the two below scenarios, which is most probable in terms of SOL reset?


a) I’ve reset the SOL on my derogatory mark. If this is the case, and the CA will not offer pay for delete, I am better off paying the CA the $300 now so I am less cash out of pocket in regards to not having to deposit one month’s rent to my future landlord.


b) I’ve not reset the SOL, and in this case I should deposit one month’s rent and wait for the CA to stop reporting the delinquency to the credit bureaus.


Thank you. Please let me know if any additional information is necessary.


I guess something that would help me better inform my decision is the following: I have some consumer debt on my credit report. Can anyone provide an estimate of how many points a $300 delinquency is worth? How much do I need to fight for this, to the extent I can? It seems the CA won't offer pay for delete so it might be a moot point.

personalfinance,Advanced Debt Restructuring &amp; IRA Loan Loopholes,"Hello, 

I'm trying to consolidate my debt and lower interest rates. I would like your feedback on my proposed roadmap. 

**Situation**

* Spending due to divorce, job loss, medical issue on high deductible plan, and relocation over a 2 year period. 
* Secure job, stable mental health, and happy. 
* Following budget and have not missed payment
* Trying to crawl out of this responsibly

**Income**

* Age: 28
* Income: $149k + Bonus
* Freelance Consulting for Additional Money ($500 - $1.5k monthly) 

**Debt**

* Credit Card: $58k (15% - 25% interest)
* Personal Loan: $3.7k (7% interest)
* 401k Loan: $11k (4% interest to myself)

**Assets**

* Cash: $4k
* 401k: $76k (Fully Vested &amp; I contribute 5% of my income which gets me a 4% match)
* Roth IRA: $21k
* Credit Score: 633 (High Balances to Credit Ratio)

**My Proposed Roadmap**

Goal:
Lower all interest rates from an average of 22% to 11% and follow a strict budget that allows me to pay-off principle as quickly as possible. 

Step One:
Take a indirect transfer from my Roth IRA creating a [60-day] rollover loophole loan to use to pay off existing 401k loan. ($19k Liquid Assets) - 10% withheld by IRS by bank). 

Step Two: 
Pay off 401k Loan. $19k - $11k = $8k. 

Step Three:
Take 401k Loan. $35k + 11k = $43k. *(Can only take 1 401k loan at time).*

Strep Four:
Rollover Roth IRA $43k - $21k = $22k. 

Step Five:
Pay off $17.2k Work of Credit Card Debt, lower average interest rate by over 30%, and payment by $350.

* $5k 26%
* $2.7k 24%
* $9.5k 21%
* $3.8k 17%

Step Six: 
Pay off remaining debt, use lower monthly payments to put more towards principle, improve credit score: 

* Credit Cards: ($16k 17% | $11k 16.4% | $5.4k 14.99%) 
* 401k Loan: $35k (4% but it goes back into 401k)
* Personal Loan: $3,659 (7%) 

Step Seven:
If credit improves, and good loan offer becomes available, consolidate remaining credit card debt. 

Step Eight:
Stay on budget and pay off-debt. 

**Risks**

* I cannot miss the 60-day rollover window. Otherwise the IRS will consider the debt an early disbursement. 
* 401k will reduce my take-home pay, failure to repay by the deadline will trigger a tax risk, there is additional risk if I quit or lose my job. (Which is unlikely).

investing,Is the market overvalued?,"There's not much consensus here: on the one hand, you have CAPE hitting levels typically associated with bubbles, but on the other hand, interest rates have been at never-before seen lows, which you would expect to push up the price of stocks (and other assets). So, the question is then, is the current prices of stocks justified by the low interest rate?

That is something I haven’t seen a convincing answer for. I’ve read a couple articles that related the interest rate to market prices, but the data was a bit outdated, so I decided to try to take a stab at recreating it. I looked at the historical monthly value of the 13 month Tbill (^IRX), which I'm using as a proxy for the interest rate, and compared it to the historical S&amp;P500 price and historical CAPE levels. I also ran this against the 10 year Tnote (^TNX) for comparison. I think we’ve all seen the chart of the S&amp;P500 overlaid with the falling interest rates, but it’s hard to draw any conclusions from that. Plot the interest rate against the CAPE ratio, however, and you get a pretty clear trend: https://i.imgur.com/dWrfPLf.png 

Here, the Dot Com bubble stands out as clearly above the trend (overvalued), and a good portion of the time since the Great Recession stands out as being below the trend (undervalued). I took the trendline as the fair value CAPE, and from that, I backed out what the fair value for the S&amp;P 500 was based on the current interest rates: https://i.imgur.com/pAGX5yq.png 

Based on this, the Dot Com bubble and the period leading up to the Great Recession are periods where the market was overvalued, but the bull run from 2009 up until 2015/2016 was actually undervalued given the interest rates at the time. It was only recently in 2016 that the market has crossed into overvalued territory.

So, since the market is overvalued now, I should sell, right? Not so fast. Looking at it from a returns standpoint,  while being undervalued is associated with a higher average return and higher occurrences of achieving a positive return, even when the market is overvalued, the average 1, 2, and 5 year returns are still positive, and the number of occasions where you achieve a positive return over those time periods almost all exceed 50%: https://i.imgur.com/0wkAVCD.png

The moonshots are now all officially up between 75% and 300%, let’s hear it for ELIX, DBC, BNTY, DRGN, and KCS.

Today’s Moonshot KuCoin Pick: SNOV 

SNOV is located on KuCoin with a market cap of approximately 45 million this has true moon potential. If it approaches a very reachable $100million or $200million market cap the value of the SNOV will increase 200 – 400%. I am predicting this increase to take place within the next month as SNOV makes its way to larger exchanges. Yesterday money flooded into BTC as you could see in the BTC price rise. I predicted this 24hrs ago that institutional money would get involved within the next 72hrs, and we had our 20% BTC price climb. What happens immediately following a BTC price climb? The alts respond! I expect SNOV to have overreacted to the BTC climb and will in turn correct even more significantly. 24hrs prior this coin was trading at 1200Satoshis. As I am writing this SNOV is at 830Satoshis. This means a 50% return can be not only achieved, but expected tomorrow (or within 72hrs when the alts correct). The prior 5 alts all hit in order as predicted. I wouldn’t expect SNOV to be any different. I actually like SNOV very much because it had a signficiant drop yesterday correlated to the BTC spike, and now that BTC has settled SNOV should skyrocket. To the moon in 24hrs? Maybe not, but I do expect returns in the 40-100% range within 48hrs. TODAY’S KuCOIN PICK: SNOV.

What does SNOV do?! It is the first blockchain based lead generation service. Every company I’ve known, had friends and family work for, etc. they use leads regularly. SNOV brings that same concept to the blockchain. Leads are an essential aspect of most businesses and as business generally moves to a safer, faster method, the blockchain. I also expect businesses like lead generation to similarly successfully follow suit.  A niche market, a small market cap, few exchanges hosting SNOV, and an already functioning platform SNOV should moon very shortly. Check out their website if you don’t believe me . The ‘blockchain’ was missing a lead generation service and SNOV is an early entrant into what will continue to be a booming market for the years to come. SNOV should see the moon by the end of this weekend. At a bare minimum prepare for launch!

ELIX (yesterday’s pick) is still a very important HOLD as their team posts weekly updates, is active on social media, has many Q&amp;A sessions and implements expeditious development of their software. Unlike most coins ELIX has 2 full time Devs that have met every deadline to date. Elixir’s purpose is ‘crowdfunding on the blockchain’ a blockchain niche that even the lending companies haven’t migrated into. The goal is decentralized crowdfunding, at a much lower cost. They also have a lending service and payment ledger which can be used to track and create loans based on agreed upon interest rates, length, and a detailed description.

I want to reiterate my position on holding DRGN, BNTY, and KCS, and DBC. Profits from other exchanges should be rotated into KuCoin to take advantage of the unreasonable returns we’ve been able to attain there this week. The pick is SNOV for today! However, BNTY should continue its rise as it gets added to a new exchange. DRGN is not left to die by Disney and is leading the charge to get on Binance. KCS will win because it is one of the few exchanges still accepting new patrons, AND they give 90% of the trade commission back to KCS holders and as referrals. 


I have approximately 30-40% of my portfolio in moonshots (I have a high risk tolerance) and every time 1 coin holding is disproportionately more valuable than the other I reallocate funds from the larger portfolio holding to the smaller holding. In this case DRGN is up huge (KCS is a hold for other reasons, the dividend and rapid site growth). DRGN being up almost 300% means 20-100% of your holding’s in DRGN should be sold and diversified between ELIX, DBC and KCS. There is no room for nostalgia. Make your %, and reallocate. If you are feeling attached to your KuCoin coins, sell ones on Binance and Bittrex and transfer more funds into Kucoin!

personalfinance,"Pay off interest, or entire loan with extra income in college?","My situation involves going to a college with a paid internship program where one semester is full time classes and the other semester is full time paid work.

My plan was to pay off all the unsubsidized and to save the rest of the money to pay the subsidized loan after I graduate, since there is no interest until I graduate in 2021. Is this a good plan, or should I direct my money towards investment? I am educating myself on the matter and will be dedicating a lot of time finding out about investing, economics and the stock market on my free time from work and am looking into investing the rest of my income for a short while in the stock market (5 or 10 years) to get much better returns than savings or a certificate of deposit.

CryptoCurrency,"My thoughts on the ""bubble""","A lot of Wall Street experts and tech experts from the dot com era speak about an impending crash. I don't doubt their expertise, but I feel this ""bubble"" isn't anything like past market crashes. 

For starters, most crashes affected the stock markets, jobs growth/unemployment rates and interest rates. The crypto market, in my opinion, doesn't directly impact any of those (yet). What happens in our crypto market, to date, doesn't affect our day to day lives, unless of course we hit our moon. In the past, it was governments and large banks placing large bets on the future markets, failing and jeopardizing our lively hoods. With crypto, it is anyone with access to the internet and a bank account.

personalfinance,How should I save after I've made it through the flowchart? Details in post.,"Hey all,

I'm trying to figure out how to invest my extra income once I've made it through the flowchart.  Any help would be appreciated.  Let me know if you need more information.  Some specs:

-Salary: ~$450,000 if bonuses track expectations (rough floor of $350,000 if they don't) BUT I may only be with my current employer for another ~2 years, after which my salary will go down substantially (to ~$250,000)
-Student loans: $80,000 @ 2% interest rate
-Aged 31
-Soon to be married, fiance makes ~$100,000/year....we share the same financial goals, and will probably have a couple kids
-My share of rent is roughly $2000/month
-Maxed out 401K and backdoor roth last year (first year saving for retirement), plan to do the same this year
-$25,000 emergency fund
-$70,000 in a Betterment account invested with their 36-year horizon allocation of 90% stocks, 10% bonds 

Last year I threw a lot of income at my loans to get them to a more reasonable balance.  With the low interest rate and a balance I can get my head around, I'll probably pay the minimum ($3,500/month) from now on.  My question is what I should do with the excess.  I'm currently invested 90% stocks/10% bonds in a Betterment account, but don't know if I should be more conservative than that.  I'd LIKE to buy a house at some point, but I wouldn't say I'm in any particular rush, so it's not like my goal is to have a certain specified amount of money saved in a certain number of years.  But, I still probably want to buy at some point.  Also, I'd like to retire early -- basically, as early as possible. 

So, I'm debating now between being a little bit safer with my investing to be able to save for a house vs. being more aggressive with the goal of maximizing returns for early retirement.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.",finance

We currently owe just shy of $58,000 of the 65,500 we borrowed in March of 2014. I would like to pay this thing off by March of 2024.

My current interest rate is 4.5%. Payment is $465/mo.

I got a quote on refinancing as a 10 year and paying it down to $50k in the process: interest rate would be 3.375%; estimated payment of $624.89/mo.

Closing costs total $3515.36. So it would cost me $11,296.43 to pay it to $50k and refi as a ten year. I would still be able to put some extra money each month toward principle if I did this, but not much. Maybe $100/mo.",finance

financialindependence,Any advice on buying this house FIRE community?,"Hey dudes, looooong time reader, don't post much at all, but I do quietly cheer you guys on.  
  
Alright help me with this housing decision. I live in Dallas and rent from my landlord for a ridiculously cheap sum of 795 a month. She offered to sell me the house for 350K. I have 30k saved up for a downpayment. I work full time and I'm going to grad night school classes to get a MS and an MBA, I should be done with grad school by the end of this year (cross your fingers).  
  
She wants owner financing, where she carries the note and wants to charge a ridiculous 5.5% interest rate. Zillow/other estimates are that the home is around 400k, its a duplex with a long time renter (and friend) on the other side. My dad (godbless him) has stated he would help me, never gave a hard number so lets figure he goes in 50/50 with me and my downpayment is 60k.  
  
The numbers say that my principle and interest payment is $1,646, with taxes at about $600 insurance at $125 for a grand total of $2,371 monthly payment, of that the renter would pay $800 and I'm left with $1,571 in rent.  
  
My salary is 76k but I've been getting bonuses that have pushed me up to mid 90k. Using a conservative 70k salary dividing by 12 and using the 28% ""rule"" the most I should pay is 1633, which this is under but I have sooooo many questions:  
  
  
It is kind of scary to ""depend"" on my renter. He's rented for longer than me (him 8 years me 5). The location is amazing, you can walk to 3 different grocery stores, over 20(+) restaurants and bars but far away enough that the friday/saturday bar crowd doesnt make noise/nuisance at night. Arts district/live music is a 5 minute cheap uber and I really love living here.  
  
So questions: 5.5% and 350 is steep, I looked at comps and they around the 400k range. This would be my first house. I'm terrified the renter leaves. If he did I don't think it'd be hard to find a new one and charge 1,000 to 1,100 (I'm pretty close to a university and the proximity to nightlife would make it an easy sell) but I'm afraid of quality of life if a bad renter shows up and I'm forced to live with them for a year.  
  
I have no debt and my net worth (only counting investments) is 250k. I'm terrified! What if my friend the renter leaves and despite what I said above I can't find anyone and I'm on the hook for the full 2,371 a month. My plan is to sell half of my crypto stock this march, being conservative would let me pay another 30K in downpayment to get total payments down to 2,104 and w/ the renter at 800 my payments would go down to 1,304 (which is a reasonable rent in this city, most average apartments go for around 1,100-1,300 and each unit of this duplex is a 2 bed 1 bath with an actual sizable back yard for each unit).  
  
Anyone have any experience doing this? is it fucking scary as hell? Do you only buy the house with the full knowledge that you could last years paying with no renter? I could probably pay the full amount without a renter for about 2 years before I'd be in hot water and would be forced to sell. And please let me know if I'm thinking about this incorrectly but my theory is: I'm going to pay for a roof over my head no matter what, so if I can shove bonuses and windfalls into equity into the house until my monthly payments fall into the range of what a renter would pay, than I should pull the trigger and buy this house. Sorry for being all over the place with this post I'm really fucking scared and I don't have family or friends in my financial position to ask these questions.  
  
Final thoughts: I will never ever live in such a great place for such a low price (795 a month). This is a wake up call that my choices would be to live in a much worse place for 1,000+a month, or pull the trigger on this deal, pay 60k now, another 30k in march (or negotiate to pay the full 90 in april) and try not to hyperventilate that I'm relying on rental unit to be occupied 60% of the time. Ending on a note of optimism: I could see this being a huge step up. And I love the option in the future of either 1) making this my forever home; tearing down the duplex and building a forever home in the future or 2) moving out in 5 years and just becoming a land lord myself, either doing the upkeep myself or contracting a 3rd party and having my first passive rental income stream. Any responses are very appreciated, and sorry for the scatter brain post I'm just incredibly nervous this is the biggest financial decision I've ever made.",finance

The numbers say that my principle and interest payment is $1,646, with taxes at about $600 insurance at $125 for a grand total of $2,371 monthly payment, of that the renter would pay $800 and I'm left with $1,571 in rent.

My salary is 76k but I've been getting bonuses that have pushed me up to mid 90k. Using a conservative 70k salary dividing by 12 and using the 28% ""rule"" the most I should pay is 1633, which this is under but I have sooooo many questions:

It is kind of scary to ""depend"" on my renter. He's rented for longer than me (him 8 years me 5). The location is amazing, you can walk to 3 different grocery stores, over 20(+) restaurants and bars but far away enough that the friday/saturday bar crowd doesnt make noise/nuisance at night. Arts district/live music is a 5 minute cheap uber and I really love living here.

So questions: 5.5% and 350 is steep, I looked at comps and they around the 400k range. This would be my first house. I'm terrified the renter leaves. If he did I don't think it'd be hard to find a new one and charge 1,000 to 1,100 (I'm pretty close to a university and the proximity to nightlife would make it an easy sell) but I'm afraid of quality of life if a bad renter shows up and I'm forced to live with them for a year.

I have no debt and my net worth (only counting investments) is 250k. I'm terrified! What if my friend the renter leaves and despite what I said above I can't find anyone and I'm on the hook for the full 2,371 a month. My plan is to sell half of my crypto stock this march, being conservative would let me pay another 30K in downpayment to get total payments down to 2,104 and w/ the renter at 800 my payments would go down to 1,304 (which is a reasonable rent in this city, most average apartments go for around 1,100-1,300 and each unit of this duplex is a 2 bed 1 bath with an actual sizable back yard for each unit).

Anyone have any experience doing this? is it fucking scary as hell? Do you only buy the house with the full knowledge that you could last years paying with no renter? I could probably pay the full amount without a renter for about 2 years before I'd be in hot water and would be forced to sell. And please let me know if I'm thinking about this incorrectly but my theory is: I'm going to pay for a roof over my head no matter what, so if I can shove bonuses and windfalls into equity into the house until my monthly payments fall into the range of what a renter would pay, than I should pull the trigger and buy this house. Sorry for being all over the place with this post I'm really fucking scared and I don't have family or friends in my financial position to ask these questions.

Final thoughts: I will never ever live in such a great place for such a low price (795 a month). This is a wake up call that my choices would be to live in a much worse place for 1,000+a month, or pull the trigger on this deal, pay 60k now, another 30k in march (or negotiate to pay the full 90 in april) and try not to hyperventilate that I'm relying on rental unit to be occupied 60% of the time. Ending on a note of optimism: I could see this being a huge step up. And I love the option in the future of either 1) making this my forever home; tearing down the duplex and building a forever home in the future or 2) moving out in 5 years and just becoming a land lord myself, either doing the upkeep myself or contracting a 3rd party and having my first passive rental income stream. Any responses are very appreciated, and I should definitely get a home inspection right? To know what upcoming repairs I'm on the hook for?",finance

We do not have car payments or any other type of debt besides our mortgage - though if we're both employed, we will have $2000 in daycare expenses monthly.

personalfinance,I think my bank has incorrectly applied a large card payment to the lowest interest rate on the card. Did the rules change on this or do I understand wrong?,"I received a very generous bonus this year and used it to pay 2k on a credit card that has three possible interest rates: ~1800 was at 13.5% Purchase Rate ~7000 was at 0% Balance Transfer Promotional Rate ~1500 was at a 0% Check Cash Promotional Rate

My minimun payment was $106.

The section under ""HOW WE ALLOCATE YOUR PAYMENTS"" states ""Payments are allocated to posted balances. If your account has balances with different APRs, we will allocate the amount of your payment equal to the Total Minimum Payment Due to the lowest APR balances first (including transactions made after this statement). Payment amounts in excess of your Total Minimum Payment Due will be applied to balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs.

My understanding of this reading is that $106 should have gone to one of the 0% rates and the remaining $1894 should have gone to pay off the amount at the 13.5% rate in its entirety and then some of one of the 0% rates. Instead about $800 was applied to the 13.5% and the rest to the promotional balance transfer.

In addition to this discrepancy for some reason, the $1500 I had on a check cash promotional rate increased to ~$1600 despite no additional usage of this (it's showing this amount as being on the same ""promotional offer ID"" as was paid down the month before).

Before I call Bank of America and try to get things sorted... am I correct that this seems wrong? Is there something I'm missing? My understanding was that the laws changed in 2010 and that cards were required to apply payments to the highest interest rates first. Maybe I missed a change back though.

I was really hoping this payoff was going to get me on the road to zeroing out my debt since everything should have gone onto the 0% interest through the end of the year...",finance

CryptoCurrency,"""Nothing important has ever been built without irrational exuberance""","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble is a pretty good read for perspective. Here are some selected passages. Any of it sound familiar? 

As a result of the rapidly-increasing usage of the Internet, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any company that had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a "".com"" suffix in its name, leading to a stock market bubble. During the bubble, the valuations of companies in the quaternary sector of the economy increased rapidly. Venture capitalists, eager to profit on this investment demand, moved to raise and invest capital faster and with less caution than usual. A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices, market confidence that the companies would turn future profits, speculation in stocks by individuals, and widely available venture capital created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the price–earnings ratio, in favor of basing confidence on technological advancements. The low interest rates of 1998–99 helped increase the availability of funding...

An unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred during the boom, and the press reported the phenomenon of people quitting their jobs to engage in full-time day trading. The value of the Nasdaq Composite stock market index, which includes many technology companies, rose from 1,000 in 1995 to 5,000 in the year 2000. By the end of the 1990s, the NASDAQ Composite reached a price–earnings ratio of 200, dwarfing the peak price–earnings ratio of 80 for the Japanese Nikkei 225 during the Japanese asset price bubble of 1991. In 1999, shares of Qualcomm rose in value by 2,619% and 12 other large-cap stocks each rose over 1,000%. Even though the Nasdaq stock market index rose 85.6% and the S&amp;P 500 stock market index rose 19.5% in 1999, more stocks fell in value than rose in value, as investors sold stocks in slower growing companies to invest in Internet stocks.

At the height of the boom, it was possible for a promising dot-com company to become a public company via an initial public offering and raise a substantial amount of money even though it had never made a profit—or, in some cases, realized any material revenue whatsoever.

American news media, including respected business publications such as Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, took advantage of the public's desire to invest in the stock market; an article in the Wall Street Journal suggested that investors ""re-think"" the ""quaint idea"" of profits, and CNBC reported on the stock market with the same level of suspense as many networks provided to the broadcasting of sports events...

Most dot-com companies operated at a net loss to harness network effects to build market share or mind share as fast as possible, using the mottos ""get big fast"" and ""get large or get lost"". These companies offered their services or products for free or at a discount with the expectation that they could build enough brand awareness to charge profitable rates for their services in the future...

On the long-term legacy of the bubble, venture capitalist Fred Wilson, who funded dot-com companies, said about the dot-com bubble:

""A friend of mine has a great line. He says 'Nothing important has ever been built without irrational exuberance'. Meaning that you need some of this mania to cause investors to open up their pocketbooks and finance the building of the railroads or the automobile or aerospace industry or whatever. And in this case, much of the capital invested was lost, but also much of it was invested in a very high throughput backbone for the Internet, and lots of software that works, and databases and server structure. All that stuff has allowed what we have today, which has changed all our lives... that's what all this speculative mania built"".",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,My analysis (as a relatively early investor of OMG) of why OmiseGo is not taking off as much as other coins lately and why that can change soon (X-Post from /r/omise_go),"First of all let's cover what OmiseGo actually is for the people who don't know yet, if you already know feel free to skip this part:

What is OmiseGO?

OmiseGO is the answer to a fundamental coordination problem amongst payment processors, gateways and financial institutions. By enabling decentralized exchange on a public blockchain at high volume and low cost, OmiseGO provides a next-generation value transfer service operating across currencies and asset types. Through the OmiseGO network connected to the Ethereum mainnet, anyone will be able to conduct financial transactions such as payments, remittances, payroll deposit, B2B commerce, supply-chain finance, loyalty programs, asset management and trading, and other on-demand services, in a completely decentralized and inexpensive way. Further, millions of mainstream users in the largest growing economies in the world will be enabled to make the transition from using fiat money to using decentralized currencies such as ETH, BTC, and others. The OmiseGO network is intrinsically agnostic between fiat and decentralized money: as far as adoption and usage go, the system is constructed so that the best currencies will win.

The OmiseGO Blockchain

The OmiseGO Blockchain comprises a decentralized exchange, liquidity provider mechanism, clearinghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway. It is a scalable and totally public (permissionless) blockchain whose Proof-of-Stake consensus is bonded by the activities of the chain itself. The network is designed as a highly performant system leveraging interlinked blockchain construction: while clearing and settlement occurs over the OmiseGO blockchain, the costs of protecting transaction value is externalized to other chains in ways that directly promote the value of those chains.

Source: www.omisego.network

My analysis:

I've been in OMG since it was $1.50. The thing is, it went absolutely crazy from around $3 to $14 because the Omise team was very good at hyping it. They announced partnerships almost weekly and posted these vague pictures with Apple logos, pictures at the Google HQ, announcements of announcements etc. This did work very well for them, people remembered the name and started doing their research on OmiseGo. After doing their research they of course invested.

Eventually a lot of people became fed up with it and told Omise to cut down on the hype. Omise responded very professionally to this IMO and they indeed became a bit more modest on social media. After this the China regulations happened, the whole market went down for a couple of months including OmiseGo. In the last couple of months OMG hasn't had a large rally anymore, probably because people are jumping on other hype trains and the market has become a little watered down with all these new coins. OmiseGo is a very ambitious long term project, so investors need to be really patient and if there's one thing most investors in this market aren't, it's that.

The next time big news about OmiseGo comes out it will go crazy I think. We just need to be patient, if you sell now you'll be too late to buy back in when it happens. When new investors find out the extend of this project; that Omise is an established billion dollar fintech company, that they have a huge partnership with MCDonalds, that they're backed by Thai bank krungsri (which is part of Japan's largest bank) and that OmiseGo is clearly one of Vitalik's favorite projects it will have a very positive effect on price.

This is a good analysis of the project: http://strategiccoin.com/omnisego-research-report/

In conclusion these are the pros and cons of OmiseGo IMO:

Pros:

- They're targeting a huge market. Many fintech companies that do payment services have multi billion dollar valuations. If OmiseGo can successfully disrupt this market by using the blockchain to decentralize it, it will be a major breakthrough. Look at valuations of Ripple and Stellar for example, which are in a similar industry.

- Omise the parent company of OmiseGo is one of the largest fintech companies in Thailand with a large customerbase and market share.

- OmiseGo has a very capable all star team with Vitalik Buterin as an advisor. It's not just that they put a selfie with Vitalik on their website, they're actually in touch with him regularly.

- They already have some major strategic partnerships with MCDonalds Thailand and the Thai bank which is a part of Japans largest bank (Mitsubishi financial group).

- The blockchain they're developing is going to be the first one to integrate Plasma and it's Proof of Stake, so you can earn income by staking it. 

Cons:

- OmiseGo is developing their own blockchain with Proof of Stake, but it isn't finished yet. Right now it's only an ERC20 token. They're aiming to finish the first parts of the project in Q2 2018.

- It's a very long term, complex and ambitious project. This makes investors impatient and a lot of people misinterpret what OmiseGo actually is. A lot of people either don't understand the whitepaper or can't even be bothered to read it.

- The website doesn't have a clear concise roadmap with a time line, which I think they should have. It's very unclear how far they are with the project and when they're expecting to finish parts of the roadmap. This might be putting some investors off.

- They don't have an open source Github. This makes people skeptical about the progress.

TL;DR: OmiseGo is a very long term, ambitious and complex project that had some major hype. The OMG team caused a lot of that hype themselves and when they started being more modest on social media that hype died down a little. It also suffered a lot from China regulations, which caused the entire market to go down for a couple of months. Besides that this is still a very promising project. The parent company Omise is an established billion dollar fintech company with an all star team, they are regularly in touch with Vitalik Buterin who is an important advisor, the market they're aiming for is huge and they already have (strategic) partnerships with MCDonalds Thailand and a Thai bank which is part of the largest Japanese bank.

personalfinance,"Saving account, 401k, roth ira, and investing, am I doing too much?","So I finally got my first job this past August. I'm teaching, and love it. Will probably get a second job next year to get some more income.

So far I haven't been the wisest when it comes to saving. I've been blowing my past few paychecks on credit card debt and unnecessary luxuries. I've gotten it out of my system and am now ready to be more serious about saving for my future. I'm 26 and also live with my parents, so I don't really have to worry about rent or other expenses at the moment.

So I began a saving account with Goldman Sachs (highest interest rate) when I first started my job and so far have $4,000 saved in there. I am about to open a 401K (the school system doesn't do it for you...). I also just opened a Roth IRA with Ally and am thinking of starting ""self-directed trading"" with them as well.

My idea is this:

-GS savings is more of a short/long term saving that I can use for my summers and just store spare change in (for vacations and such).

-401K is self explanatory.

-Roth IRA will be money I just won't touch and will add on to monthly.

-Do the self-directed trading as a past time to learn about the stock market and get some experience in it (this whole bitcoin situation woke me up to the potential of investing)

Bitcoin,question about the tax stuff...,"This might sound stupid of me but can't help but think that the tax situation on crypto is kind of an overstep on the IRS's behalf. when looking at this market and how bitcoin and all the other currencies work together it seems as if this is a market that can not be regulated by any entity outside of itself. It's almost built like a glass bubble, any attempt to regulate or apply restrictions to it seems as if it would break the market for most of crypto-currency as we know it. if you tax each transaction on the fly you end up with a paper trail so long you would have to hire the entire worlds population over in IRS auditors and you would still likely end up getting left in the dust. that is not even mentioning the fact that by taxing per event most people wouldn't even be able to trade alt coins at that point. (tax+fee=more people sitting on coins longer and less trades) the market has been operating by itself with absolutely ZERO backing or support by the government and yet somehow they think everyone should pay them because people trading in crypto made a profit using a platform that doesn't even involve them? that seems incredibly arrogant and presumptuous to me.

 This entire taxation seems like it would be better to just leave on the back end. skip all of the per transaction events and just tax on the cash out, a base percentage. its simple, its smart (lets be honest, before this most people probably didn't even think about paying taxes on their coin profits.) and last but not least it doesn't hurt the American people that are already in the market enjoying a system that doesn't require ANY intervention from ANY government. 

IF the IRS wants to get involved then that means all coins better be backed and federally insured. this also means that thefts must be investigated and given the same treatment as any other theft, fraud, or any other type of crime involving currency. otherwise i see no reason why ANYONE should even bother reporting their gains. how is uncle sam going to know if everyone jumps ship and starts using VPN's to do their trades and pretend to be someone that is not a US citizen? dumping coin gains in overseas bank accounts? it seems like the government is SO greedy and hungry that its willing to kill the hand that feeds it. again, this is just what it seems like from me. I'm not 100% sure on this but it really and honestly seems to me that no government is entitled to any tax from ANY crypto-currency unless it is a tax on a transfer to it's own currency, anything more is an overstep and a fee on something that we get nothing from. this will be an event that will ultimately kick America out of the bitcoin market gating the American people from yet another opportunity to live the American dream!

personalfinance,Increasing home value or paying principle,"So i bought a home for about 170k with a FHA 0 down, with a first time home owners grant (15k).   After 5 years the 15k is 100% forgiven, and will be considered my home equity.

I pay for PMI, and my 5 year plan is to refinance, since i have a really high mandatory interest rate with this setup.   I would like to go Conventional, and have 20% of the homes value in equity.

So paying an additional 50 a month nets me 3000, and off of pure amoritization, ill be 10k(approx) in equity.  Leaving me somewhere between 5-10k shy of 20%.   So i need to either increase value of the home OR pay more in equity.   

I can pay an additional 166 to cover the 10k (total 216) OR invest in the house.  Would solar panels increase the value of homes, while they are purchased with a loan?  Also i am buying a new AC unit, not sure if that would increase the value.

The reason for the refi is so we can let my wifes father live there on disability while we start our family in a bigger home, and he can pay the mortgage himself.   Thus we can sell the bigger home in 20ish years after kids graduate, and move back to this home when its fully paid off.  Thus we can pay for kids school and have plenty of retirement money.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Moonshots are landing on the moon 6/6! SNOV, BNTY, ELIX, DRGN, KCS, DBC (Strategy Inside!)","Today is an exciting day as we are officially 6/6 on KuCoin picks, and if you’ve seen KuCoin they have 40% of their coins in the red on a daily basis. We all deserve a little congratulations as we’ve outperformed every metric there can be to define a week of success. The 6 picks from the past 8 days are on average up 150% (which can only be said of the top 1 or 2 performers on all of Binance and Bittrex for the same period). None have even shown signs of pulling back. Another very positive thing for us KuCoin early entrants is that Binance and Bittrex have suspended allowing new traders. That means guys like you are flocking to alternative exchanges (like KuCoin) to get involved in the crypto world. KuCoin has increased their daily volume every single day for the past 2-week, their twitter eagerly displays this info, and they updated their servers to handle significantly higher trading capacity. 

So now everyone’s favorite part (as it is mine too considering we’ve been making 50% on anything held 24hrs, 100% on anything held 48hrs, and 150%-200% on anything held 72hrs).
Once again we didn’t even have to wait 24hrs for SNOV to demonstrate to the 100s of haters that initially flock to my posts, but disappear 2 hours after my coins are up 40% compared to the market averages. It hasn’t “mooned” but it is up over 60%, which is a win in anyone’s book! Moonshots are officially 6/6 with a new one to be added tomorrow given our recent success! The moonshots are now all officially up between 75% and 400+%, let’s hear it for SNOV, ELIX, DBC, BNTY, DRGN, and KCS. Not only has the moonshot list had huge gains, we have had other 100%ers in the last 10 days. XRP, BNB, NXT (80% if you were late to the party), ENJ, NEO, ICX, and XEM. We have had a very successful week make sure you don’t forget to tip the dealer/researcher/Redditer who is putting in all this effort to share winners with you!

Today’s Moonshot KuCoin Pick: SNOV (Yes, I know it was yesterdays but I feel it is still the most undervalued, today is the time to double down until it hits 2000 Satoshis and is currently sitting at 1200 approx.)

Referral link (if you need one PM me, can't post it here)

I like SNOV even more today than yesterday. Yes, we’ve all experienced a nice gain and I always follow my rule, pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. However, we have to compare SNOV to other recent moonshots. Anyone who has sold a moonshot to date has lost out as my first 2 picks KCS and DRGN are up the higest %s. This demonstrates that HOLDING is as important as monitoring important times to buy and sell. I’ve added $$ (well BTC) to KuCoin as the opportunities here are much more significant than on Binance and Bittrex with new $$ and traders flowing in and new coins being listed regularly there are endless possibilities. SNOV is located on KuCoin with a market cap of approximately 55 million. This has true moon potential as reaching 100-200million is feasible in the very short term. If it approaches a very reachable $100million or $200million market cap the value of the SNOV will increase 200 – 400%. I am predicting this increase to take place within the next month as SNOV makes its way to larger exchanges. 2 days ago money flooded into BTC as you could see in the BTC price rise. I predicted this 48hrs ago that institutional money would get involved within the next 72hrs, and we had our 20% BTC price climb. What happens immediately following a BTC price climb? The alts respond! I expect SNOV to have overreacted to the BTC climb and will in turn correct even more significantly. 24hrs prior this coin was trading at 1200Satoshis. As I am writing this SNOV is at 830Satoshis the first time, and at 1200 Satoshis now. This means a 50% return can be not only achieved, but expected tomorrow (or within 72hrs when the alts correct). The prior 5 alts all hit in order as predicted. I wouldn’t expect SNOV to be any different. I actually like SNOV very much because it had a significant gain yesterday correlated to the BTC spike, and now that BTC has settled SNOV should skyrocket. It has corrected to the pre BTC price collapse but has yet to excel like the many others located on KuCoin. Sunday’s pick remains SNOV, I personally am doubling down by rotating $$ out of stagnant positions in Binance and Bittrex. To the moon in 24hrs? Maybe not, but I do expect returns in the 40-100% range within 48hrs. TODAY’S KuCoin PICK: SNOV. However, I do promise to have a new KuCoin pick for tomorrow so I’d get crypto transferred in today for tomorrow’s pick! When SNOV appreciates slightly more it will tip the scale to my “new pick” being undervalued in comparison at which point I will recommend it. I am going to continue ride the alt wave all day as DRGN, BNTY, ELIX, KCS, and SNOV (#1) should all trend north tomorrow. I also plan on transferring a decent amount for Monday’s pick! Diversification is key, but it is important to still HOLD.

Sunday’s move, double down on SNOV, get more $$ into KuCoin for tomorrow, be ready for the 8am KuCoin pick! I have 2 I am debating between currently and have a few final decisions to make! However, I am doubling down on SNOV, adding money to KuCoin for tomorrow, and purchasing the other 5 recommended moonshots (all 5 keep trending north). My highest % ownership of the moons is SNOV (since I doubled down) and I expect this to be the fastest gainer in the next few days when compared to the other moons, but by owning all you CYA (cover your…). 

(Disclaimer: The below paragraph has not been editing just describing what SNOV does.)
What does SNOV do?! It is the first blockchain based lead generation service. Every company I’ve known, had friends and family work for, etc. they use leads regularly. SNOV brings that same concept to the blockchain. Leads are an essential aspect of most businesses and as business generally moves to a safer, faster method, the blockchain. I also expect businesses like lead generation to similarly successfully follow suit.  A niche market, a small market cap, few exchanges hosting SNOV, and an already functioning platform SNOV should moon very shortly. Check out their website if you don’t believe me . The ‘blockchain’ was missing a lead generation service and SNOV is an early entrant into what will continue to be a booming market for the years to come. SNOV should see the moon by the end of this weekend. At a bare minimum prepare for launch!

ELIX (yesterday’s pick) is still a very important HOLD as their team posts weekly updates, is active on social media, has many Q&amp;A sessions and implements expeditious development of their software. ELIX has continued their northern trend and I do not recommend selling as I recommend adding funds from alternative places like BTC, ETH, LTC or Fiat. You don’t want to divest and have it moon the following day (which has happened countless times). Unlike most coins ELIX has 2 full time Devs that have met every deadline to date. Elixir’s purpose is ‘crowdfunding on the blockchain’ a blockchain niche that even the lending companies haven’t migrated into. The goal is decentralized crowdfunding, at a much lower cost. They also have a lending service and payment ledger which can be used to track and create loans based on agreed upon interest rates, length, and a detailed description.

I want to reiterate my position on holding ELIX, DRGN, BNTY, KCS, and DBC. Profits from other exchanges should be rotated into KuCoin to take advantage of the unreasonable returns we’ve been able to attain there this week. The pick is SNOV for today and yesterday! I believe SNOV should have the highest return in the next 72hrs when compared to alternatives on KuCoin. However, BNTY should continue its rise as it gets added to a new exchange. DRGN is not left to die by Disney and is leading the charge to get on Binance (they also have a production deal coming up!). I am extremely bullish on DRGN even at a 400% increase this week. I expect a Disney associated press release in the next few weeks and a new exchange listing. KCS will win because it is one of the few exchanges still accepting new patrons, AND they give 90% of the trade commission back to KCS holders and as referrals. This type of referral and KCS dividend is unheard of in exchange marketplaces.

I have approximately 30-40% of my portfolio in moonshots (I have a high risk tolerance) and every time 1 coin holding is disproportionately more valuable than the other I reallocate funds from the larger portfolio holding to the smaller holding. In this case DRGN is up huge (KCS is a hold for other reasons, the dividend and rapid site growth). DRGN being up almost 300% means 20-100% of your holding’s in DRGN should be sold and diversified between ELIX, DBC, KCS and now SNOV!. There is no room for nostalgia. Make your %, and reallocate. If you are feeling attached to your KuCoin coins, sell ones on Binance and Bittrex and transfer more funds into Kucoin!

I also have 2 new ICO recs, if you need referral links or the ICO recs see my daily full report! :)",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinancing Indian education loan with a personal loan,"Hi PF,

A rather simple question for all you experts. Am in a bit of a conundrum about my education loans. Just a little background, I have around $43k outstanding debts with an interest rate of 10.55% from India. Institutions in the US don't refinance education loans from other countries (at least India). My FICO score is 760 and it's on the rise every month. 

So the next viable option is to take out a personal loan from  any of the 100+ credit unions or banks and use it towards my education debt. Even personal loans have a lesser interest rate than 10.55%. And just moving debts might save significant amount of cash. I understand no bank will give me a $43k personal loan but even if they approve a $15k loan it'll be sizeable chunk of savings. 

But I called discover today and explained to them the situation and they flat out refused to even look into the application. Their reason was Discover don't give out personal loans for refinancing post secondary education loans (or something of that ilk). Can anyone explain what it means? Is it illegal to do this? Will no banks be able to give me a personal loan with this intention? 

I am already paying $600 each month towards the education loan. I would much rather pay that towards a personal loan with a lesser interest. 

Any advice/suggestions?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"If you're not investing in the Lending sector, you should be","Consider the market we are living in right now. Everyone has FOMO over every new hot coin, and nobody has the capital that they wish they had to make the gains they wish they could.

Let's say I read about a perfect coin project coming down the pipe. Team, whitepaper, product, need, all of it checks out and it looks great. Only problem is, I only have $5000 to spend and its all wrapped up in another promising coin. This is the dilemma that each of us faces, every single day - we want to invest in new promising projects, but we're scared to death to that as soon as we sell our existing holds, they will shoot up and we'll want to kill ourselves.

In Steps Lending Dapps

With lending Dapps, I can post my existing currency as collateral for a loan in ETH/BTC. So if I hold 1000 VEN, am scared to sell, and I want to buy a bunch of XLM at an attractive price, now I can do that by putting my VEN up as collateral for an Ether loan.

What this also does is introduce futures and shorts to crytpo, in a sense. Take ETHLEND (LEND), for instance. Their product currently requires a borrow to post possible offers, but what they are working towards is having the lenders post their offers. So if I'm a seller I can say ""I'll offer $3000 in the form of 3 ETH as a loan for 30 days, at a 5% interest rate, but I will only accept XLM tokens as collateral"".

See what just happened there? The lender is making 2 assumptions:

-ETH will remain static, go down, or will rise less than the price of the interest on the loan
-XLM will go remain static, go up, or decrease less that price of the interest on the loan

Lending platforms will be a way to trade against expected future values of coins/tokens, while also offering borrowers access to more capital, and lenders a predictable return on their assets.

Look for these projects to go up in the short term, IMO. I like LEND but they need t get their shit together marketing-wise.",cryptocurrency

Should I contribute more in my loan payments and adjust my 401k contributions?

* **Age**: 23
* **Loan Balance 1 Year Ago**: $46k 
* **Current Loan Balance**: ~$30k
* **Average Interest**: 2.3%

I've been making payments ahead of time on my loans, and now that the average interest rate is relatively low (down from +6%), I'm thinking it might make sense to start throwing more money into  ETFs and being less aggressive with my loan payments.

My rationale is that if I put myself on a 5 year repayment plan, it will come out to around $530 a month. Assuming I get returns of, conservatively, at least 3% on the ETFs I invest in; after 5 years I should come out ahead.

VA CU likes to reorder transactions to charge NSF fees it seems like they do this in an excessive fashion to maximize the amount of fees they can charge. I feel like what would have been 1 or 2 NSF's w/ Chase turn into 4-5 w/ VA CU. They also have strict spending limits on their cards, they blocked my card on Black Friday because I would have exceeded my daily $1,000 spend limit (i had way more than enough in the available in my account) I was super embarrassed at a busy Target store and had to travel to an ATM and re-ring my transactions uggh. Also they always place extended holds on my checks for example when I sell company stock and get a check larger than $500 guess what 5 day reg cc hold. I've deposited these checks plenty of times, i've never had a returned check on my acct either seems like they want to hold it and collect interest as long as possible. Never had this issue w/ Chase or Citi Just seems like they have slow backend systems since they're a po-dunk credit union.

CryptoCurrency,"My thoughts on POE, and why 2018 could be big for Poet","#**INTRODUCTION**#

Let me explain – if you’re new to Poet, POE can be simply described as follows:

1.  A decentralized platform that allows publishers to license, identify, and monetize digital content such as blog posts, news articles, YouTube videos, audio/music, e-books and more.

2.  It ensures content creators will receive credit and be financially rewarded for the content they create.

3.  Poet is more efficient and global than standard copyrighting due to its speed and decentralized nature


##**What makes POE great?**##

Think about all of the articles, news posts, and videos stolen on the internet today… Social media is notorious for this.

Poet seeks to offer a tangible and immediate solution to this problem that, before now, has been extremely difficult to control in our ever-expanding and evermore transparent digital world.

To put it simply, it is difficult to legally enforce who owns digital content created online. Poet plans to resolve this.

It will ensure creators are credited for their work and rewarded accordingly. Blockchain quite literally provides the solution to this and Poet is the key.


##**Why POE?**##

1. Mass adoption is very near. Poet is currently testing a WordPress plugin, Frost app, that is scheduled to go live in Q1 2018. Due to the widespread use of WordPress, when this goes live, Poet will be available to over 300 million websites at the flick of a switch.

2. The community is growing rapidly and the Poet team has been aggressive in expanding its community team to best position the platform for continued growth and adoption.

3. Realistic, yet aggressive roadmap: The Poet roadmap is one of the few roadmaps I’ve seen that clearly outline the goals and do so in a very realistic timeframe. In addition to this, their product is coming very soon.

4. Undervalued market cap: Inevitably a critical factor for any investor. My personal belief is that project is just getting started. This project aims to target a market of nearly 1 billion+ websites, and that doesn’t even include the number of articles, posts, videos, and audio attached to these sites. Poet is just now beginning to gain a lot of momentum and hasn’t even begun their public marketing campaign. The development team has been extremely transparent and continues to seek out the community to regular input and feedback. This team has performed brilliantly thus far and continues to meet and exceed expectations!


##**COMPETITORS**##

There aren’t any companies directly doing anything quite like Poet. The closest comparable are maybe VeChain *(Tracks real-world goods)*, Tron *(Content hosting, Justin Sun compared to a Facebook or Youtube)*, and Publica *(Marketplace for ebooks like Barnes &amp; Noble or Amazon)*, but their goals are completely different and would not resolve the issues of content licensing and proof of existence like Poet seeks to achieve. Poet aims to resolve a very specific and achievable goal. 

- Poet aims to resolve a widespread global issue that has not been achieved before.

- Allows for any content creator to utilize its platform for proof of existence.

- Allows publishers to license, identify, and monetize digital content easily and seamlessly.

- Will prevent plagiarism and allow for content disputes via community trusted mediators.

- More efficient than copyrighting

- Completely decentralized

CryptoCurrency,My analysis (as a relatively early investor of OMG) of why OmiseGo is not taking off as much as other coins lately,"Original post by u/redderper

I've been in OMG since it was $1.50. The thing is, it went absolutely crazy from around $3 to $14 because the Omise team was very good at hyping it. They announced partnerships almost weekly and posted these vague pictures with Apple logos, pictures at the Google HQ, announcements of announcements etc. This did work very well for them, people remembered the name and started doing their research on OmiseGo. After doing their research they of course invested.

Eventually a lot of people became fed up with it and told Omise to cut down on the hype. Omise responded very professionally to this IMO and they indeed became a bit more modest on social media. After this the China regulations happened, the whole market went down for a couple of months including OmiseGo. In the last couple of months OMG hasn't had a large rally anymore, probably because people are jumping on other hype trains and the market has become a little watered down with all these new coins. OmiseGo is a very ambitious long term project, so investors need to be really patient and if there's one thing most investors in this market aren't, it's that.

The next time big news about OmiseGo comes out it will go crazy I think. We just need to be patient, if you sell now you'll be too late to buy back in when it happens. When new investors find out the extend of this project; that Omise is an established billion dollar fintech company, that they have a huge partnership with MCDonalds, that they're backed by Thai bank krungsri (which is part of Japan's largest bank) and that OmiseGo is clearly one of Vitalik's favorite projects it will have a very positive effect on price.

This is a good analysis of the project:

http://strategiccoin.com/omnisego-research-report/

Recent video posted by its founders:

https://youtu.be/xJ0rCyBK_DI

In conclusion these are the pros and cons of OmiseGo IMO:

Pros:

* They're targeting a huge market. Many fintech companies that do payment services have multi billion dollar valuations. If OmiseGo can successfully disrupt this market by using the blockchain to decentralize it, it will be a major breakthrough. Look at valuations of Ripple and Stellar for example, which are in a similar industry.

* Omise the parent company of OmiseGo is one of the largest fintech companies in Thailand with a large customerbase and market share.

* OmiseGo has a very capable all star team with Vitalik Buterin as an advisor. It's not just that they put a selfie with Vitalik on their website, they're actually in touch with him regularly.

* They already have some major strategic partnerships with MCDonalds Thailand and the Thai bank which is a part of Japans largest bank (Mitsubishi financial group).

* The blockchain they're developing is going to be the first one to integrate Plasma and it's Proof of Stake, so you can earn income by staking it.

Cons:

* OmiseGo is developing their own blockchain with Proof of Stake, but it isn't finished yet and right now it's only an ERC20 token.

* It's a very long term, complex and ambitious project. This makes investors impatient and a lot of people misinterpret what OmiseGo actually is. A lot of people either don't understand the whitepaper or can't even be bothered to read it.

* The website doesn't have a clear concise roadmap with a time line, which I think they should have. It's very unclear how far they are with the project and when they're expecting to finish parts of the roadmap. This might be putting some investors off.

* They don't have an open source Github. This makes people skeptical about the progress.",cryptocurrency

That's straight from my online payment history from HESAA student loans (NJCLASS).

I pay $207 every month. my interest rate is variable but remains fixed at 8.6700% each 6 month period which it goes up or down 0.05 or so...

I pay on-time every month.

I called to ask them about it, and I was told that they apply all excess payments to Interest that would normally occur for the following month before they apply it to the balance actually owed. What I find more bizarre, is that some months they seem to apply more of my payment to interest than others... despite being the same exact amount each month.

I have paid over $3400 in monthly payments to this loan over the past 24 months, and have watched only $1200 of it actually be applied to the balance owed.

I have a car loan where I pay my $200/mo every month, and like clockwork, the same exact amount goes toward interest and the same amount goes toward principal.

Is this even legal for them to do this? If I wanted to pay $1000 towards the balance (only $6000) could they put $23 towards the balance and pocket the $1000 as ""future interest"" as they seem to have been doing?

I purchased a 2010 Chevrolet Camaro with 70k on the odometer that month. Discover's Fico Credit Score Card puts me at 646 for the month of Sept.  I've searched previous post and can't find anything recent in regards to acceptable rates. Is this APR normal, did I get swindled?

edit: I contacted USAA to ask about a lowered interest rate. They told me that I can apply for refinancing at that the original loan rate was based off of my credit history, income, and age+mileage on the vehicle; they use Experian. The income I reported in September is much lower than my income now. I plan to apply for refinancing in a few months once I get my credit score up by paying the rest of my balances and not applying for anymore lines of credit. Looks like I'll be able to pay off the 60 month loan much sooner than that.  My current monthly take home is $3200 after taxes and I am accepting an additional job sometime in April. My rent is $500 a month, and the only bills I have are: car insurance ($375), loan payment ($299), Discover It Student Card, Amazon Prime Store Card, CapitalOne Platinum.

Thank you for the advice and information.",finance
personalfinance,23.99 percent APR car loan,"Being in a hard spot, I just signed a predatory car loan with a 23.99% interest rate.

I'm really regretting this decision, but have terrible credit and needed transportation to work. After doing some research, I plan on refinancing as soon as possible. I'm hoping that even though my credit is horrible, I can find a better rate. My credit only sucks because I was temporarily unemployed and am playing catch-up. I do also plan on dumping my tax return into the vehicle to avoid prolonging the situation. 

Regardless, it seems the legal maximum for interest in my state is 21%.
I'm not sure if this only applies to credit cards or not. I read that I may be allowed to sue for up to three times the amount of the principal, if I'm not mistaken. The state is Indiana, wondering if anyone had any advice or insight.

Sorry for poor sentence structure, I guess that just like my purchase I haven't thought this situation through.

Edit: not hoping to sue. Just hoping this could be leverage for a lower rate? Idk. I need the vehicle, pretty sure I'm stuck until refinancing.",finance

Bitcoin,A Bitcoin Proposal For Fiat,"An important advancement for our global civilization is the achievement of international stability of currencies. The goal is not stabilization of purchasing power, which is an impossible feat, but the removal of the political component of respective national money supplies.

We see this as achieved by either the scenario of Bitcoin becoming a ubiquitous global currency in conjunction with the hyperinflation of centrally managed national currencies, or via major central banks achieving international value stability between their national currencies by inflation targeting Bitcoin.

Consider a scenario in which Bitcoin becomes globally adopted as a currency. If the price trend in Bitcoin terms of a certain good in country A differs from that of the same good in country B, this would signal a difference between each country’s supply and demand curves of that certain good as opposed to differences between each country’s monetary policies.

In the second scenario, where central banks successfully value target Bitcoin, any differing price trends of a certain good between country A and country B would also reflect the differences between local supply and demand curves of that certain good in country A versus country B.

Both scenarios describe a comparable and favorable result in which the local price signals of goods are conveyed free of the noise created by political intervention in the supply of money, while still affording central banks the ability to enact monetary policy to fulfill their mandate of stabilizing their respective economies.

In the scenario where central banks inflation target Bitcoin, it becomes comparable to the ICPI (Industrial Consumption Price Index) that in his works entitled Ideal Money, John Nash argued COULD be used as a central banking value target for the optimization of each nation's money supply.

The ICPI is a decentralized array of regularly adjusted commodity prices. We observe that Bitcoin fulfills the necessary apolitical consideration that such an array of prices seeks to provide. Moreover, it addresses the necessity of a mechanism for regular adjustment, while avoiding the introduction of a political component.

This political component is avoided by the novelty of Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment algorithm explained in the following quote:

&gt; The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. If the price is below cost, then production slows down. If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more. At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.

The expected value of the instantaneous production and consumption of block header candidates is a price discovery of the costs required to produce a Bitcoin. This, in conjunction with the decentralized nature of mining, suggests a Bitcoin standard can serve as a perfect international basis for value stabilization not unlike gold standards observed in favorable economic times in our history.

Our proposal is that any changes to Bitcoin should be made with full consideration towards maintaining its ability to serve as a monetary policy basis comparable to a theoretical ICPI.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"28, homeless, and looking to financially rebuild my life.","Hey there Reddit, here's a bit of backstory on how I got into the hole I'm in:

I've always worked in food service, I never really had a plan for myself career wise or financially. Figured long as I had what I needed then what I was doing was fine. Wasn't interested in college, after all in the day and age where I can learn any skill on the internet for free, what's the point? (Yes I know you don't have to tell me.)

I had a decent job as a restaurant manager, making around $2,800 a month. I had a modest apartment, I'm not very material and I'm only ever home to sleep really. I had a loving girlfriend who I intended to marry, and things were going well for me.

I met someone at work who was a JavaScript engineer who I became friends with, he offered to teach me and maybe even get me a job in his company, which offered around 80k per year, great deal it seems to me! So I make time for his lessons whenever I can and after a while I start to get the hang of it.

Fast forward to the year just past. I won't go into much detail as this is already getting longer than I'd like but to summarize: lost my job, lost my girlfriend, lost my apartment, friend failed to get me a job, and I've been living in the backseat of my car ever since.

I bounced between a few different places before I landed the two fast food jobs I have now. Still living in my car but hope to change that soon.

So, now onto why I'm here and what I'm asking. It's pretty obvious I'm not very smart financially, but I'm looking to change that. I want to get a room rented. Pay off my debt, which is substantial, and go back to school. I need help trying to get my money on track to get these things done.

I make roundabout $2,150 a month between the two jobs, with minor variances depending on my hours between the two and I work roughly 65 hours a week.

My debts are my car and credit card, totalling out to about $13,000.

My total expenses monthly translate out to about $1,190 a month, $960 of that my fixed monthly bills and the rest being variable for gas and food.

So, what can I do to make things better? Obviously get my debts paid, but moving forward, I don't want to just work myself to death, what can I do to work towards living a better life? Any advice is appreciated.

Happy New year to you guys!

personalfinance,What financial goals should I set with my crypto portfolio? Started with $3k now I'm here,"I started reading about, researching and investing in cryptoassets in December 2016, with an initial investment of about $3000. It's been quite a journey and consumed nearly all my free time this past year, but it's been worth it for many reasons, and in the last couple of months I am starting to see paper profits that are actually on the verge of being potentially lifechanging for me. I've already cashed out around 8x my initial investment and used it to pay off debt, and now have a portfolio worth around 48x the initial investment.

My assets and liabilities a year ago (net worth: -$109k):

* +2.5 BTC (about $3k)

* -$12k in revolving debt

* -$15k in private student loans

* -$85k in Federal student loans (which, unlike the private loans, are eligible for income-based repayment. It's probably worth mentioning that my regular income is around $30k a year as an independent contractor, with deductions taking that down to around $18k, which makes me eligible both for IBR for Federal student loans, and for an ObamaCare subsidy.)

My assets and liabilities right now (net worth: +$60k):

* +9 BTC worth of several cryptoassets -- mostly BCO, BTC, BIS, EVX, BTCZ, XRB, LUN, PASC, LTC (about $145k)

* -$85k in Federal student loans

Throughout 2017, I sold about $12k worth of crypto, paid off all of the revolving debt and about $4k of private student loans. So far in 2018, I've sold an additional $11k to pay off the rest of the private student loan. My only liability now is $85k in Federal loans.

What I'm not clear on is at what point it's worth cashing out some of my portfolio going forward, and for what. Paying off all my credit cards and private student loans were obvious goals, but now there are no more obvious goals, only nebulous tradeoffs.

Is it worth paying off part of my $85k of Federal loans if doing so triggers a tax events that ends up accelerating the rest of them by increasing my IBR payment?

How much cash should I have as an emergency fund? By now I feel comfortable enough holding private keys to BTC (and understanding the math behind what they actually are) that in a way it almost feels more secure than an emergency fund. But at the same time, I do want to mitigate the appropriate amount of volatility and hacking/data loss/Meltdown/Spectre/rise of quantum computing risk.

At what point ($250k? $400k?) should I start thinking about other financial goals? Honestly, I like what I do for a living so early retirement is not a priority, although exploring some other paths/projects might be interesting too. I want to buy my mom a house at some point, but that is still very much a ""reach"" goal for now (probably worth mentioning that I'm 32, single, live at home and pay most of the rent here). 

Also, until this year I never gave any thought to traditional investing for retirement, because I never had a financial time horizon that long. Now, I definitely don't ever want to be out of crypto entirely, but at some point the market cycle will change and it may make sense to diversify into other asset classes before then. At the same time, I don't want to dilute potential returns by diversifying into asset classes where I'm relatively clueless.

So, I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts on this! It feels like there's not exactly an established script for this situation yet -- it's different from an undeserved windfall in that I created, grew and managed the asset, doing so with a high-information approach. But it's similar to an undeserved windfall in the sheer magnitude of returns, and in the fact that on the fiat side of things I still have somewhat of a poverty mindset, and have never really made long term financial plans before.",finance

btc,BTC is currently 5x pricier than BCH despite having a far less attractive investment proposition. Is that a market failure? Analysis inside.,"TL;DR: My answer is, ""Not yet.""

Let's look at a few examples:

At the end of 2012, bitcoins were trading at $10. They should probably have been trading much higher, since in 2013 they were trading at $100 and $1000, despite only a marginal advancement of use cases over the course of the year. 

Whether you believe $10 was too low or $1000 was too high, the question remains: *Do short-term radical underpricings or radical overpricings constitute a market failure?*

I think most will say no, because otherwise all assets would move solely in accordance with the strength of their fundamentals. 

In addition, all assets moving upward, however steadily they move at first, inevitably enter a mania phase when a broader audience notices that the asset ""only goes up."" An analogous phenomenon happens on the downside with panic selling.

The mania can add 5x or 10x to the price, and a panic can do the same in reverse. Add to that the basic factor that it takes even astute value-seeking investors time to notice and research each asset, especially if its fundamentals are complicated. This results in further short-term mispricing.

The above is all the more true if there is mass censorship interfering with value-seeking investors' tendency to notice the asset as something worthy of consideration, as well as their ability to conduct proper research on it. If that censorship is carefully hidden, the situation is even more distorted. 

Thus we have the result, both from historical example and from basic market psychology and the practicalities of investment research on a complicated technology (which is currently facing major added political complications), that a cryptocurrency can easily find itself 10x or even 100x away from what its fundamentals may justify. 

If ""market failure"" is taken to mean any large mispricing of an asset, even in the short run, the term would lose all meaning as such temporary mispricings are so common that no asset is immune to them. The term can only have meaning on a longer timescale. It seems reasonable to define ""market failure"" such that the extent of the failure is proportional to the duration of the mispricing, not just its magnitude. 

Moreover, for the most obscure and hard-to-research assets that few people really understand, especially ones plagued by temporary political suppression and misrepresentation, the allowance for duration before we call it a failure should be especially high. It takes even fundamentals-driven, value-seeking investors (as opposed to trend-chasing traders) much more time to notice and research such investments so as to effect a repricing on fundamental terms. 

To this we must add further allowance for any short-term influx or exodus of ""dumb money"" obscuring the picture, which is especially strong right now (even Ripple got its pump, and crypto has become the talk of the town). 

This all means that huge mispricings lasting even a year or more should not be surprising. 

Now if we apply this reasoning to the relative price of two assets, we can see that BCH currently being 5x or 6x cheaper than BTC is well within the range of temporary market noise. Another tripling of BCH and halving of BTC would constitute a flippening. These kind of moves have been routine throughout Bitcoin's history, especially during mania phases, and this must again be added to the fact that Bitcoin has recently become substantially harder to analyze. Radical moves and reshufflings are to be expected at any time, even if a short-term calm pervades for weeks or even months (as happened in mid-2013).

Let's look at another scenario to get an even broader and clearer perspective:

Most people believe Keynesian economics, or at least have been convinced that a degree of inflation is good and deflation is evil. What if the Fed makes a ledger-copy of Bitcoin but adds a bunch of extra inflation and then markets the heck out of it? Perhaps they even allow the inflation rate to be set by the Fed as an oracle, allowing for runaway inflation to meet the needs of the government in times of war or other crisis.

The market cap of this Bitcoin ledger-copy would likely exceed that of Bitcoin (BCH+BTC) for a time. In fact, since it is a ledger-copy, it would probably take on the Bitcoin name by convention. 

However, self-destructing money does not maintain its dominance for long, especially if that self-destruction increases in runaway fashion. Thousands of years of history have born this out, from ancient Rome to interwar Germany to present-day Venezuela. 

Ironically, this is exactly what is happening with the BTC ledger-copy of the asset formerly known as ""BTC."" On August 1, 2017, two ledger copies were made of Bitcoin: one called BTC and one called BCH. 

The old asset known as BTC was discontinued that day, a fact obscured by the renaming, with the BCH ledger-copy adding an 8MB blocksize cap and the new BTC (a different asset than the old BTC) adding Segwit. BCH's investors are largely committed to large blocks, whereas BTC's investors are largely committed to tiny blocks and waiting for the Lightning Network to be fully invented. 

Core created a ledger-copy remarkably similar to the Fed's self-destructing money. The only difference is that *instead of your money crumbling away due to runaway inflation, your money crumbles away every time you go to spend it (or mix it or otherwise move it) due to runaway fees.*

The net result is that BTC is functionally about the same as the US dollar in terms of holder dilution (actually far greater dilution for anyone with the net worth and spending habits of the average consumer), but the Core ledger-copy has the additional huge burden of extreme transactional friction making commerce completely pointless in the first place (with all hope pinned on an as-yet *not even fully specified* second-layer contraption that its inventors say requires 100MB blocks anyway and is already requiring 3rd and 4th layers).

**Instead of the Fed creating holder-dilution coin backed by its own authority position and that coin temporarily pumping higher than Bitcoin and temporarily taking on the Bitcoin name, Core has created holder-dilution coin backed by its own authority position and that coin has temporarily pumped higher than Bitcoin and temporarily taken on the Bitcoin name.**

Whether this is a central banker conspiracy or just coincidence, the effect is the same: Bitcoin as its original vision shines on despite being temporarily eclipsed in market cap and naming convention by an authority-backed pretender fueled by dumb money. 

Whether this condition persists long enough to be deemed a significant market failure remains to be seen.",cryptocurrency
btc,Thank you R/BTC,"When i first started looking into Cryptocurrency in July of 2017, i found myself amazed at the fact that Bitcoin could really make a positive impact on the entire world, in both an economical and societal sense. 

I quickly jumped on board and bought some BTC to be a part of this revolutionary movement. One month later, the BCH fork was announced and i didn't know who Roger Ver or Jihan Wu or anyone that was responsible for the HF were. I was subscribed to R/Bitcoin that entire time and was fed heavy propoganda and ended up despising Roger &amp; Co. thinking it was an attack on BTC.

Upon HF, i quickly liquidated the BCH i received from the fork for BTC and soon after... this is where the problems with BTC started to become apparent. I started to look at this more objectively and removed all bias and prior perceptions i had for the team and community behind BCH... and to my suprise.. i actually ended up agreeing while lurking from November to December. This was further reinforced by the fact that BTC was then considered as a store of value which featured high fees and slow confirmation times. 

Honestly guys i was blind, but now i see. I'm really glad to be a part of this community as you all treat BCH as an actual currency and not a store of value!

The most interesting part I learned was how security engineers develop their algorithms. Encryption algorithms are battle-proof. They will not thrown out for public use in zero time. It's a hard process of destructive testing that takes years until the algorithm reached a state that can be called secure.
Why is it bad going the same way with crypto currency? Maybe it was not on purpose in case of Doge, but it's a way we are sure our system works.
Every update is a security risk and developers of cryptocurrenies and people put much money into the system and they have to trust the development.

financialindependence,from 21 yr old condo dweller NW 10k to 25M with roommates NW almost 200k. Thank you for teaching your lessons. (here are some of the big ones for me),"I will often see success stories here about people who have accumulated immense wealth at later stages in their life and are kind enough to share their stories. Here are a few of the advice you gave me, and how they have made a positive impact on MY life.



Advice given: one of your hobbies should make you money

How it was used: Tutoring 4 hrs a week gives me great joy, and covers all of my groceries and then some. At these early stages in life, this gave me a huge head start on savings (about 120CAD/week). It honestly feels too good to be true.


Advice given: Live in a place you can afford, there is no shame in roommates.

How it was used: I bought a very cheap triplex at 22, and then a duplex at 24 closer to the city that I could live in. I live in the downstairs with 2 roommates, and now effectively live rent free. More savings. I am looking at triplexes next week so I can purchase ANOTHER property owner occupied, and live in my own small flat rent free (flat value 700/m, far cry from my 1500/m rented condo).


Advice given: (from a PM) ""Cash out some of your risky investments and pay off your fucking car loan you barn animal""

how it was used: No car payment, less stress, more savings. I find i am not checking my phone constantly for most recent market prices, and my car just feels better knowing it is not bleeding me monthly at almost 6% interest rate.


Advice given: sometimes, you get work benefits just by asking

How it was used: Asked my work to send me to PMP training. They delivered and I write the exam in a month. Once I get this designation, it should help my career in the long run. 


Advice given: Max out TFSA, Max out TFSA. Max out TFSA

How it was used: well...maxed out TFSA, and after you do it the first time its not hard at all. TFSA contribution is limited to 5500/yr, which I can almost cover with tutoring alone. 


Anyway, I have been floored recently, as more and more of my bills approach zero and I have been living well below my means. My rent is zero, my car payment is zero, no loan payments, contribute max out rrsp and then have over 3k take home pay (about 2k leftover to invest after bills and TFSA...and  really know where tf to put it tbh).

personalfinance,Paying down loans (debt) - do you start with the highest interest loan or are there other factor to consider?,"Recently got married, taking a fresh look at our combined finances for 2018. 

We have 2 mortgages, car payments and student loans. 

My inclination tells me to put any of our extra money into paying down my wife’s student loans since it has the highest interest rate of our loans. 

Other than interest rate ... are they’re other factors I should be mindful of when deciding what to start paying down first?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment and Forgiveness,"I'm a mid-level healthcare provider with current loan debt at $187k. ($150k principal with the rest interest at this point). All loans are federal. I made on-time payments for the first two years, but for family reasons, I've had to move overseas indefinitely and am currently on a $0.00/month IBR repayment (hence the high interest, about $15K per year). The fact that the two years of payments I made have been erased by subsequent interest is absolutely crushing. My current $0.00/month payment is counted as ""on time"" towards a 25 year loan forgiveness plan, but what other options do I have, and what will this look like in 25 years? As I understand, the debt will be forgiven at that time (which could be something like $400K) but will be treated as taxable income. How much might that be? I will be about 60 then, and don't know how I would pay that debt off, either.

I am working overseas in a similar role to my career at home but the pay is much, much lower. If I increased my payment to something like $200/month, it would be a great hardship for me and my family, and not make much of a difference on the loan principal or interest. The standard repayment plan is about $2400/month, which is about twice my current monthly income, so not at all possible.

I have looked into PSLF but have not found a US organization that qualifies while I'm working overseas. I have also looked into locums positions in the US that pay a high hourly rate and cover my housing costs so I could have money to throw at the loans, but this makes it very difficult to physically support my family overseas, and I would of course then have to send money back to family. Also, with the locums positions, while I could throw chunks of money at the loans, because they are temporary, I would likely have gaps between jobs where the interest would pile back up. I have also looked at HRSA/FQHC loan forgiveness but it would again require me to be away from my family for a minimum of 2 years, and now that the interest is capitalizing so quickly, the $50k award seems minimal.

I have no other income or assets at this point. I would like to have a child soon, and am at an age where the window for doing so is quickly closing shut. My spouse is not a US citizen and cannot work there at present, so that of course complicates my working there if we want to have a child, on top of other responsibilities to family overseas.

I don't know what to do with my loans or how to strategize. I can't stop thinking about the debt and my overseas income is only about US$19K per year. I wouldn't have taken out the loans if I knew I couldn't pay them back but never anticipated I would find myself overseas supporting family. How should I go about thinking about my loans and what might make the most sense financially? What sort of financial planner or advisor might I need to speak to? How can I find out more information about what the 25 year loan forgiveness/tax payments might look like? What else should I be thinking about?

Thank you for your help and advice.",finance

personalfinance,[US] 25 y/o needs help with multiple closed credit card accounts,"Please no judgments here, I was a stupid college kid when I opened all of these a few years ago and was a stupid college kid when I didn't pay any of them off. I make $50k a year with a $3k bonus in February and my monthly bills are: $750 rent and utilities, $250 car, $50 phone, $1300 student loans (see below.)

https://imgur.com/a/2PoY3

The first picture shows my one open credit card which I opened last year (had to put a deposit down) with a very tiny limit that I pay my utilities with. I got this to actually use a credit card responsibly and pay off immediately. The rest are my 4 closed credit cards. The next picture shows my federal student loans and two accounts in collection. I'll mention now that I used unbury.me to come up with an avalanche plan to pay off my student loans (there are $33k in private loans) in 6 years, without accounting for raises, promotions, etc. This payment is $1300 a month. 

My question here is: how do I fix these closed credit accounts? I am in the process of contacting the two in collections to see if they have payment plans or will settle for a lower amount, however when I spoke to Discover about settling that account a few months ago, they said they would not be able to take it off my credit report and also said they could not guarantee a written letter declaring the settled amount we agreed I would pay off would be sent to me. **This scared me off of settling a closed account, because what is the point if they don't remove it from my report?**

Sage advice appreciated.

**TRUMP - THE NEXT MOVE**

Looking to boost domestic energy production, Friday the Trump administration has proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, including in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans. That would reverse the Obama-era order placing 94% of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers.


**CRYPTO**

Prices retreated from last week’s record highs after Coinbase, one of the largest exchanges for cryptocurrencies said that it has not made a decision to add new currencies to its platform. This dried out recent speculation that it would include Ripple. Ripple now has a market cap of $130 billion, in second place behind Bitcoin. Ripple sells blockchain technology, powered by its own cryptocurrency XPR, to banks and payment providers and other financial institutions to speed up cross-border payments.


**GOOGLE’s CHINESE PRESENCE**

Google made an undisclosed deal in China on E-sport streaming, with gaming live-stream company Chushou. There are other investors as well. Chushou has around eight million streamers and 250.000 live streams per day. Google’s search engine is blocked in China and the tech giant has used investments as a way to broaden its presence in the market.  - Google took a minority stake in Chinese AI startup Mobvoi in 2015 during a $75 million fundraising round.


**GREED INDEED**

Verizon has pulled Bloomberg TV from its offerings for 4.6 million subscribers, after being asked to pay for the content. VZ's argument is that Bloomberg is making the content available to all consumers for free via web and mobile app, and that it shouldn't have to pay carriage fees.


**VW IS STILL THE BEST**

Volkswagen group sales rose to around 10.7 million cars last year, keeping the German behemoth ahead of its Japanese competition as the world's largest automaker. The report came as Ron Stach, senior vice president of sales at Volkswagen of America, left the company. U.S. sales rose 5.2% to 339,676 brand models last year but dropped 19% in December as the carmaker shifted focus to its homeland.

**FX WORLD**

Friday’s NFP has missed big time and our pairs reacted accordingly, or in cases not so subsequently. We are going to have an interesting week, with FED rate hike clues.

The **EURUSD** had a nice run on the NFP report but pulled back to 1.20, which seems to be the support at this point. The pair is still “fighting” 1.21 as it froze the market a bit, if we break it, 1.23 or even 1.25 is doable.

The **GBPUSD** also rallied and turned to the downside. Above 1.365 would mean that we closed a massive gap below and could offer a buy and hold market. Until then just buy the dips, as 1.3333 is the floor.

The **USDJPY** has bounced on Friday, which is interesting since the jobs report numbers missed significantly. This shows that the market is interested to go 115 and beyond. Until we break above, use the dips for entries.

CryptoCurrency,"There is a sub for financial advice, /r/personalfinance. You should understand it before investing in crypto.","The sad thing is complete lack of true financial advice. Some things are different then typical fiat/stock/mutual fund traditional advice.

However many things are similar. People saying ""ALL IN"" are children or poorly informed. Never go all in, never put all your eggs in 1 basket, never buy just 1 stock, 1 coin, etc.

People saying ""don't invest more then you can lose"" are incorrect, to a degree, in the sense that it's a gamble. It should be ""don't invest in super high volatility that you are not comfortable with.""

Your age, location, job stability, family, risk tolerance all support an ideal portfolio.

Young, stable job, risk tolerant people can hold more riskier assests, then say a retired 65 year old.

All investments should be diversified. Holding stock? It better be index funds or mutual funds. Want safe? Try certificates of deposits....but spread them out over various interest rates, over multiple time frames. Lock in $5,000 at 2.1% for 4 years, put another $5,000 in at 1.5% for 1 year, and $5000 at 1.8% for 2.5 years.

DIVERSIFY.

Crypto shouldn't be more then 5% of anyone's portfolio.

If you are under 30, with a 6-figure salary, and 99.999% job security....you should still only hold 5% crypto.

Within that 5% crypto, it should be broken down into stable and risky assests. With the uncertainty of the market, bitcoin and ethereum look to be the ""reserve"" type coin. But even in the crypto world, the iconic, stable Bitcoin and Eth are still insanely volatile compared to traditional investments.

Just to give an idea of my personal portfolio and networth....JUST AS AN EXAMPLE BASED ON MY AGE, INCOME, RETIREMENT GOALS, AND JOB STABILITY:

* 35% Roth IRA and 401K (priority over all others), Vanguard mutual funds (total and international stock)
* 25% Index funds, S&amp;P500, and Healthcare funds
* 25% Home/property collateral
* 10% Emergency (6 month living expenses)
* 5% Crypto and other risky investments including a rare set of sneakers and an original sealed-in the box pokemon red cartridge from 1996.

My 5% cryto is broken down similarly, with higher holdings in more ""stable"" assets such as bitcoin and ether. I say ""stable"" in quotes because its still considered EXTREMELY RISKY by modern investing standards.

* 35% Ethereum
* 25% Bitcoin/Litecoin
* 20% Iota / Stellar / XRB
* 5% OMG / WTC
* 5% REQ / MOD
* 10% SHITCOINS including Tron, Fun, Potcoin, Tittycoin

Some may say that MOD, XLM, REQ, etc. are shitcoins or risky too.  This isn't a crypto coin discussions.  It's a financial warning to the kiddies running around the sub claiming to ""GO ALL IN UNTIL MOON LAMBO.""  The entire crypto section is considered the riskiest part of my portfolio.

If crypto dissolves tomorrow, it's only 5% of my net-worth and I'd be perfectly fine without it.

I literally have 10% of 5% (so .5%) in shitcoins. Tron, Fun, Pot and Titty need to completely tank for me to lose .5% of my total portfolio.

DO NOT GO ALL IN AND KEEP CRYPTO EXPOSURE TO A MINIMUM

**Want to be a millionaire?** Budget yourself, target high interest debt, work 15-25 years and save a much money as possible. Max out your 401k, IRA and other tax exempt savings options. Store money in low management fee mutual or index funds. Most likely buy a house with a sub 4% mortgage rate. Pay off all credit cards completely within the first month, every month.

An IRA at $5500 per year for 40 years can net you over 1 million dollars.

A 401K (with 0% employer match) at $5000 per year for 40 years can net you over 1 million dollars.

If you can save $10,000 per year into 401k/IRA, over 40 years, which totals $400,000....if compounds to over 2 million in a 40 year span.

It's hard to do because wow.. we are up 25% last year alone.

I also wondered about moving a % of our money into a cash equivalent and the only selection we have is:

BLACKROCK FEDFUND 
(INSTITUTIONAL CLASS SHARES) Symbol: AZBGP

I am a novice investor (just started studying last year) but we've invested well in our 401K for the last 15 years.  I am torn about bonds.. I keep reading conflicting info (especially regarding the treasury) about how safe bonds will be in the near future (next couple of years). 

Bonds Available for our 401K are:
VANGUARD INFLATION-PROTECTED SECURITIES FUND
(ADMIRAL CLASS) Symbol: VAIPX

NORTHERN TRUST COLLECTIVE AGGREGATE BOND INDEX FUND
(TIER 1) Symbol: QMCAT

LORD ABBETT BOND DEBENTURE FUND
(CLASS R6 SHARES) Symbol: LBNVX (I know this fund invests in junk bonds and I believe I should not invest a large % in these.)

TOTAL RETURN BOND FUND
(CLASS INSTITUTIONAL) Symbol: FTRBX

So those (4) are my only choices for bonds.. 

I'd love some feedback on a couple of things..

Are bonds that invest heavily in the Treasury safe for the near future with interest rates sure to hike?

Don't they adjust the terms of a bond when they are for sale- to reflect current (future?) interest rates?

Should I spread funds between several of the bonds?

What percentage should I maybe put in cash?

And Lastly.. if the market had a serious crash tomorrow and you wanted to temporarily get totally out of equities, what would you do with only these bond funds (and cash equivalent) available?  We have ALL our retirement in one 401K.  We are looking to retire in 10-15 years.

personalfinance,What to do with an accidental Roth IRA investment when I'm past the income limit for contributing to this account type?,"So as of this year it looks like I've passed the [income limit](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2018) in which I can contribute to a Roth IRA.

However, I forgot to turn off the auto-investment schedule on Vanguard that I had running for 2017. (I have since turned off the auto-investment.)

Now I have a small amount invested in my Roth IRA for 2018 despite no longer legally being able to make any contributions to this type of account.

My question is: **what do I do with this investment?**

- Do I just leave the small amount invested in the Roth IRA and now just set up my contributions for a traditional IRA?

- Do I call Vanguard and see if they can move it from my Roth IRA to my traditional IRA? (I don't even know if this is possible)

- Do I bite the bullet and move the small investment into a brokerage account, possibly paying a 10% federal withholding fee? (It would be relatively minor fee, but this still feels like the worst option.)

- Some other path forward that I'm not aware of at this time?

Any help on what to do that will incur me the least amount of trouble and taxes would be much appreciated.

Thanks everyone :)",finance

Bitcoin,"In 1933, 4,000 banks failed and closed up shop. Washington Mutual had over 300 billion dollars in assets when it failed in 2008.","The US banking system has existed in some form dating back to the pioneer era. Federal insurance (1933) was formed hundreds of years after the first bank was created (1791). It took HUNDREDS of years for the banking system to evolve into its current form and it's still largely untrusted. 

Bitcoin is only NINE YEARS OLD and look how far we've come. The volatility should be obvious and expected. Forget about the adoption curve. Forget about the FUD. We are barely entering the wild west stage of development but the traction we've gained is substantial. The principles of Bitcoin have not changed. The scaling issues are mathematical and technical. And they WILL be solved. Rushing development can have serious consequences so any advancement from here on out will be meticulous and will take TIME. Be patient. 

You always could have traded penny stocks. Alt coins are just a new means to do so. A lot of money will be made but a lot of money will also be lost. Just remember the reason this movement started in the first place.

Your Bitcoin is yours. If you secure them properly, no one can take them from you. That is THE most important component of owning one. It's been battle hardened and stress tested since its creation. A global infrastructure has been lain, entrenching it as the backbone of the cryptocurrency asset class. It is not going anywhere anytime soon.

Remember what P2P did to revolutionize media distribution. Remember what P2P is doing to politically censored countries. Even the concept itself has only been popular for less than 20 years. It's a blip when compared to the legacy systems it serves to revolutionize. 

If you anticipate that Bitcoin is going to disrupt not only the US banking industry but the whole global sector, stop looking at the daily charts. Accumulate when you can. Keep up on technology advancements. But most importantly, HODL!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Seeking financial advice to start the year off right [Planning] [Debt] [Retirement],"Hey all, I’m trying to get my family’s finances in order with the ultimate goal of paying off debts and saving for a down payment on a house. I have a ways to go, and I could really use some guidance. I’ve read through the wiki and have some questions. Any and all help is greatly appreciated. I’ve laid out the basics of our situation below, with questions at the bottom. Many thanks in advance!


**Budget**  
Here’s a brief overview of our monthly budget (post-tax):

*Income:* $8k  
*Mandatory Spending/Bills:* $3,800  
*Savings:* $1900  
*Discretionary Spending:* $2,300  


**Emergency Fund**  
We currently have savings of just under $17k. I figure our 3-month minimum should be around $20k, so we have just a little more to go. But we just had our first child and my wife’s pay will run out in early February. I’ve estimated that we will need to use about $3k of our savings before she goes back on payroll.


**Retirement**  
My wife and I work for the same company. Our employer automatically contributes 5% of our salaries to each of our 403(b)s, regardless of how much we contribute ourselves. That scales up to 7% and then 13% after so many years of employment. My wife will hit the 7% mark soon, and I'm still at 5%. I currently contribute an additional 10% pre-tax, and she contributes 9%.

Our employer offers us the choice of using Vanguard or TIAA-CREF for retirement. When I started here 6+ years ago, I signed up for Vanguard, but my coworkers urged me to switch to TIAA. My wife and I both currently have our retirement funds with TIAA. But in reading through this sub, I keep seeing people recommend Vanguard, so I'm wondering if it would be advantageous to switch.


**Other Assets**  
We own a car that I've estimated to be worth around $4,500 using kbb.com. We also own an apartment that we bought for $30k in 2015. When we decide to sell it we will get the $30k back, adjusted for inflation. Due to the housing program we bought from, we cannot make a profit on the apartment (look up Mitchell-Lama if you’re curious), but living in New York this has saved us a boat-load on rent.


**Debts**  
We currently have several debts, some with very high interest. These include 2 personal loans my wife and I took out to buy our apartment (Mitchell-Lamas are not eligible for mortgages). I also borrowed some money from my parents against their home equity line of credit to cover the difference.

*Personal Loan:* $10k at 10.2%  
*Personal Loan:* $3,500 at 5.95%  
*Home Equity Loan:* $7,400 at 4%  
*Wife’s Student Loans:* $25,400 at varying interest rates – I’m looking into refinancing options  
*Auto Loan:* $4,800 at 2.09%  
*Credit Cards:* $7,200 – almost all of this is on a card with 0% interest until May. We’re planning on using our tax refund to wipe this out. Last year's return was almost big enough to cover our current balance, and I’m anticipating a bigger return this year since we didn’t take an allowance for our child until December.


**My main questions are these:**  
1. Should we contribute less to our 403(b)s in order to pay down debts and/or start paying into IRAs? The wiki indicates it’s best to match employer contributions, then pay off debts before contributing more. But our employer contributes whether we do or not.  
2. Should I consider moving our retirement funds from TIAA-CREF to Vanguard?  
3. Is it better to contribute to an IRA before increasing contributions to my 403(b)?  
4. I’m planning on using our tax refund to wipe out our credit card debt. I want to use the avalanche method, and although our card has no interest until May, it then jumps up to 16.49%. Is this a smart use of my refund?  
5. I’m interested in starting a 529 for my son, but from what I’ve read it seems best if I hold off on that for a while. Should I be doing anything to prepare for his future education expenses now, or focus entirely on our (rather substantial) debts first?

personalfinance,"Help with refinancing mortgage, current mortgage i have is 6.45%","My parents bought a house back in 2008 in state of Colorado. Their  30 year mortgage rate is still the same at 6.45%. I think this is too much and I want to help them refinance the mortgage but my knowledge is limited when it comes to loans and mortgages. English is not our first language, my parents fear all the paperwork and don't understand what refinancing is exactly, I tried to explain it to them and I told them what I know, I could have told them wrong because they still hesitant because of paperwork and mostly closing costs again. Now I want to try to show them even with closing costs at the end will save more because of lower interest rate. I looked at current mortgage rates for 30 years and 15 years and they were around 4.5% and 3.9% and they show that the monthly costs will be lower for my parents by $100-200. I want to take them to local banks to talk with lenders to get better understanding. What things should I know about to help me prepare , any hidden fees that will come with refinancing? Anything to help me help my parents and explain to them that this would be good or bad is appreciated. 
My questions also are: when is a good time to refinance? Will the rate increase or decrease, should they wait? What websites will help me to compare rates, I used nerdwallet and bankrate , my parents prefer something local to go see face to face instead of doing it online. Local banks rates were higher than online banks. And most importantly what happens when refinancing, like will the new lender pay the old lender, is that something I have to worry about?

personalfinance,Bankruptcy vs Credit Card Settlement: Which is better?,"So I'm in debt for about $22,000. I don't want to file for bankruptcy and believe that I have two options:

Option 1) Call each credit card company and attempt to settle with each one with them myself. There are 13 in total.

Option 2) Stop making monthly payments and wait for the bills to go to collections. Once collections get in touch with me, I settle with them.

So here are my questions:

1) Which option is better? Or is one worse than the other? If so, why?

2) I'm assuming either one is better than bankruptcy, but can either one have a longer lasting, or more powerfully negative impact on my record? In other words, would choosing either option above leave any impact on my record the way bankruptcy would? I mean it would ding my credit score (and badly, I would assume), but I can just start to build better credit right away and there's not some ""stain"" that would be left behind for 10 years (or for however many years) as would be the case should I have filed for bankruptcy.

4) Would the collections agencies settle for a lower amount than the credit card companies would? 

5) How much should I expect to settle for? I've heard $0.40 to the dollar? Does that sound about right? What is the average number I should be looking for, if such a number exists?

Besides the above questions, if you have any additional advice that you think would be helpful, I would love to hear it. I am not very knowledgeable about interest rates, credit cards, finances, so I won't feel insulted if you speak to me like a child. I just really need to get this thing rolling and would greatly appreciate any help I can get from you all.

Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Vanguard accounts and funds,"I'm very new to investing and I am a bit confused on the set up at Vanguard. I've read through a ton of reddit posts already and I realize that some of my questions have been answered in the past but I get anxious when it comes to this stuff and want to be completely sure I am taking the right steps.

I just opened a Roth IRA there and contributed the max for 2017 and 2018. I took the money that was put in the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund and put it all into VFFVX (2055 fund). It looks like I did this correct...

Now I have another 12-15k I want to invest. When I try to buy more funds it says I have to add more to the Roth IRA brokerage account but I am already at my limit. So I am guessing this is basically telling me I need to make a separate brokerage account for the purposes of general investing?

Can anyone recommend which funds to get nowadays? I've gone through several reddit posts and determined that I should probably invest in funds as opposed to ETFs. It seems like the most common answer is 40% VBMFX, 40% VTSMX, 20% VGTSX. I don't mind risky investments so I may just make it an even 33% split between the 3. But what about VFINX? Should I include that in the portfolio as well or is it not necessary?",finance

personalfinance,In a bad place.. HELP!,"Now, I'm sure there are much worse cases out there, but I am currently in alot more debt than I need to be and I feel with some good advice it could be taken care of relatively shortly. I am a 3rd year college student going into my second semester in a couple days.

I also need to be saving for an engagement ring, and rent when I transfer to a new school next year (it's part of the engineering program I'm in) because I here students there rarely have time to work if they want to maintain decent grades.

ada,Going all-in with Ada: a manifesto,"I'm a trained Architect (as in buildings), but have been interested in programming since I was a kid. I've been mostly focused in C and assembly on various different architectures, but have also been on the Java bandwagon. I have always been particularly interested in the actual architecture and design of large systems, such as OSs. 

I've spent a lot of time perusing various open-source code bases, specifically OS kernels (FreeBSD and Linux, mostly), and I have been pretty dismayed to find far too much raw egotism/intentional obscurity, frankly lazy hacks, and poor documentation. Delving into user-land libraries can be down-right terrifying. It's not a problem of ineptitude, it's a combination of over-confidence, and the weakness of mainstream languages to properly abstract systems, and contain side-effects. When I was younger, I use to think I just wasn't ""advanced enough"" to understand what I was looking at. After becoming experienced, what I really found was that poor practices, both in design and implementation, are endemic in mainstream software.

A few years ago, I discovered Ada mostly by accident, while casually appeasing the aviation nerd in me (the 777 is my bias). I found the idea of safety-critical software to be very interesting. I started to look more into Ada, and what I found took my breath away. As a systems architecture enthusiast, I had never seen a language that was so carefully structured and disciplined. As a modernist, I had never seen a language that could be so aesthetically pleasing. 

I devoured Barnes' ""Ada 2012"" book in just under a month, and nearly every page filled me with an ever deepening sense of amour. I never imagined a literal textbook could be a page-turner. I know this may sound embellished, but I'm dead serious.

About a year ago I started working with a medium-sized non-profit organization who needed help maintaining their core in-house software system, which was written in C#. It is outdated, monolithic, and chaotic. 

They later decided to go through a huge re-branding process, including the design of a brand-new website. The new website was to have vastly-expanded client service capabilities. They wanted me to take on the task of interfacing this new website with the internal client-care infrastructure. I had to build an API.

Well, they didn't give me much requirements except that it had to work. I took a gamble, and I decided to implement the entire thing in Ada. It was my first real-world, large project in Ada. 

The result was 99% Ada (Ada 2012-FSF GNAT-FreeBSD). I mean 99% as in I didn't use any external libraries. The only non-Ada components were some last-mile system-calls bindings written in C, to take advantage of the system headers. All JSON parsing/generation, HTTP, and TCP/IP was implemented in Ada.

What an incredible experience. Every step, end-to-end, I was consistently blown away by how elegantly Ada facilitated both architecture and implementation. How disciplined, principled, and consistent it is. And most importantly: how deeply expressive it is. Like in Architecture, abstraction is the tool for expression on the large. I have never found more enjoyment writing software than I did in Ada.

When I finally got the thing to compile (i.e. after Ada/GNAT dutifully exposed the depth of my human propensity for error), everything just worked. I have never experienced anything like it. It just worked exactly like it was supposed to. The entire system has been up for months now, and not a single bug has appeared. The performance and stability has been beyond anything I could have hoped for. 

The client has been quite satisfied, and has decided to let me re-build their entire in-house system. I've already pitched and been approved for doing it all in Ada.

I've since started a business that is committed to the exclusive use Ada/SPARK Ada in the development of critical enterprise software systems. I intent to be a champion for the wide-spread adoption of Ada, and I hope we can support the Ada community by helping to bring it more mainstream. 

TL;DR:

I am thoroughly convinced that Ada is exactly what the world needs now, and for the future. The mainstream software industry needs more discipline, more careful design, and less pettiness. We don't build buildings for the convenience of construction workers. I think it's a problem that we've allowed convenience to drive so much of programmer culture. We need something that fosters integrity, forethought, and care. We need to do a better job at building software, in general. I believe Ada is the best positioned language to facilitate the implementation of properly developed software, in general.

I see a lot of room for this out there. I see a silent majority of people who are fed-up with unreliable, unstable software. We need more people bringing Ada to the table. I hope to be one of many to join that cause.


P.S. I'm hiring; but I'm also a ""start-up"". If anyone is in Toronto and shares the same kind of passion for Ada, please PM me. Even if I'm too small for your caliber, maybe we can start something grass-roots anyways. Otherwise, It’s an honor and a pleasure to join this small but important community!

personalfinance,Can I claim the solar tax credit even if I am already expecting a refund?,"My wife and I purchased (via a loan) and installed a solar system at our primary residence in 2017.  Combined, we make around $140,000/year.  We were already expecting a refund from our 2017 taxes due to higher than needed withholding (that we have since corrected).  

My question is this: 

I know the solar tax credit is nonrefundable.  Can we claim the 30% solar tax credit for our 2017 taxes or are we precluded from doing so due to our withholding?  Our combined tax burden is in the neighborhood of $15,000-$20,000 in federal income taxes, which is much higher than the approximately $6,000 we are due from the credit.  Or, alternatively, will the credit reduce our income tax owed, thereby increasing our refund? 

Thank you for the help.  

EDIT:  To clarify, here is an illustration of my question 

$18,000 - taxes owed

$18,000 - taxes withheld from paychecks over the course of the year.

$6,000 - solar tax credit total value.

Is the solar tax credit value applied to the $18,000 owed, thereby making it so that I have overpaid my taxes by $6,000 and entitling me to a $6,000 refund?",finance

I have 13 classes left to finish my Bachelors in Business. I have a 10 month old daughter and this last semester I took two classes while working 30ish hours a week at 13/hr. 

While looking at my report it hit me hard that at my current pace it’d take me 4 years to graduate school. 

I was looking at jobs in my area and they generally pay around 45k starting wage for someone with a bachelors and strong customer service background. I’m currently working as a Pharmacy technician just sort of getting by and working to pay for my car and a cc I have. 

Would it be so bad to quit my job and take out approximately 15k in loans for one year so I could slam it and graduate sooner? The loans would be to pay for daycare and my car. My SO pays rent and other expenses. He’s currently paying for 2 days of daycare as well. I’d be borrowing some in loans to pay for the other 3 days so I could attend school. I currently have 7k in loans so I’d be graduating with about 20 total. All the loans are federal so 4.55% and deferred until I graduate. 

Would it be so bad to just finish? I’m struggling with the idea of student loan debt but is 20k a lot to graduate with? I was contemplating potential loss of wages and the 3 years of “lost” experience if I continued as I am right now.

I wouldn't live in the property since I'm renting and working out of town.  I want to buy it for somewhere to live later in life, and I'd likely rent it until then.",finance
investing,Questions: about timing and diversification,"Hi,

I am beginner, and at the end of last year I opened account at Degiro and start buying ETFs. Currently I bought only this: iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF (ISIN IE00B4L5Y983) and I plan to buy also Amundi ETF MSCI Emerging Markets UCITS ETF EUR (ISIN FR0010959676). 

Question about diversification:
If I invest each month 1000€ is this good to diversify do like this?
1) 550€ - iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF
2) 200€ - Amundi ETF MSCI Emerging Markets
3) 100€ - Crypto currencies
4) 100€ - one old deposit bank account with 2,5% interest rate per year (better then governament bonds). Nowdays, it is impossible to have this interest in banks.
5) 50€ - Gold/Silver

Question about timing:
When you are buying ETFs or Bitcoins with the money you transfer every month (i.e. the same amount every month), do you care about the current ETF value (BTC value) or you just buy (i.e. at the same day of each month)? You can get lucky or not, but in general do you care about this timing, or you just do diversification when you transfer the money? If it value was rising all day in last week do you still buy?",finance
personalfinance,$3000 medical bill that no one wants to charge us for?,"Last year my husband had to have surgery to remove a large kidney stone after a trip to the emergency room. He has Blue Cross Silver HMO in PA. We stupidly went to a tier 2 hospital  during the emergency and expected to be charged more...

But aside from a $500 urologist copay who performed the surgery we never got any bills, not even for the ER visit.

When he signs into his insurance online and looks in the claims.  it says his surgery is only partially covered and that there is $3000 under “owed” column. But there is no balance on his account.

He called both the insurance company and the hospital about this last summer after no bills arrived. Both say there is no balance they are owed. The insurance service rep just scoffed at us about why we would pursue this if no bill came.

I’m worried it’ll get sent to collections or that we’ll get hit with penalties. It’ll be a full year in February from the time of his surgery.

Is there a time limit on when the bill can be issued? 

And what do you think happened that we don’t owe the bill — a lucky error or hospital accepted a lower amount from insurance?",finance
personalfinance,Calculating the net benefit of immediate vs. long term charitable donations and financial independence.,"Hello, I'm trying to come up with a formula for figuring out how much money to invest vs. pay off debts vs. donate to charity. I don't want to have to reinvent the wheel, but this is a special situation. Here are the parameters:

Dual-income (married) household, current income is $400k) in the United States

All student loans paid off, currently renting, but wanting to invest in a condo or home in the near future (SF Bay Area), no other debt/liability

Very strong ethics where the belief is that spending money on luxuries (anything beyond housing, food cooked at home, and medical costs) is directly negatively impacting others and that money could be used in charity to save lives - only spending $500 per person per month on luxuries.

The goal of this formula is to calculate how to maximize charitable donations over time, and secondarily to determine when financial independence could be reached allowing early retirement.

So, how much to save immediately for a downpayment on a home, does it make sense to buy as soon as possible or to save longer, does it make sense to donate everything above a certain tax bracket to charity immediately, or should that money be invested and have the investment compound, then donate at a later date?

The goal is to help as many people as possible with the money, rather than spend it on personal things, and somewhere fit in retiring early as that would be a huge net benefit to personal happiness (as opposed to more dinners, or a nice car, and so on).

I'd like to be able to plug into a spreadsheet current incomes, tax brackets, cost of a home, current interest rates, current performance of securities and other investments, and come up with a few numbers as to when to donate and how much in order to maximize donations over time (and be able to update the spreadsheet as incomes change, tax rates change, etc.). Any advice on how to proceed with this would be appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,How much very low-interest debt should I take on?,"I have a relative who is very fiscally conservative, and firmly believes the market is going to come tumbling down at any moment. He has about $500,000 in a savings account because it's ""safe"" from the impending crash. (In case you're worried about him, he also has ample other investments that are more than sufficient for his retirement, but those aren't relevant right now.)

He's willing to loan me some or all of that $500,000 at 2% APR, paid over whatever term I like, because he sees it as a win-win -- he gets a better return than in his savings account, and I get to use the money for something productive.

The question is: how much debt should I take on?

Considerations:
1) Obviously, I should pay off any debt that's at a higher interest rate using this loan. I don't have any of this.

2) I'm going to repay the money. If I used the money to start a company that then failed, I'd still repay the loan. He's family.

3) My salary is large enough that I could afford the monthly payments on the whole sum, as long as it was spread out over a 20-30 year timeframe.

What would you do? On the one hand, debt is rarely encouraged around here. On the other hand, a 2% loan when the market returns have averaged 7% seems like a lucrative opportunity.",finance

personalfinance,Young pharmacist with student loans. Better to pay off loans fast or invest?,"Hi PF, this is my first post and I only briefly skimmed the FAQs page but didn't notice anything similar to my question.  
I remember hearing people in pharmacy school talk about how they thought it better to invest instead of paying off their loans.  At the time I thought they were insane (Why would you want to live with debt any longer than necessary??)  But now that I've been browsing this and the FI subreddits, it seems like there is some logic to investing rather than paying down debt.  
So my question is: If I want to maximize savings and my retirement fund and put myself on the path to retiring early, should I spend as much discretionary income as possible on paying down my debt?  Or should I only pay the monthly minimum and spend the rest on investing?  Or is there some combination of the two such as making one big investment now and then focusing on the debt?  
Thanks in advance  
    
Relevant financial info: I have ~150k USD in debt to the government with most of the loans at ~6.25% interest rates.  My current after-tax income is ~70K USD per year.  Monthly expenses are a little under 1k USD (including rent).  I'm not sure how much I'm contributing to my 401(k) but I plan to maximize that once I've figured out what I'm doing about debt/investing.  I live with my girlfriend (who is also a pharmacist) and we have no plans for children in the near future, and we split everything as 50/50 as possible.

CryptoCurrency,Are we gonna talk about that r/all post?,"The ignorance of the masses really drives me crazy. Yet every single time a bitcoin/crypto post makes it to the front page, I cant stop myself from looking at the comments.

There are so many ""its a pyramid scheme,"" ""its a scam,"" &amp; ""im so much smarter than you"" posts, its unreal. I can understand if cryptocurrency isnt your thing, but to call a growing economy of 800 billion dollars a scam and a pyramid scheme just doesnt make sense.

That post about the gdax wire transfer being locked to a name mismatch has brought out so many people who think so poorly of decentralization and cryptocurrency in general that I seriously question their intelligence. Everybody knows not to invest more than you can afford to lose, yet they take every chance they get to hop on reddit to say ""HA YOU LOST MONEY ON THAT BITCASH SCAM HAHAHA IDIOT."" 

Just look at the comments, and the upvote/downvote ratio. Its sickening. How can so many people have so much hatred for crypto, and what we spend our money on? Blind hatred as well, as its evident they have zero knowledge of what this space is, the functionality of it, or the marketplace-stock aspect of it. They act like we all think this is a get-rich-quick scheme, just because the last few months has been a ""cant-lose bull run."" There were plenty of us here in the bear market. &amp;when it rears its head again, the lambo types will cash out and we will still be here. This is nothing we havent seen before.

They can be the ones left behind. The can let their banks gamble on defaulted loans with their money in an inflationary currency. They cant avoid the inevitable integration of the technology we are bringing them. &amp;when the time comes, the same ones commenting how bitcoin is pyramid scheme and gdax &amp; gemini are scammers who are going to disappear with our money will be the ones asking if anyone can sell them some crypto for these worthless pieces of paper from the federal reserve.

Okay maybe not that extreme but damn im aggravated. Idk the point of this post really. I guess I just wanted to say that with the recent media exposure of crypto, and the recent influx of users... that when push comes to shove, even the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash communities need to stand together as one, as we are all under the umbrella of Cryptocurrency and the revolutionary technology that lies in the belly of it all.

CryptoCurrency,Discussion: Loopx - a scam ICO?,"Hi r/cryptocurrency! Throwaway account. This post is about an emerging cryptocurrency/ICO called Loopx. For some more info, here's [a whitepaper](https://www.loopx.io/media/loopx_whitepaper.pdf?v=20171225) they put out to describe their offering. Here's their [FB page](https://www.facebook.com/LoopX-Coin-2021730828111348/). I'm no expert in crypto, so I'm posting here for the first time (even on my main account). Cheers.

SO. My friend is getting into the crypto game and has done fairly well for himself over the last month. He has little/no experience with economic analysis but enjoys trading for the fun of it. Yesterday he told me about his interest in a new currency, Loopx. I've never dipped my toe into the crypto market, so I decided to have him talk me through it over the phone. I wanted to know what made him interested in this particular currency. What made him confident about its likely performance? To these questions he had no answers, so I decided to do some digging. 

As it turns out, Loopx is not merely a coin but also *the promise of* a trading algorithm that the founders will use to make high-velocity crypto trades. The team (more on the team in a bit) has been slow dripping a base of 10mil coins out over a multi-stage coin offering. With each new release, the cost has increased by $0.10 USD from an initial cost of $0.70 to a 5th-round ICO cost of $1.30. They say that they're releasing 8.2mil coins during the pre-ICO/ICO at these different cost increments. Their total projected value (# of coins released * cost per coin at each phase of release) is $6,940,000 ([page 15](https://www.loopx.io/media/loopx_whitepaper.pdf?v=20171225)).

So, to the best of my understanding, Loopx is functioning like a bond or any other form of financial instrument: give us your $, we'll use it to make propitious trades, then we'll reward you with  interest derived from the trades we make with your capital (represented, of course, in some quantity of loopx coins). 

Going from their website and their social media blasts, it would seem as if their initial offerings were virally successful. After digging around, a few red flags came up for me.  

#Red flags?
1. **Lack of transparency vis-a-vis trading algorithm**: I looked around pretty intensely and couldn't find anything, I'm talking nada, regarding the infrastructure behind the trading algorithm. In their white paper they say
&gt;A more technical description of core architecture and APIs will follow after the ICO funding phase (p 4)

 AFTER the ICO?? Wha? They don't even seem to be bothering to sketch out the fundamentals of their code. Hmm. 


1. **Lack of transparency vis-a-vis development team**: Again, no information on their site or any other location on the web about who, exactly, is behind the project. 

1. **Claims of demand relative to digital presence**: On [their facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LoopX-Coin-2021730828111348/), they claim that the initial pre-ICO offerings were snatched up within ""4 minutes"" of offering... Similar claims for further rounds. Despite this, their digital presence (both in terms of follower counts and just general digital matter sprinkled around the web) is very slight. I know this seems somewhat petty to point out, but their Facebook only has 700 likes, their twitter 1.3k followers... With very low engagement rates across both accounts and, at least on their Facebook, very visible complaints re payment. To me, that type of digital footprint doesn't account for the sale of ~$7mil coin. Or does it? I have no idea. Just seemed a bit off.

1. **Promise of consistent profits and interest:** This one is really scummy, irrespective of their fundamentals. From their white paper: 
&gt; Everyone who is willing to invest now in the immensely growing market of crypocurrencies will be likely very successfull, because the projection of the overall market cap are in the trillions. So more than 10 times more than the market cap at the moment.

 Another example of this expectation inflation. They say their service is for investors who are
&gt; Always looking for those opportunities to make profits bigger than 10%, which will be payed out to our members on a weekly basis (p 6, white paper)

 
 In addition, though they claim to have tested their ""algorithm thoroughly over half a year with great profits continuously every month"" ([link: about us section](https://www.loopx.io/)), they offer, as far as I can tell, no proof of this whatsoever. 


So I guess in summary: Having yet to reveal any concrete information about the miraculous algorithm that will allow them to master crypto trading, with very little transparency regarding their dev team, and with a relatively tiny digital footprint, they've allegedly sold ~8.2 mil coins valued at ~$7mil USD. My question is, does this math make sense?

Speculating that their model might be fraudulent might be a bit extreme, but it nevertheless blows my mind that they've been able to raise such a tremendous amount of capital with so little proof of... anything: of software, of talent, of community, etc., etc. At the very least, this ICO appears to be a cleverly disguised financial fund, rather than a pure currency. Currency is transformed into Loopx credit &amp; is then used to trade other cryptos on the margin... It may be a currency, but it's also seed capital for an investment fund. 

Would love to hear any thoughts on this!

##Edit: Some more on their operating practice and capitalization strategy, drawn from their white page (pages 15-16):

&gt;Our LoopX Trading Software facilitates more than 10.000
transactions per second in high yield exchange coins with
major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum on exchange
platforms. Applying this to LPX, you can get up to 48% return within 30
days by lending LPX to LoopX. You can invest in in LoopX to
receive weekly interests. The interest per month ist up to 48%
of your lending amount. The more you will invest in the lending
platform, the better interest rate you will get.

 On the following page, they describe the ""balance bonus"" feature: 
&gt;You can simply stake your LoopX Coins in your wallet to earn
new coins.
How does this work? In the blockchain there exists something
called Proof of Stake (PoS). That means, if you just leave your
coins in the wallet for a certain period of time you get rewarded
with new coins. Because you leave them with us, we from
LoopX are now able to use them as leaverage on high speed
trades. There is never just one trade going one, but always
multiple hundreds of them. That guaranties you that you will
never loose your PoS Coins in your wallet. This is a great way
of making passive income. By keeping a specific amount of
tokens in your wallet, you provide security and stability to our
system.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Temp job ideas for a stay at home mom to make money?,"I have been applying for full time jobs that utilize my degree (computer science) but I haven't had any luck yet and the study curve is killing me (many hours of studying and still not passing those damn technical interviews). Honestly maybe its  just not for me. I am looking for other ideas to make cash in the meantime (still applying and working on full time employment also). It's a lot to handle with a little one. I know some moms are really good and juggling everything but I am not one of those people. I don't know how people handle 2-3 toddlers and still get shit done.

My toddler is at that annoying age of one and never naps so I have like 1-2 hours at night after she goes to bed that I can do anything without watching her. She is not old enough to go unsupervised for long time periods (even in ""child-proofed"" rooms). She climbs everything and loves heights. AKA she is constantly trying to kill herself. 

So I turn to this sub looking for money making ideas and find many great suggestions. Inspiring, even. But sadly they don't really work for my situation as I can't really take my kid with me to donate plasma and I don't have a vehicle.

I do have a shitty laptop and maybe 1-2 hours at night. I know programming but not gonna lie, I really suck and i've been out of practice. I have been trying to sell stuff online but that's not been lucrative so far. I have been repairing friends phones and laptops but because they are friends I really don't make much money from this.

financialindependence,What assumptions do you make?,"*""Nobody Knows Nothing""* - Jack Bogle

&amp;nbsp;

In our pursuits of FIRE and personal financial planning, we are required to make many assumptions in order for us to create our models and strategies.  Of course, it is difficult business making even broad assumptions about the future.  

&amp;nbsp;

Many variables will have profound effects on our wealth generating ability, including: asset returns, health care, real estate, social security, wages, taxes, childcare/college costs, AI/computer learning, longevity, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

It it imperative to be highly fluid with your assumptions, to be able and willing to make adjustments no matter what comes your way.  When you are crunching numbers, it is often suggested to test out many different scenarios and adjust variables to determine the robustness of your planning.

&amp;nbsp;

With all that out of the way, I will start with some basic assumptions that I use in my personal plans and modeling.  I have arrived at these figures by sourcing and averaging predictions from ""experts"", trend following and my own personal bias/theories. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Asset Returns (Real, long term):**

US Stock Market: 5%

US Small Cap Value: 6%

Total International: 5%

Emerging Markets: 7%

Total US Bond: 1.5%

Intermediate Treasuries: 1%

High Yeild Corporates: 3%

Cash: -2%

Real estate: 0%

Gold: 0%

&amp;nbsp;

**Taxes:**

Far too complicated to realistically guess, I project current tax law (federal, state, FICA, investment, SS, sales, etc) into the future, knowing that it will most likely change.

&amp;nbsp;

**Social Security:**

75% of current projected benefit.  I have ran scenarios at 0% and 100% of current benefit as well.  I know there is a lot of fear-mongering surrounding this subject, but the data shows solvency until 2035, at which point a shift to a 75% benefit will prolong solvency far into the future.  That is without any changes to retirement age or increased taxes.

&amp;nbsp;

**Health Care:**

Like taxes, this is way too variable, so I use current MarketPlace and Medicare pricing to model.  Hopefully it will not be the case, but I find it prudent to also test scenarios where health care is 2-3 more expensive in real terms than what is available currently.  This has huge negative impacts on discretionary spending.  The possibility of single-payer greatly impacts these assumptions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Childcare/College:**

For childcare, I use current prices, inflation adjusted.  For college, I believe that in the 20 years higher education will look a lot different.  In my opinion, the tuition increases seen over the last three decades are completely unsustainable.  Utilization of more online courses, satellite campuses, improved for-profit options, accredited certificates, etc have a chance to make college comparatively more affordable than it is now.  With that said, I usually use the current price of a 4 year, in-state tuition for 529 planning.

&amp;nbsp;

**AI/Computer Learning:**

I believe that AI and automation is going to have massive effects over many different industries, but perhaps the widespread adoption will be slower than what many experts predict.  A lot of careers/jobs will be in danger of partial or complete replacement (this is actually one of my driving factors for FIRE, I believe my line of work will be among those to go).

&amp;nbsp;

**Longevity/Life Expectancy:**

It's important to realize that life expectancy may be higher (potentially much higher) in the future, with advancements in medicine and aging research.  This is especially true if you are relatively wealthy and will be able to afford cutting edge treatments.  Keep in mind that life expectancy is generally illustrated as a median or mean, implying that close to 50% will live longer by some degree.  I use 95 for my own planning, but perhaps that may not be conservative enough.

&amp;nbsp;

**I am curious to hear what figures and assumptions you all use when planning for your future?**

&amp;nbsp;

*Keep in mind that these are medians, I have done testing with higher and lower values of pretty much all of these figures*",finance
personalfinance,Roth IRA Question - Lump Sum or gradually?,"Trying to keep this as short as possible, i'm almost debt free (under $5000 in debt which is easy to clear by the end of the year) and I have a fully funded emergency fund of $1000 liquid cash + 6 months expenses which are in savings at 1.3% interest rate. Going forward though I have tax return and bonus coming up and Money Markets aren't really doing any better annually than my savings account could earn, so I'm looking at setting up a Roth IRA since I have room to bump up retirement contributions anyway. Question is, given that I'm going to be getting a sizeable amount of cash up front from tax return and bonus, is it better to max out roth IRA in one lump sum, or should I just get in the habit of gradually adding to it?",finance

personalfinance,"Will have 50K students loans at end of 2018, household income of $160K -- OK to wait to pay it off and buy a house?","Hi! It's my first ever reddit post, so that's neat!

I'm in graduate school at night and also work full time, making $80K. My partner also makes $80K and we have shared finances, for a total household income of $160K. Right now I have $42K in student loan debt (all from graduate school - I finished paying off my undergrad loans last year) and plan to take out another $8K ish, for a total of $50K in loans. All of them are unsubsidized federal loans, with interest rates of 5.8%, except $6000 I took out this year, which has an interest rate of 6%.

Other than that, I have a TSP with 32K in it (I'm 30) that I contribute 10% of my paycheck to (and get a 5% match), a tiny ROTH IRA with $1K in it, and an 8K safety net. 

My partner has no savings, but also no debt, and has just started to contribute to a retirement fund through his work. Our net worth as a couple evens out to like $3K (pathetic) and we have good credit scores.

We are thinking about buying a house. We can save $2K per month (together, not individually) in addition to the amount we're putting toward retirement, so we could buy a modest house in our area (which would be a good investment) in a year or so. Right now my student loans are still in grace period, but they are accruing interest. 

Is it nuts to buy a house when I have this much student loan debt, or is it a good idea? I know 5.8% is high interest, and I read the PF wiki that said it should be treated as a debt to pay off straight away, and we could theoretically put the 2K per month we can save toward the principal (before I'm even required to start paying), or toward taking out fewer loans for next semester. I'm just wondering if the ability to buy a house might complicate that. Honestly, I'd love a house, so I'm hoping there's a way it would make sense. If we put the 2K/month toward the loans, I guess we could be done in 1.75 years and buy a house then, though. 

If you have any other comments/ advice beyond the house vs. student loan dilemma, I'd love to hear it. I'm just getting started in PF, didn't even know what an IRA was until a couple of years ago, and never made more than 20K a year until recently, so I'm just learning how to manage money. 

I tried to follow the instructions -- hope I did!

personalfinance,Debt consolidation or take my lumps?,"So, last year, we purchased a new home.  We moved out of metro DC to a rural area mainly to get out of the city, and to lessen our expenditures.  Daycare, alone, in DC is ridiculous, and we were expecting a second kid.

Using the equity from the sale of our townhome, we almost paid off all of our debts.  Yay, good for us!  Unfortunately, we didn't change our habits, and within one year, we are back to where we started.

Full disclosure, we spent a good amount of money repairing things on the house.  New carpetting, painting, windows, emergency plumber job, an unexpected pet illness...but we also own that we were living like kings without the finances to back it up.

So, long story short, we're back to where we started, with our debts racking up, and needing a plan.

We've sat down and started working out a plan for expenditures, and to cut this habit of not keeping track of where our money is going to.  I'm moving to a job in 2 weeks that doesn't require me to spend $100/week on fuel.  No more take out every day for work lunches.  Little things everywhere that we can stop doing to treat ourselves every day of our lives.

Now it's a matter of tackling our debts, and getting the payments under control.

I've been looking into a debt consolidation loan with Lightstream, and debating whether or not it's worth the effort.  I'm currently at around $20K in debt, with monthly payments of $544.  Interest rates range from 18%-26%(itemized below).


* Chase - $4013 balance - 23.24% - $115/mo
* Credit One - $1605 balance - 24.9% - $85/mo
* Bank LOC - $9382 balance - 18% - $167/mo
* Paypal - $1743 balance - 19.99% - $52/mo
* Lowe's - $3898 balance - 26.99% - $125/mo


* Mortgage - $1000/mo
* Car payment - $450/mo
* Internet - $100/mo
* Cell phone - $95/mo
* Daycare $200/week


The other thing that's hanging over my head is I have school loans that I've been deferring begin payments in November.  My plan is to consolidate those into a new loan when the time comes, to get out from under Navient.

My gut feeling is to just take my lumps, and continue paying down where I can.  Obviously, along with multiple lifestyle changes to reign in spending.  But, I was hoping this sub may be able to offer some guidance as to whether or not debt consolidation is the right move or not.  Thanks!",finance

I am trying to figure out if I should re-finance my car or not.

I purchased a used 2011 Toyota Corolla S - I am 4 years into a 6 year term.

I can see why people wouldn't want fiat because it hardly makes any money right now versus crypto . I think the best use might for example to buy a place to live cash or pay off your mortgage   .

Interest rates are very low now obviously but it would be more peace of mind .

ethereum,"Etherions updates: cheaper whelps, feeding &amp; battle systems &amp; more","People have been asking for updates and more information about the game with PMs so instead of replying to them all individually, here we go, more information about our belowed Etherions game:  

&amp;nbsp;  

**Short overview for newcomers**  
Etherions is a 3D dapp, a game where you interact with digital Dragons, called Etherions. You can hatch them, feed them, trade them, battle with them for now. They start as hatchlings and can potentially evolve/grow to powerful creatures. With each passing day their powers grow, including health points and ability strength, which you can track. In your nursery they play with their siblings and discover their abilities. It is basically a collectibles game where you can buy cute hatchlings stored on the Ethereum blockchain.  

&amp;nbsp;  

Dev of the game, */u/Convergence-* got offers for help from several people. I got chosen to help him out in the process of bringing the game closer to you, the gamers. He will focus on making the game work, I will focus on getting it to the community. So for any questions feel free to PM me, */u/TomiSharked*. You can also visit the the *[website](https://www.etherions.com)*, our *[Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Etherions/)* or *[Discord](https://discord.gg/75paXTy)*.  

&amp;nbsp;  

**Cheaper Dragons**  
We heard you! Happy to announce there are now 2 cheaper options to get started: Red and Yellow Etherion whelps, priced at 0.01 and 0.025 ETH. The difference is that these 2 smaller Dragons have their age-cap set at 60 days at which point they will be larger whelps, while the original dragons can grow up to 1 year in size, at which time those should be some *[big-ass dragons](https://www.etherions.com/images/mature.jpg)*.  

&amp;nbsp;  

Some more info about the games systems:  

&amp;nbsp;  

**The Feeding sytem**  
The intial plan is for feedings to be stored on the blockchain for bigger Dragons only. That means while the whelps only need to be fed small animals (such as rats or chickens) without any tx fee and just for fun, once the Dragons get up to the size of eating say whole cows, those feedings could potentially be stored on the blockchain. Say 150+ days after birth.  

&amp;nbsp;  

**The Battle system**  
Once your whelps reach a certain age and strength, they may be able to do battle with other Dragons. Older Dragons are bigger and more powerful (making them more valuable). Rarer etherions have slightly better or more unique fighting abilities. Since this system is still under development we like to ask the community if they prefer a turn-based battle system or go for the more realistic realtime battle system, the latter of which will be more centralized and takes longer to develop (especially by one guy).  

&amp;nbsp;  

**Modular Contracts**  
One of the features of smart contracts is, is that they can't be changed anymore after deployment. This has advantages and disadvantages. One disadvantage is, that if you find bugs, (the eternal bane of developers), or want to add new features to the dapp, that is essentially impossible. You can always deploy a new contract at a new address with the changes, but if your dapp stores data like kitties, dragons or houses, then migrating that data is a PITA that costs a lot of gas and transactions (afaik). A solution that we used would be to use modular contracts: one contract only stores data and does nothing more, then another contract handles the logic and things subject to change, such as features. And you can upgrade those 'helper-contracts' without touching the stored data.  

&amp;nbsp;  

Long term plans include the aforementioned Feeding and Fighting systems along with trading but could be more depending on the community. We will follow what will be most popular, so any suggestions are welcome - we will pick what's best for the game and players.  

&amp;nbsp;  

At this moment you could see the game as a ""hold-game-asset-for-profit type"" but this is just the beginning. With adding of different gameplay elements we will enhance the value of your Dragons and the gameplay aspect itself.

personalfinance,College student- put money into Roth IRA or save to pay off loans after graduation?,"Hello,

I have been lurking this sub for a long time and feel I have a basic understanding of what I should be doing with my money. I am a 22 year old college student approaching my last semester of school and need advice on what to do with my earnings this upcoming semester.

Here is a breakdown of my current situation:

- 2,987 in checking account
-1,000 in savings account
- Part time internship making 18/h working 18 hours a week, bring home about 530 every two weeks after taxes
- Only real expenses are groceries and gas which total out to about 100 every two weeks.
- Student loans are about 60k in a mix of private and federal loans.
- Plan on living at home for at least a year after college to pay back as much as my loans as possible
-Full time offer at my internship for 55k/year once I graduate

I was wondering if it would be wise to start a Roth IRA and put money in every month this semester or to save up to pay my loans off for after I graduate. Thank you.",finance
gaming,Have you ever been bashed as a traitor for not using the faction representing your nationalist (or other major tribal identity such as religious groups) in a video game? Especially if you choose traditionally opposing faction for gameplay purposes?,"Years ago I was playing Rise of Nation and I typically used the Turks because of their gunpowder technology which really made them incredibly destructie in long range fighting during the Medieval Ages.

When I decided to discuss the game at school, some people (who never even heard of Rise of Nations) began to bash me as an Islam lover and anti-American. I was so fucking pissed because not only did my selection of The Turks have nothing to do with being pro-Turkish but also because the Americans were my second favorite faction in the game.

In a similar note, when Call of Duty 4 was still big a few grudges even started against me on the internet because I preferred to use some of the Russian classes instead of the Allied. People thought I was pro-communist (which really hurt me because I was so pro-capitalist).  I even switched to a specific French class and still people were bashing me for not being ""pro-American""  even though my selection was primarily based on gameplay mechanics (especially weapons the class had).

I am curious have any of you ever experienced this?? 

EDITED

I even used the Americans in Empire Total War because they're quite well balanced compared to other factions. And guess what some Southern guy started calling me anti-Confederate because I prefer using the ""Yankees"". Uhhh this game takes place in an era before the Confederacy ever existed! Even choosing your own faction can get you bashed simply because you don't choose a specific microdivision (the game may not even allow choosing say Frederick Barbarossa's army and only allows you to choose the Templars or the Hospitalers).",technology
personalfinance,Roll over credit card debt into a 3rd balance transfer or deal with the interest?,"I'm coming up on the end of the 0% promotional period of my second balance transfer. Currently the balance resides on my Chase Slate card with a total $1,875 remaining. The promotional period ends on February 26th so I'll be able to make 2 more 0% interest payments before the normal 14.24% hits.

I recently paid off a home improvement loan which freed up roughly $300-400 extra a month. Which means that in 6 months that balance should be gone off the card. I used that extra money for Christmas in December but now that that's done I can refocus it back towards the Slate card.

Now this is where I'm waffling on what to do and where my questions arise. 

When the promotional period ends, from what I understand that 14% interest rate will be applied only to the remaining balance and not the initial balance transfer amount. Is that correct? 

I currently do all my banking through Chase; Checking, Savings, Chase Freedom (empty), Chase Amazon (empty) and the Chase Slate. Having the balance on my Slate card is convenient as all of my debt as well as income is situated in one place. This isn't a deal breaker but it is a really nice benefit to not have to remember yet another user name/password and have yet another credit card sitting around.

The other thing holding me up from doing a balance transfer is that all of my credit is frozen through the big three. I'm assuming that to open a new card I'll have to unfreeze them, get approved, and then freeze them again. Am I wrong on that? There was a fee when I originally did it but I'm not sure if I get charged again to refreeze. I'll also be charged a 3% fee doing the balance transfer itself

I have every intention of paying off that remaining balance by June because of my tax return and having the above $300-400 spare income. I'm just trying to get a feel for if it's worth going through the cycle of a third balance transfer when the total balance will be gone in a few months. Would someone smarter than me be able to do the cost savings I'd achieve if I went ahead with the transfer? 

It's a petty thing to be sure, and the logical thing is to do the transfer as it will result in less extra money being paid, but I don't know if it's enough of a loss in $ to outweigh the headache of unfreezing/refreezing my credit, opening a new card and such.

Any input from you fine folks? This subreddit has helped me a ton over the last 3 years and this is the final hurdle to being debt free so I want to make the right decision.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on lowering credit card interest rates?,"A little background: I have a credit card with a 4k limit and about 3.5k in dept accumulated. I kept it well below the limit for quite a while but some hard times came up and I racked up a few high end charges. Things were fine with my monthly minimum payments being ~$80/month. Suddenly the min payment started climbing, from $100 straight to almost $200. 

Called credit card company and told them I can't make those payments in my financial situation. They put me on a payment plan where I have lower payments but can't use the card for 6 months. At the end my interest rate will be 18%, at the cost of my credit score. 

Before this my strategy was always pay on due date, a bit more than required min payment.

Ripple continues to provide excellent growth thru its ability to attract banks, payment providers and others to utilize all of its products including xrp . XRP will soon be offered at coinsquare a much larger exchange than coinbase as well as a Japanese exchange that is apparently much larger than coinsquare !

Ripple worked with western union back when ripple xrp was known as ripple labs and I would not be surprised to see a partnership develop there fairly soon. I also believe coinbase would have already added xrp to it's trading platform had the news not been leaked, it's regrettable but coinbase has to maintain their reputation and can not be seen as conducting business with allegations of insider trading. As such coinbase has no option but wait some period of time before they add xrp or any additional coins.

Ripple will continue to be misrepresented, dismissed and slammed by the hardcore faithful bitcoiners and others who are totally anti bank and believe that central banks and the federal reserve will go quietly into the night. I believe this is foolish, the banksters will NEVER go quietly into the night. In fact they will use every dirty trick in there collective books to crush or at least control all crypto currency's .  With that said I have said repeatably that XRP is the anti bitcoin, there will be winners and loosers, there are tons of “shit” coins that will disappear, the coins however that provide a valid service and have a legit purpose will thrive.

personalfinance,Graduated but owe 11k still and need to access my transcripts (VA),"I recently (last month) graduated from a state school in Virginia with a degree that isn't going to take me further than entry level without supplementing with a masters. Just prior to my final semester, I was asked to turn in a whole stack of paperwork to the financial aid office for an audit of my aid. As a result, I had 11.5k worth of financial aid from the prior year rescinded. As this money had already been spent paying for school obviously, I was told that I had to pay out of pocket the full amount. The reason given was that my mother who claims me as a dependent got remarried in 2016, and their combined income made me retroactively ineligible. This wasn't reflected in the tax forms already filed because they were married months after her taxes were filed. I then attempted to get private student loans to cover the amount, as I already maxed out the little federal aid I was now eligible for my last semester. Unfortunately, I needed a creditworthy cosigner and neither of my parents match that criteria, and there isn't really another person wanting to cosign 11k to an unemployed (but searching!) recent college grad. Fortunately, Id already been registered and begun my last semester classes so I was able to finish out my last semester (in which I made Deans List) and walk in my graduation ceremony. Unfortunately with the stress of working to pay my other bills and my final semester of college I really neglected to be as proactive as I should have been on figuring out where to get this money. So now here we are. I am hopefully going to be returning to my previous service industry job soon while I search for something better to at least keep my bills paid. As mentioned before, I really need to get a graduate degree sooner rather than later as it would increase my earning potential dramatically on top of the fact that experience is very important in my field and I'd rather reach financial security before I'm 60. And to apply I need my final transcripts which I cant access until I pay this money. At this point, I'm not really sure what my options are and any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Need help with some monthly repayment calculations!,"Hi, I'm trying to figure out the proper way to calculate a monthly loan repayment, and the explanation for it.

Say I want to take a auto loan for $15,000.00 at an interest rate of 3% per year, with a repayment period of 5 years. This is paid monthly, so that makes a total of 60 payments.

Using some online calculators and using the excel PMT function (with input r = 0.03/12, number of periods =60, present value = 15000) gives me a monthly figure of $ 269.53. This means that my total payment is $ 269.53*60 = $ 16,167.82 .

What I don't understand about this figure is doesn't this mean that the effective interest rate that I'm paying is $ 16,167.82-$15,000/$15,000.00, approximately 7.81%; or about 1.56% per year only? Far less than the 3% per year figure.

Would it not make more sense if the monthly calculation is five years of interest atop of the principal, divided by the number of repayments? $ (15,000 * (1.035))/60; about $ 289.82.

This gives the total repayment about $17,389.11. About a 15.93% interest rate over 5 years, or about 3.18% per annum.

I'm not so sure which is the correct way to calculate, but most sources i've looked at points towards the first one. I can't seem to wrap my head around why it is; especially since the interest rate doesn't seem to match.

investing,So I Bonds don't actually protect your money from inflation,"Am I missing something?

It seems to me that for most people and situations, buying this bond specifically designed to protect you against inflation actually guarantees you will lose money to inflation in any year in which there is inflation, assuming the fixed rate portion is negligible (like 0.1%).

This is because you are always earning slightly more than the inflation rate, and then you are paying federal taxes on that interest earned, pretty much always guaranteeing you never actually match inflation.

This is extremely ironic to me. Am I missing something?",finance

personalfinance,Estimating potential AMT on ISO exercise (calculations included),"I am planning on exercising some stock options (ISO) in 2018 and selling them one year later. As such, this will be the first year I’ll be reporting “income” from other than normal salary on my tax filing. I understand there is a possibility of a tax liability from AMT and I’m planning to run this simulation in tax software and consult with a CPA or tax accountant shortly. I also understand I may need to provide more information than below but I wanted to consult with this community on whether my general understanding of my potential tax liability is correct or if I’m missing something. I will likely elect to take the standard deduction of $12,000 (using the proposed 2018 tax reform figures). The gain on the ISO spread is $15,000.

**Regular Tax:**

Projected gross salary: $155,000

Adjustments (401K Contribution): $18,000

Standard Deduction: $12,000

Taxable income (under regular tax methodology): $125,000

Federal tax paid: $24,890

Effective tax rate: 19.4%


**AMT:**

Projected gain on ISO spread: $15,000

Adjustments (401K Contribution): $18,000

btc,I have a confession...,"Until last week, I was among the masses whom supported bitcoin core over bitcoin cash. I had not read the white paper nor had I looked into what all the 'lightning network' would involve. I was simply regurgitating the rhetoric idea that the lightning network implementation is going to save bitcoin core. 

I have no background in cryptography and don't claim to be an expert, but I do have a degree in computer engineering (and have an 8-5 day job as a software developer). I feel like this helps me to, at least to some extent, follow along and develop a rough understanding for the two different scaling solutions (block size increase or lightning network). 

Last week, after reading the white paper for the first time... I found myself awestruck. This may sound tin foil hat like, but since discovering bitcoin I have always felt in a way that Satoshi Nakamoto creating bitcoin... feels almost like divine intervention. As if we have reached a tipping point in civilization where greed and centralized - government - manipulable  currency has made the world a very corrupt and unfair world to live in. After finishing reading the paper… my initial reaction was something like… “wtf… bitcoin cash *is* the real bitcoin / Satoshi’s vision…” Satoshi even brings up the block size scaling concern and refers to Moore’s Law to point out that gradually increasing the block size would not be a problem. 

Thinking to myself… “Wow, increasing the block size does seem like a very easy and reasonable scaling solution (Satoshi even accounted for this). So why is the Bitcoin Core community so persistent on not using this solution? Is lightning network really a better solution? What actually is lightning network?”

So I went and read everything I could about this lightning network solution… Hoping to find that my supporting of bitcoin core would be justified and that this lightning thing would be some other elegant solution that I could imagine working. Instead I found myself being extremely skeptical of it, and to me having off-chain transactions completely defeat the purpose of bitcoin. Completely defeats the purpose of wanting to transition to a decentralized currency, immune to 3rd party/ government fuckery. I had been fooled. 

I had gone along w/ the masses, supporting bitcoin core. Not actually understanding the valid claims that resulted in the community forking and creating bitcoin cash in the first place. I think part of it was that I had seen a few short clips of Roger Ver, where he seemed to be acting in irrational way(s). And him being referred to as one of the figure heads of the bitcoin cash community, it was just easy to believe the rhetoric that bitcoin cash was the ‘attackers’ and bitcoin core was the real bitcoin. 

I have finally awoken. I can now say that I without a doubt believe in Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin. 
It’s crazy to imagine that everyone here probably had experiences similar to this one. It takes time and due diligence to become enlightened and form a real opinion between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash. I feel like many on the Core side, have not actually took the time to draw their own conclusions. I definitely had not. I was a sheep. I feel like I should do everything I can to try to wake others up and help them discover the truth. I’m not sure how one could do this. I suppose creating YouTube videos could help. I hate to flame Roger but… maybe Bitcoin Cash would seem like more reasonable coin (and people would be more likely to look into it), if he acted more professional while being interviewed by media. And would be helpful if he (or someone else) would explain in a calm rational intelligent manner… Why the Bitcoin Cash community believes in this scaling solution in extensive detail. And why the bitcoin cash community doesn’t agree with the lightning network scaling solutions because reasons x, y and z. Maybe this would be more helpful in engaging listeners. Approach them with reason and logic. Not just constantly repeating that bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin and bitcoin core developers are the worst developing team on the planet. Even though I now understand the claim that bitcoin cash is ‘the real bitcoin’, since it seems to be in-line w/ Satoshi’s vision (white paper)… It didn’t resonate w/ me when I was on the bitcoin core side. It just sounded like an irrational – emotional statement to me. 

I’m not sure what to do from here. I have spent the last several months telling everyone I know how much I believed in Bitcoin (core)… To now discover that it is really Bitcoin Cash that aligns with my values. I’m not sure what to say to my friends and co workers. “Oh hey btw, goodluck w/ that bitcoin you bought on my recommendation. I actually don’t believe in it anymore. I believe in Bitcoin Cash now. I encourage you to read into both coins and invest in whichever one you believe in. “ ??? 
Have you all experienced this too? Any advice on this transition over to the bitcoin cash side? 
I’m happy to join the community and am excited about trying to find ways in which I can contribute to its success.

Cheers 

Edit: as several have pointed out to me, including @con-sci-ens 's post: ""Roger is just a rich guy who promotes bitcoin cash. and apparently it is easy to highlight just the negatives and do a character assassination using the subtle tools of censorship...""

personalfinance,Math Question - Understanding How Much I'll Save Paying Loan Off Faster,"My SO and I have a savings account for our toddler that we put $25 a week into and all birthday/holiday money for their future. It has gotten to over $4000. We have our own emergency fund (10k) but quite a bit of debt (student and car loans). I asked this community before if we could/should use some of our toddler's ""savings"" to pay down some of those high interest loans and pay the account back periodically and we got a resounding ""DO IT"" response.

So, I'm back with a supplemental question. Please go easy on me as we are really bad at math and new to personal finance. I Googled it and everything, but I bet someone on here could figure it in an instant.

We were going to use 2k of the toddler savings toward either loan A or B:

A (6.25%) student loan with a balance of 5,000 with a monthly payment of $70 (but we've been paying $250)

B (3.85%) automobile with a balance of 6,000 with a monthly payment of $215 (but we've been paying $800)

Basically, the 2k bulk payment would help us pay off either loan sooner. I know we should do the higher interest rate one financially, but we don't ""own"" either of our cars, and this would allow us to ""own"" a car instead of just paying off 1 of our 5 remaining student loans...I am not sure if there is a fiscal advantage to that besides a sigh of relief that we own a car outright.

Could someone show me how to calculate how much we would save by paying off early with bulk payments on each loan?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Stop talking about bubbles,"It’s an important topic but constantly bringing up bubbles, especially in the media psychologically convinces people their investment isn’t safe.

Yes of course, all markets crash in cycles.

I’m not god but I’m gonna guess we have at least a few years before the next big crash. 

Consider how much money people are making and how slow the process of converting your money into fiat is. You have a withdraw limit on coinbase and have to wait a week for the shit to process before you can withdraw more. 

I also personally would rather my money be stored in cryptos and see nice gains and have personal access to my wealth without having to put it into some stupid bank that gives me shit interest rates, and the feds keep inflating fiat as well. 

The amount of wealth that’s growing from this market is something we’ve never seen before. We’re in a global market with stupid amounts of money and we’re only at the tip of the iceberg, the amount of money in the market is only going to increase exponentially from here on out. 

Say the US economy crashes in the next two years like it’s speculated to do so, I personally imagine people would put their money into crypto to avoid the inflation and loss of value in their wealth. Crypto will be a safe haven for your money and even increase the value of your money. 


A crash will only happen if everyone’s psyching each other out and convincing one another it’ll crash.

personalfinance,Avalanche Method For Paying Off Student Loans,"I have approximately $49,000 (private) and $19,000 (federal) student loans from my undergraduate with a BS in Chemical Engineering.

Some background: I traveled and explored during my months post-graduation and later scrambled to find a job before my grace period ended for my loans. This resulted in accepting the first offer I received at approximately $52,000 pre-taxes and as a contractor (aka no benefits/hourly/9-month term). The job is at a highly reputable pharma company and I am learning a lot. I am currently reaching out to people within my professional network to relocate and find a much higher paying job after my 9-month contract ends.

My current question concerns how to pay off my student loans as I look for a higher paying job. My federal loans have an average of 4.05% and minimum monthly payments of $195 for a 10-year term. I am currently paying the minimum.

My private loans are as follows (current balance --- interest rate):
$12,372.97 --- 3.375%
$10,001.00 --- 9.125%
$8,601.55 --- 10.250%
$7,505.25 --- 9.750%
$6,453.66 --- 9.125%
$4,977.42 --- 9.125%

With such similar/high interest rates on most of these private loans, should I only focus all my extra money on the 10.250% interest loan? Or spread the extra money on the highest interest loan and highest current balance? I've been feeling stressed and anxious trying to determine the best course of action to pay off these loans.",finance

Off the top of my head, ECB, Japan, and SNB buy equities. 

The reason for this is supposedly to act as a diversification tool for central banks who are overexposed to government debt, but lets not get into politics or speculation. 

What I want to discuss is whether the stock market rise can be attributed to these central bank factors as much as (if not more than) the growth of global economies. Moreover, how long do you think this behavior will continue? Technically indefinitely as central banks can ""print"" money, but can they really keep doing this in a practical manner?

P.S For what it's worth, I think that the rise in global equities IS mostly due to central banks except for 2017, when economies actually were undergoing great growth and corporates were posting great earnings.",finance

personalfinance,Bought too expensive of a car. Unsure of what to do now.,"I'm 26. Make $60,000 pre-tax. A year ago I bought a brand new, fully loaded Mazda CX-5 for ~$30,000. At the time I told myself all the typical things to justify the purchase and thought it would be a good decision. Now, one year and 16,000 miles later, I really wish I hadn't. While the steep car payment doesn't completely cripple my budget, I know I can make better financial decisions and a 26 year old doesn't need a $30,000 car. I don't want a $427 car payment until I'm 30.

The loan is at 0% for 63 months, and I still owe $21,750. According to KBB, the car is worth ~$22,000. 

What should I do? Here are the two options I see:

**1) Suck it up, deal with the car payment, and drive the car until it dies.**

I love this car and definitely would drive it for 8-10 more years. But it's hard for me to justify paying $5,100 per year for the next 4 years. But it's a new car that should last a very long time and holding on to it for as long as possible may be one solution to a poor financial decision.

**2) Sell the car, buy a cheaper one, learn from my mistakes.**

According to KBB, I'd break even on the sale vs. remaining principal. I'd be looking a $7,500 loss (down payment + loan payments to date) but I consider all of this in the past and just want to focus on what I can do to make the most out of this situation. I don't have enough to make a cash purchase so I'm looking at another loan. No idea what used interest rates are now (~800 credit score) but I'd look to pay the car off within 24 months. I need an SUV for my lifestyle and I'm thinking about replacing the car with a 2006-2008 Toyota 4Runner in the $10,000 range. I had an older 4Runner before my CX-5 and have full confidence in Toyota reliability. 

In one example of this scenario, I put in $3,000 towards the new car, finance $7,000 for 24 months. Let's assume 4.5% My monthly payment is $306. I'd pay the car off much sooner and end up saving ~$8,500 between now and the date I'd pay off my current loan (after factoring in insurance cost for both vehicles). 

The hard part of this scenario is dealing with an older car not having the creature comforts I'm used to with the CX-5 (rear view camera, heated seats, radar cruise control, active safety features, etc.) but I'm not sure these things are worth $8,500 to me.

For what it's worth, here's a full picture of my financial situation.

personalfinance,Income-Based Repayment question - married filing jointly vs. separately,"My wife is currently enrolled in an income-based student loan repayment program (IBR).    She also has federal student loan forgiveness after 10 years of timely payments.  We currently file our taxes separately to keep her payments as low as possible.  However, for 2017 I had substantial capital gains via the sale of stocks.  If we were to file jointly, my tax liability would be reduced substantially due to the fact I'm affected by AMT when filing separately (but not if we were to file jointly).  If we file our taxes jointly in 2017 her student loan payments would rise, but our tax savings would offset it.  Next year if we filed separately, we won't be affected by AMT when filing.  My question - if my wife and I file jointly this year, (kicking her out of IBR) would she be able to switch back to an income based repayment program for 2019 when we switch back to filing separately, or would she be required to always file jointly going forward?

**Job** = mining fiat, you do some work and get rewarded with fiat coins


**Gold** = Bitcoin, highly stable store of value, many argue if it is the best but nothing has shown superiority to its store of value


**Dollars** = USD Tether, printed at will by a shadowy entity, no one really knows what’s backing it up but we accept it as valuable


**Renminbi, Euro, Pound, Yen, etc** = AltCoins, hey, don’t tell their backers they’re AltCoins because unlike those other shitcoins I mentioned theirs is totally for real a challenger to the current reserve currency while not actually being BTC, USD, or Gold.


**The Economy** = mining network, whoever’s is biggest is the most valuable because of network effects and resilience to attack


**Bank default** = exchange hack, so this entity was totally negligent and lost a bunch of people’s money because of it


**The Fed** = Tether (the company), so when banks really screw up The Fed can just print money to bail them out, when they realized this “Quantitative Easing” made shitloads of money they decided to just keep doing it and massively inflate asset prices.


**The military** = FUDsters and 51% attackers, whenever another country or currency threatens your dominance just launch an attack with your military


**Military Invasion** = Successful 51% attack, what’s better than shitting all over another coin...er...country?  Invading it, stealing its resources, and driving it’s economy into the ground!


**Constitution** = whitepaper, vague ideas strewn about on paper that are supposed to dictate how the thing is run, the details get filled in later


**Regime Change** = Hardfork, there was a flaw in the previous way of doing things so we decided to change them, sometimes peaceably (User Activated or SoftFork) and sometimes by force.


**Passport** = Polkadot and atomic swaps, you belong to a country but want to travel around to others


**Citizenship** = maximalism, everyone has a favorite coin, some people are overly hyped about their own


**Social Security Number/National ID** = Private Key, you need it for everything you do but don’t tell anyone what it is cause if it gets stolen you’re fucked


**The Holiday Season** = Pump and Dump, get people really excited about something so you can take their money and leave them with essentially worthless junk


**Marriage** = HODLing, sure things may get bad but you know in the long term sticking with it will pay off, daytraders rarely profit


**Child Birth** = ICO, so much potential for such an early stage of the project, you hope for 1000x gains but will probably just suffer for years only to see it reach mediocrity",cryptocurrency

My parents aren't very great with finances either.

Sorry in advance for the formatting, I'm on my mobile.

* The context: *
I'm 22 years old from Australia.
Mid last year my car blew up during my final university exams whilst I had just finished paying off a holiday to europe for after my exams and I was only working casual at the time (so I was essentially broke because all my savings was paying for this one off holiday inc spending money, which was pretty frugal, in hindsight I probably shouldn't have gone but it was my own reward for finishing my degree).
Because I needed a car, my parents (as my dad was also without a car at the time, so there was not a free car to borrow) purchased a semi-automatic 2011 Ford Focus Ambiente as an interim car for me so I could finish my exams, head to Europe without financial stress and have a reliable car when I came back. 
The agreement was that until I could finish uni, go to Europe and come home and find a full time job and pass the probation period, they would be in charge of the debt. After that, I would then get a loan from the bank to pay my parents back, and essentially buy the car back off of them - dad specifically stipulated that he wanted me to get a loan and pay the amount in a lump sum to him (not pay him back until I finished my probation period and get a loan for the rest which was what I wanted to do) and then I would just pay the bank back. Between paying for the car and borrowing a little extra money for travel, I owe my parents approximately $10,000. 

* Current financial status: *
I have since finished uni, travelled and secured a full time job and recently successfully passed the probation period and was offered a permanent full time role, which I accepted. Currently, after tax I earn approximately $34,600 a year. 

My living expenses are low and I need to work on my spendings (irrelevant but might help gauge advice) which I'm hoping to shape better as I pay off this loan as well.
I have about $500 savings. $900 that I need to pay back onto a credit card (which will be done over the next two weeks and then said credit card will be put in a dark draw, far away, so I monitor my spendings better and don't live beyond my means).

So, I need to buy the car off of them ASAP via a loan.
Once I do this (which they are aware of) I am looking to sell the car soon (which should pay off a large portion of the debt) and then purchase a much cheaper car to transport me to work as well as help me learn manual in to help tide me through until I can save up enough on my own, in my savings account, to buy a newer car outright in the future. If that makes any sense.

* Part I need advice on *
I'm looking to take out a loan for approximately $12000 ($10000 to pay my parents back, $2000 extra to pay for rego and insurance on cheap run around car that I will buy after I sell the newer car)
I'm looking into personal variable loans purely because I would like to pay the loan back ASAP, especially since I should have a large portion available when I sell the car.
Most banks and small credit unions that I've looked at are looking at $150-300 upfront cost, $10 a month loan service fee and interest rates from 13.9% onwards. The fees were the same for the fixed loans when I filled out all my details, but the interest rate was slightly lower.

The reason I am not interested in a fixed loan is because most banks/credit unions that I've looked at stipulate that you can pay back no more than approximately $1000 extra, beyond your standard repayments, per annum if you're on a fixed rate loan. And I really don't want to have the debt for that long if I don't need it.

I'm not sure if this will help, but apparently my credit score puts me in the top 20% of applicants???

If I'm totally honest, I don't really understand this whole ordeal, what's normal and what's not and do not want to jump into a loan that I am getting ripped off on.

Am I on the right course? Are there resources available to guide me a little better? Help?

Should I just apply for said loan with my bank at the rates mentioned? I really don't know....

The more I try to google it, the more confused I am getting. Any advice will help please.

TL;DR: casual job, uni student last year when my car blew up - parents bought interim super reliable car approx $10000 debt which was agreed I would pay back when I got a full time job. Got a full time job, need to pay back debt via a loan and have no one for advice.",finance

I'm looking to lower my monthly mortgage payment by refinancing. I purchased the property in June 2017 and the current interest rate is 4.875%.

personalfinance,"(CAN) Final semester, low gpa, ""useless"" degree, but not in debt and in need of advice","I'm in a bit of dilemma right now. Basically I goofed up in uni. I'm majoring in Human Geography at UBC and have an average of 72% (which is a 2.95, very close to a 3.0). I'm currently finishing up my final semester (I'm a 5th year student) and have already made plans to graduate in May. 

I know what people are going to be asking me with regards to my major: ""why did you major in an arts subject if you wanted to get a job?"" To be fairly honest with you, I actually originally wanted to pursue a useful major. I started out with History and after finding out the job prospects in the field I decided I wanted to obtain something that would make it easier to find employment, particularly business, economics and computer science. However I wasn't too prepared for university in my freshman and sophomore years and because of my gpa, I was rejected from those majors I listed. I stuck with geography in the end because of GIS but I failed to secure a relevant internship in the field. In my junior and senior years my gpa improved massively but unfortunately I took an accounting course that dropped it way below the 3.0 threshold (completely my fault). My reason for graduating so late was because I switched majors halfway through and had to take the required courses (plus in my fourth year I was dealing with grief after my father passed away as well as working a part time job which led to me taking only a few courses). 

So now that my background has been laid out, what sort of advice would you give me regarding graduation? Should I just graduate and then find a job? Or is it worth continuing to take courses over the summers and raising my gpa up to a 3.0?

Honestly right now I just want a job that pays the bills (though my preference is in marketing/event planning positions which I have relevant experience for). Something that would allow me to remain independent in the future (no I don't plan on having kids). I'm open to all suggestions if you know of any openings in mind (even retail and fast food is okay as long as I have the opportunity to advance to a better paying and less stressful job). If I manage to acquire a position that is relevant to my degree then I'll be super overjoyed but if not, then its no loss. I just want something that would act as a good foundation for a much better position later on. I'll work on my dreams while I'm working that job.

I do have some experience too. I've worked two part time jobs before in the summer and am currently doing an internship as an event planner for a non-profit organization. I've also participated in a lot of volunteering gigs during my time at uni. 

I'm in quite of a pickle to be honest. I really need to decide whether its actually worthwhile to delay graduation to bring up that gpa or whether I should just suck it up and graduate. The issue I'm having with delaying my graduation is that I'm just going to be spending more money but I heard a lot of horror stories regarding sub 3.0 gpas. I've been hearing from so many places that if you don't achieve a 3.0 it would be almost nigh impossible to get your first job or even have a comfortable future. Not too sure how true that is but I've noticed people saying this and it honestly terrifies me.  

I know I've posted this on another subreddit already but I kinda am looking for more suggestions elsewhere.",finance

personalfinance,Balancing enjoying now vs saving for later,"I am typically a saver. Always have been. At age 14, I was using the Dave Ramsey envelope system for budgeting my allowance and summer job money. Not advocating 100% of his strategies, just giving a reference for how long I’ve bent committed to being smart with money. 

I am 27. I make $14/hr at a not for profit. My $67k House was paid off last year. My husband and my student loan debt was paid off 3 years ago ($35k). He also has a similar income at the same place of employment. The only debt we have is $15k on a car we needed unexpectedly a few months ago. We got a pretty good deal on a brand new, but dealer used car. We were never underwater on it, despite being a new car. Plus, I have good credit, so the interest rate is pretty low. All this said, to give you more perspective on how committed I am to paying down debt. This is ingrained into me. 

In this last week, I have been forced to face more reality of how short life can be. A wonderful, kind, hardworking acquaintance I passed away and unexpectedly at 43 from natural causes. Another friend in her later thirties has been diagnosed with leukemia. My husband himself suffers from a horrible condition called Ankylosing Spondylitis. This affects his everyday day life and will probably mean he’s on disability at some point in the next 20 years. It also could mean a shortened life expectancy or decreased quality of life. We don’t really know what his exact situation will look like until we get there. 

Right now, our current income is about $3200/mo. After taxes. We fully fund our HSA account at $550/mo. We also contribute 10% to a Roth 403b. Our budget has about $1000 in monthly expenses, and $1000 in savings for things like home/car repairs, vacations ($200), emergency funds. 

My question is, at what point do you or should I be putting aside planning for the future to live a little more for the now? We want to travel, we want to enjoy life, and we never know if we can wait until 59 1/2 to access our 403b. And what quality of life we will have then.

* Car - $33k loan. 4.49% interest rate. 84m term. $505/month.

* own 5-7 properties (because I think real estate is a great investment..)

Edit 2: I'm really surprised at how anti real estate many of you seem to be! I'm constantly talking to people locally who own 10+ properties and want 10 more or have 40 doors and want 70. Is real estate not a viable retirement strategy? Not a complaint, just an observation!",finance

CryptoCurrency,BMX Hardfork and upcoming Cerebro ICO,"Hi all,

#TL;DR:

I want to start a blockchain/crypto/digital/tech consulting company. And I have come up with an amazing way to make this work on blockchain. It's called Cerebro and it will make the likes of McKinsery/Bain/BCG/Deloitte/EY/PWC's digital and tech arms completely obsolete. It will be a sight to behold. I am ICOing 49% of the company (it's my company, I keep 51%) and I am looking for a total of 5Mio dollars investment capital. If I receive more than 5Mio dollars in investment capital, I will scale down everyone's participation percentage and return the excess funds to the addresses they came from. Maximum investment is 1000 USD per person/address (if you want to invest more, then you'll have to use more addresses, but I don't want you to). The reason is that I want this to be a TRUE community effort, where everyone who believes in blockchain technology can participate and be a part of the future. We will change this world, and KNOWLEDGE is the only way to do it. Read more if interested.

Before you read anything: I've been working on these ideas for a long time. I finally had the AHA moment today when I realized how to tie it all together. Other than my best friend, you are all the first people on the planet to hear about this.

First things first: BMX (see https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7ogdxs/bitcoin_markets_xbm_fork/) will still be #free and #CPU #mineable. Nothing changes about the BMX BTC hard fork. I've already gotten started, but I'm on vacation right now, so it may take some time to have a first update. If you want to read where the BMX coin fits into all this, jump down to the #layers part where I explain how I plan to achieve what we're doing.

I want to start off by saying that the following is NOT a money grab. (yeah, yeah, that's what they all say /s)... I have a legitimately amazing idea and I want to give the community a chance to participate/invest in a potentially groundbreaking idea. If you are not interested in the idea, don't worry... I don't actually need investment capital, I have access to institutional money and I could easily get funding for this idea. But I want to reach out to the community to see if there is interest in participating in a legitimately awesome ICO. That's my opinion.

Structure of this post:

1. My bio (so you can give the anonymous me some credit before you read my post). If there is positive feedback on the idea, I will come out of the shadows of anonymity and post who I really am... if that's what is required to successfully pursue this idea... I'd rather not
2. What real-world problem does ""Cerebro"" solve?
3. How do I plan to achieve it? What is the technology required to achieve it?
4. What support/funding/interest do I need from the community?
5. ICO structure and relevance of BMX (yes, BMX token will be free and CPU mineable)

#BIO:

I am a blockchain/Bitcoin/Cryptography/DistSys/Math professional. I hope that doesn't sound arrogant, but I really am (at least I'd like to think so). I am not an expert software engineer (but I am working on that every day), but I manage people who are, and I can code (not extremely well, but I know the difference between good and bad code when I see it). I'm more of a conceptional guy, but I can do work if I need to and I'm known as the ""fixer"" around my team/company. If it's hard to do, and no one can do it... They give it to me (and my guys).

I know the BTC Core devs and LN devs (well, sorta.. I know them, they dont really know me... they'd probably recognize me in person or from a picture), I go to all the big conferences, read all the papers, I'm legit. If you don't believe me, then please feel free to read my Bitcoin tech rants:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinDiscussion/comments/7p5812/bitcoin_tech_rant_january_9th_mimble_wimble/

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7i1kbp/bitcoin_tech_rant_december_5th_2017/

BUT, I am not all-knowing, and I'm not stupid enough to assume I am. I make mistakes, understand things wrong. There are things I don't know. But I strive EVERY day to learn as much as I possibly can. And that is kind of where this entire ICO idea comes from.

From an objective stand-point, the stats are: I have lived all over the world, I speak multiple languages fluently as a native speaker, I studied at a top-10 school (globally). I have a Bachelor's degree in abstract Mathematics, a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and I have 2 published papers (in the area of ""theory"" of Mathematical Finance), one of my papers got accepted into a Mathematical journal like 5 days ago and it has 10 citations (one of which is from a Field's Medalist). I have been in Bitcoin since 2011 (more on-and-off) and I actively read pretty much anything I can get my hands on. If anyone out there knows who I am, please respect my privacy and don't say anything... I want to be un-anonymized when I'm good and ready.

I work for a large multi-national Financial Services Company and I deal with consultants on a regular basis. I somewhat manage a small team of very talented engineers (I am quite young, so I'm not really a manager) and my experiences in this company and my previous companies are what has led me to do this ICO idea. As to what I work on... It's been a bunch of stuff over the past 5 years. I dont want to be too specific because I think it will give my identity away, but I work mostly in Machine Learning, General Programming/Systems Design and Cryptography (mostly Bitcoin and Ethereum)

#Cerebro's Value Proposition (What real-world problem do we solve):

Ok, so Cerebro is going to be a tech consulting firm. But there are a bunch of those, so that's not really very interesting. The problem is that almost every big tech consulting firm is actually just a small subgroup of a much much larger consulting firm. McKinsey, Bain, BCG, PWC, EY, Deloitte, TCS, bla bla bla, they all have ""Digital"" practices, but to be very honest... no one out there in this field is actually any good. Any really good people just work for themselves and charge a fortune... They actually don't get THAT much business though.

So that's where Cerebro comes in. Cerebro will be a decentralized tech/digital consulting business. A crowd-sourced, crowd-owned and more importantly crowd-staffed (yes, you heard me) consulting business that will offer all of it's members (token holders and non-token holders alike) the opportunity to work in the area of tech/digital consulting from the convenience of their home. The entire premise of this business idea is that tech/digital IS the future. Not just blockchain, but Machine Learning, IOT (internet of things), etc. Also, you really don't need blockchain for most of this stuff, but I BELIEVE that you do need Cryptography (hardcore Cryptography, like Secret Sharing and Secure Multiparty Computation) to make these technologies viable without a HUGE intrusion of consumer privacy. And that's the mission for Cerebro: Being the BEST in the tech/digital consulting space, so we have the power to shape our own digital future.

Basically, this is the idea: These companies don't know shit. I'm serious, I've worked for the ""best"" companies on the planet... They're full of people that claim to know stuff, but really don't. Don't believe me... How good is your internet connection? Google/Amazon/Facebook etc is pretty legit, but even they don't give a fuck about privacy. But the ones that will really shape our future are not Google/Amazon/Facebook, it's going to be the big banks... And right now they got us by the balls.

But the big banks are full of pompous idiots who don't know shit about technology. So they BUY the knowledge. And they do so very expensively all over the world every day. A regular consultant in the industry will run a large multi-naitonal AT LEAST 1k a day.. More like 2k in most cases, because the managers that hire these consultants never want to get some junior person because they are way too afraid.

And Cerebro will change all that. We as a community can come together and share our expertise and knowledge and attract the smartest minds on the planet to help us in shaping the WORLDS (OUR) digital future. We will have the power to ensure that Privacy, decentralization, automation, distribution of wealth, income disparity narrowing and the betterment of humanity and (more importantly) THE planet (our environment) is at the TOP of the priority list for everyone involved (because the big banks, the big multi-nationals etc) NEED us. Right now, they got us all by the balls because we work FOR them. But Cerebro will change all that. It will make them our Clients! And we name our price, we name our goals and more importantly, we WORK together.

#How do I plan to achieve it?:

Ok, so this is where blockchain comes in. If you read my tech rants, then you'll know that I know a lot about technology, Computer Science, Mathematics and maybe some Finance (not really claiming to be an expert in any, but I guess it doesn't matter). And you'll know that my DREAM is for the entire CryptoCurrency community to come together and CHANGE the WORLD. And we will... Right now it's mostly bullshit shitcoin and ICOs, but I am not without sin. I bag on Ethereum a lot, but the truth is it's not that bad (there, u/JustSomeBadAdvice, I said it). I have technical reasons for disliking Ethereum, but I am definitely unfair when I say things like ""Ethereum is garbage"".. It's not... I run a full node at home, and I read all the Ethereum related papers, Yellow Paper, PolkaDot, Plasma... I read most of Vitalik's blog posts (I will say that I firmly believe that Vitalik is NOT a genius and that he has not really produced anything technical of merit that I have seen, but maybe it's best if we just let sleeping dogs lie... It's not really relevant... is it?)

Ok, but enough about me... CEREBRO....

So there are basically #4 layers 

I will get into each of the four layers in detail below, but here they are listed out:

Layer 0: Cerebro Token (I'll explain why we need one)
Layer 1: Decentralized Anonymous Chaumian Credentials (https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/298.pdf, if interested)
Layer 2: Blockchain Academy (Free Education on everything needed to be a kick-ass consultant available to anyone who has access to the internet)
Layer 3: Consulting Company (Needs a CEO, marketing team, project managers, etc... But most of all needs consultants.. Technical experts)
Layer 4: Anonymous Data Marketplace (This is not 100% necessary, but you'll see why)

OK, so first comes layer 0; the token. The Cerebro token is needed for a simple reason: Shares of the company. All the PROFITS of the Consulting Services (yes, we will charge a small fee.. Consultant gets X and we charge our clients X+Y... Company get Y) will be redistributed to the token holders. We will have everything be completely public and all expenses will be accounted for down to the last dime. How can we achieve this? Well, simple: We only accept Cryptocurrency for our consulting services, and the payments will go to a Smart Contract (of sorts). The company will post invoices to the smart contract that are auditable by anyone and will withdraw the funds required to pay for operations from that smart contract. In some cases, we will hedge the currency exposure via futures on Bitcoin and/or Ethereum. Technical details will be in a whitepaper that I am currently writing (this may take some time). Whitepaper, Token Sale, Website, etc is all on the way. I just want to use Reddit and other forums as a sounding board first. Please provide any comments if you have any. I am here to convince you to invest in my startup!!!!

Disclaimer: I am not in this for money, I don't care about money, and I have enough money to do this all on my own... But I don't want to. I will of course get 51% of the profits (but we can talk about capping my profit-taking if we want, assuming this company goes fucking balistic) to do with as I damn well please (probably to build schools in poor countries... I am a humanitarian deep down inside). If anything I say seems like a money grab to you... I really don't care... You don't know me:

I spent summers taking care of orphans in Madagaskar with my Dad when I was a child up until my teens, and when I was 16 I interned as a Lab Tech in a Virology Center to work on auto-immune responses that identified CD8 receptors on T-Cells in order to induce apoptosis in the underlying T-Cells if it satisfied some property (with the intent to use this to cure HIV... I was naive). I am very selfless and I don't need anything from anyone. I WANT this to be a community effort. But yes, I will be taking a salary and if I want to buy a lambo with it... I am perfectly allowed to do so (even though I would never buy a stupid car... a nice watch though... definitely). If you don't believe anything I say, then please feel free to just skip my posts. This is happening with or without you... Feel free to join if you are convinced!

Next, layer 1; the identity management platform and layer 2; the academy: The main issue is that in a decentralized consulting company, there is no central entity you can trust to say that the consultant you are getting is good or bad. And we don't want a central entity. So the point here is that the ""employees"" of the company will need to prove their credentials in some way... What way, you ask? Well, Chaum came up with a way to do so (see http://sceweb.sce.uhcl.edu/yang/teaching/csci5234WebSecurityFall2011/Chaum-blind-signatures.PDF) and the paper I posted up top (see https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/298.pdf, if you missed it) shows a way to do this using ECDSA... So we can do it on a regular blockchain. I can go even further and say (I think) we can do it in Lightning! But... Bitcoin and/or Ethereum is too slow to adapt to make this a reality. We will probably need something more agile, something new that we created. Let me introduce you to BMX (read details here if needed: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7ogdxs/bitcoin_markets_xbm_fork/). BMX is a Bitcoin clone that will be CPU mineable because we will (try) to use the cuckoo cycle PoW hashing algorithm (see https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo... credit to u/yorickdowne for finding it) . As far as I know it will not be possible to build ASICs for this PoW algorithm without SIGNIFICANT resources (way more than it would take to build ASICs for double SHA), and even GPUs is going to take some work. There is really no other reason to make BMX CPU mineable other than the reality that I don't want miner centralization. I want you to be able to mine this coin on an AWS machine and if you believe in Cryptocurrencies, you will know why. It was originally supposed to be a meme coin, but I'm repurposing it for this credential based system. It's going to be pretty awesome.

OK, but still: Why do we need a Credential System. Well, it has to do with layer 2: The academy part of the equation. Basically, everyone who satisfies some skill, completes some training, etc will get a credential from the academy with which they can prove that they are for example: a Java programmer, have experience with kubernetes, design thinking training, the list will go on and on and on. And since we can leverage plenty of the content online, the academy will focus on making exams which you will need to pass to receive your credentials. The exams will be difficult to pass, you can take the exam whenever you want, however often you want, etc. The only point is that the exams will be hard enough that cheating is really out of the question, will be tailored to the free content we provide on the academy and most of all, will be achievable by anyone who is willing, interested and able to do their best. I have access to professors, big names in Bitcoin, people with decades of experience in various fields, so getting people on board who will provide quality content won't be THAT hard.

More importantly, the entire Credential System will be decentralized. It will work pretty much the same way Bitcoin or Ethereum work, only that we will include some Op_Codes to make the Anonymous Credentials possible (if that's needed, I dont know yet). I personally think I will be able to get it to work on the Lightning Network, but I can't say so definitively yet. As we get started, we can just use a central server to store credentials and the company will act as a trusted third party until the Credential Based System is done. You can also do it with some super simple public key commitment, but those are not really anonymous or zero-knowledge. We can discuss how and what to do for the Credential System.

And since the Credentials are decentralized, they can be used for ANYTHING. Much much more than just proving some abilities you posses to a client that is trying to hire an expert front-end developer (for example). You could for instance PROVE your IQ, if someone created an IQ Test on BMX, you could create something like PGP and the web of trust on it if you chose to, you could create leader boards for who is the funniest person on the planet. Basically it would just be a gigantic ledger that would let you prove attributes about yourself completely anonymously, but END-TO-END verifiably. This is of course the dream, and it will be VERY difficult to achieve, but it is doable. And I think that I know the right people to get the job done. But they won't work for free, and that's why I'm doing this ICO. And since it will all be 100% public knowledge, people can create leaderboards and stuff as 2nd layer applications. Imagine just KNOWING you are the 157th smartest person on the planet (out of everyone who uses the platform).. How cool would that be?

But why do we need a Coin for this? So... it needs to a PoW/PoS blockchain because we want it to be decentralized, and CPU mining is a great way to get it off the ground. THERE WILL BE NO PREMINE!!!!! No one on gods green earth will get a single coin (other than Satoshi because we are forking from block 1, but block 1 is unspendable anyways, so not even Satoshi will get anything). This is very important to me... I won't get anything either... although there is like a 99% chance that I will mine Block 2... But if you read what I wrote in the original BMX thread you'll see that I vote we make Block 2 unspendable as well (""1m 2020 u/nannal"" FTW). And the other reason that I want to use a coin, is that the companies who want to verify a consultants credentials will need to do so by using BMX coin. So, it will need to be traded somewhere, and the companies who want to hire someone as a Front-end Developer (for example) will need to pay some amount of BMX in fees to verify that his Credential is valid... not really sure how to do this yet, but I'll figure it out.

Also, there's some really cool stuff out there for revocation of Identities. Using revocation schemes kind of like in LN we may be able to make it so that your identity practically can't get stolen. You would just monitor the blockchain and if there was ever a use of your identity that you did not approve of, you could just use some revocation scheme to make sure no one accepts those credentials, and then move those credentials to a new seed. I don't know how to do this yet... i'll figure it out.

A final note on the academy is that our content will be completely free. The rights to the content will be owned by the token holders (I will try to make this iron-clad from a legal perspective), and if needed, I will revoke all rights to the content as the 51% owner. I think that this will be the TRUE value of the company. Credentials will be issues completely free of charge to ensure that anyone on this planet has the tools at their disposal to shape their own future. I will use most of my ""profits"" to try to get the word out, try to get people in poorer countries access to internet and computers and try to get them on the academy. Places like Thailand have excellent internet connection, and a Raspberry Pi Zero is only 5 bucks. Most people have a TV in somewhat developing countries, so I think we have a good shot at getting this thing started right. Of course countries where famine and war is a reality, this may not be a priority, but I think we can do a lot to shape the world we live in right now, to do better by ourselves and our children. Knowledge is the way... Knowledge and LOVE (call me a hippy)

Layer 3; Consulting Company: I am not a CEO, I have no experience with high-level management, Marketing, Accounting, HR... We will need to hire at least one person to be CEO, unless I am somehow worthy of being CEO. That's for the token holders to decide, not me... I obviously can't VETO the CEO appointment with my 51% of the token...

Otherwise there's not much to say about the Consulting Company. I think good work is rewarded and quality services are talked about in the industry. I know many consultants who did very well on a project and are asked to work on subsequent projects. I think if we have a good company that offers good services, we will be able to grow organically very quickly. I'm doing some basic market sizing estimates, and this is big industry... The whitepaper will have more information.

Layer 4; the data marketplace: Anyone out there who works in technology knows: It's about the data. You really can't do much with Machine Learning, IOT and the like without a ton of data. The great part about all this is that we all have smartphones... I was in Thailand a couple days ago in the middle of nowhere and had PERFECT 4g reception watching Netflix. I mean... WOW. So that means that if we can somehow gather a ton of data on people's phones, like:

Browsing History
Location Data
Attention Data (kinda like BAT)
Power consumption
Movement, activity, fitness data
Potentially also nutritional information if people put that into their phone, or have an app that accumulates that information etc

The list goes on and on. BUT the problem is with privacy. I don't know a single person that would give away their Browsing History away in an un-anonymized format (even though they do so passively all the time, but let's ignore that for now). Hell, I'd rather throw my phone in the river than be forced to show my (ex-)gf my browser history... No fucking way.

But what if we could gather this information on your phone and let you share it securely and anonymously. This is actually much harder than it sounds because it has to do with statistical databases, but there's a lot being done in the area of differential privacy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) and realistically we could just do everything using SMPC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) and Secret Sharing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing)... At least I think so.

The key idea here is that the data market place will be a tool for our consulting services. You have no idea how much time I spend every day cleaning up the WORST data imaginable. 

EXAMPLE: Boolean values in columns should JUST be 0 or 1.... But for some stupid reason, people (professionals with YEARS of experience) and I'm looking at you consultants at IBM, WiPro, TCS and the like just do some dumb shit like use ""Yes"" and ""No"" or ""True"" and ""False"" as well as ""N/A"", ""NA"", &lt;blank&gt; in different tables across the same database. So when you try to join tables, it all gets fucked up and you have to dig through it. If you work in industry, you know what I'm talking about. You also know damn well that sometimes when the errors aren't THAT extensive, you just go through each line manually and update the values by hand rather than writing a bash or python script to do. I do that too... you're not alone.

But if we had a protocol, and app, and an interface to a blockchain, we could do the marketplace the right way. There's some people out there who are building a marketplace like this (I won't name any names right now, but you know who they are)... I don't know how mature their data sharing marketplace is... I think it's not very mature. We would do it right. And if you want, you can be involved.

And finally, everyone will get paid for sharing their data (if they choose to share it). Whenever it is used, the client using the data for whatever reason will need to pay the data holder. Either in real CryptoCurrency of in BMX... I guess we'll make it so that anyone can choose to elect their preferred mode of payment, and we can put some type of commitment scheme into BMX to make sure the data you provide to the client is data you committed to in the past (again, why we need an anonymous credential system). Clients will probably not want individual data, so we will just provide them bulk data in some structured anonymized aggregated format. You can read up on Statistical Databases (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_database) and differential privacy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) if you want to understand a little more why it's not completely trivial to just share data in an encrypted format where some unique identifiers are replaced with some random unique identifier. This becomes much more complicated when you share data across multiple areas.

And that's it. Cerebro.

#What Do I need from you?

Please just tell me what you think. Would you invest? Are you interested in the idea? Do you think this is relevant.

As I stated above, I don't need to ICO. I can get funding from Venture Capitalist for this idea in a heartbeat, but I don't want that. Anything worth doing is worth doing right, and the right way to do this is to make a community effort. I just put my cards on the table. If anyone wants to steal my idea, good luck. If anyone wants to do this with me... Join me! And since you are all really only going to give a shit about this if it means gainz... let's do an ICO! If you're interested in investing, please just write something down here, upvote... I dunno... Just give me a sign of life. This is happening with or without you... I would like to have you on board.

#ICO Structure:

As I stated above, I'm going to keep it simple. I will own 51% of the shares of the company. My company, I own the majority stake. Look at other ICOs and you'll see that 51% is generous as fuck! ALL PROFITS will go back to the token holders. I am fine with capping my profit-sharing at some number... I dunno... name a number if you care... If my profits are capped, so are yours. And the excess money we make goes to Charity. The token holders can vote on which charity we give it to every quarter... I will have a VETO right because I don't care what you say, Susan G Komen (or whatever it's spelled as) is not getting a cent... And there are others out there.... I donate a lot.

Another option is for the excess profits to go to a non-profit organization we create. I think CerebroCares is a good name. We can discuss what this organization should do, but I think it should be used to fund new content for the academy and focus on giving disenfranchised people access to computer and internet so they can learn through our academy.

BMX coin for the Credential Based System will be free and anyone will be able to mine it. If it goes to the moon, good! It will have value because companies will need to transact in it in order to verify their consultant's credentials.

I will be creating an ICO that has the following structure:

1. No address can invest more than 1000 USD equivalent of Cryptocurrency (to avoid that some fat-cats try to buy it all up)... I will also be monitoring ALL the networks to see which transactions came from which IP addresses on the planet, so if anyone tries to dupe me, I will be returning their funds. If you figure out a way to trick me by investing from multiple addresses on multiple computers and I can't figure it out... good for you... you're just an asshole.

2. Funding Target is 5Mio USD. Anything over 5Mio, I will simply scale down everyone's share of the token sale and send the excess fund back. Why you ask? Because no successful startup ever needed more than 5 Million dollars to get started.. Especially not one that is basically profitable by design (consulting is mega-profitable)... most of the content for the academy is available online for free, and I have enough experience in academia to do most of the early leg-work myself. The rationale is this:

A. It takes 5 years for a startup to turn a profit (on average... My mother always said that... She's an entrepreneur. *Hi Mom*)
B. 5 Mio, 5 years means 1 Mio per year. That's 10 people's salary for a year. I can do this with less than 10 people. But 10 sounds about right to me
C. I think ICOs that raise.... 200 Mio dollars are obscene. I want to no part in it. *I'm looking at YOU Tezos*

DONE

So there you go. Cerebro and BMX. Everything I wrote above has been in the works for a long time but as individual projects I've been working on. I've just never gotten off my ass to actually do it. But I had an epiphany today when I realized I can use the Credential Based System to create a trustless consulting service, and combine the academy idea to train the consultants. The data marketplace is a bit of a bolt-on, but we need data, and people should be in control of their data. The EU has a new rule coming out that everyone should own a copy of their data... They're going to fuck it up somehow... I guarantee it... So here is my attempt to do it right.

Please let me know what you think. Tell me whether you would invest. Just start talking. If you hate it, tell me why. If you love it, tell me why. If you couldn't care less, then please just move on. Please don't troll. I can't force people to care about things that matter to me, but I can do something about it. This is my attempt.

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me.

r/CerebroICO

I'll do things like slack and telegram etc soon. I need to focus on the Whitepaper for now. The technical details are on their way.

ICO start and all that stuff will be in the whitepaper to avoid any possible confusion. I'll put a hash of the whitepaper on the blockchain, so anyone can verify it, and I'll sign everything with a private key going forward once the whitepaper is on the blockchain. I'll use a P2PK output so that you know the public key and I'll provide a valid signature for all messages I send out after the Whitepaper is done.

I'd prefer to remain anonymous, but if you would never ever invest in a company (not even 1000 dollars though?) that has an anonymous founder, I guess I'll come out of the shadows.

personalfinance,Pay Student Loans or Purchase Florida Pre-Paid?,"Living in Florida - I recently started on a 5-year plan to fully pay off 60K in student loans and so far so good, however my wife and I recently found out we're expecting our first!

My question is related to contributing to Florida Pre-Paid for the new addition - Should I: 

1. Divert the money I'm paying towards loan principal to Florida Pre-Paid while the lump sum is at 29K, and then switch back to my paying towards the principal on my loans, or
2. Focus on paying off my loans now, then buy Florida Pre-Paid in 5 years?

My concern with Option 2 is that Florida Pre-Paid may be more expensive in 5 years than it is now, but then on the flip side, my loan interest is 6.725% (I'm using Nelnet, my employment is currently stable but things can change and I value the federal hardship protections that I don't get through SoFi, etc).

CryptoCurrency,What are(or will) be options for getting loans from overseas via Cryptocurrency?,"Hi,

I was researching what are options to get the home loan from Banks overseas. Currently, banks don't (or are hesitant) fund those type of loans.

Will there be any changes in Cryptocurrency world in future, which can give loans across the borders for different needs without involving banks.

I see few loans related coins coming up, but how close they are to solve real needs.

e.g Loan for a business
Loan for buying house

Few countries (like Japan) have ultra low-interest rates, whereas few countries (like India) have very high. If we go via banks we cannot take advantage of low-interest rates somewhere else. So something needs to be changed?

edit 1:

The goal of this discussion is to discuss if something change in lending space to help people borrow from countries where interest rates are low. Banks earn only due to loans which they give. They borrow from low-interest areas and give money in places where they charge massive middleman fees. If loans can be brought in Crypto world, banks will have a hard time to survive.

investing,[Bonds] Bonds behaving unexpectedly?,"I've heard the praise, a rising tide lifts all boats. 

I've been looking for a more conservative portfolio structure than past years. I'm pretty pessimistic on the current market growth. I've historically shy'd away from bond funds because for the past few years they've been yield 1.75-2.5% (as I've observed them in real time. Maybe the retrospective data reflects differently). When I checked recently though Federal Bonds were yielding 5-6.75% on vanguard(?). I spoke with an older mentor who cautioned me that Federal interest rate hikes typically make bond funds go down as their existing holdings become less valuable in light of more attractive higher interest rates available. When I read the Vanguard bond fund descriptions, they also say this exact same thing. 


My question, if interest rate hikes are supposed to make bond funds go down, why are bond funds up right now? Is this just the overall investor optimism pouring into the balanced portfolio funds which is lifting bonds? Whats your guess on bond fund outlooks for next year if the market holds.

We did not adjust our deductions on our taxes in 2017 so we are expecting about 10k-12k back in taxes this year

My question is, I am thinking of taking all the tax refund money and dumping it on her student loans.  She is already paying $600 more a month towards student loans over the minimums.  Her student loans are scheduled to end summer 2021 and her auto loan summer 2020.  We have been talking about taking money from our other accounts and applying it towards the student loans to help get rid of those faster.

A caveat is that we are considering selling our house and moving back closer to family to help in the future towards daycare costs.  We would make a bit on the house since we were the first buyer in a small development that the later houses set higher comps.

Any advice is greatly appreciated and thank you very much!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Po.et information,"**INTRODUCTION**

Let me explain – if you’re new to Poet, POE can be simply described as follows:

A decentralized platform that allows publishers to license, identify, and monetize digital content such as blog posts, news articles, YouTube videos, audio/music, e-books and more.


It ensures content creators will receive credit and be financially rewarded for the content they create.


Poet is more efficient and global than standard copyrighting due to its speed and decentralized nature


**What makes POE great?**

Think about all of the articles, news posts, and videos stolen on the internet today… Social media is notorious for this.


Poet seeks to offer a tangible and immediate solution to this problem that, before now, has been extremely difficult to control in our ever-expanding and evermore transparent digital world.


To put it simply, it is difficult to legally enforce who owns digital content created online. Poet plans to resolve this.


It will ensure creators are credited for their work and rewarded accordingly. Blockchain quite literally provides the solution to this and Poet is the key.


**Why POE?**

Mass adoption is very near. Poet is currently testing a WordPress plugin, **Frost app, that is scheduled to go live January 21**. Due to the widespread use of WordPress, when this goes live, Poet will be available to over 300 million websites at the flick of a switch.


The community is growing rapidly and the Poet team has been aggressive in expanding its community team to best position the platform for continued growth and adoption.


Realistic, yet aggressive roadmap: The Poet roadmap is one of the few roadmaps I’ve seen that clearly outline the goals and do so in a very realistic timeframe. In addition to this, their product is coming very soon.


Undervalued market cap: Inevitably a critical factor for any investor. My personal belief is that project is just getting started. This project aims to target a market of nearly 1 billion+ websites, and that doesn’t even include the number of articles, posts, videos, and audio attached to these sites. Poet is just now beginning to gain a lot of momentum and hasn’t even begun their public marketing campaign. The development team has been extremely transparent and continues to seek out the community to regular input and feedback. This team has performed brilliantly thus far and continues to meet and exceed expectations!


**COMPETITORS**

There aren’t any companies directly doing anything quite like Poet. The closest comparable are maybe VeChain (Tracks real-world goods), Tron (Content hosting, Justin Sun compared to a Facebook or Youtube), and Publica (Marketplace for ebooks like Barnes &amp; Noble or Amazon), but their goals are completely different and would not resolve the issues of content licensing and proof of existence like Poet seeks to achieve. Poet aims to resolve a very specific and achievable goal.


Poet aims to resolve a widespread global issue that has not been achieved before.


Allows for any content creator to utilize its platform for proof of existence.


Allows publishers to license, identify, and monetize digital content easily and seamlessly.


Will prevent plagiarism and allow for content disputes via community trusted mediators.


More efficient than copyrighting

personalfinance,Help with car insurance,"Hello, hope this is the right place for this!

I’m having a nightmare with my current insurance provider (Hastings Direct SmartMiles) I have been with them for little over 3 months and have had nothing but stress since being with them. I have been charged numerous account fees for changes to the account that were no fault of my own and they can’t get my direct debit payment at the correct amount. They’re showing no care to resolve my problem and have offered terrible customer service. I have phoned up over 15 times and complained but have only been given £30 compensation (this doesn’t even cover the fines they took from me) and not to mention the countless hours I’ve had to use to phone them. 

They changed the car on my policy to my parents car without any notification to myself then when I phoned up to change it they charged me. 

I have been charged a fee to reduce my no claims discount to 0 years even though I did what was required for notification of no claims bonus. 

I’m fed up of having to deal with the company as they don’t value me as a customer, what can I do to resolve this nightmare of a situation? 

Thanks in advance 🙃",finance
CryptoCurrency,A company with extremely high utility flying under the radar,"The one bluechip company with extremely high utility not to make it to this sub 

If you spend hundreds of hours researching crypto like I did (and I bet many others do), you might come across this coin. From going through hundreds of forums, youtube videos, twitter accounts, following redditors accounts who have a verified history of concrete predictions etc... there is one coin that comes up as being heavily undervalued, truly practical, and actually has a brilliant phD and experienced backed team.

This company may have hit the /r/cryptocurrency sub a couple of times with very little viewing and upvotes, as it is flying under the radar. All of the community knows the only problem now is marketing. iExec RLC is an actual umbrella company that is going to be at the forefront of things as a necessity. 


**Whose on the team?** 

* At the top of the team is *Gilles Fedak* (https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=8UEfrTEAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr) who has 14 years of experience in cloud computing research at INRIA (public research body dedicated to digital science and technology)

* *Haiwu He* is a professor at the CNIC (Computer Network Information Center), Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and a scholar of the Ministry of Education of China. He also worked as a researcher for INRIA in France and has published about 30 scientific papers. He holds a Ph.D in Computing.'

* The rest of the impressive team is outlined @ https://iex.ec/about-us/





**Why should I invest in this company?**

*  iExec is in my opinion a bluechip company, mainly because of its real-world implications and therefore utility. 

* iExec is a BlockChain based decentralized cloud computing solution

* ... But its not simply a file storage company like Sia Coin, it's a *computing* cloud solution, similar to Google except in a decentralized form

* In other words, instead of renting out storage space, iExec is renting out computer power that isn't being used, and they would be the **first** to do this on blockchain, and they have the experience to do so successfully. The only similar companies right now are golem and sonm, who are more market specific and unproven. 

* Already have a live dApp store

* Incredible team, (but admittiedly underwhelming website and marketing thus far)

* dApps now don't require more power than Etherium can handle, but in the near future when they need a large amount of computational power, Etherium will not be able to execute this, and it will be expensive (large amounts of gas when it needs to run at 10x, 20x, 30x etc...)

* An example of iExec solving this problem: "" Flixxo is a dApp that envisions itself as the decentralized YouTube. Because of all the encoding and decoding of videos on the blockchain, it requires an enormous amount of computer power. “iExec will allow the platform to do [this] by providing cloud resources""

* Partnered with Request Network

**What is the coin/token for?**

*  Lets first acknowledge that this isn't theoretical, the team already has a working platform - The Software Development Kit (SDK) which dApps can already use for off-chain (fiat/non blockchain) computational power [CPU, GPU, Applications, Data-Sets] a la iExec. 


* According to the blockchain business developer at iExec, iExec provides computing power for free. In **May 2018**, computing providers will be able to monetize their own resources on our marketplace

* PoC (proof of contribution) is used to prove that companies have given out their excess data or computational power, and this is recorded on the blockchain through PoC technology already created by iExec.

* iExec can adapt to any blockchain, including Cardano for example

* Network fees are paid by the RLC token, which goes up in value as more network demand enters. So **workers can rent out computer power**, **developers can rent out applications** on the dApp store, and **companies pay for these using RLC in return for those services!** 




**^Bottom ^Line**: This is a company that isn't vaporware, it already has working products, a dream team, a grand scalable idea, a big problem they can solve (ETH cannot itself economically support the future of dApps), and this is a company/coin that has seriously flown under the radar. 

So if you aren't into pump and dump schemes but rather bluechip long term hodl investments, this coin is currently for all intents and purposes, on sale.  The total supply is 86,999,785 RLC as well.  Think decentralized amazon web services. Think decentralized google. Think Hundred billion dollar industry. Think bluechip. Think big. Think iExec. 


**Community:** https://www.reddit.com/r/iexec/

*Shillclaimer: I have USD in RLC coin. Some people will come here subtly trying to pump n dump. Others will come blatantly shill their invested coins with no backing. I am blatantly backing this coin backed up by facts. OF the cryptocurrencies today, how many are actually with utility and large scale, all encompassing? Barely any actually have utility like that outside of the WaltonChains, Ripples, and a few others. 

**Current Market Capitalization**: $***175,277,809*** USD 

**Current Market Price as of writing**: $***2.22*** USD

Bitcoin,Startups and Bitcoins in Micronesia,"Federated States of Micronesia
Micronesian history is dated back four thousands years when the first settlers' company visited the Yap region. However, a better part of the Micronesian history still remains a mystery due to lack of written records and archaeological artifacts. At the end of 19th century Micronesia had been one of Spanish dominions, until, after the Spanish-American war, it was sold to Germany. Japan army occupied Micronesia during the World War II. After the end of the war, USA started to exercise an administrative control over this region under the auspices of the UN Resolution 21. As a result, in 1979, the part of Micronesian islands decided to enter into the Compact of Free Association with USA as an independent state named Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).

The head of the Micronesian government is its president, which is selected by the local senators from its own rank. The chosen senator must be the representative of one of four FSM States: Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei or Kosrae. Fourteen-members unicameral Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia consists of native tribal leaders and non-partisan representatives. There are not political parties in FSM.

FSM budget heavily relies on two sources: the US financial assistance and fishing rights' sale amounting to $20 million yearly. Other sources of revenues include marine products export to Japan, which accounts to 85% of total FSM sale to another countries, and the proceeds from licensing agreements for using ""fm"" first-level domain name. At the same time, the local tourism industry, which serves to over fifteen thousands international travelers visiting FSM each year, remains ostensibly subdued.

FSM is the small, isolated island nation, which possesses no drivers to ensure high-tech industry's growth. FSM economy mostly depends on external financial assistance and fishing. Other negative factors include tiny population, absence of qualified work-force and the rudimentary infrastructure. Still, given the local tourism industry slow but continuous expansion, there may be some limited profit opportunities found for mobile Internet startups founders.

The Federated States of Micronesia does not have laws regulating cryptocurrencies, which makes trading crpto or organizing ICOs technically legal in FSM. However, as an US associated state, which uses US dollar as a national currency, FSM will likely be closely following all future US FRB's policies concerning digital money.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: indifferent;
economic climate: not friendly;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: e-services (tourism);
major limitations: GDP is less than USD 300 million, population is around 100 thousands, low-income consumers, high inequality rate, underdeveloped infrastructure, low fixed Internet penetration rate, high administrative barriers to SME;
stimulus: affiliation with USA, low competition;
opportunities: to launch a mobile e-business aimed at the local international tourists market.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (moderately negative).",cryptocurrency

Th dot com bust left me scared of the equity markets &amp; with current valuations equities seem scary right now. Keeping my principle safe is of th greatest importance followed by returns.

https://www.annuitygator.com/independent-review-of-the-security-benefit-rate-track-7-year-myga-fixed-annuity/
Or a product very similar. 

Is this the best place to park this money that I am certain I won’t need for 7 years. From what I understand it will keep my principle safe and also leave me the option of making a slightly higher return if interest rates rise. Am I understanding this correctly? Are there other products out there that would offer the same benefits? Annuity or other types of investment vehicles that are not annuities. And what are any drawbacks or be precautions I should take/consider before going this route? I am very thankful for any advice you can provide. I’m not a finance person (as proven by my lack of diversification &amp; over investment in Lucent Technologies in the late 90’s early 2000’s) and don’t want to depend only on the advice of the person trying to sell me the product.",finance
CryptoCurrency,KODAKCoin from a Photographer's Perspective,"[KODAKOne Platform and KODAKCoin cryptocurrency](https://www.kodak.com/kodakone/default.htm)

Just a few thoughts from a photographer and someone who understands, at least a little bit, about blockchains and cryptocurrencies 

There isn't a current problem with proving ownership of photos. Most of the time nowadays images are posted online by the original authors (or the company that they work for) and those online records are easily searchable (ever heard of Google?). And if they aren't easily found online, then the photographer will have either the RAW photo (before any edits/specialized file format) and/or a larger size/uncropped images to prove it is his/hers.

Copyright law is federal law ([Title 17](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html)) which means that the cases are only tried in federal court which means they are very expensive. These lawsuits for enforcing copyrights can reach over a million dollars ([The High Cost of Suing for Copyright Infringements - $2.5 Million in Legal Fees and Costs](https://petapixel.com/2015/06/04/the-high-cost-of-suing-for-copyright-infringements/)) which often means that these cases are not persued. Even if it is a slam dunk case in your favor, it is often times not worth the time and cost. There are groups looking to change this with small claims copyright precedings ([2017 Copyright Small Claims Bill](https://petapixel.com/2017/10/05/house-bill-introduced-copyright-small-claims/)), but until something like that is passed into law, copyrights are pretty much worthless.

What photographers/agencies do now is send demand letters and threaten lawsuits crossing their fingers for a payout with no recourse. This KODAKCoin doesn't solve either of these issues. 

There are also tools specifically designed for searching the web for your images like what the new KODAKOne platform wishes to do. One of those tools is [Google Reverse Image Search](https://reverse.photos/) and I can't imagine Kodak coming to the table with better image analyzing software and/or a better web crawler.

And finally the last part of the KODAKOne system is the ability to license images for use and collect payments (KODAKCoin in this case)). Many sites/services already exist for this. It is called Stock Photography. [iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/) is a big one and recently Adobe has entered this market with [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/). If you don't know Adobe, they are the makers of Photoshop and Lightroom. They are the two biggest and most well known staples of the photography industry which are tied into Adobe Stock already.

Kodak fell out of favor a long time ago for professional photographers. They missed out on the digital market in the 2000's and short of producing film for the very few photographers and videographers who still use it, the photography world has passed them by. Their brand name has no pull in the industry, only in the memories of past consumers.

**TLDR: Don't waste your time. This doesn't solve anything, and doesn't need a blockchain to do it.**",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I pay off my low interest student loan debt or invest?,"I have about $30k left of student loan debt with interest rates ranging from 2-3%. I’m currently paying about $500 a month in minimum payments, and a little extra most months. Regardless, this will take years to pay off entirely.

I’m getting a $28k bonus this year due to my company being acquired so this is a one time occurrence. Still employed despite acquisition and job is secure. 

I would LOVE to use my bonus to pay off my debt, simply because it would be great to be debt free. I have no other debt- I have a relatively low cost rent in LA, car is paid off and in good shape, and don’t plan on buying real estate any time soon. 

I have about 7 months of salary in liquid assets which could cover 10 months of actual expenses. Aside from my 401 k which I contribute up to employer match, I don’t have any other investments. 

While I would love to be debt free, with interest rates on my loans so low, would it make more sense to invest my bonus? If so, what would be wisest investment choice?

TL; DR: pay off loans or invest?",finance
personalfinance,Traditional TSP vs Roth TSP assistance please,"Hi there, I'm a federal employee who currently has 5% of my pay going into a traditional TSP account each pay period. (with a 5% agency match)

I will be in the 22% marginal tax bracket this year with the new tax code, was 25% last year.  I have all my money in the Traditional TSP right now, would starting a Roth TSP start a totally separate fund from $0, or would it compound with the money I already have in the Traditional? (probably a dumb question, I assume they will be separate but want to make sure)

Does putting 5% in Traditional and 5% in Roth seem like a sane idea? Should I be going all Traditional? All Roth?

Opinions, please! I want to pull the trigger, but this Roth vs Traditional is preventing me from doing so!",finance
Ripple,Swift handles $5 trillion per day!!!,"If you're just trying to understand the volume of electronic transactions generally to an order of magnitude, it's in the quadrillions of dollars per year. According the US Treasury, SWIFT handles about $5 trillion per day, or given about 250 business days per year, about $1.25 quadrillion dollars a year.

Similarly, CHIPS handles about $400 trillion per year, and Fedwire handles around $900 trillion per year (most of both of these arise out of SWIFT messages). These transactions make up a large fraction of electronic transactions in the world, so it's safe to assume that the global total isn't much more than a few quadrillion dollars a year.

There is plenty to gain for Ripple / XRP.

personalfinance,"If family money will likely fund my retirement, does it make sense to max out my (non-matched) 401K if I could be putting that money towards a house?","Hello! I’m new here, and looking for some pretty specific advice. I’m not in any kind of dire straits, but I am looking into ways to save some money in the next 6 months/1 year in order to put it towards a down payment on a house. I have been making &gt;100K salary for three years now, have no debt, and I’d like to buy a home. I’ve done my research into mortgages and feel pretty comfortable with the idea,  but I’d like to maximize savings in order to be able to pony up a larger down payment (possibly in the next 6 months ) as well as to be able to afford a shorter mortgage with a lower interest rate. 

 For the last year I have been contributing the annual max ($18,000) to my employer's non-matching 401K. fund. Obviously, this means I have fewer liquid funds. The wisdom I hear is that one should ALWAYS max out one's 401K, but I wonder if my situation might be an exception. 

There is money in my family, and a lot of it. I didn’t know the extent of it until this last holiday season when I was introduced to some family assets. I don’t have access to it now except for a very small (&lt; $5,000) annual income coming in from shares of a family-held LLC, and since I’ve done well by myself professionally I’m fine with that. However, sometime in the next 10-20 years I will be managing assets that will likely provide a very comfortable passive income, so I am not super concerned about my retirement plan. 

Should I put further 401K-bound funds towards a house instead, and let my 401K gather dust for now? Or is it stupid to rely on future money? 

Am I overstating the importance of a larger down payment/shorter mortgage, and would $18,000 really make that much difference? Also, I have already inquired about a family loan instead of a mortgage, and that's definitely not happening! My family wants me to figure this out for myself.

(I have no intention of touching my deposited 401K funds, since I understand that tax penalties would be steep) 

I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'm 27, single, and have no immediate plans for a family. 

Thank you! Please let me know if I missed important info.",finance

Bitcoin,Why bitcoin is way more extraordinary than we think by looking at the stock market,"We all know Bitcoin is still one big experiment that has never been done before. Like every experiment, we have people who believe in it and others who don't.

At the moment, we are not the only ones doing an experiment. At this time, the CB has historically low interest rates. Normally, the Central bank would have rates of around 2% so when the economy has a downturn they can lower it and consumers will start buying more. What we see now is that the CB, after the economic crisis in 2008, still keeps up the low interest rate despite the crisis occurring 10 years ago. When there is an economic downturn again they do not have the capacity to lower the interest rates and that is very disturbing. But what happened in the last few years, is that not only investors but also consumers searched for other ways to get a decent return on their capital. As we speak, the S&amp;P 500 (one of the biggest stock markets) has increased this year by 20% which are extraordinary gains for the stock market. So what are the Central banks afraid of? To increase the interest rates. People will take out their investments and this could lead to an economic downturn again, then they would have to lower the rates again and we would be back to the starting point. After that, people would lose their trust in the CB's. The central banks have never been in this state before, making this maybe an even bigger experiment than Bitcoin, because everyone is participating in this one. Bitcoin could be a solution to take away a bit of their power.

Everyone has to pick their side in which experiment to believe in. I've already picked mine ;)

I kept thinking how wrong he was, Silicone Valley is an amazing example of capitalism, built by computer businesses and run by dot com millionaires. 

I'm new to Bitcoin but as I learn more and more, I can't help but think this is the best example of capitalism we have seen in 100 years. In my opinion, if you can keep the corruption out, capitalism is the best way to have a successful society, and Bitcoin is very good at this.

I think Bitcoin has the ability to create a common world economy that can't be manipulated by governments. Anyone with a computer and internet connection (not controlled by a government) can participate. 

I know its speculation, or maybe just wishful thinking, but in my opinion Bitcoin could spell the end of one of the most corrupt organizations in the world... The Federal Reserve. I know many people think of Bitcoin as an investment but it was started as a currency and I think that is the best use of it.

I would like to hear other opinions to help increase my knowledge of how Bitcoin will shape the world in the future.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Need help figuring out monthly student loan payments,"TL;DR here so you don't have to scroll: If I pay $172 more per month on my student loans to pay them off a year early, how come I would only end up saving $572 by the time the loan has been paid off?

I graduated college in 2016 with, like many others, a decent bit of student debt, coming in at around $30k, which I know is good compared to some horror stories I've seen.

Fortunately, I got a great paying job after college in my field and have been uber aggressive in paying off all my loans. As it stands, I've got about $500 left to pay my school (started at $3,000) and another $24k (started at around $29k) to pay federally. I have been using [Student Loan Hero](https://studentloanhero.com/) (highly recommend, it's a great resource. Also, I don't work there, not plugging them for financial gain) and they have a calculator tool that helps you figure out how much you'd have to pay per month to pay off your loans in x years (you can sync your loan data so its relevant).

I don't want to be straddled with student loan payments until I'm 40, so I've set a goal of paying off my loans by the time I'm 27, which leaves me 3.5 years to do so. When I go into their calculator, when I say I want to pay off loans in 3 years, it says my monthly payment should be $736, if I want to pay off my loans in 4 years, my monthly payment should be $564. That's fine, makes sense.

Here's where I'm confused. For a 3 year repayment, their calculator says I would pay a total of $26,479 including $1,716 in interest but for their 4 year calculator, it says my total payment would be $27,051 including $2,288 in interest. 

How is it that I would only pay $572 less total over the life of the loan but would be paying $172 more every month? It seems to me that if I were paying that much more per month, I would end up paying substantially less than just $572 if I finish a whole year earlier?

The only thing I can think of is by paying $564 per month, it wouldn't take me exactly 4 years to pay off, but more like 3 and a half. Maybe it's that simple? I honestly don't know. Thanks for any and all insights.",finance

personalfinance,Can you people please help settle an argument I have with my wife . Is it better to pay down student loan debt first or credit card debt? My vote is to kill credit card debt first,"So my wife and I often get into arguments over which debt to go after first .

We both have about 20,000 in student loans so about40,000 total .

We both have cars to pay down each month (her used car and my newer car ) 

We both have credit cards to pay down . 
4 cards . One is zero interest until July that we consolidated a few last year . One is Home Depot.

The credit cards are near max , but Home Depot has some room .

We share checking / savings account. We are co-signed on each other’s car (because my credit score is much higher than hers ) . We are on both authorized users on our credit cards . I think the money is OUR MONEY and she thinks her paycheck from her job is her money that I can use .

Last year was an ugly year for us . We moved to a cheaper older home owned by her grandparents to be closer to her family and save money . Sadly that year the fridge broke , my truck broke , and computer needed to be replaced. 

She wants to go after student loan debts and always over pays them . The bill is always random amounts each month and she feels too embarrassed and too shy to call Fedloan and figure out what is what . So instead of dealing with it she just over pays , some months she doesn’t have to pay because she over paid . I tell her this is not good and student loan debt is fine to pay minimum when we have so much other debt to worry about. I told her cars and student loan debt are fine to pay down slowly over 10 or so years . She doesn’t like that .
I tell her that is good debt to have and as long as we are paying it down it’s not bad. Since she disagrees with me whenever she gets paid she pays down Fedloan as soon as she can . 


So are left with little money to buy stuff we need and it usually go to credit cards to balance things out. She is very stubborn and thinks she is always right. I pay the vast majority of the bills with my income  and balance the accounts . She wants to pay more down in savings but I’m against putting huge amounts of money into savings when we are near drowning in credit card debt . Savings are good and it has bailed us out a few times .

Before we got married I had to bail her out twice because she forgot to pay a bill student loans for a few months. She didn’t want to pay for Obamacare before she got insurance from work and thinks she is invincible so never goes to the doctor. So we had to pay the tax penalty twice because she didn’t pay her fair share of those bills . Twice we have been given money to go on honeymoon but twice we had to spend it on her student loan debt (which she forgot to pay and eventually had to do a settlement ) or fixing cars (my truck) .

My friend Steve gave us a Ramsey guide for debt or something for our wedding and she doesn’t want to open it for two years. I beg and beg her but not until this year did she listen and we opened it up . We have yet to see the contents but she at least is open to using it now . 



I’m not fiscally perfect either , I sometimes get numbers mixed up when inputting them into checkbook app , but at least I’m willing to track our expenses where she just assumes chase app is always right. I know I Buy too much junk food and video games on credit and such . We probably go out to eat too much and go to Movies too much so I don’t help make dinner (because I suck at it ) so I can do more to be more fiscally responsible . 

I love my wife but when it comes to money I don’t think she has a clue and doesn’t want anyone to tell her different. My wife does realize we need financial help , and wants to get a second job but I tell her we need to make sure we are using the money we have now wisely and we might need to get a second job. And the cost to our relationship might be too much as we may never see each other if she works 60+ and I work 40 hours a day . By the way she wanted to talk to fiscal advisor before we got married but we couldn’t because we don’t have money to see one . 

So who is right ? 

Put out big fires in student loan and car debt 
Or put out smaller fires in credit card debt first ?

Please help.",finance

personalfinance,Should I consider an unsecured professional loan?,"I have been accepted into a private barber school and I'm looking for help financing. The only debt I have is the remaining $1600 I owe on my car. 

The cost of the schooling is $6950. $6000 for tuition and $950 for books, supplies, etc. If you pay up front,  you get a 10% discount on your tuition. But if not, you can make monthly payments to the school $500/month).

I can't afford to make 2 separate payments a month; so I thought to get a loan for $7500 to consolidate the remaining debt on my car and fund my schooling.  However, my car isn't worth enough to be accepted as collateral; and I don't have a cosigner.

personalfinance,Payoff Car or House Downpayment?,"Hi r/personalfinance! First time poster here.
Historically, I've been pretty good at saving and reaching my financial goals, but I always have trouble prioritizing said goals and I tend to get myself in trouble that way.

A few years ago, I found out my credit was terrible due to a disagreement with an apartment lease when I was in college. I knew I wanted to buy a house one day, so I got a credit card and financed a car to start building up some credit. I managed to pull my credit score from 590 up to 757 in a couple years (going off CapitalOne's TransUnion estimate), so I should be able to qualify for a loan, but during the course of the past couple years, I kinda lost track of the original goal and didn't quite save as much as I should have. Here's where I'm not sure how to proceed:

Would it be wiser to just throw money at my car until it's paid off, or should I dump money into savings until I have a sizeable down payment? One thing to consider is that the real estate market in my city is insane right now, and the longer I wait to buy something, the more I risk being priced out of living in town and having an awful commute, which is unacceptable. As it stands, I could get a house in a decent, but up-and-coming area near where I live now for between 150K-200K. If the market keeps going the way it is now, the only way houses in this neighborhood would *lose* value would be if there's some kind of natural disaster. The city is growing way faster than infrastructure can keep up with, and housing is getting more and more ridiculous by the day.

I hate hate hate being in debt, so right now the only thing I owe is the $13,500 on my car. My interest rate is set so that if I pay it all today vs pay it off at the length of the loan, I still pay $13,500. I currently have about $6200 in savings, and can pretty comfortably save about $500 a month without really putting in any effort or changing my quality of living (though I haven't *really* started saving until last spring). Take home pay is about $3200/mo, and rent+utilities+car payment come out to about $1750/mo, so I could probably save more if I did some analysis and cut out unnecessary spending. On top of my day job pay, I also have sporadic side income from playing music on weekends (usually $200-400/mo depending on the season).

Something else to consider - I'd also like to save/invest more for retirement. I have a 401K (contributing 7%, company matches 5%), but zero other investments other than some silver I bought back in 2012 when it was near $30/oz (stupid). I've been told a Roth IRA is a smart move to do early on (I'm 28 now), so I feel like I should be making this a priority too; I'm just not sure in what order I should prioritize things.

I know this is a lot of info. Sorry for all the clutter. I'm just a little overwhelmed and not sure where to start.

Any help is appreciated! Thanks!",finance

We have 3 credit cards right now with a total line of credit for $14,000. We only have a credit card debt of $1,200, so our utilization percentage is low. We do have $75,000 in student debt, but husband is in school, so we don't need to pay that back yet.

Now, I want to go to a certain expensive college, but $6,000 per year out of pocket is too expensive for me currently - I have around $300 to my name. My parents won't cosign on loans, but they are fine with me staying in the house. So, I am considering staying home for a year or two and earning a bunch of money working at FedEx or something. Buuuut, I know that once I have more money, my EFC will rise, and so I'll have to pay more per year at the college.

Would this be worth it? How much would the price rise if I got more money? Also, would the college not give me as much money if I wasn't coming straight out of high school? Could I potentially be taking some cheap courses in a local community college while I worked, or would I need all the money I could get?

personalfinance,"Living at home, need to move out. Save money or pay on credit cards?","Ok, so a few months ago I had to get a surgery that wiped out my savings. Between paying for the surgery and being out of work for 4 months I also maxed out some credit cards. I moved back in with my mother in October and at the beginning of April, I need to move out.  Rent here in Fort Worth is really expensive especially considering I have other bills I need to pay.  I also have a car payment that is pretty high with a low 3%ish interest rate that I got when I was making much better money but have had less than a year so i can't refinance, I also fell behind on the car payment for one month. All of this has led to my credit score plunging and my debt rising.

So to the meat of my question.  Since I have to move out in April should I be putting my extra money every month towards credit card bills or towards savings?

personalfinance,I'm Giving Money To A Relative To Buy A Car For Me. What Are My Tax Obligations?,"To give more info:

&amp;nbsp;

The relative works for a major car manufacturer and can get me a good deal through their purchase program but he has to buy it. I would like to give him about $15k to buy the car and then he will turn the vehicle over to me. The only catch is that the title must remain in his name for 3 months. After which he'll sign the title over to me.

&amp;nbsp;

How would this be viewed for Federal tax purposes? At first we thought this would fall under the gift tax but this isn't really a gift. It doesn't make sense for me to pay a gift tax for the money and then for him to pay a gift tax on the car's value giving it back.

&amp;nbsp;

Is there anything we need to worry about with me giving him the money and getting the car?

&amp;nbsp;

To be clear, I'm not looking to evade taxes but I don't want to pay an unnecessary tax either because we misunderstand this particular situation. Happen to clear up any questions about my particular scenario if I left anything unclear.

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT**: The federal gift limit is $14,000 for 2017 &amp; $15,000 for 2018[1]. The car in question is actually a little more than $17k, so it would exceed this limit.

CryptoCurrency,Warning about the upcoming BOScoin listing on KuCoin,"I've heard a couple people mention about the upcoming listing of BOScoin (BOS) on KuCoin since it won the community vote there. KuCoin just announced that they've been having issues getting it loaded for trading but are working on it and hopefully it will be up soon. I've been reading up on it a fair bit and have some concerns that I thought would be prudent to share with others before rushing in to get this as soon as it's listed on KuCoin.

It seems this coin positions itself in the same realm as Ethereum, with the exception being that there is no mining, rather their is a proof of stake type system. I'm not up on all the technical ins and outs of the blockchain technology and how exactly trust contracts differ from smart contracts, and will leave those to others more versed in that to decipher.

Total circulating supply of this coin right now is 500,000,000 coins. The ICO sold for about 3-5 cents per coin* (1BTC:40,000BOS; BTC as around 1736 at time of ICO), but if you read up on this coin on coinmarketcap you'll see a current trading price of $4.63 USD per coin as of checking it right now. Unfortunately this is only based on trading on one exchange, HitBTC. However, this valuation would put it at a 2.315bil market cap, which would place it as the #21 on the list of top market cap coins.

*This 3-5 cents per coin ICO price is a bit misleading, as not all coins were distributed through the pre-sale. Some were distributed as ""bounties"", one such bounty was for BOScoin holders to receive additional coins for having voted in the KuCoin community vote.

Another concern is that the total circulating supply as of the end of 2018 should be approximately 1.5bil coins. If this coin could even maintain a $4 valuation through the end of 2018, that would give it a $6bil market cap (which as of today would make it the 13th highest market cap coin, but of course the market can change quite a bit between now and end of 2018)

Additional coins are brought into the market through ""freezing"" rewards, in which coin holders are rewarded for essentially staking their coins in 10,000BOS increments and are awarded with a reward for doing so. From the whitepaper this is apparently meant to make the price fluctuate less as these coins would be locked up for the duration of their freezing period.

More coins are brought into the market through ""confirmation"" rewards, which are randomly rewarded to nodes on the network. The more frozen coins are in a node the more likely they will receive the reward.

This really seems like a system where those with the most coins will be awarded with more, and now that the price has seemingly hiked so far up, there's not much room for non-wealthy investors to amass the 10,000 coins required to freeze them to gain the freezing or confirmation rewards (though the ICO holders are likely quite excited by this prospect for having gotten in at the 3-5 cents per coin). The other concern is that this coin is apparently along the same lines of Ethereum (I've heard some others refer to it as the Korean Ethereum), however ICX already exists and by many accounts is already the Korean Ethereum. 

I'm very cautious about this project, and fear that we will be having a lot of new to market crypto investors jumping on this coin as soon as it's released, only to see the valuation steadily decline as it's a puffed up number. If anyone has some expertise in this coin or can shed some more light on this project please comment below as I'm eager to hear what others think.

personalfinance,"Starting on 2018 Financial Goals Today, let me know if you have any other suggestions.","I completed an analysis of my spending through mint for 2017, and I was not completely happy with what I saw. I am a male in my mid thirties, have a good paying job and do moonlighting work for a small company doing professional services. At the end of 2016 I went through a pretty rough divorce, where I lost almost every possession I owned, and the home we had purchased (Luckily no kids or that would have been a nice dumpster fire). I did complete some major purchases in 2017, such as a studio loft downtown where I live, and had to buy a lot of starter home items (furniture etc).  

My 2018 goals are as follows: 

&amp;nbsp;

1. Cut spending money out to eat lunch and dinner out during the week to as minimal as possible (spent about 10k on food/bars last year, want this to be about 1/2) &amp;nbsp;
    I have been meal prepping on Sundays, and staying at work during lunch (2 crock pots, and an instant pot - also freeze food for later use).
&amp;nbsp; 
2. Cut spending money on Coffee Shops to 1/10 (Spent at least $800.00 in 2017 at coffee shops.) &amp;nbsp;
3. Bring my Emergency Fund up to a solid 6k-10k. &amp;nbsp;
   Right now fund dwindles to 3k or 4k after credit card payments.
&amp;nbsp; 
4. Pay of student loans to under 20k this year from 25k
   a) increased payment from 450 to 550, and paying bi-weekly (which is over 550 a month, and will be paid off in 3.9 years). 
&amp;nbsp;

5. Increase my moonlighting pay from 12k last year to over 16k this year. 
&amp;nbsp;
   a) Testing for another certification, and training for another specialty. &amp;nbsp;
   b) Close a contract for residual income. 
&amp;nbsp;
6. Make over six figures this year. 
&amp;nbsp;
7. Save at least 10% of my income. 
    Invest or retirement over my 6k-10k emergency fund (2 months of expenses)
&amp;nbsp;
8. Start a Roth IRA to supplement my retirement account. 
    $100 a month toward that goal, allocating this money from a closed debt in 2 months. 
&amp;nbsp;
9. Reduce travel to two domestic trips a year, and one international trip every 2 years, which will also let me apply more money toward my goals.
&amp;nbsp;  
    Awesome girlfriend, lot of trips, and this reduction would allow me to work on the side more.  
&amp;nbsp;
10. Changing the way I do financing from spending from a large saving account to allocating funds toward specific tasks. (such as Travel, Phone upgrade, car maintenance, goals, investing, and retirement, house maintenance, home purchases) 

Info: 

* Make about 72k a year gross 
* 12k additional 1099 income 
* 6k Savings 
* 2.4k average monthly credit card bill (includes phone, all utilities, food/bars) - trying to reduce under 2k 
* 450.00 a month for my car (3.5 years left on note) @ 1.87% APR
* 1.3k mortgage and HOA total
* 25k student loans (just over) variable interest @ 4.68% APR - prior to refinance was at 6.125%.
* 118k mortgage @ 4.75%

personalfinance,Recovering Addict Drowning in Debt,"Hello everyone,

I'll skip the sob story, but suffice it to say that I was raised financially illiterate, went to college when I really shouldn't have, got married when I really shouldn't have, and became addicted to drugs when I really shouldn't have.

Combine all of the above and I've been dealing with my student loans and credit card debt by ignoring all of it. For roughly ten years.

Last year I remarried to a wonderful woman who is financially stable and worth a hell of a lot more than I. As I never developed a career, I decided to get certified in emergency services work and try and climb my way up to the paramedic route.

As of today I'm a lowly EMT making roughly $8/hour. It's a substantial pay cut from a service industry job, but I'm attempting to get into paramedic school as a longer-term investment in my income.

As for my debt...

I never really knew what it was. I ignored calls and chucked bills unopened. This seemed like the best solution for my anxiety and general lack of funds to pay anyway.

Today I finally found the courage to call all my debtors and currently stand at $73k worth of student loan debt, with some credit card debt thrown in there. I have no idea how to go forward and really need advice.

My debt comes from 3 sources:

General Revenue Corp. has taken over my debt owed directly to my former college. They hold $25k in my debt with 9% interest rate. The representative floated a payment plan of $633/mo, which seems high to me (but what do I know?)

US Bank has my credit card debt. I owe them $3k but I'm not sure the interest rate there. The rep suggested a plan of $123.94/mo.

The lion's share of my debt is held by Great Lakes, which I don't really grasp. I have Federal Stafford loans (and a ""direct"" Stafford loan, o think?) which have ""subsidized"" and ""unsubsidized"" portions at different interest rates. That's four loans with interest rates of 6.8% for unsubsidized portions and 4.5-6.0% for the subsidized portions, and the grand total would be $45.5k. They say I'm eligible for a ""pay what you want"" $0/mo plan if i fill out some paperwork and give them mine &amp; my wife's FSAID and income information.

I really have no idea what I'm doing, and any advice would be appreciated. My wife is very well off (at least compared to me) and is capable of taking care of most domestic expenses. I, however, want to eliminate my debt without bringing her down or dipping into her savings.

I have about $700/mo that I can contribute to debt payments at present, but that may change if I enroll in paramedic school. I should note that I was denied a better-paying EMS job due to a DUI from 3 years ago.

I've made many bad decisions and it feels like I'll be paying for them for the rest of my life. How can I address all of this in the most efficient &amp; expedient way?

personalfinance,My personal loan has both an APR and an interest rate. Which one I paying?,"[Please see this screenshot for context.](https://ibb.co/dmzfWm)

I took out a personal loan because the interest rate on my credit card is 24.59%. My credit score is in 675-690, depending on if it’s my FICO score, Transunion, Equifax, etc. 

So, I compared a few personal loan companies and moved some of the money from my CC to the loan. The best one I found was from Lending Club. The APR is 15.59% and the interest rate is 11.99%.

What has me confused is that I have a credit card and it only has an APR and not an interest rate. On the other hand, I also have student loans that only have an interest rate and not an APR.

I already emailed the company and asked them to explain it and I didn’t understand the answer. Also asked my mom and stepdad and I still didn’t understand. Which rate am I paying?

personalfinance,Trying to get out of debt,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I’m just looking for advice on my current situation and how to move forward with getting out of debt.

I’ve recently separated from the Navy after 6 years of active duty service and have decided to stay in the state of Virginia, as it was a cheaper alternative to moving back to California.

Now just a few months before separating from active duty, my car was totaled in a hurricane about a week before my final deployment. This obviously was a poor situation, but one that was bearable given my impending deployment. 6 months later and $13k richer, I have the opportunity to get my hands on a 69 Ford Mustang, with the only catch being that I have to pay the $800 transport fee to ship it from CA. 

Long story short, the car has many issues which have since been fixed, restoration, rental cars, and a lack of steady pay for a bit leave me about $18k in credit card debt on top of an $18k auto loan.


Fast forward to now, I’ve recently started a job for $70k/year and have been using Mint for everything. My Roth TSP has $17k in it, but I’m not sure if I should roll that over into my current employer’s Roth 401k option since I can’t technically contribute to TSP as a non-federal employee. I’ve started to contribute the max amount to my employer’s Roth option, as they match 6% every year. I’m also in the middle of starting my BS in Information Technology and will be receiving $840/month as part of my Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits.

A brief overview of my expenses:
Rent- $855
Utilities- $200
Food- $300
Internet- $80
Phone- $90

Are there any things that you see that I should be doing to get myself out of debt faster? I’m currently putting $300 towards each card per month.

personalfinance,Am I Getting Screwed on my Car Loan?,"**Quick back-story**: Bought my car through cash down and financing in June of 2016 at an interest rate of 4.5% on approximately $23k. My partner and I each sold our cars and downsized to one nicer vehicle that we could share and pay off together. My credit was in a pretty rough spot, at the time, of ~580-620, bureau depending. I am glad to say that through timely payment, reducing debts, and handling old credit report problems, I'm now at a 795 and watch my credit like a hawk!

However, I'm still not well-versed in how loans and interest work. My partner and I share a monthly car payment of $355. As aforementioned, interest rate is 4.5%. We pay extra every month, and pay instead $400. I called the bank in October of 2016 to make sure that the extra payment would be applied toward principal and not toward total interest/interest on the life of the loan. They assured me it would. 

Today I received a statement from my bank for the year saying that in 2017 we paid $851.95 in interest. Every month we pay $400, when the payment amount due was only $355.

The statement says, for example, that of our $400 payment last month, $331.17 went towards principal. My question is, does that mean that ~$68 went towards interest? My calculations tell me that that means almost 18% of our payment went towards interest instead of 4.5%. I feel like we are getting screwed and I'm going to call tomorrow, but I'm not really sure if we are, or I'm miscalculating, and I don't want to raise hell if I'm actually mistaken.

More info:
The principal went down, after this payment, from $16,916.70 to $16,585.53 after our payment of $400. As I said before, the summary says $331.17 went to principal.

Is the bank trying to pull a fast one? 

**Tl;Dr:** Applied for financing for car in June/2016. Bank promised extra payment would go towards principal. Found out we paid $851.95 in interest in 2017 out of $4,800 in total payments. This seems like we are paying 17.7% interest instead of the 4.5% stated.

personalfinance,"Extremely lost, confused, hopeless and helpless about how to fix my credit score and make a realistic plan to get out of debt","Between credit cards, hospital bills, federal student loan debt, and other smaller bills in delinquency, I probably owe about ~$50,000 in debt as of the present moment, and upon finally opening up mail from the U.S. Department of Education, I learned that as of December 29th, 2017, I had received my final notice of wage garnishment for debt owed to the US government, and it has finally been the incentivizing thing for me to finally actually do something about beginning the process of fixing the shitstorm of financial damage that I have racked up in the past few years and seriously make a plan to resolve and repair the damage made, but I don't know where to start or what my rights are or what I need to do to begin tackling this beast. I've had a unique set of life circumstances set upon a total naivety that have put me into the position I'm in right now.

This all started when I was 19 years old and a sophomore in college in 2011. One night at a fraternity, I was sexually assaulted while I was asleep and 911 was dialed by someone who walked in. I took an ambulance to the hospital where I had a rape kit done. I remember being told that my care that evening was going to be covered entirely by the government, so I found it odd that a month or two later, I was receiving ambulance bills in the mail saying I owed the city $500 for my ride. Remembering what I was told, I figured it was just some kind of mistake and I shrugged it off, assuming it was made in error.

I then picked ended up picking up a call from a creditor regarding it, and I expressed my confusion about being charged when I was told I had ""nothing to worry about that paying that night"". The creditor recommended I write a letting of dispute and mail it, explaining why I should not be held accountable for this debt, detailing all the explicit reasons why. I got a letter back, telling me my debt was valid. They even had the audacity to condescendingly tell me I could've gone on a payment plan and pay it off gradually but that it was too late; it was going to be ""sent to collections"", something I didn't understand the meaning of at all until I began checking my credit a few years later. As a 19 year old full time college student, the idea $500 would ever be in my possession was unfathomable, and frankly if I even was comfortable enough financially to pay for it, it would give the fact that I was assaulted and my assaulter absolution and I absolutely refuse to on principal.

While all of my friends began getting credit cards with massive limits with their perfect 700+ credit scores, I was at 620, and the highest limit I could start with was $300. It was at that point that I think I stopped even wanting to bother with the idea of ever having excellent credit. I was angry that even before I could really understand the importance of my credit score, and what having a good credit score means for my future, I already had a huge ding on my score. I was at a disadvantage before I ever even had the chance to make a plan to build my credit up and maintain it from there.

I tried to begin paying back my student loans when they were due, and did so successfully for a bit, but I have am a typical millennial and have had bouts of time since graduation that I've had no money to pay the minimum, no job to even get money to TRY to pay the minimum from time to time, and after months of deferring payment I just gave up, knowing that my credit was already not great and that it just really didn't matter.

I have avoided so many bills and charges and creditors because I let my hopelessness of being perceived as delinquent in the eyes of all the credit agencies dictate my actions. After years of flailing after college, I'm really trying to get my shit together here. I have a good steady job I love and I want to no longer need a cosigner on apartments. Most of all I want to begin to think about owning property someday and receive the ability to borrow money. Hell, for all I know all my mistakes may have already hindered those chances completely but I finally want to begin to chip away at this dark cloud I've been under since I was 19 years old.",finance

personalfinance,I have $250 left until my next paycheck. All major bills are taken care of. What should I do with it?,"Hi there PF. I make $32k a year before taxes, no rent/utilities to worry about, and all my health insurance/retirement/etc expenses are taken out of my check before tax. This is a cool $250 that I'm sitting on right now, and have no idea what to do with it.

- I am starting up my savings plan again for 2018; I reached my goal of $5k last year, and halted it for a while to have more disposable income around the holidays and for travel. I've already dropped my money in for the first half of the month; my goal is to save $300-$400 per month. My goal is to have $10,000 in savings by December 31st, 2018.


Student loans: $35k left,  3.2%-5.9%. I pay more than the minimum each month.

Credit card: no credit card debt. I pay off in full each month, so not considering it here. The balance I have now is going to be gone soon.

Car: $9,000 left, 2% interest rate

Roth IRA: dropped $25 in it yesterday, at $225. First contribution of the year. I've been neglecting contributing to this, because I have a pension plan through work. 

Savings: $6,400, 1% interest rate

personalfinance,Any insight on my current situation?,"Hey y’all, long time lurker. 

I graduated college in May with about 12K in debt (thankful that my parents were able to pay a large sum out of pocket along the way, oh and scholarships). 
Parents are currently paying the car, but i cover other maintenance related expenses. 
I live at home, so no rent expenses. 
I have a job that doesn’t pay extravagantly well (30-35K/year), but I am able to pay my bills.
I dont have any pressing credit card debt (maybe some things that i have riding on the no interest periods), but am able to end the month with all bills paid. 
I pay about $200 on my loans monthly. 
I still have about 1000 at the end of the month to save/use/play with. My instinct is to try and pay down my loans with any and every money left over, but i like to live a little and be able to treat myself to things/experiences throughout the year. 

I would say i am definitely in a fortunate situation where many of my expenses (car payments, rent, utilities) are paid for, but i also figured this is when its important for me to take advantage of extra expendable income and utilize it in a way that will make my life later easier. 

What are some good next steps i can take towards investing in my future?

Edit: more details
I have about $800 on a card that doesnt charge interest until May, but it’s not really my expense. I paid it down prior to letting my mom use it for a purchase she wanted to split up over 3 months, so theres really no concern on that becoming an issue. 

Student loans have an interest rate of 3-4%. 

My plans are to hopefully move out within the next 2 years into Manhattan. But not sure if Im capable of taking on that many expenses lol.",finance
btc,"OT, but any help would be appreciated dealing with Bitmain","I ordered my first S9 from Bitmain last November for the January 2-10 batch. Paid up, got the confirm, their system shows that I paid. I thought I was going to get an early Christmas present when the order status changed to Shipped last December. But what instead happened is that the shipment got called back to China before the courier even called me for customs - which is fine, since it was early shipment and I had no entitlement to early receipt - but the order remained flagged as ""Shipped."" I have a recording of my conversation with Fedex where they confirmed it was shipper-requested return.

What I think happened is that they shipped from the wrong batch to me, realized their error, called it back, and left it at that, instead of marking my ticket back to Unshipped.

I already have a support ticket open with Bitmain and the last response I got was to send 0.2652 BCH payment ($850 CAD) for re-shipping. For one S9, that stings.

I've [already posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/BITMAIN/comments/7p8izq/bitmain_called_back_my_order_and_wont_send_me_the/) in /r/BITMAIN but did not receive much help there.

personalfinance,Got a Raise but my Federal Taxes Went Down,"So two important notes:
I changed my filing status to married at the beginning of the year and I got a $2,000 raise to start the year.

I just got paid today and was comparing my taxes from my last paycheck last year to my first this year and my federal taxes went down $40 even though I am now making $90 more a paycheck then before. I claim 0, the same as last year. 

Does changing your filing status with your work from single to married change your federal taxes that much? Or is there some kind of error? I am just worried about owing taxes at the end of the year.

personalfinance,Buy house in 6 months or buy house in 1.5 years after paying off all debt?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I'm at a crossroads that I'd like a little advice on.

I moved to Texas a few months ago and my lease is up in 6 months.

I have a $15000 down payment saved up and I'm ready to buy a house soonish. But I have $8000 in student loan debt (6.8%) and owe $5000 on my car (2.5%).

I'm looking to buy a house in the $120k range.

I'm in a situation right now where I have $15k-20k extra cash a year and that has been going straight into savings. I saved that $15k in a little less than a year.

In 2018 I will be putting 15% of my income into a Roth IRA and a 401k as well. So that box is checked.

For a $150k house the mortgage, PMI, property tax and insurance will end up being about the same as my rent currently is monthly. That's above what I want to spend, so likely I'll be looking at a cheaper monthly obligation. 

In my area you can buy a $120k-$140k house that's move in ready. I don't plan on buying a fixer upper. So, hopefully less unexpected repairs.

I'm already well above a 720 credit score now, so I don't need any time to increase my credit score for a better interest rate.

If I do end up waiting I'll probably pay off my student loans immediately and put the rest of my savings into a CD for 1.5 years since it'll grow more than my car interest will.

energy,"Sen Murkowski (AK), chair of Energy Committee, interview excerpts","The full interview is behind the Politico Pro paywall. 

From Politico:

Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski has been on a roll. Last year, after a nearly 40-year effort, the tax overhaul opened up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, and now the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee chairwoman could soon win a deal for the long-sought road to King Cove. In an exclusive sit-down in her office, Murkowski talked with Pro's Anthony Adragna about how the ANWR measure came about, her take on the new offshore drilling plan (spoiler: she was not surprised Florida was exempt) and why Washington should be acting on climate change. 
Some key takeaways:

On Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's Florida offshore drilling reversal: ""The one thing that surprised me about it is that it came as soon as it did. And I think that's what has gotten everybody. If he had made this announcement a month from now, I don't think it would have been that big of a deal. ... I expect them to weigh in in Alaska and I'm encouraging them to do so because I don't think all 19 areas in offshore Alaska should be open for oil and gas leasing.""

On why an energy bill could get done this year: ""We've got to encourage our friends (in the House) that it's time to do it. And I think they recognize that. I've had good conversations with Congressman [Greg] Walden and Congressman [Rob] Bishop. Congressman Bishop's retiring [in 2020], so he's kind of looking at how we shape some things then. Not to say he wasn't willing to do that before, but I think it does help to kind of crystallize some things and say, 'OK, what do we want to be able to advance out of here?'""

On the federal government and climate change: ""I think that there is much that can be done to address some of the issues that we face with climate change that can be addressed through investments that we're making. When you upgrade your pipelines so you don't have methane emissions out of your gathering lines, you don't have seepage - you might not think of it in the perspective ... climate change policy - but are we making incremental gains in that way. ...

""... And I have to acknowledge: I'm dealing with an administration where some in the administration get really squeamish about anything that has the word climate in it. I'm not afraid to talk about that. I'm not afraid to bring anybody up to my state and show them the impacts we're seeing - whether it is to our runways, our coastal communities or to take them out in the interior and show them the impacts of additional fires that we haven't seen.""",energy

There **IS** a difference between convertible and non-convertible virtual currencies. And the notice only applies to convertible.

I'm in the medical device industry (r&amp;d) as an engineer making approximately 65K in philly.  I am currently living with a roommate and despite this, I think my cost of living is too high. 

**Debts:** 

* 7500 (unsubsidized federal student loan) 

* 15500(car - have time with this as my parents bought it outright and I will be paying them back)

Net Take Home Pay (After Taxes): 3300

This is a current breakdown of all my expenses (built off an average over 3 months through mint) thus far:

* Rent: 1070
* Utilities: ~160 (winter months, apartment has bad insulation)
* Auto/Gas: 280
* Food (Groceries): 240
* Entertainment: 100

* Pharmacy: 50
* Bars/Drinking: 160
* Ubers (gf does not live with me and is a student): 50
* Discretionary spending/Savings: 300
* Loans: 650



My questions:

* How does my budgeting look? Am I allocating/spending too much in certain areas? I often find myself not having the discipline to save the money for loans since I'm still in my six month forgiveness period until next month

* My company is known to underpay their engineers (cost of living is based out of HQ in midwest), how long do I wait to start looking for better paying jobs? After six months, I enjoy working here and have excelled (likely to make Engineer level 2 by next year) in a position that was created especially for me; however, I feel deserving of a pay raise considering the median salary in my area for my position (r&amp;d engineer) is 81k. It is very likely for them to say no if I asked for a raise - when I received the offer, it was  take it or leave it (no negotiation)

* I have not started matching 401k yet because I am trying to save for repayment of these loans. They match at a decent but not great percentage - should I start contributing immediately or hold off until my debts have been resolved?

* Any suggestions/advice where you were in a similar boat? I feel like I am being swallowed alive by my finances despite managing them and making a decent amount of money.

I'm not very happy in my job and wish I were making more, but feel like I may be stuck and not actually qualified for anything else that would make more money. 

I'd like a reality check either way.

---

**EDUCATION:**

Bachelor's degree in education but not a teaching certificate and have never actually worked with children other than practicum experiences during school. I graduated in 2011.

**EMPLOYMENT:**

Full-time employee, local government position earning $55k gross with regular pay increases of about $2.5k per year over the past 6 years (started at $39k). These increases are likely to remain pretty consistent but will eventually hit a cap. My position is very niche and difficult to transition into other industries, but there are definitely aspects of my job that I can flesh out to show how they could transfer into another type of position.

My current position provides a pension, but only vested after 10 years of service. I just completed year 6. The pension will start at 20% of top salary when I turn 65. Even assuming this year's salary as the top, that would be $11k per year in my retirement. If I leave before 10 years, I have the option to take what I've invested and lose the 6 years I've accrued, or ""freeze"" it in case I return to this employer later and maintain the 6 years. 

**DEBTS:**

Federal student loans balance of $24k (5 loans ranging from 5.1% to 6.55%). I pay $230/month on IBR plan. I am going towards PSLF which is 120 payments. I currently have about 50 payments so would need to either stay in my position or find another qualifying position for another 6ish years. Alternatively I could give up the PSLF track and start aggressively paying these loans off. I tried to determine how much I will get forgiven at the end and came up with $25k that will be forgiven, but I'm not sure if I did the math right.

Private student loans balance of $7k, paying $165/month minimum payment. These 2 loans are at 5% and 6%.

**ASSETS:**

I own a house, purchased in 2013, recently started renting out halfway through 2017. Rental income after my mortgage (includes escrowed insurance and real estate taxes) is $500/month. I haven't filed my taxes yet this year but am assuming I will net about $200-300/month. The house is worth approx $80k more than mortgage balance based on recent appraisal but it's in a hot market and I want to hold onto it as a rental for a few years before selling.


---

Because of all these moving parts, it's really difficult for me to determine the true value of my current position and how much I would need to be making if I were to switch to a new job considering the loss of my pension and the PSLF. I have very minimal savings but starting to ""pay myself first"" by setting up an auto transfer each paycheck that goes into a savings account I don't look at. I do contribute the max each year to an IRA for retirement as well.

I guess I'm just stuck. I can't tell if I'm doing well or if I need to make changes.",finance
personalfinance,Financial check-up for a young adult,"Hi, I am just starting out with making personal financial decisions and while I have absorbed lots of great information from this subreddit, I thought that it might be wise to ask the experts to double check both my understanding and current strategies. I also wanted to write this all down as a way to solidify for myself what my strategies actually are. Any advice is much appreciated!

**Background**

I'm 24 and have been working my first full-time job for about a year and a half now since graduating college in 2016. I have some student loans that I am still paying off and just started dealing with my 401k at the start of this year. I don't have any other debts and I am renting an apartment, so no mortgage. Luckily, I am being paid fairly well and my loan interest rates are not very high. I have managed to pay off about 2/3 of my total loan balance so far, with a little over $12,500 left to go. My remaining loans have interest rates between 3 and 4%. 

**Loans**

As for my financial strategy, basically all I have been doing with the extra money I have each month after rent, monthly loan payments, and all my other expenses is save it up until I have enough to pay off a loan completely. I make sure to always keep around 3 months of an emergency fund in my savings account ($6,000) and also significant wiggle room in my checking account for unplanned expenses that are not necessarily emergencies ($1,000+). I have been paying off the loans in order of highest interest rates first. 

**401k**

My employer does not offer 401k contribution matching, instead they contribute automatically between 3-15% of your salary as a lump sum at the end of the year, with the exact % depending on yearly profits. This year I became eligible to receive this contribution and it was 15%, woo! I haven't contributed anything to the 401k myself since I figure my savings are currently better off going towards my loans with those guaranteed interest rates attached to them. However, I did have to decide how to invest the money in my 401k recently. I read up on it and bought into the mindset of low cost index funds, so I chose to invest 76% of my balance into a total US market index fund (expense ratio 0.09%) and 24% into a total US bond fund (expense ratio 0.45%). I picked the 76-24 split following the ""invest your age in bonds"" suggestion to balance risk. I saw some suggestions for further diversifying with international index funds but I couldn't find any options like that among the ones available to me.

**Credit**

I applied for credit cards last summer and the best I managed to get was a Bank of America BankAmericard Cash Rewards secured card which has a yearly fee but does give decent cash back on gas and groceries which seems worth it. I originally had only a $300 limit but they've increased it to $1,500 since. I still wish it was higher because then I would be more comfortable buying everything on that card rather than using it only for gas and groceries and putting everything else on my debit card. CreditKarma tells me my credit score is around 720. I'm not sure if/when they will upgrade me to the regular version with no annual fee and I'd get my security deposit back.

**Future**

Fairly soon, I will have paid off my student loans and need a new direction for my savings to go. It seems like a good option is an IRA, but I think I will save the detailed planning of that for later, although any suggestions are welcome in regards to Roth or Traditional or whether it really matters much for the average person.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't have any specific questions in mind with this post, I more just wanted to get my situation written down and ask for feedback. So if you have any changes to suggest, no matter how minor, I would really appreciate hearing them! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Am I ready to buy a house to live in and rent out the spare apartments?,"Hi everyone, 

I saw a house on the market for $150K near a local university. It is already constructed into 3 separate apartments (5 bedrooms total). I was thinking I would love to take the studio apartment and rent out the other 4 bedrooms to local students. 

I make about 45K a year. I have a down payment pot of 10K right now and an emergency fund for about 6 months of expenses. I have zero debt and I am on track for retirement due to my work's amazing benefits. 

My parents have entertained the idea of paying for the house in full and having me pay them at a super low interest rate - this is yet to be fully negotiated. I am estimating a monthly mortgage rate of $700, maybe even lower, which I could afford on my own if I don't find any renters. The listing says last years property tax was at $1,424. 

I understand renting is a part time job. My current job is very flexible and close by (I would also live on site). I also feel like I could afford to be selective with my tenants and not rent at all if needed. This would be my first home purchase.",finance

ethereum,How could you build a Real Estate cryptocurrency or blockchain ?,"Professionally I work in commercial real estate. My team of 3 makes loans out to large private developers, REITs, and private equity companies. 

I'm trying to build conceptualize how real estate can be tokenized. I'll dive below into two disruption models. I think land registry is a legitimate use for blockchain technology, but I'm trying to think about this from a capital markets perspective.

Real Estate Equity:

This is essentially when you take the value of real estate equity (eg. you put a 20% downpayment on a house or you own a property with no mortgage) and tokenize that value. That token represents ownership of the physical property. Token holders will then be compensated for the income of the property and the value created when the property sold (if the value increases).

Real Estate Debt:

This is the other segment of the capital stack. This represents the lender who gave 80% of the value to the homeowner who put their 20% downpayment. The lender of capital is entitled to interest rate income and repayment of the original money loaned out. The catch here is that the borrower offers the real estate as collateral. In other words, you don't pay your mortgage, your house is taken away and sold to pay the money back.

These two segments of the real estate economy are worth trillions of dollars.

Now on the software side, I am not so familiar with how the implementation would happen. Here are my questions or concerns. I am trying to view this as a skeptic as well.

Why do you need a blockchain for real estate?

Skeptic:

- If you want fractional ownership of real estate, you can invest in private equity, publically traded REITs, or in real estate crowdfunding like fundrise.
- It is too complicated. There is too much legal paperwork that determines stuff relating to tenant-landlord laws, environmental laws, tax law, permitting, contracts with contractors, etc. etc. How in the world would you solve for that?
- If there's an expected return, then in the USA the token will be considered a security.

Counterpoint:

- There is a massive supply/demand imbalance of people willing to increase their exposure to real estate
- People have crypto gains which if they cash out, they will have to pay taxes on. There is not a productive use of crypto-capital that can generate additional return.
- The costs may be less than using a traditional REIT/PE legal/corporate structure.
- Publically traded REITs do not offer ownership. They offer shares of a corporation, which pays out dividend income (taxable event). By owning a real estate asset, you may benefit from tax advantages like depreciation and deductions reducing your taxable income. 
- Stock certificates used to be traded paper-to-paper. Now they're traded electronically. A blockchain based real estate protocol with offer a way to digitally track real estate ownership.
- Real estate ownership requires A LOT of capital. You need a lot of money to make money in real estate. Like ICO's opening venture capital to the broader public, this could be the same thing here.

There is inherent centralization in real estate

Skeptic:

- Let's say a tenant doesn't pay rent. How would a 1,000 different token holders fix this issue? You would have to require a middleman (a property manager) to handle this, which means there are more fees. If you trust middlemen, then what's the point of using a blockchain if you rely on trusted third parties still?
- Relating to the issue above, companies already own and manage lots of buildings and have systems in place to act as the entity controlling all of the assets in the portfolio.

Counterpoint:

- I agree that you would need a central point of authority. There has someone who is responsible for fixing the roof, making sure the tenant that does not pay gets dealt with the appropriate legal action.
- I think that instead of tokenizing individual properties, you would rather invest in a Fund that owns say, 10,000 apartment units and manages everything for you. The value of all of the assets make up the value of the ""Fund of 10,000 apartments"" token.

personalfinance,Employer Overpaid me for 2017. Do they need to issue a new W-2?,"Hello, 
For reference I am in the USA in WA (no state income tax).

Due to an error in the HR system, my employer overpaid me by $550  in a single paycheck. They notified me of the mistake and said it would have to be paid back (makes sense). Details:



- Overpayment for pay period 12/15-12/31 (2017)
- Paycheck was dated 1/10 (2018)
- They just notified me that I can have the $500 taken from my next paycheck, which will be for hours worked 1/1-1/15.
- Nothing in the notice said they will be ""fixing"" my W-2 (not sure if they need to)



My question is, because this was an error for 2017 income, it seems like I will be paying more federal income taxes than I was supposed to. Do they need to issue a new W-2, given that we did get paid the higher amount for 2017, even though it was in error?



Secondarily, I am a bit concerned because I will be applying for a new apartment soon and many need income to be 3X rent to qualify. My income for January will show as ""lower"" than it should be. How can this be rectified? Will some type of documentation/an explanation of the situation work?

personalfinance,Need advice about scheduling a credit card payment.,"I have a credit card with very good credit score because I always paid on time (I guess I missed one payment of less than $100 in the past 5 years or so).

This month I had an impulsive spending spree and realized I might come a bit short for this month's expenses, unless I schedule some kind of payment plan or take a small loan.

I know it's silly to pay less than full for credit card if you qualify for a lower interest loan but I'm just trying to understand the calculation. (I've never managed a loan or credit-card loan payment before).

Let's say I have a bill of $2800, but I only want to pay $800 this month, and pay the remaining $2000 over a period of 12 months. Let's say my interest rate is 17.9% (is that monthly or annual or what?)

I used one of the online calculators and it said I would have to pay $183 every month for twelve months, and the interest payment would be a total of about $200.00. (So I guess I would've paid a total of $2200 instead of $2000.)

But it says that's assuming I make no future monthly charges. I don't know what that means. I would be using the same card for future monthly expenses but those expenses I'll pay in full every month. Let's say my future monthly spending is $500 per month. If I pay $500 plus $183 every month, does that equal $0 future monthly charge?

Personally, paying about $200 over my actual payment of $2000 doesn't sound too bad. If I look for low-interest loans, the best I'll get would be probably $50 instead of $200? I personally don't see it worth spending extra effort of securing a loan to save $150 over the next year (this year is extremely busy for me, but I guess you could say that's being sloppy with finances).

Could you guys confirm if my calculations are correct and that I'm not missing any elephant in the room that might bite me down the road? Kindly feel free to post questions, comments, etc. Thanks in advance.

**edit**: Do I need to contact my credit-card to make some kind of schedule for payment plan? or should I just start paying my future monthly charges plus part of the debt?

**edit 2**:  17.9% is worst case for my credit-card. The range that the card advertises is between 12.9% and 17.9%, depending on credit score. I might qualify for lower interest. But speaking of elephant in the room, is it possible that my card company ends up charging me more than 17.9% as a result of some fine print that I may not have read?",finance
CryptoCurrency,How could you build a Real Estate cryptocurrency or blockchain ?,"Professionally I work in commercial real estate. My team of 3 makes loans out to large private developers, REITs, and private equity companies. 

I'm trying to build conceptualize how real estate can be tokenized. I'll dive below into two disruption models. I think land registry is a legitimate use for blockchain technology, but I'm trying to think about this from a capital markets perspective.

Real Estate Equity:

This is essentially when you take the value of real estate equity (eg. you put a 20% downpayment on a house or you own a property with no mortgage) and tokenize that value. That token represents ownership of the physical property. Token holders will then be compensated for the income of the property and the value created when the property sold (if the value increases).

Real Estate Debt:

This is the other segment of the capital stack. This represents the lender who gave 80% of the value to the homeowner who put their 20% downpayment. The lender of capital is entitled to interest rate income and repayment of the original money loaned out. The catch here is that the borrower offers the real estate as collateral. In other words, you don't pay your mortgage, your house is taken away and sold to pay the money back.

These two segments of the real estate economy are worth trillions of dollars.

Now on the software side, I am not so familiar with how the implementation would happen. Here are my questions or concerns. I am trying to view this as a skeptic as well.

Why do you need a blockchain for real estate?

Skeptic:

- If you want fractional ownership of real estate, you can invest in private equity, publically traded REITs, or in real estate crowdfunding like fundrise.
- It is too complicated. There is too much legal paperwork that determines stuff relating to tenant-landlord laws, environmental laws, tax law, permitting, contracts with contractors, etc. etc. How in the world would you solve for that?
- If there's an expected return, then in the USA the token will be considered a security.

Counterpoint:

- There is a massive supply/demand imbalance of people willing to increase their exposure to real estate
- People have crypto gains which if they cash out, they will have to pay taxes on. There is not a productive use of crypto-capital that can generate additional return.
- The costs may be less than using a traditional REIT/PE legal/corporate structure.
- Publically traded REITs do not offer ownership. They offer shares of a corporation, which pays out dividend income (taxable event). By owning a real estate asset, you may benefit from tax advantages like depreciation and deductions reducing your taxable income. 
- Stock certificates used to be traded paper-to-paper. Now they're traded electronically. A blockchain based real estate protocol with offer a way to digitally track real estate ownership.
- Real estate ownership requires A LOT of capital. You need a lot of money to make money in real estate. Like ICO's opening venture capital to the broader public, this could be the same thing here.

There is inherent centralization in real estate

Skeptic:

- Let's say a tenant doesn't pay rent. How would a 1,000 different token holders fix this issue? You would have to require a middleman (a property manager) to handle this, which means there are more fees. If you trust middlemen, then what's the point of using a blockchain if you rely on trusted third parties still?
- Relating to the issue above, companies already own and manage lots of buildings and have systems in place to act as the entity controlling all of the assets in the portfolio.

Counterpoint:

- I agree that you would need a central point of authority. There has someone who is responsible for fixing the roof, making sure the tenant that does not pay gets dealt with the appropriate legal action.
- I think that instead of tokenizing individual properties, you would rather invest in a Fund that owns say, 10,000 apartment units and manages everything for you. The value of all of the assets make up the value of the ""Fund of 10,000 apartments"" token.

personalfinance,Quick question about student loans,"I'm trying to plan out my financial future and one question that is unsolved is whether to bother paying down my student loans.  

I am on income based repayment and until my income exceeds six figures the income-driven payments won't even keep up with interest.  I expect to have about eight or nine really high earning years and then retire early (/r/leanfire style).  I am also running out the clock on a progressive illness which will likely render me fully disabled by that time anyway, but fortunately I'm already getting a VA pension for that which will likely increase when it gets bad enough that I can't work.  

Anyway, here's the question: when the income based repayment period expires and the remaining balance on the loan is forgiven, am I taxed on the balance of the loan including the capitalized interest, or only the original principal balance that I actually received?  

This fact would make a decisive difference in deciding whether to aggressively pay down the loans during my high-earning years, or aggressively save while paying the minimums and just plan on paying the ""tax bomb"" later, when I am 58 and in a very low tax bracket living off my non-taxable VA pension and the residuals of the modest savings I intend to have by then.  If I am only taxed on the original principal balance then it makes sense to pay the minimums, but if I would be taxed on the interest as well then the total tax would probably be just as much as the present value of the debt.  

I'm starting to lean toward it making more sense to aggressively pay but I'm not really sure.  The decision is coming soon because as I go through my other debts at the avalanche method I am about $11,000 away from the student loan being my highest interest debt, and at my current earning rate that's only a few months away.  

Thanks for any info.

personalfinance,How does one pay for day to day life in grad school?,"Hello all, 

So I've found a lot of good wisdom on this sub regarding grad school tuition and books, but wasn't seeing much about how to actually cover costs of living and I am woefully ignorant on the topic.

For some background, I'm a 23F 8 months out of undergrad (majored in Anthropology) heavily considering going back to my alma mater in the fall (out of state) for a Master's in Emergency/Disaster Management after my medical school aspirations fell through. In the mean time, I've been living at home and penny-pinching as much as I can while dealing with loans. At this point I only owe about 4k in federal loans, have about 8k in savings, and own a reliable car outright. My credit, though limited, is pretty decent, and my parents have offered to cover my phone and keep me on their shitty health insurance provided I cover all copays while I attend school.

The source of my anxiety arises not so much from the tuition aspect, but about how the hell I'm supposed to feed myself and deal with other expenses. The good thing is, it's an accelerated degree so I will only be without steady income for about 11 months (assuming I get a job immediately after). Since I have friends in the area who have offered me a place to live, my rent should ""only"" come out to about 500 to 600 a month. I also have a tentative offer of employment at a local fire department, but a) EMS wages are shitty and b) I know I'll probably only be able to pick up a very limited amount of hours plus the occasional babysitting gig once classes begin. To make matters worse, my current full-time employment contract has just expired. While I am still employed on a part-time basis with two EMS agencies (18/hr) and a non-profit (11/hr), it's hardly steady- I might have 60 hours one week, and get nothing the next three weeks. So, I don't want to assume I'll have much more than my current 8k, which is not enough to cover rent, food, and any unexpected expenses that might arise.

So, past graduate students and financial gurus of reddit- how does one do it? There must be some sort of loan for this sort of thing or other assistance as tons of people go to grad school every year... but a) how do I find them, and b) how do I not get ripped off? Also, is there some sort of credit card magic that would enable me to support partially with credit cards without ruining my life?

personalfinance,Personal Loan to Cover Underwater Auto-Loan,"Greetings!

So I've been doing a lot of reading, especially the articles regarding selling ""underwater"" cars. 

I guess I'm looking for anecdotal experiences regarding this specific situation, and maybe some affirmation that I'm making the proper decision.

I financed my car at 0% APR for 72 months (I had phenomenal credit paired with dealer incentives.) 

However, I am now in a position where I no longer want to keep my car. I will be moving across the world, and the public transportation system is more than sufficient to suit my needs for the foreseeable future. 

I am roughly $6000 underwater on my car. KBB values my vehicle at $10,000 on the high end, but I also have an extended warranty along with about 15,000 miles on the original warranty, so I have an aching suspicion that I may be able to push that figure upward a little bit with that in mind.

Despite this, I have a limited time to sell my car, and I'm looking at pulling out a personal loan to cover the ""underwater"" gap. I've never taken out a personal loan before, and I know that they can carry very hefty interest rates. 

I have a credit score of roughly 740, though I am carrying a bit of credit card and student loan debt. I regularly pay more than the minimum, and as a result, I've managed to keep in good graces with the credit gods. 

Ultimately, I feel that I'm being leveraged into a situation where a personal loan is my only option, and I do not relish in the idea of being pidgeonholed into having to take out a high interest rate loan just to ensure that I do not have to store my vehicle for three to four years.

I have 46 months left on my auto loan term, and I comfortably make my payments. Using various online loan calculators, placing %20 down on a $6,095, 2 year loan (the remaining cost of the car if I sold for the absolute lowest I would go) with a 7% interest rate brings my monthly payments in line with my auto-loan payment, which I have already established that I can afford easily.

Rather, the proposed Telegram Open Network (TON) would seek nothing short of decentralizing online communication, with a suite of services, from file sharing to anonymous browsing, purchasable with the new crypto tokens, known as grams.

“This is like Elon Musk-level ambition,” Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital, who looked at the offering, told CoinDesk. In fact, Samani said he declined to invest in the ICO precisely because of its broad scope.

“My concern as an investor is the focus and diluted effort,” he said since the TON aims to disrupt the same areas as several other blockchain startups that have also recently raised funds via token sales.

Outlined in a 23-page primer on the offering obtained by CoinDesk, the TON is a blockchain protocol for the peer-to-peer movement of funds between users and to make purchases. This would interact directly with Telegram’s messenger app, which was created in 2013 at VK, the Russian equivalent of Facebook.

Sources told CoinDesk that $500 million to $600 million was Telegram’s goal in a presale, with the other $600 million to $700 million to be offered publicly.

The company is using the Simple Agreement for Futures Tokens (SAFT) structure, in which money is raised from accredited investors before a functioning network is built, in order to avoid running afoul of securities laws. The grams, eventually delivered to the SAFT investors, could then be resold to consumers.

Talk of the town
Telegram, which has not responded to CoinDesk’s requests for comment, would, no doubt, be the most mainstream company to issue a crypto token to date, although the social messaging app Kik raised $98 million in an ICO in September.

“Many hedge fund managers are talking about the TON ICO,” said BitBull Capital’s Joe DiPasquale. “Telegram has owned the chat space for those in crypto, and our usage of the app is increasing due to its security and ease. It’s become the platform of choice for crypto discussion, and they will have a lot of attention leading into their ICO.” 

Calling the presale’s minimum investment of $1 million and cap on proceeds high and its one-year lockup long compared to other token sales before it, DiPasquale still continued optimistically, saying:

“They are likely to be successful with a raise given their success as a platform to date.”

Other investors CoinDesk spoke with were reluctant to discuss the sale, with one citing a non-disclosure agreement required to view the primer and a technical white paper.

Rumors of the ICO plan started last week, and on Sunday a Russian-language slide deck marked “Ton_Draft” was posted on a Russian-language Telegram channel run by Fedor Skuratov, CEO of Combot, an analytics platform for the messaging app. TechCrunch was the first English language outlet to report the plan.

While the document CoinDesk received, and other investors have confirmed receiving, does not seem to be the most detailed account of the TON system (its footnotes refer to the technical white paper), the primer does provide a basic outline of what Telegram hopes to achieve with its crypto token.

Lofty goals
In the document, the company declares:

https://RateHash.com


“The current state of blockchain technology resembles automobile design in 1870: it is promising and praised by enthusiasts, but inefficient and too complicated to appeal to the mass consumer.”

As such, no cryptocurrency has gained truly mainstream success, yet Telegram believes, according to the paper, that a decentralized counterpart to everyday money is needed.

The primer states that the company is hoping to enable the easy exchange of micropayments among users and bots, something that’s been of general interest throughout the blockchain space.

In an effort to do that, the primer explains that 5 billion grams will be generated, with 4 percent reserved for the Telegram team (with a four-year vesting period) and 44 percent to be sold during the ICO.

The remaining 52 percent will be “retained by the TON Reserve to protect the nascent cryptocurrency from speculative trading and to maintain flexibility at the early stages of the evolution of the system,” the primer states.

According to a source with knowledge of the presale terms, the one-year lockup comes with a 60 percent discount.

The ICO is likely all or a part of the “three big announcements” Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov told his followers about on his public Telegram channel on New Year’s Eve.

According to the primer, the sale will take place in the first quarter of 2018, with the SAFTs converting to grams in the fourth quarter.

The roadmap goes on to state that the first related product, “External Secure ID,” will launch in the first quarter of 2018, with all other products to be rolled out by the first half of 2019. And the Telegram founders’ control of the project will shift to a non-profit foundation by 2021.

‘Tons’ of competitors
While the TON’s main priority is consumer payments, the primer goes into a number of services Telegram would like to build out that seem to encroach on territories, such as file sharing and privacy, already staked out by well-known and well-funded ICO issuers.

For instance, the primer outlines:

TON Storage – “A distributed file-storage technology, accessible through the TON P2P Network and available for storing arbitrary files, with torrent-like access technology and smart contracts used to enforce availability.” Throwing in torrent-like access makes this product similar to the Filecoin platform, which raised $257 million in a token sale in September, as well as projects like Storj and Sia.
TON Proxy – “This layer can be used to create decentralized VPN services and blockchain-based TOR alternatives to achieve anonymity and protect online privacy.” This sounds similar to the vision articulated by the team behind Orchid.
TON Services – “A platform for third-party services of any kind that enables smartphone-like friendly interfaces for decentralized apps and smart contracts, as well as a World Wide Web-like decentralized browsing experience.” A number of blockchain-based startups are building decentralized app marketplaces, including Coinbase, which continues to build out its Toshi marketplace; and the recently completed token sale for Sirin, which seeks to integrate decentralized applications into its blockchain-based mobile device.
TON DNS – “A service for assigning human-readable names to accounts, smart contracts, services, and network nodes.” Both MaidSafe and Blockstack, which raised $50 million on an ICO in December, fall into the same category.
The company’s ICO plans must have come together quickly, according to the former chief technical officer at VK, Anton Rozenberg.

“While I was working at Telegram, cryptocurrencies, ICO, the blockchain, etc were never discussed,” Rozenberg, who left the company in April of last year, told CoinDesk.

Still, many remain, if nothing else, wow-ed by the expanse of the project.

Eduard Gurinovich, a Russian entrepreneur and founder of MyTime, which plans on launching an ICO in March, told CoinDesk:

“Gram … is declared, essentially, as a new dawn for P2P.  This is something that could compete with bitcoin. Gram has the chance to realize its full potential. This is the winning bid for Gram as a new accounting currency, not an investing one.”

Telegram’s $1.2 Billion ICO Could Be the Most Ambitious Token Sale Yet

To describe Telegram’s planned initial coin offering (ICO) as ambitious would be an understatement.

finance,Student Loan Resolutions amid Interest Rate Uncertainties post Brexit,,finance
personalfinance,21 yo. New grad looking to become financially intelligent,"Hello,

I am 21 years old and just got my undergrad degree and work full time now making $83K annually. I have about $80K in student loans and I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree.

I have a source of good income now but I am just not sure what to do with it.

I think I should start paying off my oldest student loan now: $20K with 7.3% interest. The rest have lower interest rates.

I also want to put as much money as I can into my Roth 401(k) as my company matches 50% of the first 2% I contribute and 25% of the next 5% I contribute. (Idk if this is a good amount of matching or not)

I’ve also read that getting a Roth IRA would be good.

Lastly, I’ve been reading about the stock market as well because I know that is also a place to potentially make money in the long run.

If I continue this route, I will still need to get loans for my current classes. $4K every 3 months.

Is this a solid plan? I have no idea if this is good or not. I’ve just been talking to my parents and reading about finances to come to these conclusions. References, advice, etc. I’d greatly appreciated. I am just a young’un beginning my journey :D",finance

personalfinance,"How much would I have to pay to cancel a life insurance policy that I took a loan on? New York Life, based on the info given.","In 2010 I put 60K toward a life insurance policy with New York Life. The purpose of this whole life policy was that by the time I retired I would of cashed it out for 300-400K.

Mid 2015 I took out all of the money available as a loan with a 5% interest rate, 53K, I don't know what happened to the other 7K but I believe it was a premium that I paid

Late 2016 I took out 900$ that generated and took out 900$ this past summer that generated. How this policy is generating money, again I have no idea.

My death benefit is 300K - the loan I took out.

I was told that the 900$ I took out, that if I took it out as a dividend the death benefit would drop dramatically.

Basically I want to know how I can get rid of this life insurance policy? I don't want it and to be honest I was pressured into getting it by my brother and a family friend back in 2010.

The family friend (not my friend but a family friend) is also the agent and when I spoke to him about canceling he told me about taxes that I'd have to pay but honestly I have no idea what he's talking about.

Further more I don't know how much in taxes I'd have to pay anyway.

I know this is vague but any info would be appreciated. I just want this policy gone.

I was told that if I died the death benefit would be my death benefit minus the loan that I took out.

Is it only the taxable gains that I'd be taxed on?

Also what is the cash value exactly?",finance

CryptoCurrency,How would a collapse in financial markets affect Crytpos?,"The FED plans on hiking interest rates 4 more times over the next 12 months. Every time they have increased rates this significantly in the past, a large correction has occurred in financial assets.

The yield curve on bonds is starting flatten out as a result. Most economic indicators are either extremely weak or are manipulated. CPI, retail sales, non-farm payrolls all suck. 

The US is in more debt than ever, and it’s literally impossible to pay off according to GDP. 

But even if any of what I’m saying is nonsense, let’s just assume for one second that it’s not. As a side note, I’m just trying to make the required word count for posting my question on this subreddit. 

My question being, how would a collapse in traditional financial markets affect the crypto markets? Do you think people will retreat to cryptos as a safe haven? (Kinda like gold was a safe haven in the 2008 GFC) Maybe cryptos will collapse too, due to leveraging. What do you guys think?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"My finances spiraled out of control while I was starting school and totally on my own--now I'm budgeted and scheduled, but still feel financially crippled","I've read a few posts similar to this, but I'll admit--I don't think anyone was in a hole as deep as me at my age. 

My current net worth, including my student loans, is -$37,000. Without my student loans, it is -$7,200 (credit card debt). On top of that, I've taken out high-interest personal loans--I paid one back, but the other I defaulted on, causing them to rape and pillage my bank account biweekly until my bank sent them a cease and desist letter on my behalf demanding that they stop drawing an overdrawn account after I sent letters to the lender requesting they stop. (for those thinking, no way that worked, my bank was blocking the payments anyway and I told the lender this, meaning they were basically trying to financially cripple me with fees knowing they wouldn't benefit)

Now, before you go ""Holy shit! Who taught you anything?""--No one did!

Fast forward 4 weeks from that letter: I'm 21, a senior at uni. When I first came to school I had to do it all on my own. My parents are below the poverty line and I'm the only one to go to uni--therefore it was my choice, my money. However, in my sophomore and junior (2/3) years of school, I began to run out of money to pay off each semester. So, I turned to 0% interest trainer cards to pay off the remaining few hundred dollars. Then, I had to use up more of the credit. Eventually I was at 80% of my revolving credit and the interest rate was about to kick in. Oh boy.

Then, from that day until now, I've simply been apathetic towards my finances. I've been able to pay rent, but sometimes just barely or by selling something I know I don't need. The ""why"" is beyond me now--I had a diagnosed illness that probably contributed to me acting like my finances weren't my own while I was succeeding in every other aspect of my life. I only deal with the ""how""

HERE'S THE Q: I now have a full time job, am finishing classes, and have budgeted to be able to pay rent come the first of feburary (barely, again). What do I do about all of these defaulted and dead weight accounts? I have 3 cards that have been stopped with no payment, that outstanding small loan ($200), and $450 in negative bank fees from the fiasco that came after. 

I feel like half of a human having a budget on paper and getting cash in hand knowing that if my employer switches to direct deposit I'm immediately screwed. I can't afford to sink an entire paycheck into those bank fees and get my checking account back.

Additionally, I began to brutally schedule my life recently so I would stop with the shortsighted decisions. If that scenario arose now I'd simply drop out and come back in a few years. Eh, we live and we learn.

I've used apps like Mint, YNAB, Week Plan. Only Week Plan works for me, everything else I customize or do on paper. However, it's hard to use budget software when you are, in the bigger picture than just paying what you need to survive and save a bit, totally financially crippled.

So, what should my steps to the future be? Is this a slow-and-steady deal where I have to tiptoe across the thin ice that I've made, or is my only real concern the bank fees and the rest can wait?

Edit: As below, my debt is no interest or low fixed interest on the student loans. My income is around $1-1.1k per month, with around $750 of can't-miss expenses. My budget has $880 in expenditures each month if I include food, gas. I paid for my car but it's legally in my sister's name--didn't want any debtors putting a lean on it. I rent my housing.",finance

personalfinance,"Following this sub's steps, not sure what comes next: student loan debt or IRA","Hi! So my husband and I are following the steps on this sub, and so far we have:
Paid off $11k in credit card debt
Paid off $15k in super high-interest private student loans
Saved $15k in an emergency fund
His employer matches to 8%, so he contributes that to retirement

I have $85k in direct student loans, interest rates ranging from 5-7.6%. He has $15k left in direct student loans, interest around 5-6%. We're both on income-based plans, about $500 total a month. 

So now that we've done the top priority things, I don't know what to do with our budget surplus (usually $1k a month). It seems like the options, based on the steps, are to either:

1. Start more aggressively paying off the rest of our student loans. Issue with that is that I *should* technically qualify for public service loan forgiveness (in 7 years). But I don't really trust that it'll actually be forgiven, and it hurts seeing all of that interest accruing. Plus I'm not 100% that I'll stay in this job. I suppose we could start with my husband's 15k and then decide? 
2. I could open an IRA/he could contribute more to his 401k. Right now my only retirement contributions are what my employer puts into my pension fund. 
3. Something else that you all think is better (Or a combo?)

(Just fyi, we own our home, we are both 29, and we have no kids, but probably thinking about kids in the next 2 years. Not sure if we should be doing something else to save for that.)

About how Nixon's Detente (his ending of hostilities with Russia) was sabotaged, resulting in U.S. taxpayers paying a huge price in Trillions &amp; Trillions of tax dollars given 2 scheming ""Defense"" industry","""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA""; By Anne Hessing Cahn

Book review in the ""Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"" January, 1999

No. 1, Vol. 55; Pg. 70

By Warnke, Paul C. (reviewer)

Killing Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.

In presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)

Shortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly **overstating** Soviet military expenditures. **[WhereIsFiber's note: The Soviets, now the Russians, have always spent a small fraction on defense compared to our wildly wasteful U.S. ""Defense"" budgets. The USA spends on ""Defense"" what the next 12 countries combined spend on defense. That's why our economy is just limping along and our national debt has skyrocketed to 19 Trillion, and dangerously rising.]**

In late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by ""projecting a sense of complacency."" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.

The initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.

The navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.

Whatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by ""independent"" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.

As the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the ""intellectual godfather"" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. **[My note: This is laughable.]** In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the ""intensity, scope, and implicit threat"" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that ""Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded."" **[Note: Haha, if you're going to waste Trillions of U.S. taxpayers' money on ""Defense,"" you need a big boogeyman/bogeyman, a scary ""enemy,"" a phantom menace. The reality is the U.S. foisted the Cold War on the Russians.  The Russians wanted to be our ally, just like the French are our ally.  In fact, the Russians were our allies during World War 2 against the Nazis.  After World War 2, U.S. war mongers started the Cold War against Russia.  No less than double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling has said the Soviets/Russians did not want the Cold War.]**

It is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.

Detente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.

Although the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided ""intellectual fodder"" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that ""the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup."" **[Lol. You accuse your ""enemy"" of what you, yourself, are most guilty.]** The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, ""has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated from a single center--Moscow."" **[The jokes keep coming.]**

Not surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

Fortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.

Although detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, **[this book was published in 1998 during Bill Clinton's presidency, so, no, detente did not survive the Bush/Cheney regime and the ""Project For a New American Century,"" the 21st Century's equivalent of the anti-Nixon, anti-detente ""Team B"" liars]** the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.

""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" author Anne Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But it is the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.

Previously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.

personalfinance,22 yo about to go through MAJOR career move,"Hello, r/personalfinance, first time poster here. I’ll try to keep this short and to the point. 

I’m 22 years old and graduated college 6 months ago from a large well-respected public university on the west coast with a degree in political science with a minor in economics. In my last quarter of college, I did an internship on Capitol Hill and loved it—my original plan was to work a temp job for the first 4-6 months after graduation &amp; use those savings to move to DC and begin a career in politics by starting out as a congressional staffer. 

However, I got a full-time job offer in finance right before graduation, from a company for whom I previously interned. I took the job and moved to the area, which is 2 hours south of my hometown. After being there for 6 months, I absolutely hate it. It isn’t what i thought it was. I was incredibly mislead by the hiring team to believe that it was a financial advisor role, when in reality I’m just a life insurance salesman masquerading as a financial advisor. It pays barely above minimum wage &amp; the commission structure is crap. I want out!! I hate every minute of the job, I totally regret taking it. Although I was able to get FINRA series 6 &amp; 63 certified out if it. 

My plan is to quit soon and move back to my hometown. I plan to get a temporary job for 4-5 months, save up about $10K, and move back out to DC to work on Capitol Hill again since politics is my true passion. 

I make about $35K annually at my current job. No health benefits, no retirement plan, no guaranteed base after the first 9 months (your pay is 100% commission after that point; I’m month 6 currently). 

As a congressional staffer, I would start off around $35-45K, but I would have full health benefits, pension, retirement plan, comp’d daily commuting, and I would actually be doing something that I’m passionate about! Also, my student loans would be forgiven after 3 years as a federal government employee so I wouldn’t have to worry about paying off my student loans. 

I currently have:
 $500 in savings. 
$500 credit card debt 
$10,000 student loan debt

My current monthly expenses are:
$800 rent
$180 gas
$200 food

When I move back to my hometown to take a temp job, I virtually wouldn’t have any expenses since I’d be living at home. 


I want to save up $10K before moving to DC because I would need to find a room to rent and also want about 6 months salary while I job hunt on the Hill. 

Is this a good plan financially? Should I plan to save up more before moving? What’s your advice on which debt I should pay off first? My student loans would be forgiven once I find a job on The Hill so I’m not sure if I should just pay off the monthly interest for now and just focus on building up my nest egg. 

TLDR; I hate my first job out of college, I want to move across the country to pursue a career field that I’m actually passionate about. Want to know how much I should save up.",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin and the Collapse of the Global Financial System,"Hypothetically speaking, if the bond market crashes as a result of the Fed dumping their ~2 trillion dollar bond portfolio onto the market wouldn't this cause a devaluation of the USD? Wouldn't other countries like China follow suit dumping more USD into circulation pushing the value of the USD lower and lower? Wouldn't the stock market sell off so people can maintain some value in their bank account as everything becomes more expensive? Wouldn't this be worse that what we have seen before considering the US has been printing 500 million dollars per day for over a decade? 

So, my real question is... Where the F*UCK does the money go after this? Back into a system that PROMISED there would never be another boom bust cycle (we've had 4 major ones since then)? I think not. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are going to be the new safe haven for everyone that has been F*CKED by banks and the elite since the beginning of the federal reserve.

personalfinance,The lesser evil: taking out a student loan or taking money out of a Roth IRA to help pay tuition?,"I'm currently in a one year master's program and I literally made it to my last semester without taking out any student loans. But now I need to pay my tuition and am looking at two options: take money out of the Roth IRA (started a couple years ago when grad school wasn't a part of my plans) or take out a student loan.

General advice seems to be NOT to do either of these things, but I have exhausted all other options (I've gotten all of the federal loans I can and have used my own money, but now have just enough to get by for the rest of the year). In researching student loans, I've seen everywhere to try to do anything else I can before I take on out. And my research of IRAs and retirement accounts also tells me that I shouldn't take out of them. So which is the lesser evil?

More details on my situation:

* Roth IRA is $9,400 with about $2,400 in unrealized gain
* I've got about $2,500 in checking/savings
* have a good credit score (mint says 746 right now) and my parents could also co-sign a loan if need be so generally speaking, I think I could get a pretty low rate on a loan
* I graduate in May and with my degree should be getting a job that pays at least 65k (if not more like 70-75k)
* I currently TA and will be making $674 a month until mid-May
* I already have about $20,200 in federal loans

List of expenses:

* tuition: $6944
* Rent: $700/month
* utilities: ~$65/month
* food/other: ~250/month

personalfinance,"How much would I have to pay to cancel a life insurance policy that I took a loan on? New York Life, based on the info given.","In 2010 I put 60K toward a life insurance policy with New York Life. The purpose of this whole life policy was that by the time I retired I would of cashed it out for 300-400K.

Mid 2015 I took out all of the money available as a loan with a 5% interest rate, 53K, I don't know what happened to the other 7K but I believe it was a premium that I paid

Late 2016 I took out 900$ that generated and took out 900$ this past summer that generated. How this policy is generating money, again I have no idea.

My death benefit is 300K - the loan I took out.

I was told that the 900$ I took out, that if I took it out as a dividend the death benefit would drop dramatically.

Basically I want to know how I can get rid of this life insurance policy? I don't want it and to be honest I was pressured into getting it by my brother and a family friend back in 2010.

The family friend (not my friend but a family friend) is also the agent and when I spoke to him about canceling he told me about taxes that I'd have to pay but honestly I have no idea what he's talking about.

Further more I don't know how much in taxes I'd have to pay anyway.

I know this is vague but any info would be appreciated. I just want this policy gone.

I was told that if I died the death benefit would be my death benefit minus the loan that I took out.

Is it only the taxable gains that I'd be taxed on?

Just got my policy details from my agent.

First of all: Does this effect my credit, since it was taken out as a Parent Plus loan for Els_worthy1?

Second: what are my best options for paying this off? Should I refinance it with my other private loan for a single loan? My federal loan is currently on income based repayment - and thus 0 a month. 

Should I just try and start pumping as much money into the loan as possible now and call it a wash on my taxes? Can I pay it off while its still under my Dad's name and get tax credit for doing so?

I am a veteran and will therefore be using the VA home loan which if you don't know, can offer lower interest rates, require no down payment, and don't require you to pay PMI.

My rent has been steadily creeping up to a point where it's nearly $1000/mo which is basically what I would be paying for a mortgage anyway.

-AES- $23345.11 @ 4.4% variable (recently sold to Navient, so I anticipate an interest hike) (current payment is about $150/month)

-Nelnet (federal)- $32789.55 across multiple loans, ranging from ~2-7% (not currently making payments as I am on an income-based repayment plan- after this year, I'm pretty sure my income will be high enough that I will need to make payments/would like to start making payments anyway so that I'm not piling on more and more debt)

-Credit Card- $1859.25 @ 15.24% (aiming to pay this off as quickly as possible, but also considering opening a card with a 0% interest promotional rate and moving the balance over to give myself a little more wiggle room to get it paid down- advice on this appreciated as well)

Current income situation:

-Appointment-based work, previously as a contractor from July through December, but as of the first of this year on payroll. Hours vary and do not always reach full time status. Varies from $1300-1800 per month post-tax (but will increase as the year goes on and I add more clients).

-Part time job, just started at the end of December. Approximately 16 hours a week. ~$700 per month post-tax

personalfinance,0% interest credit card as a short term personal loan?,"I am a student in a professional program with a significant (6 figures) of student debt, almost all unsubsidized. I will be graduating this spring and starting my new, modestly paying job this summer. My expenses were much higher than expected and I needed some extra money to tide me over until graduation. I called up my credit card company and got a 0% interest rate applied for the next 12 months on new purchases. I am planning on putting most purchases on this card, then paying back the balance after I graduate/before the 17% interest kicks in. Is this an okay idea? Am I missing something where this is going to bite me in the future?

To answer some questions ahead of time: I was hoping to avoid taking out more student loans since my loans are unsubsidized, so they start accruing interest as soon as I take them out. I already have just under $100,000 in student loan debt. I could have taken some money out of my IRA, but that account is doing really well right now and I wanted to keep it intact and avoid the penalties. My parents/other family members are not able to assist me financially. This final year of my program is very time consuming and I had to quit my part time job (though I still take inconsistent gigs to make some money, but it is not reliable or significant). 

My expenses are quite low, I just needed a few thousand to get me through the next 5 months. I will still be making minimum payments to avoid fees. I recognize carrying a balance will hurt my credit score a bit, but I otherwise have excellent credit. I recognize that if I'm not able to pay it back within a year it'll seriously bite my ass. 

If I am missing anything else or anyone has additional advice I would be happy to hear it.

I put my spouses in, and my federal drops to a $2,200 return, and about $500 owed to state. I'm not sure exactly what she is claiming on her W-4, but I know its not more than a 1! 

Why the heck did our federal return drop, and our state shoot up?! Did the income push us into a new tax bracket at both the state and federal level?

personalfinance,Does a home with a mortgage provide a good ROI? And Should I pay extra premium or buy ETF?,"I was having a discussion with someone the other day and they were makings the argument that homes that carry mortgages typically have a negative ROI. He was arguing that home value typically under perform mortgage interest rates plus upkeep expenses. Case-Schiller Home Price Indices show that US national home prices increased in value an average of only 4.79% per year from 1975 until 2017 while US national 30 year fixed mortgage average was 8.18% and 15 year fixed mortgage was  during this same time. If the home value does not keep up with (or out pace) the mortgage being paid, then the average ROI would be negative. 
Thoughts?

Also, if I had an extra $2,500 per month should I pay extra on principle on my 30 year mortgage at 4% or invest in an ETF fund? I typically Vanguard funds.

Please note that it isn't a discussion about the merits or necessity of owning home, everybody needs a place to live, just curious about peoples views on the financial investment of home ownership especially because were always told that buying homes are good investments.",finance
investing,My reading of the Intelligent Investor [1/13/2018],"Two questions I've encountered reading the Intelligent Investor (revised ed. w/commentary by Buffett &amp; Zweig). (I'm sure many more will come.)

* On p. 24, Graham writes: ""Towards the end of 1971 it was possible to obtain 8% taxable interest on good medium term corporate bonds, and 5.7% tax-free on good state or municipal securities."" Can anyone tell me what the rate is now? Looking at [this summary](https://money.usnews.com/funds/mutual-funds/rankings/corporate-bond) shows that mutual fund products (which I realize are aggregators of the securities that Graham is referring to) range wildly between $BRASX (offering a roughly 2.6% return) and $VWESX (offering a roughly 10% return). Is the 8% figure on corporate bonds, therefore, still relatively accurate?

* On p. 63, Zweig comments that using an REIT can provide a ""defense against inflation"". Contrary to the popular belief of newly minted 2017 investors, the market does in fact fall. In addition, while probably unnoticed to many laypeople, the fed has already spurred the incipient crawl of increasing interest rates and recently announced they plan to do so again. While this inflation creep is certainly not approaching the historic highs described by Graham, just last week I could get a line of credit from Citi Bank with 21 months 0% APR. That offer, as of this writing, has disappeared. Certainly, I am not implying causality in my anecdotal, isolated case, but the relationship between interest rates, inflation and the health of the economy are well documented. My question is this: Does a long term investment in an REIT ETF or mutual fund have a place in the portfolio of a 20 year old investor who remains cautiously bullish in 2018 but is waiting for the other shoe to drop? Should I take steps to guard against inflation?",finance
personalfinance,In need of serious help with Student Loans,"Hello everyone. I'm the newest member of the ""Uneducated Past Decisions"" club who is now being punished by their past self for not understanding how to pay for college. I ended up more or less covering my entire first two years of college with two massive loans with stupid interest rates. I have a combined 4 loans, with interest rates ranging from 6.3-9.375% and a total debt of over 120,000 US dollars. I have tried to consolidate my loan, and even with my credit score in the high 600s and my cosigner with great credit as well I have been unable to find help. 

Firstly, I am from the state of New Hampshire and went to UNH with an in-state tuition. My payment is an adjusting payment, with a payment of over 1200 dollars right now. I am able to make this payment and save some money every month but as you can imagine this financial burden (which is completely my fault) is limiting my ability to grow in my life. I am entirely dependent on my parents in terms of my living situation and I cannot afford something such as a car payment on a decent vehicle. 

I have applied for a consolidation at 3 different credit unions, more banks than I can count and even sites like SOFI.com have turned me away, all citing the amount of the loan as an issue.

I don't know what to do. I'm at wits end and if a consolidation will only save me 100 bucks a month even that would be a big help. I don't even know if I'm in the correct subreddit for this question and am open and willing to listen to any advice anyone wants to give. Thanks for taking the time to read my plea for help.",finance
economy,Could the ‘Fair Tax’ Pay For Universal Healthcare?,"For those who don’t know what the ‘Fair Tax’ is, it is a new way the Government recieves funding with the Income, Coporate, Death Tax, etc. abolished. You would keep 100% of your paycheck and most likely recieve higher paychecks due to the Payroll tax be abolished aswell. This would also be the end for A LOT of Washington Lobbyists. The government would recieve money from products people buy. For example, if someone buys a $1 can of soda, under the fair tax the government will recieve 25% of that dollar which is 25 cents. This will allow everybody, including tourists &amp; illegals to pay taxes, this system would also allow the wealthiest americans pay their fair share, because wealthy americans buy really expensive things, such as a million dollar home or car. This will allow the Government to take in the same if not, more money than it does now so our education, military, and government programs would be here to stay.

Now having that said, nobody ever points out that the federal government spends about $1.4 trillion on healthcare a year, implementing Universal healthcare would cost roughly the same amount, so if the ‘Fair Tax’ was implemented today &amp; the government started to recieve the same or more money than it does now, could there ever be a time in America where you recieve 100% of your paycheck and have Universal Healthcare at the same time?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"XRB is hyped up vapourware and will never work as advertised. Don't buy into the pump scheme.. if you did, this could be your last change to get out without burning yourself.","XRB rai blocks has massive issues which will never get resolved. The developers have been making promises to resolve these node/exchange issues for almost a year now. The latest promise is that ""it will be resolved early next week"" but anyone who isn't blind to the obvious facts can wager that it will definitely not get resolved.  



This is the XRB [cryptopia](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6ttbbLWgAEr-4M.jpg) de-listing message, which also talks about these sync issues. This was almost a year back. The XRB shills want to pretend the cryptopia delisting was only due to death threats from third world captcha farmers, but the issues were simply because the coin has huge issues even back then.    


The Cryptopia node simply kept crashing and for days the coins were not accessible. The wallet on cryptopia exchange site said frozen for several days, and suddenly one day they would enable deposits and withdrawals, but in a couple of hours it would go down again. This kept happening time and again... people sent their coins to cryptopia, but they never arrived in the wallets. Withdrawals, same story, disabled. They tried reaching Cryptopia support who in their capacity also tried to fix this issue and get the wallets running, but again it would go down in next to no time. Rise and repeat. 



People were waiting for the withdrawals and deposits for weeks on end, and after a while even they got fed up with the lack of support. Then naturally, the blame game started and the accusations fell on Cryptopia. And ofcourse, some people reacted badly with death threats etc.. Cryptopia talks about of all these problems including death threats and network issues in their delisting message. It is not down only to ""Death threats"", but a chain of events culminating in the threats... 
  

  
Now fast forward 8-9 months since then, and what do you have? All exchanges are still not working. Bit Grail owner publicly stated he is being insulted, called a scammer, and he was given the twitter abuse by the community too, when all he did was say the truth that there are HUGE issues which are outside both his and developers control... Merca tox is down for god knows how many days, there is constant reports that Mercatox has scammed, pursue legal action, etc. At this point, from abuse and legal threats, to death threats... it is not a giant leap.. especially when people believe they are losing money.  



There is a major issue with the coin. It cannot be resolved in a suitable manner that will enable smooth functioning of exchanges. No exchange will be able to run seamlessly like they are supposed to, because of severe limitations of the network and nodes. When there is small 100k volume, this is not a problem, when the volume scales, this will always result in huge back log of support tickets, deposits not working, withdrawals not working, blame game, finally legal threats... the cycle goes on..  

There was a full cycle of these threats with Cryptopia and now very close to the legal/death threat phase of Merca tox and Bit Grail. If you read the XRB subs/twitter, many are abusing the owners of Bit Grail, someone wanted to visit Bit Grail office. They want to ""sue"" Merca Tox  

The ""great"" community.. even that can turn bad in no time, when money is involved.. You can never predict what people will do when they are waiting for several weeks for their coins. 
  

Its almost preposterous to think it would be any other way, but heck, coin went on KuCoin and same outcome. Surprise surprise. Notice how it is always blamed on the ""shitty"" exchanges alone by XRB shills.   


The same issues with Rai Exchange as well. Today Rai Exchange actually posted that **""they have troubles integrating Litecoin""** [Source](https://twitter.com/RaiExchange/status/952409741908733952).. Hahaha ... If they can't integrate Litecoin, how the bloody hell will they integrate XRB the exchange killer? 
  
It is obvious the whole episode this is nothing but an elaborate scheme played to pump the coin from #200 in CMC to #15...    



Anyone thinking Binance the biggest exchange is gonna touch this toxic coin is out of his mind. It won the vote, but actually listing it is a different matter altogether. Adding such a crappy coin will harm Binance's reputation; especially after seeing KuCoin suffer. Even if they actually list it, and the same issues happens once again, it will be obvious to everyone that there is huge flaws in the system. The whitepaper and technology is great, but if implementation is impossible then there is no hope. The value will come tumbling down. 


These issues were brought to the developers as early as March 2017. They cannot be fixed unless there are serious changes made to the concept of raiblocks. If there is no solution, all investors may be sitting on highly combustible vapour. You need to understand the history of this issue and for how long it has been happening, and can't simply brush it aside crucial issues unsolved for almost a year now as ""third world death threats""... or exchange issues which ""will be resolved"". 

If the developers were smart they will be on an island sipping their cocktails after the massive pump. No one has ever seen the lead developer, apart from his Linked In profile. He has never done any interview or even a video, outside of reddit AMAs. There is no reason to believe they have not pulled a Joost with their money (worth approx. $100m) after a successful hype driven pump campaign, instead of working on issues that cannot be resolved.      

  

Right now the coin has little bit of value left, if you are smart with your investments, you will know what to do.. If you can actually deposit that into an exchange, that is... 

  

If anyone tries informing their echo chamber subs about these issues, the posts get deleted faster than this coin's transaction times. Abuses get hurled along with the customary ""Thxn, just bought more"" Lol.. Those echo chambers actually believe this coin will ""replace Bitcoin"". They fail to realise that hundreds of coins have come and gone trying to replace bitcoin (each with a different tricky idea) while Bitcoin has not moved an inch from the top spot. This one and its toxic community of shills will learn a hard lesson not to buy every random reddit pumped coin especially when everyone else has done accumulating it.     




##Edit##

No XRB shill is able to answer any of the important questions as to why they have not resolved the basic exchange node issues for a whole year. All they reply is the plain old ""FUD"", or ""You must have missed out on the train"" or ""Must be butthurt"".. Lol. This XRB community is more toxic than even the BTC one, and thats saying something. Its like Verge 2.0 in here.

personalfinance,"Where should I put my Money? Student loan, retirement, or house?","Good Morning,

I'm looking for suggestions as to where I should concentrate my money, so that I am in the best situation going forward.

I am 25, I live in the Boston Area and earn 53k gross. I have my bachelors and master's degrees. My Undergraduate degree was free to me, and my masters was 26k, which I started paying off in August of 2016. My remaining student loan bill is $17,563. I am an educator, so I contribute 11% of each paycheck to my retirement (pension) fund. The top step on the payscale is 90k, I'm far from that as I'm in my second year of work, but I get a raise each school year. 

I live w/ my rents, so I pay no rent. My take home after taxes, union dues, and retirement is $1381.91 a pay period. That will go down in a few months when I turn 26 and have to pay for insurance. Insurance (health and dental) is about 250 a pay period. So, I am looking at 2200 take home a month. 

Expenses:
Car: 350/month (15k left) interest rate is 0.9 on a purchased new 16 Accord. (I'm aware this is cost/purchase is against PF's advice, but there were numerous reasons for this purchase). 
Gym: 20/month
Phone: 50/month
Netflix and Moviepass: 20 a month. (so about 560 dollars saved to do whatever with).

So this is where I need some advice. 
Right now I put 1200 a month towards the student loan. The rate is 5.9%. I've been putting the majority of my money towards this loan over the last 2 years. I started with 600 a month, then went to 1,000, and now I'm up to 1200. 

I have 7k in my checking, 2.5k in a credit union. 2k in savings bounds that have almost all matured (with the interest rate ranging from 4% for a handful, and the others are at 1.25 (or so).  

My credit card is fully paid off.

Should I be paying as much as I am towards my student loan? I am not making any more contributions to retirement other than the 11% I already do (I know the recommendation is at least 15%.)

I have excess money each month that I have just been keeping in my checking-account. On the last day of school each year I get paid for the summer (so 5 paychecks), so I am looking at a lump sum of about 6 grand when the school year is over.

My goal is to eventually to purchase a home (with the hope of either a 2 family, or a place where I can rent out a room for some added income.)   

Do I continue to pay as much as I have towards the loan? Is it better to do 600 towards the loan, and 600 in an account for my desire to purchase a house? Should I put money towards a 403b or Roth IRA?

Any thoughts are appreciated.",finance

I’m trying to help support her and would appreciate any advice.  I know topic like this come up a lot, but I thought I would list her particular situation.

$20000 - credit card defaulted last year and done nothing.
$20000 - credit card debt that had been consolidated at 25%interest! 27000 originally but 7 paid off.
$8000 - one card, paying minimum 18%
$8000- another card 18%
$11000- debt borrowed against through her retirement at 5%
$15000 - student loan debt secured 6%

This year she will make about $80000.
She say her take home is about $2600 per month. I’m guessing some loans are deducting month probably the one against her retirement.
She has about $26000 in retirement pension plan which can’t be touched because part of her pension.
Rent is $1000 and she has to eat, which are her main expenses. 

This is a new area for me because I have been fortunate not to be in debt. I have been reading about it here and other places but would really appreciate some advice about her particular situation.  

How to restructure/manage the debt, chapter 13 (don’t think she qualifies for 11), is her credit already shot due to the one default? Who would you recommend we contact to help navigate the situation? We live in New York

Bitcoin,Bitcoin or Bust?,"THE recent surge in the price of Bitcoins has created an unprecedented wave of interest in the cryptocurrency.
Once the domain of computer geeks and speculative investors, the meteoric rise in the price has forced Bitcoin into the public spotlight and it has become the hot topic of debate around the water coolers as well as in the bars, restaurants and hair salons.

Some dismiss it as a passing fad, a bubble waiting to burst and an elaborate Ponzi scheme, while others claim it the greatest innovation since the internet, the currency of the future and a great way to make quick money. Who is right and who is wrong?

Bitcoins are traded on a number of exchanges around the world and, as with any other market, whether it is oil, wheat futures, share options or the price of bagels in downtown Manhattan, the price is determined by supply and demand.

Some investment gurus such as Warren Buffett believe the hockey stick shape of the Bitcoin price cannot be explained by traditional supply and demand dynamics. The meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price has been caused by an investment frenzy triggered by the hype surrounding the cryptocurrency concept which has gripped the imagination of the public.

It has all the hallmarks of a speculative bubble which they believe could burst at any moment.
An investment bubble occurs when the price of a commodity rises way beyond the intrinsic value of the item. The sudden rise in price creates a lot of publicity and tales of instant wealth and overnight millionaires lure new investors into the market.

As the price continues to rise, the fear of missing out (the Fomo factor) attracts even more investors, driving prices up further. The cycle repeats itself until the price reaches a tipping point and the market collapses overnight.
There have been a number of well documented examples in the past, from the Tulip Mania that gripped the Dutch in the 17th Century to the tech boom in the late 1990s, the housing crash of 2006 and the commodities bust in 2009.

During the tech boom in the 1990s, for example, the share prices of web-based businesses reached astronomical proportions. Gripped by what the US Federal Reserve Board chairperson at the time, Alan Greenspan, called “irrational exuberance”, seasoned investors and regular consumers clambered to get a piece of the action and make a quick buck.

At the time, nobody really understood what the internet was, let alone what its long-term implications were, but this did not deter people from selling the proverbial farm and buying tech stocks at almost any price.
As share prices soared, some of the most obscure, and often unprofitable, internet based companies had market capitalizations in the millions and sometimes billions of dollars.

Despite some spectacular failures and the poor financial results published by those who managed to survive for longer than a year, the investment frenzy continued unabated. In early 2000, however, the market seemed to come to its senses. Prices began to decline and then started plummeting as panic swept through the market.
The tech market eventually collapsed, leaving many investors penniless and the world economy in a recession.

A number of investment gurus see many similarities between the tech boom and bust of the ’90s and the Bitcoin market at the moment.

At the current price level, Bitcoin has a market capitalization of over $200 billion, which is $70bn more than the value of General Electric and greater than the gross domestic product of some countries.

As Buffett put it in 2014: “The idea that (Bitcoin) has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view. Bitcoin is not backed by a company’s earnings or the strength of a government and rule of law. There’s also no interest or dividends.”

At the time Bitcoin was priced at about $600 and is now trading above $14 000, but he is sticking to his guns and in October 2017 stated that Bitcoin “is a real bubble”.

On the other side of the argument, there are those who believe that the internet and social media have created a new mindset in modern society which makes the concept of a global currency that cannot be controlled by any government an alluring concept that has caught the imagination of the public.

Anyone who owns Bitcoin achieves a degree of economic freedom which was not possible before. They can send value across the world without having to ask for permission from a bank or government body and Bitcoin cannot be taxed, controlled, destroyed or confiscated.

A central bank cannot print more Bitcoins to control the money supply and manipulate the price either. It is free from global recessions, government financial mismanagement and unfair taxpayer-funded bailouts.

This utopian view of an international currency free of interference by big government is the primary reason for the high value placed on Bitcoin by the public. Demand is being driven not by traditional investors, but by a wave of internet-savvy pundits who believe that Bitcoin will become the de facto method of payment in the future.
In a digital age we need a digital currency and the current price, they claim, reflects the future expectations of the market. The high prices are not a reflection of Bitcoin’s current value, they say, but rather its potential value.
Another factor driving up the Bitcoin price is the expectation that big financial players are set to wade into the market. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) recently introduced Bitcoin derivatives – a bet on the future value of the currency – which allows hedge funds to enter the market.

Some speculate that big players such as JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch could enter the market in 2018 and offer Bitcoin as part of a high-risk portfolio to clients. Once the large investment houses start buying Bitcoins, demand will skyrocket and the price will rise to even greater heights.

If Bitcoin fulfils its original purpose and becomes the medium of exchange on the internet and is accepted in more brick and mortar stores, the demand will rise even further. Bitcoin enthusiasts believe it is likely to fulfil that role and the high Bitcoin price indicates the market agrees.

The Bitcoin market, however, is still in its infancy and is extremely volatile as widely differing opinions about its future cause the price to fluctuate wildly.

Those who got in early are making huge returns on their investment and it may be tempting to jump on the bandwagon and get a slice of the action, but Bitcoin should still be considered a risky investment.

Some say Bitcoin is a solution looking for a problem. It could become the next global payment system, but it could just as easily fail or fall away. It would be wise to adopt a rational and cautious approach and as with any prudent investment strategy – only invest as much as you are willing to lose. 

**THREATS &amp; CHALLENGES**

BITCOIN faces a number of challenges which detractors believe could reduce demand in the short term and threaten its existence in the long term:

**Rising prices**

Ironically, Bitcoin’s is its own worst enemy. Rapidly rising prices are not a desirable feature of a currency. If someone believes the Bitcoin price is likely to rise and will be worth more in the future, they would be reluctant to spend it on something now. Its success undermines its usefulness. Some analysts believe that market volatility and continually rising prices will prevent Bitcoin from fulfilling its purpose as a global payment system.

**Security**

The blockchain itself is considered totally secure and virtually hack-proof. It has withstood intense scrutiny by mathematical and computer experts and to date there haven’t been attacks on the blockchain itself that has led to money being stolen.

Bitcoin’s biggest vulnerability is the integrity and security of the exchanges and wallet programs that store Bitcoins on behalf of users. Some have gone bust while others have suffered cyber-attacks in which hackers have made off with huge sums.

Further reports of successful cyber heists could shake investors’ confidence in the cryptocurrency, causing a sell-off and a sharp decline in its price.

**Speed**

The blockchain is spread over thousands of computers globally, which compete with each other to verify transactions. Although this is at the core of its security, it is a highly inefficient system and means Bitcoin can only process a handful of transactions a second.

Centralised payment processors, like Visa, process thousands of transactions a second, which makes it more attractive to large retailers as a payment system. Amazon, for example, processed
600 transactions a second during last year’s Amazon prime sale.

If even a fraction of their traffic decided to pay with cryptocurrency, consumers would be stuck for hours waiting for their transactions to be processed.

**Rival coins**

There are other cryptocurrencies already on the market which are a lot faster. Ripple, for example, can process 1500 transactions a second.

Bitcoin wields first-mover advantage, accounting for about 61% of the cryptocurrencies, but there is nothing to prevent any of the alternative coins from usurping Bitcoin.

Amazon is an innovative tech giant with huge clout in the internet industry and there are rumours they are looking into developing their own cryptocurrency, which could provide a serious challenge to Bitcoin.

**Power consumption**

Some experts believe an environmental crisis is looming if Bitcoin continues on its current trajectory. The complex computer algorithms that underpin Bitcoin require huge data centres that guzzle power.
One observer predicts that without a significant change in how transactions are processed, Bitcoin could be consuming enough electricity to power the US by the middle of 2019. Six months later, that demand could equal the entire world’s power consumption.

**Over-regulation**

Many countries worldwide are investigating Bitcoin and starting to recognise it as a realistic threat. Controlling the money supply is a vital economic and political lever which governments are reluctant to abdicate to a cryptocurrency.

Its anonymity and lack of central control, however, makes it difficult to control and it seems that in the short term their only course of action is to regulate it out of existence.

Oct '16 my child's mom passed, not going to reiterate it, it's in my post history for details, but TL;DR: We were divorced with joint custody and myself having primary residential.  She was not remarried and our child was her only.  Anyway, I've successfully completed the application for child's survivor benefits and receiver our first payment / retro pay.

&amp;nbsp;

So I realize that every year I need to submit a high level expense sheet and that's fine.  I've been trying to gather as much info about the usage of the benefits as possible...  

&amp;nbsp;

I found this doc on the [SS website](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10076.pdf) 

&gt; First, you must take care of the beneficiary’s day-to-day
&gt; needs for food and shelter. Then, you must use the
&gt; money for the beneficiary’s medical and dental care
&gt; that’s not covered by health insurance. You can also pay
&gt; for the beneficiary’s personal needs, such as clothing
&gt; and recreation. You must save any money left after
&gt; you pay for the beneficiary’s needs, preferably in an
&gt; interest-bearing account or U.S. Savings Bonds.

and also 

&gt; In certain instances, the Social Security Administration
&gt; will pay past-due benefits all at once in a lump sum, which
&gt; may be a large amount. First, you must spend the money
&gt; on the beneficiary’s current needs such as rent and a
&gt; security deposit, food, or furnishings. After paying these
&gt; expenses, you may spend the money to improve the
&gt; beneficiary’s daily living conditions or for better medical
&gt; care. Spend the money wisely. You should use the money
&gt; in the beneficiary’s best interests. Then, if there’s money 
&gt; left over, you must save it, preferably in U.S. Savings
&gt; Bonds or an interest-paying bank account, insured under
&gt; either federal or state law.

&amp;nbsp;

Examples of my plan for this money:

* School after-care payment
* Summer camp payments
* Therapy copayments / pre-deductible payments (Both family and child's individual)
* Refurnishing his bedroom

&amp;nbsp;

However things I have been reading show that there's a LOT more grey area to this.. for instance I was reading on another forum that some have taking the **housing cost** + **utilities** and dividing it by the number of people to find out the share to deduct from the benefits payments... That feels a bit wrong to me since child was living with me prior and a 1/3 of our mortgage and utilities would be a significant chunk of the monthly benefit...

&amp;nbsp;

One thing that I am wondering, is we were planning on taking a Disney vacation before everything went down, and I am wondering if as a one time cost, we could use the benefit to cover say their plane ticket and misc expenses on location?  To me that doesn't seem shady or a dishonest use of the money and SS even mentions recreation (quoted above)

&amp;nbsp;

Bonus Question: We're planning on converting our walk in attic to bedroom / loft / half-bath and moving child into it, they're 8 and definitely begging to have some more space and move out of their tiny bedroom.  The benefits specifically mention furnishing their space, so when we buy a new bed and such that's fine, but I wonder if it would be ok to use some of the funds to help with the renovations of that space.  Again, SS mentions using the benefit to improve the child's living condition and this would be huge for them...  Besides the ss benefits, they're also getting a considerable life insurance benefit (college will be taken care of and plenty more to spare) which is paid directly to them (with myself as the custodial) and a pension and retirement account that I'm rolling over into Custodial Inherited IRA (for their much further away future), Mom worked for a municipality.  Maybe this would be a better and more valid use of the life insurance?  I'm just not sure what's both *legally* and *morally* responsible.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm honestly really not sure what to do, and I'm looking to get some feedback on people who have being receiving these payments and how their experience with expensing things and what they've expensed has been.  Or any advice in general dealing with situations like this.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks,
Rich

I didn’t have an established credit so they gave me a 22% interest rate and my monthly payment is about 400 for 66 months and they offered me about 6 months to refinance and lower it. 3 months later I looked over my paper work and I see my total price after all payments go through is about 30k... how? I mean I can still pay and I’m sure I’ll be able to save up enough to pay the 12k in less than a year but I don’t understand how it got up to 30k.. should I wait for my refinance and see the total sale price go down or should I find a credit union to pay the whole 30k.. If I somehow get 15k before 66 months would they get rid of the other 15k? I do love my corolla and i am happy with what I have.

No it isn't, and even if it does, it will be years and years before places like Coinbase and other exchanges switch over to lightning addresses, so please for the love of Satoshi... get over it already...

personalfinance,"General advice, and what to do with tax refund?","I'm 29F and returned to school this past year, pursuing a BS in Computer Science. Estimated graduation date is May 2019, and at the latest December 2019. 

Right now, I am working full-time while going to school. I plan to do this at least until the end of the summer. I'll explain my income and budget, and then ask for advice about my tax refund. I live in one of the most expensive cities in the US, so the numbers here are reflect that. Please feel free to give any thoughts or advice that you can think of! 

At the end of 2017, I finished paying off $8K in credit card debt and am now consumer debt free. Before that, the additional income beyond core expenses was being thrown at my debt. I've learned a ton about personal finance in the last year, but I feel behind in many ways, so advice is appreciated.

I base my budget on a 4-week schedule, and every few months when there is an extra pay period, I put everything in savings apart from essential expenses like food. That is not reflected in these numbers. 

**Income**: Bringing home $5,344 every 4 weeks.  

**Budget:**

* Rent and utilities: $1520
* Groceries and coffee: $326
* Dog care: $30
* Gym membership: $99
* Netflix and Spotify: $19
* Self-care (hair cuts, medication, doctors appts): $120
* Electronics replacement fund: $80
* Clothes fund: $80
* Travel fund: $320 (will stop in June and going forward put the funds toward general savings)
* Social activities: $200
* General Savings: $2544 
* Health insurance (medical, dental, vision) is paid for in full by my employer. 

**Student loans:** Currently, all of my loans are subsidized US federal loans (Direct Sub Stafford) that are in deferment until 6 months post-graduation. I hope to be able to use the same loans for the rest of my education, and will try to bankroll whatever I cannot finance through subsidized loans. 

*Current balance:* $9227

*Anticipated future loans:* $11,000

**Current finances:**

My starter emergency fund currently has $1500. I also have $4000 in a Roth IRA, which I know is unfortunately low for my age. My plan is to save aggressively until I have a fully-funded emergency fund (~$12k), and then divide the rest of the savings between my Roth IRA (no option for a 401k with my current employer) and a savings cushion. 

Ideally, I want the flexibility to quit or cut back on work and focus on school for my senior year if possible. I plan to work full-time as long as I can while going to school, but school is my priority. If I chose to do that, I would leave the city I currently live in and move somewhere with a total cost of living under $1000/mo. I would use the savings cushion to fund it.

**What to do with this money:** 

I have almost completed my taxes for 2017, and it looks like I will be receiving a refund of about $3200. What should I do with this money? Bulk up my emergency fund? Pay toward the student loans? 

Likewise, I have $1500 tied up in a secured credit card from years ago that I plan to get back one way or another this year, now that my credit is in the 720s. 

My initial gut feeling was to use the tax refund and secured credit card funds to pay toward the student loans. However, since I won't be paying interest until 6 months post-graduation, would the money be better purposed in a high-interest savings account until then? 

Would appreciate any and all advice and insight. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Help prioritizing loans vs. retirement vs. down payment,"I'm 27, married and a doctor currently in residency training. My wife and I make a combined gross income of ~$100k (me $60k, her $40k). No kids at this point. We have $45k in federal student loans at an average of 6% (individual loan rates vary between 3.4-6.8%).

My goal in the next ~6 years is to pay off the loans, start aggressively investing for retirement (would like the option of retiring in my 40s) and take out a mortgage (prob. $400-500k home).

My salary will be ~$60k for the next 4 years and then will bump to ~$300k gross once I'm done with my training.

Regarding the home, if I want to put down 20% to avoid PMI, that means I need to save ~$100k.

Regarding retirement accounts, I'm tempted to put  $11.5k/yr into Roths for my wife and I while our tax rate is still low.

Regarding the loans, it's very tempting to put all my money into paying my $30k in 6.8% loans since it's a guaranteed return!

I know I will eventually be able to meet these goals no matter what order I tackled them in -- especially once my salary increases significantly -- but what is the most efficient way to approach this?

Currently I'm thinking:
1) Max out Roth for my wife and I -- won't get this opportunity in the future.
2) Put any spare money after that into the 6.8% loans
3) Start saving up $100k down payment after 6.8% loans are paid
4) Pay rest of loans (3.4-5.4%)

personalfinance,"Credit card company autopay stopped, now have overdue payment on credit report","I have a Visa card through a credit union that, when I use it, I tend to keep a balance on it for a few months (the interest rate is ridiculously low), then I'll eventually pay it all off at once. In the mean time, I have autopay setup so it takes the minimum payment (~$20) out of my bank account each month so I never have to worry. 

It's been working like this for 8 years or so... never a problem. I got a notification today though that there was a change posted to my credit report, which turned out to be a ""30 day late"" hit. I tracked down the account and saw that the autopayment is now turned off, with the last autopayment being 11/2. I very rarely use the credit union account (where the money is pulled from) or the credit card, so I didn't notice.

I'm pretty pissed that this is on my credit report now. First outright negative thing I've ever had on there. I never received a phone call, never received a letter, just the exact same email that I get every month ""Your statement is ready and can be viewed at ____"".

Is there a chance I can get this removed from my credit report? The balance I can pay in full immediately (~$400), and I'll happily put this card out of commission. I'd rather not spend the next 7 years angry about this though if it can be avoided.",finance

hardware,"Downsized from NZXT H440 to an NZXT H200i, wanted to report on temps and noise for those looking into similar changes","This isn't the most scientific test, but I wanted to report my findings to help those considering this case or similar cases.

Common Setup:

* Intel Core i7-7700k @ stock
* Cryorig H7 CPU Cooler (yes, it fits just fine in the H200i)
* G.SKILL 2x8GB DDR4-3000 CL 15
* EVGA Z270 Stinger Motherboard
* EVGA GTX 1060 SSC (dual-fan), not overclocked beyond how EVGA configured it
* EVGA G2-650 PSU
* Dell U2717D 2560x1440 60hz display, no G-Sync support

As I'm typing this out, I'm beginning to realize that I might have an EVGA obsession...(note to EVGA, start selling RAM outside of Microcenter!)

What's different:

NXZT H440 - https://www.nzxt.com/products/h440-white

* I used the standard fan configuration
* 3x120mm front intake
* 1x140mm rear exhaust
* All connected to the ""PWM"" (not really) fan hub included with the case, so the fans were actually controlled by the CPU fan header and ramped up when the CPU fan did. This made them louder than necessary. If I had kept this case, I would have replaced the fans with PWM alternatives and run them separately via the motherboard.

NZXT H200i - https://www.nzxt.com/products/h200i-matte-white

* Removed the top 120mm fan because the Z270 Stinger's 8-pin connector placement blocks this by &lt; 1mm. It's that close.
* Replaced the rear 120mm as it was DC only, and the Z270 Stinger doesn't support DC operation, PWM only. Replaced with Cryorig QF120 Silent PWM.
* Placed 2x140mm Cryorig QF140 Silent PWM for front intake (stock configuration is no intake, place your radiator here).
* Z270 Stinger ""Smart"" control isn't so smart, so I set the chassis fans at 40% fixed (~600RPM). Testing from 40% to 100% netted a 1-2°C difference, but a TON of extra noise. At 40%, they are nearly silent.

In both configurations, the PC case was sitting to my right, at head level (resting on my desk), about 3 feet from my head. So, I'm highly sensitive to fan noise and more concerned with silent operation even if temperatures go up.

I made up two tests here for what I considered to be both consistent and close to real-world. First, let's look at Forza Horizon 3. I run this at Dynamic Render High with Motion Blur off and V-Sync on. This gives me a locked 60fps (VERY rare dips into the high 50s) and a good load on both the CPU and the GPU. Running at Ultra on the preset introduces FXAA, making it look worse. And removing Adaptive and using the advanced settings means my GPU can't run Ultra at a locked 60fps (what idiot thought it was good to use MSAA at medium and high, but FXAA at Ultra!?). I observed these readings towards the end of the Goliath Circuit, which gave the system plenty of time to warm up.

**CPU:**

* H440 - ran at 50-54°C during gaming, 58° during initial loading that basically loads all 8 threads.
* H200i - ran at 48-52°C during gaming, 58° during initial loading that basically loads all 8 threads.

**GPU:**

* H440 - Fluctuations between 57°C and 66°C during gaming. Fan RPM is comfortably below 1000 RPMs and noise is not a factor.
* H200i - Fluctuations between 58°C and 68°C during gaming. Fan RPM is comfortably below 1000 RPMs and noise is not a factor.

So, what's going on here? The H440, despite being a larger size with more volume is known for being air starved on the intake. The H200i has a better front intake. Essentially, the air travelling to the CPU fares better on the H200i because it has less resistance in its path. On the H440, the air in this path goes through 2x120mm fans (but these are starved), to a 120mm CPU fan, through the heatsink, then out the rear via 140mm exhaust. For the H200i, this path starts with an unstarved 140mm, through the same 120mm and heatsink, then exhausted out the rear via a slower spinning 120mm. For this setup, the H200i had better intake, and the H440 had better exhaust. The H200i was quieter and ran at marginally lower temps. I'll take it.

As for the GPU, that's where things are different. In the H440, the GPU has a lot of open air beneath it, being fed directly by a front 120mm intake (though this is starved). On the H200i, the GPU isn only partially being fed by a front 140mm. While not starved, the GPU fans are largely obstructed. Between this being a 120W (max) GPU, Nvidia's excellent power management, and me running V-Sync, this GPU is rarely being pushed to its limit. Let's change that.

World of Warcraft is a game that isn't known for being a GPU hog. However, you can seriously push a GPU if you test in the following.

* Vsync off
* Frame limit off
* Max graphics settings (10, removes CPU limit)
* At least 2xMSAA
* Set NVCP Power Management to Maximum Performance
* Run a level 3 garrison for consistency (no other players enter here without your permission)

This isn't a test for performance, but to see worst case temps and noise. It will peg the GPU at 100% load and, in my prior tests with an RX 480, it pushed the card to much higher power draw than Unigine ever could. Let's see what it does here.

**H440:**

* 72°C
* ~1200 RPM

**H200i:**

* 78°C
* ~1600 RPM

And here's where that fan obstruction sets in. We get noticeably higher temps and more noise. And this is with a 120W card. It's going to be worse for those of you with 1070s, 1080s, and higher, where you're pushing 150-200W (or more!). Or, if I were to switch to a higher refresh rate monitor capable of G-Sync, I won't have 60hz + V-Sync artificially limiting my GPU and sparing me from temps and noise. The GPU would always run at 100% load except in cases where the CPU becomes the limit.

If I upgrade to Volta/Ampere this summer or fall, I need to either go with the x60 model again, or if I really want an x70/x80, consider a hybrid version or a hybrid kit (like the Kraken G12). This case will likely not fare well with a higher-end GPU (temps might be in the high 70s/low 80s, but high fan speed will annoy me). And no, a blower fan isn't the solution here. A blower fan benefits you when you want the air exhausted out of the case, not circulating within it due to bad overall case airflow. That's not the problem with the H200i. The problem here is GPU fan obstruction. With a blower style, you get 1 tiny fan obstructed and literally screaming to keep up, vs. 2 fans partially obstructed with a circulation style cooler.

**Amended Conclusion (edited for clarity):**

The airflow for the CPU is very good (especially if you can fit the top 120mm fan in there). Using an i7-7700k (admittedly, at stock settings) with the $30 Cryorig H7 as the cooler, it's not loud at any time.

As for a GPU, the system is also quiet when using a low-wattage GPU, further bolstered by gaming with V-Sync on (prevents GPU from hitting 100% usage most of the time). But gamers who unlock their framerate and/or user higher wattage GPUs likely have cause for concern. A hybrid cooled GPU (if they have a 120mm rad), or a Kraken G12 + 120mm AIO may be a better fit. This is due to the fact that airflow to the GPU is seriously obstructed by the PSU and shroud.",technology

personalfinance,How can I get on top of my financial problems? I am debating a 401k loan or filing for bankruptcy.,"Hello.  I am 30 years old and have had some unfortunate circumstances and bad decisions make me land in a less than (ok very less than) ideal financial situation.  I am trying to get a handle on my debt and budget, and would like some advice please.  This is a throwaway account, to protect me personally, and I have lurked here a bit and been on reddit for 4 years now.  First I will outline my income and what I pay each month and what debts I have.  Then throw out some ideas I have to help.  Please be as honest and brutal as you must, I really can not live like this anymore.



I made $23/hr last year and that is the income I will be working with right now.  I did receive a raise to $25/hr but it has not kicked in yet, so I don't know what my new ""take home"" pay will be.  I also work a good bit of overtime and get paid time and a half for it, but it is never guaranteed so I didn't include it here.  I bring home ~$1300 bi-weekly, which technically comes to ~$2816 a month, but because I am living paycheck to paycheck now, it's more like $2600 a month since most months have 2 paychecks.  So, lets go with $2600 a month for simplicity. I will also be rounding up to the nearest dollar on my bills/debt for simplicity.



$875 - Rent (This is a little high for the city, but is in a very good neighborhood and I am unable to move)

$176 - Truck Payment (outstanding balance of $3343)

$130 - Sprint

$5 - GoodBudget App (I have been using this ap for several years now and I really like the envelope system it uses.  I would be open to free apps that do the same thing, but I haven't found one that I like)

$25 - Home Depot CC (This is a min. payment each month.  This card only has my washer/dryer that I bought when I moved into my current house.  It is no interest until Dec 2018 and the outstanding balance is $1082)

$194 - Progressive (This one is a killer right now, I live in MI with no-fault insurance, have to have full coverage, and have a 1 year old speeding ticket.  I shopped around at other places the past couple months and this is the lowest available.)

$45 - Comcast (I have haggled with them on the phone several times, this is the lowest rate I can get as of last week, internet is a must-have for my job)

$61 - Student loan (Outstanding balance of $590 with an interest rate of 4.8%..sooooo close)

$280 - Lending Cliub (personal loan I got a couple years ago when I tried to consolidate my CC debt, but then they just got filled again.  I know, bad decisions, trying to learn.  Outstanding balance of $7604 with an interest rate of 12.29%)

$93-260 - Electric (This is the range over the past year.  They have a ""budget plan"" where you pay the same every month, but it tells me the bill would be $281, which is higher than any month has been for the past year.)

$250 - Walmart CC (Ugh I know, this is my shame.  This card is maxed on a regular basis.  I pay the min. every month and some months I use what is left because I literally run out of money.  Another bad decision.  Outstanding Balance $8152 with an interest rate of 23.9%)

$10 - Netflix (This is my only form of TV or entertainment, I cut out Pandora, Amazon Prime, and Movie Pass already.)

$45 - Capital One CC (This is the min. payment, this card is also maxed.  Outstanding Balance of $1974 with an interest rate of 16.15%)

$71 - Discover CC (This is the min. payment, this card is also maxed.  Outstanding Balance of $3465 with an interest rate of 16.24%)

$81/3 months - Garbage (This is the standard pick up price for garbage and is only due every 3 months.  The plan is to save out $27 every month, but I usually can't/don't.)


That is everything I pay on a monthly basis.  I also have 2 other credit cards.  One is for Catherine's clothing store, it is empty and I have only used it twice, paying in full both times.  You can use the card and pay the balance right there in the store at the same time, so I use it for discounts.  The other is a CareCredit Card for my pets medical emergencies.  This one is super handy, you can charge vet bills to it and anything over $200 is interest free for 6-24 months depending on amount.  It is also currently empty and I have always been able to pay it off before interest started on it.


I rent, as you can see above, and I have a loan on my truck, so I don't really have any assets there.  I do also own a convertible that I ""bought"" from my boyfriend's mom.  I was supposed to pay her monthly, but then I moved and couldn't afford to anymore. 
 The bumper fell off and needs fixed, but I can't afford to insure it anyways, so it just sits in the garage.  The plan is to fix it up in the Spring and sell it.  His mom says I can keep the money and not worry about paying her back right now.


My 401K has $16,533 in it and when I panicked after only having $21 to live off of for the next 2 weeks I looked into taking out a loan through it.  I could borrow up to $8266 with an interest rate of 5.5% and a payment of $73.29 bi-weekly for 5 years.  I know these loans are like a last resort thing and frowned upon, but I am kind of grabbing at straws now.


I also tried to apply for several credit cards about 5 or 6 months ago that had 0 interest and 0 fees for balance transfers, but I was denied by all because of my income to debt ratio.  My credit score isn't that bad, at 705, but the ratio is horrible.


The only other thing I can think of is bankruptcy.  I don't know much about it though....and it just seems like WAY big and scary.


Please help me in any way you can.

EDIT2: Yes the CC Debt was a huge spending issue that is now resolved by living nearer to family and not having to spend. It was mostly from doing 7-10 hour drives every few weeks to deal with family issues and living out of hotels and eating out while on these trips.
The insane spending has stopped cuz I moved closer to family (which happened along with a change in my job as well) which has caused another issues in that the cost of living here is WAY more expensive than before, literally every bill went up by over $100 after moving.

Edit 3:  I forgot to mention some bills, as the comments brought up and wanted to clarify some of that.  

Medical:  I have 2 outstanding medical bills.  One for $95 that was just sent to collections and I actually need to call them tomorrow to figure out a payment plan.  The other is for $300 for medical supplies that I need to go discuss with the company as the supplies were not correct.  I also have 2 prescriptions that I need to re-fill every 3 months, which comes to $40 every 3 months.  

Food:  This is something I have been terrible at keeping track of, which is the main reason I didn't list it.  Basically I have been buying what I need as I need it.  Again, this has been one of my bad decisions that I recognize and need to change.

Gas: Same as food, bought what I needed when I needed it, and if I didn't have the money it went on a CC.

Right now it looks like I don't need to file bankruptcy, and I won't be taking out the 401k loan.  I am going to look into the cell phone plan and try to change it maybe or get a new service.  I'm not sure where I will be going with that since I am paying for my phone monthly and may be stuck for the moment.

As for the roommate suggestions....I will think about it. 

Second/part time job suggestions....also something I have debated doing before.  This is difficult however because my current job can be very demanding randomly and I could go from working 40 hours to 80 to 50 to 40 to 60 from week to week.  It is not predictable what my hours will be, so scheduling a second job around that would be troublesome.  I am also currently applying and looking into going back to college, which will take up all the extra time I will have.  However, I do participate in craft shows with a friend and sell some items there and on Etsy that brings in some very minimal income.  I did really well over the holidays on Etsy, but haven't sold a single item since Christmas.  From now on that income will go straight to debt.",finance

personalfinance,Part time 27 year old with $7000 in credit card debt. Interest rates on my credit card is keeping from ever getting out of debt right now. What options do I have?,"Interest rates on my credit card is 28%. A LARGE portion of each of my check goes to making payments to this card but with the interest charges each month I budgeted and itll take me decades to pay it off and cost me thousands. I was in a tough spot, jobless, homeless, and had to rely on the card but now I need to find options on how to pay it off or get a lower interest rate. I have heard of those advertisements about taking out a personal loan with a lower rate and using that to pay off the card then just paying the personal loan off, are those viable options?

What is my best option right now, these interest rate charges are killing me and I can barely make ends meet.

Any advice would be deeply appreciated",finance
personalfinance,Trying to set up a financial plan for myself; am active duty military. Please help.,"Active duty Marine here, been in about 6 months and about to hit my unit. I am trying to figure out a personal financial plan for myself.

My overall goal is to pack away as much money as possible, and even build some through investing(which I know little about). I don’t plan on re-enlisting, but going to a four year after my contract is up. The college is like to attend also has the yellow ribbon program, so anything the Post 9/11 GI Bill doesn’t cover, the school will. 

Currently, I’m getting paid about 650 a paycheck, and putting 200 of that into savings. The rest goes into my checking, but I never spend all of it. And often move excess money I don’t spend into my savings. My only bills right now is Spotify premium and my phone bill.

Once I hit my unit I will be switching to Navy Fed, and will set up a TSP. How much should I put into my TSP? What other realistic investment options can I use to make a little more money?

Also, how should I configure my finances and pay when I deploy? How does my current plan look? 

Thank you for any and all info.",finance

personalfinance,Am I on the right track?,"I'm 27, my husband is 28. I'm just starting to dig into retirement planning and investing, though I'm still extremely confused by it all. My husband has even less of a client an I do. I have about getting a financial planner at our local Edwards Jones. But the thought of someone else handling my money doesn't sit very well with me. I know lots of people do it, but I'm not sure if I could just hand over my money. So I thought I'd ask for your advice. I love reading through all of the posts on this subreddit. There is always fantastic information being shared.

My yearly salary is $83k, expected to increase to $85k in March. My husband recently got new job and will be making approximately $120k this year. Previously, he made about $80k. 

My retirement funds: 
1) Merrill Lynch - $12,000 in 2055 target retirement fund. Currently matching employer contribution at 6% in traditional 401k.
2) HSA - $1600 in Vangaurd SP500 (plus $1000 in ""cash"" account). Maxing out at $3450 for 2018
3) Vangaurd - $39,000 in 2055 target retirement fund. No longer contributing, from a former employer I left in December 2016 

My husband's retirement funds: none

Debts: 2 car loans with 21k and 32k, monthly payments of about $450 each. The interest rates for these aren't bad: 3.2% and 2.8%. Mortgage is $168k at a monthly payment of $1350. I paid off the last of my student loans last month, my husband owes around 20k (I don't know the exact interest rates, but I'm assuming there between 5% and 8%). No outstanding CC debt (monthly usage is around $1500 which is paid in full every month).

Our number 1 goal this year it to pay off most, of our debts: the student loans and both car loans. I'll be getting a bonus at work of about $8k, before taxes, in March. I'll put this directly towards the 20k car loan. My husband will be working to first pay off student loans, then switch to the 32k car loan. 

My questions:

My husband's work doesn't offer any sort of 401k or retirement plan. I've told him he should open a Vangaurd account and start putting money in ASAP. However, I'm not sure how much money he could put in. Should be be putting in a percentage of his salary, or just a certain amount. Is there a ""maximum"" he can contribute,a like the $18.5k with a 401k? With salaries this year, we don't qualify for a Roth IRA. 

Should I be putting more into my 401k? I am thinking about increasing my contribution to 10%. Should I do more, or wait until my other debt is paid off? 

I have the option of moving my 401k contributions into a Roth 401k. Is this a good idea? We have no idea what our income will be after retirement. My husband plans on becoming a research professor, so his income could continue for many years after retirement. I think if I move my contributions to a Roth 401k (say 10%), my employer's contributions (6%) would still remain pre-tax. Is that correct?

personalfinance,Leaving federal job - TSP allocation,"Hello, I am currently early 30's and leaving my federal position to return to school for an accelerated program. Family will be supporting me, so bills shouldn't be a worry. Family has paid for the first semester cash, but I may be looking at upwards of $30k in tuition, fees and books for the remainder. I have a home equity line of credit for $28k at 3.5% that hasn't been touched yet in lieu of private student loans due to the better rate and repayment terms.

The question I have is that I have a TSP retirement with the government at approximately $26k. I'm not sure how to handle this money. Am I able to leave it in the TSP? Do I need to roll it over to a private account? Would it be wise to take the tax hit to pay for the outstanding tuition to avoid paying any interest?

Right now I have a large amount of money sitting in my checking account (over $150,000).  That account pays an interest rate of something like 0.01%, so I know I should move most of it somewhere else.  But I have no idea what to do.

This money might become a down payment on a house in a couple of years, so I think I want to keep it somewhat liquid.  The options I'm considering are:

1) Buy a CD or open a savings account at my bank.

2) Buy a CD or open a savings account with an online bank such as Marcus.  The rates are higher here than at my bank, but I don't know much about online banks.

3) Invest the money with vanguard in some kind of index fund, or bond fund, or something like that.

personalfinance,Wife came clean about major credit debt...trying not to panic. What should I do?,"Throwaway account because reasons.  I'll try to include as much info as possible:  I'm 38 and she is 37 and live in GA.  I'm a police supervisor and make around $72k a year.  She is a restaurant manager and makes roughly $135k a year.  Her base pay is around $80k and she bonuses each quarter to make up the rest.  We have 2 very young children.  Our home is new (3 years) and mortgage is $2k per month.  Bought it for $285k and comps in the same neighborhood are going for $330+k not including major upgrades we've done (finished basement w/ kitchen and in-law suite, double size/screened deck, interior mods, etc).  We also own a rental home work approx. $135k with 9 years left on the mortgage.  Renting it out covers the mortgage and leaves just a little left over that goes in a separate account to cover any expenses that might pop up.

She hates her job and so do I.  She routinely works 60+ hours per week with wildly varying schedules.  She can go days without seeing the kids and it's taking a toll on all of us.  I'm confident we could live just off something comparable to her base pay if she could find a job with a more stable schedule.  My mother retired and moved in to the finished basement from out of state to help us watch the kids because of our work schedules (I work 12hr shifts and overnight with rotating days on/off).  We have one car that's paid off and another we pay $425 per month on.  She came home from work upset and we talked about her quitting again and she told me she's financially bound to the job because of some credit debt I'm not aware of.  For context she's done this before and to be honest it's my fault I didn't catch it.  We used to fight about money and so I chose to bury my head in the sand and trust she wasn't doing this anymore.  I never looked because I didn't want to fight.  I'll never make this mistake again.

Tonight she broke down and said she wanted to come clean.  Holy shit.  I'm staring at roughly $51k in credit cards and another $19k in a loan.  I want to vomit.  I knew we had some credit card debt.  But Jesus Christ.  Trying not to panic I had her break everything down and give me log in info for each account.  So, I need advice.  If taxes are anything like last year (which they should be) I should get back around $12k.  She is going to ride this job out until at least March when she hits her annual bonus and that should be around $15k after taxes.  I have the ability to work ""extra jobs"", sometimes paid in cash, making $35-50 per hour depending on the job.  I never work these because up until now my time with the kids was the most valuable thing to me.

My plan is to find out the interest rate on each card and contact them and ask for a reduced rate (never hurts to ask right?).  I figured to pay off the smallest balance cards first and keep chipping away until I get to the big ones.  She has auto pay set up from the checking account with a couple hundred going to each card.  I want to pay the minimum on everything except the one I'm focusing on and try to knock it out, then reallocate all that money on to the next one.  She has already looked at non-profit debt consolidation services that have said they can lower our interest rates and the payment they gave us would be less than we are paying to the individual cards now.  I just get a shady feeling from these companies.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Is this a good option?  What reputable companies do this?  Is there anything else I can do?  I know I could sell my rental and be debt free but that house is part of our retirement plans.  I can retire in 12 years with a pension but will likely stay longer due to my kids being so young.  The rental house will be paid off my then and making us a decent monthly income.  She has a private 401k.  I have a pension, a deferred comp, roth IRA, and a couple other monthly payouts that will be coming in when I'm ready to go.  Ideally I want to leave all the retirement items alone.  

She admits to compulsive shopping as a means of dealing with her stress.  She's already looked at counseling to help deal with this.  I'll probably need counseling to deal with this too.

personalfinance,A credit card question?,"Hi all, I have a discover IT student card and had a few questions about it.

The card agreement only lists certain kinds of information like fees and due dates, which is fine, and I completely understand pretty much all of it but it doesn't answer certain kinds of ""common sense"" or ""general"" questions. I pretty much just want confirmation that this is indeed how a typical card works

1) What happens if you don't keep a balance on the card for a certain month or months? Are there generally fees? Do they cancel the card?

2) What are cash back rewards and how do they work? I'm pretty sure with the Discover IT card it's actual cash that I get back but how does this show up? Is it just more money towards my credit limit or do they put money in an account that I choose?

3) Can you pay off your card before the due date? If you do this, and charge more to the card, can you pay it again before the due date? Given this, is it just better to wait until the due date to pay the full card's balance rather than in increments?

4) How quickly should I expect my credit score to raise after a month? A few months? etc...

5) Advice?

CryptoCurrency,"Raiblocks Might Be Centralized By Banks In Future - No Evidence, Just Human Nature","Hi everyone, 

Raiblocks is a fantastic innovation, it solves the scalability issue and the speed of transactions. Unfortunately, Raiblocks will suffer the same fate as Bitcoin. Which is it will be hijacked by people who work for banks.

Bitcoin was hijacked by Blockstream in 2015. Blockstream kicked out Gavin Andreson so they can control and be Bitcoin core developers. They created the problem of high transaction fees and slow transactions by not increasing block sizes, and other solutions which will favor decentralization. Instead, they're brainwashing all of us into thinking that the lightning network is the only solution. What they don't tell us is that their ultimate goal is for all hubs in the lightning network will eventually be owned by banks. This means the lightning network will centralize transactions, even though at first anyone can own a hub. Please see this video for a good explanation https://youtu.be/UYHFrf5ci_g

Below is a good Reddit post about who is really behind blockstream https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d8pjq/blockstream_is_funded_by_the_bankers_that_bitcoin/?utm_source=reddit-android

This definitely sounds like a conspiracy theory, and will put many people off. To some of you who reads into this, I hope this message will eventually reach the creators and core people of Raiblocks. I hope Raiblocks doesn't get hijacked by a small group of people who always want to monopolize a system we all depend on. These groups of people always start of by helping, and contribute positively. But later kick people out of the project that they can't control. 

Most of us know that the US Federal Reserve is privately owned by the banks. Meaning banks profit from all of us. Banks also want to profit from Bitcoin, and any other cryptocurreny that will go mainstream. Raiblocks is most probably the target, and I hope the hijacking hasn't started yet.

personalfinance,Feeling like going back to school to finish my degree was a bad idea. $82.5k in student loan debt (with my husband having another $13k on top of that) and feeling like I'm never going to have it paid off.,"Hi, all. Apologies in advance for my lack of knowledge about the subject but that's why I'm coming to you all to find some help. 

I've been somewhat of a serial under-committer when it came to secondary education. Over the course of my 20s I dropped out of three schools and finally found a program that worked for me which I graduated from at the age of 30 in May of last year. I'm thankful that my husband pushed me to complete my education and am proud of my accomplishment (I was the commencement speaker at 30 and it felt so empowering to have been granted that honor), but I'm starting to feel that a piece of paper wasn't worth the added financial stress of the loans I took on. 

I was the first in my family to go to school in an already financially illiterate family. We did not do our research about the costs of loans, about the repercussions of not paying them on time, and in my early 20s I struggled with the payments and defaulted on some loans. I've since corrected the effect that had on my credit and am continuing to pay them down. However, now that I've graduated and have taken on additional loans for that school, I'm feeling buried and need help developing a plan to pay this off. 

Loan details:
Federal Parent Plus Loan - $10,354.32 unpaid balance - 8.25% interest rate - currently pay $110.17/mo

Federal Stafford Loan 1 - $816.38 unpaid balance - 6.8% interest rate - currently pay $13.77/mo

Federal Stafford Loan 2 - $2,576.42 unpaid balance - 6.8% interest rate - currently pay $40.21/mo

Federal Stafford Loan 3 - $1,665.05 unpaid balance - 3.27% interest rate - currently pay $21.84/mo

Great Lakes mix of subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans - $55,368.98 unpaid balance -  interest rates ranging from 3.15% to 6.5% - currently pay $573.92/mo

Private Loan - $6,085.31 unpaid balance - 8.5% interest rate - currently pay $158.53/mo


Total - $917.78/mo in student loans for myself, approx $300-400/mo for my husband. 

Our combined salary is about $100k yearly pre-tax. Our mortgage is $1,098/mo. Utilities, phone, etc. total about $450-500/mo. Car payment is $255.38/mo with $5,700 left on the loan. About $6,500 in savings. No kids. 

Any advice offered would be incredibly helpful. I'm happy to provide more detail. I just want to know what our best go forward plan would be. I'm tired of being stressed about feeling like we're never going to be able to pay off our loans and feeling like we're not financially comfortable enough to start a family. 

*Edited for formatting. 

*Edit 2: I wanted to thank you all for taking the time to offer your advice and to quell my anxiety about the loans I've accumulated. It's comforting to know that many of you are/were in the same boat as I and with persistence and dedication you've paid down the debt.

Don't know why I'm just catching this now as I've been pretty on top of my federal loans since I began repayment in June 2014. I just downloaded my 1098-E, the form for student loan interest paid over the year (2017) and noticed it was higher than I expected. Below are the numbers from my last 3 years of 1098-E forms:

2015: $2713

2016: $2877

2017: $3061

Now, isn't the fundamental point of loans that your interest paid decreases incrementally every month? How could I have paid ~$200 more to interest than last year?

Additional information: my monthly loan payment gets applied to the 7 different loans that comprise my loan package, the interest rates differ from loan to loan (4 at 6.8%, others at 4.5%, 3.86%, and 3.4%) but the average is about 5.54%.

- Federal loan option, would have to take out direct unsubsidized loans 


I have about 8,000 euro saved up, and my parents are helping me out with living costs. As an international student, I would barely be able to work, so I would basically have to take out loans for the last two years of my degree. The prospect of taking out Sallie Mae loans scares me a bit, as I've read stories, but I want to know if I should just go for University A and not worry to much about the amount of loans, since it isn't an exorbitant amount anyways. However, this depends on how high the interest rate of Sallie Mae loans would be. Federal loans have a lower interest rate, right? Help me make a decision!",finance
personalfinance,Advice Needed - What would have greatest impact on credit score?,"Apologies in advance for the long post!

**Main Goal: Get a good APR on $25k-28k car loan in/around May.**

------------

Current situation (26 y/o): 

* 591 credit score (Experian FICO 8) - Was super low 6 months ago due to missed payments on student loans. Score is steadily increasing every month.
 * Hard to forecast: Would expect to be 630-650 by May
* 69k salary - Raise to $75k in mid-February
 * 8% to retirement
* Credit Card #1 (Chase Slate):
 * $2500 credit limit - never increased - was maxed 18 months ago
 * Kept at 0% utilization - still being used
* Credit Card #2 (Citi Dividend):
 * $5400 balance on $9000 limit - was 8k balance 24 months ago (job 12 months ago)
 * Currently locked/closed - was a part of 12 month payment plan that finished in August
 * 3% APR - $68 minimum - making $120 payments
 * 8.5 years old
* Student Loans (Navient):
 * Consolidated in October 2017 - all federal, no private loans
 * **There were many loans (Sub/Unsub) before consolidation that had many missed payments** - 6 years (grad/undergrad)/12 semesters/~20 loans upon graduation
 * 70k balance on loans - loan balances forgiven after 10 years through PSLF (Public Service Loan Forgiveness) - Minimum payment based on income
 * Loans were never in default/sent to collections
* Money Situation (forecasted):
 * $6k - $8k saved for possible deposit on car
 * If full value of car can be financed through NFCU, money saved will probably go to paying off Credit Card #2
* Joined Navy Federal Credit Union in August 2016 - civilian, not active/reserve

------
Here's what I think I need some advice on! I don't want too many hard pulls on my credit.

Possible Action Items:

1. Ask for credit limit increase on Chase Slate card
 * Quick research leads me to believe that this would be a hard pull.
 * I do have a branch near me if that affects anything.
2. Apply for a different credit/secured card
 * Would probably go through NFCU 
 * Since missed payments is what is holding me back the most, not sure what would be the better option between the two - also not sure if anything will have an impact on 100+ missed payments before the loans were consolidated.
 * Actual credit card would help credit limit more
3. Pay down as much as possible on closed/locked 3% $5400 balance credit card
 * If this were a normal 18%+ credit card, this would 100% be what I would be doing
4. See if I can get my Citi card reactivated
 * APR would shoot through the roof
 * Credit limit might have a chance at increasing as well
 * Credit age would also take a big jump
5. Put more money form check into NFCU account
 * Only $400/paycheck or ~$800 a month is going into account
 * Would the more $ I put in help them know the level of money I am making? Or can you submit pay stub/W-2 when you apply for the loan?
6. Try to eliminate missed payments from student loans on credit report
 * **Super Help needed**: Should I go about disputing every missed payment on my annual credit report? It seems there are a fair number of people (at least videos) of people mentioning this. (I believe one of the bureaus only lets you do 10/month? - more research needed)
 * 100% my fault on everything, it would be nice if I wasn't screwed for 7 years due to my mishaps with student loans
 * Once dust settles from dealing with the missed payments, sending Goodwill letters

CryptoCurrency,Thought experiment on the requirements of a universal global payment system in 2100,"I was trying to come up with maximum requirements for a future global payment system in form of a cryptocurrency used by everyone in the world, replacing every other payment system (i.e. cash, credit and so on). 
Here's what I came up with:

According to the [The Federal Reserve Payments Study 2016](https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/2016-selected-results.htm) the total number of non-cash payments in the US in 2015 was 144.1 billion. [The volume share of cash payments in the same year is estimated to be around 32.5%.](https://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Tasks/Cash_management/Conferences
/2017_04_24_schuh.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) So let's assume the total number of payments in the US is 213.5 billion. [The world population is projected to reach about 11 billion people by 2100,](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf) so let's assume that this is the maximum population a hypothetical payment system would have to handle. [The US was home to about 320mil people in 2015.](http://www.multpl.com/united-states-population/table) 
If all 12 billion people lived like US citizens in 2015 the total number of payments would be about 7300 billion, resulting in 230k tx/s.

[For perspective Bitcoin has a theoretical max of about 7 tx/s, while VISA handles about 24k tx/s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem)
I am going to assume this payment network has all the properties of cash and the only cryptocurrency that has these to my knowledge is Monero atm. To get an idea of how much data such a system would generate we will assume a transaction has the same size as a Monero transaction. [Monero transactions with bulletproof have a size of about 2.5kB,](https://i.imgur.com/xuOQXZI.png) so let's take this as a proven upper size limit. Therefore our payment system would generate about 575 MB/s or about 50 TB per day.

personalfinance,"Is it better to lower debt-to-income ratio by paying off some student loans, or should I just buy the house already?","Hi PF!

My wife and I are trying to figure out the best financial move. We are 33/34 years old and want to buy a house. We are currently renting in NYC for $1400/month. We both have excellent credit (Scores above 800) and make ~ $100k / year combined. We both started Roth IRAs, but have stopped contributing to them in the last year to put money into savings for a house. But we're wondering, if we should pay down some of the student debt to lower our debt-to-income ratio, and wait another year to buy the house or go after the house and just keep doing what we're doing with those student loans. We do want to start a family, and are concerned about waiting 2-3 more years before trying to do that. We can't do that in our current apartment. 

My student loans are:
~$10k at 7% interest rate
~$13k at 4.5% interest rate

My wife's student loan is:
~$59k at 4.5% interest rate

No other debts. (No Credit card debt. We own our car).

We have ~$33k in savings, which we were going to use as:
~ $10k in emergency fund savings 
~ $23k in down payment and closing costs for the house in the $300k-350k range

What are your thoughts?  Lower our debt-to-income ratio by paying off some student loans and save back up for a year, or go after the house now?

Thanks for any feedback you can give us!

btc,"Brock Pierce, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, is a Clinton Global Initiative member who has been accused by 3 child actors of running an underage sex ring in Hollywood. Brock Pierce also founded Tether. Articles about this are shadowbanned across Reddit.","It appears the entire domain of Disobedient Media has been shadowbanned across Reddit. 

Here is an archived version of the link: http://archive.is/I5RIU

Twitter link from the author: https://twitter.com/ElizabethleaVos/status/950571057060118528

Please visit the site to support the journalists, but I don't want this post to be shadowbanned so I am abstaining from giving a direct link to the site. Full text from the article:

Brock Pierce is a controversial figure who has received surprisingly little attention despite connections to the Clinton Foundation, digital currency Bitcoin and involvement in a notorious scandal involving a child abuse ring. Pierce’s involvement with a child abuse ring, Digital Entertainment Network and The Clinton Global initiative were first highlighted in the documentary An Open Secret, Directed by Amy Berg.

As detailed in Berg’s film, Brock was a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, former child actor who appeared in films such as the 1992 classic Mighty Ducks and Disney’s “First Kid,” and Chairman of the Board at the Bitcoin Foundation. Pierce also co-founded the Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), a forerunner of video sharing site Youtube. In 2010, Pierce also was also a participant at the Mindshift Conference, which was hosted by now disgraced billionaire pedophile and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.


DEN was founded in 1996 amid the rapid growth of the dot-com bubble. It raised $72 million in investment before even opening in 1999, a massive amount of capital considering that, at least on the surface, DEN was not yet providing investors with anything in return. At the time news sources scoffed at the massive salaries top executives were paid when the company was not even creating revenue.

An SEC filing obtained by Hollywood periodical Radar Online reveals that DEN’s investors included a shocking number of big name personalities such as media executives Garth Ancier and David Geffen, former Yahoo CEO Terry Semel, film producers Gary Goddard and Bryan Singer, Wall Street czar Mitchell Blutt, A&amp;M Records head Gilbert Friesen (now deceased), former Disney executive David Neuman, manager and label executive Gary Gersh, investor Jeffrey Sachs, former Congressman Michael Huffington, actors Ben and Fred Savage, and tech companies such as Microsoft and Dell. The lack of apparent revenue raises questions about what investors in DEN were expecting in return.

In 2000, DEN suffered an absolute disaster amid claims by employees and several Hollywood child actors such as Michael Egan III that Pierce and his partners, Chad Shackley and Marc Collins-Rector ran a child abuse ring with a number of other Hollywood directors and A-list actors, many of whom were financially tied to DEN.

As covered in the Amy Berg film An Open Secret, Egan alleged that between the ages of 15 to 17, he would be given alcohol, cocaine and other drugs and was raped repeatedly along with other young boys who were present. The abuse allegedly occurred at the house shared by Collins-Rector, Shackley and Pierce as well as on trips to Hawaii. On at least one occasion, Collins-Rector threatened Egan with a gun to force him into compliance. Egan filed a civil suit after his reports to the LAPD and FBI fell on deaf ears. Individuals named in the suit included Pierce, Collins-Rector, Shackley, as well as Bryan Singer, Garth Ancier, Gary Goddard and David Neuman.

Mr. Egan’s allegations mirror other similar claims made by actors such as Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood that child sex abuse is rampant in Hollywood. Pierce and his co-accused resigned from DEN and fled hurriedly to Spain to escape the FBI. Collins Rector was apparently primarily concerned that investor David Geffen wished to kill him over the scandal. Depositions taken from Pierce revealed that Geffen had purportedly been paying an employee to spy on DEN, and that he had been fed information and stolen faxes.

Ultimately, Collins-Rector was the only individual charged with sex offenses in relation to the scandal. Brock Pierce was never able fully escape negative public opinion over the role he played however. When he became the Chairman of the Board at the Bitcoin Foundation, at least 10 members resigned in protest. Several resignation letters explicitly listed Pierce’s association with pedophilia and child pornography as the reason for their departure.

Pierce is one of several public figures dogged by allegations of child sex abuse with financial or social ties to the Clinton Foundation.",cryptocurrency

gaming,Blowing on todays controllers still fixes them.,"I got my PS4 years ago. It's a Black Ops 3 edition which I bought because I really liked how the controller looked. Anyways, after about a year and a half of dumping hour after hour into various games, the left joystick slowly deteriorated to the point where L3 (clicking the left stick inward) would no longer respond reliably. This made it very difficult to run in many first person shooters. I was a little ticked off at thus since I really liked the controller. So after a few weeks of denial, I finally bought a second controller so I wouldn't have to deal with that anymore. Fast forward a few more years to about 2 weeks ago and my second controller is now also showing signs of deterioration. Now in order to run, I have to swing the stick from side to side while pushing it forward and clicking it in until I get a response. Today I got fed up with it and was about to purchase new 3D joystick sensors for both my controllers. Thank goodness I first decided to do a quick google search to see if there were any quick fixes. This random forum pops up and I scroll down to read that blowing into the joystick will maybe fix the problem. I didn't think that was possible, it just sounded too easy of a fix. Sure enough though, it worked. For both controllers. It just made me happy that I can still fix my gaming equipment by blowing air into them, even after all these years. 

Tl;dr Joysticks on PS4 controllers stopped working, internet told me to blow air into them to fix the problem, it actually worked.",technology
personalfinance,"How do I find out what my tax deductions on an $800,000 home in California would be?","I'm strongly considering an offer on an $800,000 home in Thousand Oaks, California. It's right near work, and is essentially perfect for what I need. The problem for me is ... I can afford the 20% down payment on this (thanks to years of saving) but while I have a very strong stable salary ($225,000), I will effectively be paying for the whole thing myself. Before you ask why, just know I'm hoping to move my two relatives in here who can't work, and I'd be the only income earner in this place, probably ever... short of meeting a magical partne

So this is what scares me. I'm pre-qualified for up to $1M, but my napkin math makes me feel like I can't realistically afford more than $750,000. I want to know how true that is.

Currently, I rent a full 2B/2H home. My monthly rent is $3750, which I cover entirely myself, and while steep for most areas in the country, it's tolerable here.

Looking at the mortgage calculator for an $800,000 home, I get this estimate:

* INTEREST RATE: 4.5%
* TERM/TYPE: 30 year fixed
* PRIN &amp; INT: $3,242.79
* PROP TAX: $833.33
* HAZ INS: $80.00

* TOTAL PER MONTH: $4,156.12

This is what terrifies me. That means an additional ~$400 per month, and that's before utilities and every other payment stacked on top.

Now, I know absolutely nothing about tax deductions, and this new government tax change is very confusing to me. I can't get a clear understanding of what it means.

What would my estimate tax deduction be on this home? And after accounting for this tax return... what would my *REAL* monthly cost be? Is it true that I could deduct up to $10,000 per year? And if so... doesn't that translate to $1,200 per month, and thusly my overall total per month is more like $2,956?

btc,An outsider's take on the current state of Bitcoin,"I call myself an outsider because I've never been particularly invested, literally or figuratively, in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. I have a rough understanding of how everything works, and I've done a handful of real-world transactions (BTC and ZEC), but I've never studied it in depth or done any serious investing/trading, and have only recently been trying to learn. Having given that disclaimer, here's my 2 satoshis: 

A lot of people seem to be framing the split as a choice between ""Bitcoin Core"" and ""Bitcoin Cash"", but I think that's incredibly shortsighted.

Let's just assume for a moment that Bitcoin Core is ultimately doomed to fail. Sooner or later most of its userbase will get fed up, sell their BTC, and move onto something else. Who's to say they'll migrate to BCH and not a different coin altogether? If they're already jumping ship, why not move to a coin that does something Bitcoin doesn't? Maybe the scripting capabilities of Ethereum will draw some. Or maybe the zero knowledge transactions of Zcash will appeal to people, along with its memory-hard hashing that enable people to actually mine a spendable amount of coin without buying specialized ASIC hardware. There could be some amazing coin with a hundred bells and whistles just around the corner that'd only need a bunch of people that've recently cashed out their BTC to blow up.

To me the only guarantee of Bitcoin's short to medium term survival is if the Core team takes their head out of their ass and raises the damned block size. It's becoming more and more clear that this isn't going to happen, and so Bitcoin Cash looks to be the best chance Bitcoin's got.

personalfinance,Parents took out shady loan and asked me to cosign new loan.,"So about three years ago my parents had a lot of debt and took out a shady loan with high interest for $4200. Fast forward to today and my dad has been making monthly payments on that loan for three years but only able to pay off the monthly interest. He said that the interest rate was 10% but of course I don't believe. He still owes the $4200 on the loan. They've always struggled to budget and pay off loans. 


Today he asked me if I could cosign a bank loan with lower interest to pay off the $4200. He said the bank wouldn't give it to him because of credit score. My wife is 100% against this. I feel bad since it's my parents and I really want to help them. Recently my mom had to leave her job because of anxiety and depression and my dad has been dealing with health issues. They always helped me financially when I was younger. But now I realize that their spending habits and budgeting skills are not the best.

CryptoCurrency,Wall Street Bonus Bust - BUT Walmart Willie's Bonus Will come Beginning of March,"**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:** - ***My comments are bolded and italized.*** 
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  

***Don't expect Wall Street bonuses to float the crypto boat.  Not trying to scare you, just trying to level-set expectations.  Bonuses will be light this year.***   
&amp;nbsp;

***But since Walmart Willie is starting to get involved in Crypto, the lack of Wall Street Bonuses won't matter eventually.***  
&amp;nbsp;

**Wall Street Bonuses:**&amp;nbsp;


""Wall Street banks handed out $23.9 billion in bonuses to their New York City-based employees last year (2016), according to new figures from the New York State Comptroller. .... The total bonus pool for 177,000 Wall Street employees."" (1)   
&amp;nbsp;


***Bonus checks will most likely be light this year, so crypto will have to contend with keeping the wife/husband happy and paying for the nanny and her/ his spa treatment.***  
&amp;nbsp;

""(T)raders have probably been bracing for light bonus checks all year. Just last year, Wall Street investment banks saw earnings from their fixed-income  trading businesses rise for the first time in four years. But the drop in volatility this year has weighed on trading profits across the industry.
&amp;nbsp;

At Bank of America Corp., rates traders are likely to see bonus pools shrink by as much as 10%,  according to people briefed on the discussions. Those teams at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the world’s biggest trading bank, are set for declines of about 5%, according to Bloomberg’s sources.""  (2)  
&amp;nbsp;


***European bank bonuses won't help....***  
&amp;nbsp;

""The outlook is even grimmer for firms across the Atlantic. Traders at European banks are facing some of the worst bonuses in years, as the declines in both debt and equity revenue are steeper than those at US firms.
&amp;nbsp;

Lenders including Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG may see bonus pools for fixed-income traders drop by at least 10%. Some bankers might even be forced to accept “doughnuts” - industry slang for a 0% bonus.""  (3)
&amp;nbsp;


***But if you think Wall Street bonus money is going to kick in, the date to start watching is January 18th.***  
&amp;nbsp;

""(H)ere's when Wall Street's top banks are expected to announce bonuses:
&amp;nbsp;

**Morgan Stanley** is set to kick things off this Thursday (1/11/2018 most likely). A person familiar with the matter said the bank would also announce managing-director promotions.  
&amp;nbsp;

**Citigroup** is next up the following week. It is expected to announce just after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, so January 16.  
&amp;nbsp;

**JPMorgan** is expected to announce in the middle of that week, around January 17.    
&amp;nbsp;

**Goldman Sachs** is expected to announce at the end of next week, so around January 19.    
&amp;nbsp;

**Bank of America Merrill Lynch** is the last to go of the big US banks. It is planning to announce the following week, on January 23, according to a memo sent to staff Tuesday, people familiar with the matter told Business Insider.""  (4)  
&amp;nbsp;

***The bonuses are typically paid out a week or two after they are announced.***  
&amp;nbsp;

**Walmart Willie:**
&amp;nbsp;

***Everywhere I go, I ask if people have heard of Bitcoin.  Barber, cashier, gas station attendant...all of them.  And lately, many more have been aware of BitCoin and even more importantly, Alt Coins, and ALL have expressed an interest in getting involved.***
&amp;nbsp;

***These folks are what I like to call Walmart Willie - and they also have a bonus season - when they get their tax refunds.*** 
&amp;nbsp;

***I suspect the January bounce will happen in the end of February/ beginning of March.*** (5)(6)

investing,Convince me that we won't have another financial crisis in the next 5 years,"Here's why I think a financial crisis is coming. I don't know when, but I think there's plenty of reasons for trouble:

- Banks are giving people mortgages in which people put 3% or less for a down payment, of several times their income. Banks can end up underwater on these very easily.

- Student loan debt among younger generations is skyrocketing.

- Auto loan default rates are increasing rapidly.

- Interest rates will be climbing very soon.

- Adjustable rate loans(especially mortgages) are becoming the norm. As interest rates go up, people will have less disposible income and struggle to pay off debt that was once affordable to finance.

- Healthcare is taking up a larger and larger share of the economy, which will limit consumer spending and business investment due to increased operating costs.

- Many states and municipalities have severe underfunded pension liabilities and debt that will require higher taxes to resolve, which will suffer heavily.

- Massive national debt/deficit and aging population, social security will be insolvent within a decade if nothing is changed, requiring higher payroll taxes, raised retirement age, or cut payments.",finance
personalfinance,Please understand interest so you can either save yourself money or not get yourself involved in a lot of debt.,"I feel this needs to be said.  Interest rates bring a certain illusion - people often assume ""Hey, I'm paying 4% interest, that's great!""  They assume that if they had a loan of $10K, they'd only be paying $400 in interest.  This is completely false.  (unless of course you paid the loan off in that first year).
  
Please understand the following.
  
If you get a 30-year mortgage, and let's say the mortgage is 4.5% interest, and your mortgage is $300K, you'll pay $247K in *interest* over that 30-year period.  That's almost the entire cost of your loan.  So you pay both the $300K principle AND the $247K in interest.  Yet people say ""don't pay cash for a home or car, even if you can afford to!""
  
Let's look at a car.  Same thing.
  
Let's say you paid $20K on your new car and got a 6 year loan, at a 5% interest rate, perhaps you have 'decent' credit.  That's $3191 in interest paid.
  
Let's say you have kinda bad credit, and you paid $20K on the new car, and they wouldn't give you a 6 year loan, instead you got a 7 year loan.  This time they hit you with a 13% interest rate.  That's $10,562 in interest...
  
Anyway.  I just wanted to point this out, because lately I keep seeing people saying that mortgages are great, car payments are great, etc., and that has me a bit baffled.",finance

Bitcoin,bitpay.org — Reply to earlier archived post,"Hello Reddit!

The domain bitpay.ORG has been in our possession (and still is) well before the date this phishing attempt was reported here 6 months ago. FYI we are not affiliated with bitpay.COM, nor have we ever sent out email originating from bitpay.ORG.

I assume someone has spoofed the domain name to appear as though email had originated from bitpay.ORG. Bitpay.ORG has not been configured for sending or receiving email or having the corresponding security to talk with mail servers like gmail, hotmail etc. in order to verify it’s origin including with respect to historic use. Hence these mail servers could more easily be fooled to believe email had originated from bitpay.ORG compared to bitpay.COM which has an active and working website/email etc.

I found this information out after another domain we own under development and currently only used for internal email also appears to be used for sending unsolicited emails (we receive the bounced emails at our catch-all inbox). I thought the domain could be hacked, however examining the email shows an origin from a different domain or IP address.

I’m posting this to inform anyone who may think that bitpay.ORG are engaging in spam activities that this is not the case. With that said, any email coming from bitpay.ORG is probably fake as we don’t have the domain configured to use email.

personalfinance,Question about my father's current situation,"Hi, PF! First of all...I'm obviously using a throwaway account. I'm simply doing that because I'm including some personal finance details (go figure, on this sub), and I'd like to remain anonymous. 

Second...**this is going to be a loooong post.** I truly apologize in advance, but I feel like I have to include any and all relevant information. I'm just hoping that a few people might have the time and/or interest to make it through to the end. 

**EDIT:** Since part of this deals with a 401k, age is relevant. My father is 74, and I should have mentioned that earlier

&amp;nbsp;

**Background:**

My mother passed away just over two years ago. It was completely unexpected. She was always in (what seemed to be) perfect health, whereas my father has long been quite sick. He has been a **heavy** smoker all his life (pipes and cigarettes), and I think we all assumed (my father included) that he would be the first to pass. Since that wasn't the case, he has found himself woefully unprepared to deal with the fallout of my mother's death.

&amp;nbsp;

**My dad's finances**

My father has approx. $5k in checking, $40k in his savings, approx. $160k in a Vanguard 401k (traditional - not a ROTH), and a modest life insurance policy. He owes approx. $80k on his mortgage. He pays approx. $2k/month on his mortgage, most of which goes towards principal (according to him, at least). Additional expenses include (these are rough estimates):

Landline phone: $95/month

Cell phone: $130/month

BGE: $70/month

Groceries: $300/month

Healthcare: $160/month

He also has some State Farm bills that come in (homeowner's insurance, auto insurance, life insurance) that come in every few months. Those are pretty hefty bills, though I don't know the exact amount off the top of my head. 

He receives approx. $3k/month, which comes from SS, pensions and retirement.

&amp;nbsp;

**Some Perspective On My Parents' Long-Term Goals (it will be relevant further down in the post):**

Ever since their first child, my parents knew that one of their most fundamental goals was to save as much money as possible for their children (not an uncommon goal, I know). I grew up believing that we our family was pretty ""lacking"" in the financial department, and that is because they worked so hard to save what they could. They managed to deal with *both* of them being laid off from fairly well-paying jobs (when the economy tanked), while also making their mortgage payments, paying for college for all of their children -- and still had money to leave behind. 

&amp;nbsp;

**My Father's Physical/Mental Health:**

So here's what's going on right now. My father is doing his best to be there for his family (kids, grandkids, etc), but he is completely broken from the loss of my mother. In addition to that, his health is in very poor shape. He has COPD (due to his history of smoking). Even when my mother was alive, he was stubborn about his health. He refuses to see specialists, he refuses to be put on oxygen. But it's bad. He's on a daily inhaler, and he has a ""rescue inhaler"" as well. One flight up/down the stairs, and he's winded. His hands/fingers have been red/purple for years (lack of oxygen/circulation). We can't get him to invest in his health...at this point, he's just ready to go. He has even told me - on numerous occasions - that he ""doesn't want to be here anymore."" He just wants to join my mother, and be done with it. I try to see him every day...keep him company, help out with things, go shopping for/with him, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**My Predicament:**

So now that you have some background, here's what all of this is leading to. My father's biggest stress (other than the depression that followed my mother's death) is money. He *has* money -- as indicated above, he has plenty in his 401k, he has a modest amount in savings....but, he doesn't want to pull from either of those (well, he's obligated to pull *some* from his 401k - for tax reasons - but other than that, nothing). He won't pull from those accounts, because he's so worried about ""what he leaves behind for his family."" 

Because of his financial stress (low checking balance, and refusal to pull from other accounts), he's now looking into selling his house. Actually, now that I mention that, this is a good time to explain some details about the house....

&amp;nbsp;

**My Father's House:**

As I explained before, my father has about $80k left on his mortgage. I couldn't tell you exactly how much the house would sell for (it *would* need some touching up), but I *can* tell you this: it is a 5 bedroom/4 bathroom, 3 story home with a finished basement. Two other homes on his street just recently sold - both of which had unfinished basements, and one of which had *very little* work done to it before it sold. Both of those houses sold for around $500k. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Okay, Continuing:**

Okay, so now that I included that info, back to my point. Because of my father's financial stresses, he's thinking about selling his house. He fears that he cannot keep up the payments on the house. He wants to sell the house, move into some apartment somewhere, and have a lower monthly payment. To use his words: ""every day that I'm alive, I'm costing you guys [his sons] money."" I think he feels like he **must** sell the house, so that he never has to pull from any of his other accounts, and thus, doesn't have to tap into any money that's meant to be left for us.

&amp;nbsp;

**Here's My Overall Question:**

I don't really care if my father sells the house. My brothers and I wouldn't be holding on to it anyway, and his decisions are his own to make; however, I can't help but shake the feeling that he's acting irrationally. My brothers and I have - **on countless occasions** - told him that we *couldn't care less* about how much money is left for us. We just want our father to be around...we want him to be as happy as is possible (given his situation), and we want what's best for him. 

I feel like selling his house is going to be a burden for which he is woefully ill-prepared. It will entail going through/getting rid of 20+ years of ""stuff,"" remodeling, re-painting, re-carpeting, dealing with an agent, etc etc. Then, it will entail him going through the process of moving into a new place. And, he's going to have a hard time finding an apartment that's *much* cheaper than his current mortgage, so that also means somewhat of a long-distance move for him. 

**SO...** what I'm asking is this. Are we overreacting? Is he making the right choice, or is he acting irrationally? If he's acting irrationally, is there something that we may be missing, that we could better explain to him, to help him make the right choice?

A part of me was wondering if it may be best for him to pull a large amount from his 401k, to pay off the mortgage. That would be tough, because it would:

1) drain a significant amount of the 401k upfront

2) drain even more, due to federal and state income taxes, which would also affect his SS income for the next year

3) leave him on the hook for property taxes (which his mortgage lender currently covers)

But I also feel like it would:

1) allow him to avoid a monthly mortgage/rent, which in turn, would allow him to save more money month to month, which he could put right back into a savings account for his children (not that we care at all about that, but *he* certainly does)

2) allow him to avoid the whole process that comes with remodeling, selling, moving out &amp; moving in.

But I don't know....that's a HEFTY fucking tax he would be facing, and that may be the dumbest idea in the world. I just don't know. **All I want** is to have an idea of what's best **for him,** and to be able to articulate that to him (then, after that, it's still simply in his hands, and he'll do as he sees fit). My brothers and I don't give a shit about what's left behind for us...we just hate seeing our father suffer like this, and we want to help him make the best decision **for him.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Final Thoughts:**

If you have actually made it this far, then I already *can't thank you enough.* This has been going on for a long time now, and I've been wanting to consult PF for opinions; however, I've been intimidated by *how fucking long* I knew a post like this would have to be. I truly apologize for writing so much, but I felt that if I wanted helpful responses, then I would need to be absolutely forthcoming with all elements of my father's situation.

If *anyone* has any ideas/recommendations/insight/etc, I would be absolutely 100% **deeply** appreciative. I already fear that my father is on borrowed time, and I just want the man to have some peace, and to be in a situation which is most beneficial to him. I can tell that he doesn't *want* to move, but that he feels like he is *obligated* to do so. Any thoughts?

**Thank you**

&amp;nbsp;

**FINAL EDIT:**

It wasn’t until I was responding to the first comment on this thread that I realized I didn’t articulate the following point clearly enough: *it may very well be* that my dad is making the perfect decision here. I legitimately do not know enough about finances to know. If you guys think that’s the case, I absolutely welcome that feedback (in fact, it will provide me with peace of mind). I have merely been worried that he’s been thinking so much of *us,* that he’s maybe been unwilling to make other choices to help himself",finance

Ripple,"When XRP and BTC collide, are you going to hold or $^*% yourself?","Crypto noob here since December, but I've done my research and am heavily invested in XRP, and will be for quite some time.  If your intent is the same as mine, my 2 cents.

We need to look at the entire crypto situation right now, from an executive level viewpoint, a high-altitude perspective.  A market coming into its Alpha stage, the likes of which has never been seen before due to technological constraints.

Now that market is gaining more attention + capital (with bottle necked access), investors, law makers eyes, gossip, rumor mill - technological progress, quicker better blockchain technology that's so efficient they don't know what the application for it will be yet - everyday.  

This is technology that may come to define the 21st century along with the advancement of robotics and AI, that we are witnessing explode before our eyes.  

And we are able to participate in it as a venture capitalist type of investment style.  What a confluence of events... seriously think about that.  Kinda nuts right ?

What's been going on with crypto?  There is a dichotomy beginning between cryp 1.0 and cryp 3.0.  cryp 1.0 is BTC, it's the first movers.  cryp 2.0 was random ICOs and shitcoins.  cryp 3.0 is application/utility/function/improvements on 1.0.  

And cryp 3.0 is going to have staying power, namely their recently branded standard bearer XRP.  Cryp 3.0 will challenge 1.0 soon for market dominance and steam roll it if ANYTHING that is in the works for XRP actually happens.  

BTC has what?  First mover advantage?  We have never seen a market emerge or behave like crypto in history.  First mover advantage does not apply.  That goes for market cap too.  This is brand new territory we are all dabbling in, entirely new.

Lightning network?  If it ever even comes out, what if it doesn't work, or doesn't work well enough?  Put a dagger in BTC.  No customer wants a $30 8 hour transfer.  BTC will atrophy into this quick moving markets history books, probably faster than I think.  

That is before or after the feds get involved, when that inevitably happens.  XRP is clearly positioned and prepared for that inevitability, much better than any other similar cryp.  

Then the banks start piloting around hundreds of billions of dollars and the attention that brings with new investors.  

Now zoom out from all of this.  Look at the past few years, extrapolate ahead.  This is a buy and hold for XRP.  Who cares if it's bumpy, it's a no brainer.  We all could list 50 examples of why this is so, I'm just here to say, we're all right.  

So we're right, but do you have discipline?  Can you put money into an investment, perhaps even contribute more over time, with the intention of holding for at least 10 years?  

Can you make it 1 year in and say XRP and BTC are fighting it out hard, which is bound to happen, are you going to shit your pants hard or hold?  

You hold because this is a 10 year investment and that's how I approach it.  This has potential for enormous gains but it needs a lot of time, and during that time A LOT is going to happen.  

I did a whole fly by of this crypto scene, and there's a ton of turbulence and horseshit.  But there is some serious technology being developed here.  There are a ton of great coins, but there are HUGE BUBBLES COMING over the years.  Can you hold through all that?  I can with XRP my confidence is that high in it after my whole deep dive.

CryptoCurrency,Predicted it very well. Hold Tight Coin Holders.,"I've been running some statistics for over past few years and this year I must say that my predictions were spot on for past 4-5 months, maybe off by a day but still good IMO. 
I came here because one of the friends told me I should share my knowledge that I've been dealing with for past 5y. 

What you see today in crytoworld  is perfectly normal, most TAs that you see today are telling you something that most cryto holders already knew for years, however the news always somehow comes 'after' the dip.

Things I learned and put into my machine learning:

1. Throughout the year if there are any big hacks (Kraken, Mt.Gox, NiceHash etc..) , check which coin got hacked , most likely that coin will be spread across few top coins within next few weeks but ultimately will go right back into the BTC / ETH /. 

2. If BTC is up 10% yet ETH and LTC is still at 0/1% up, you bet that in next few days ETC and LTC will go up 10% -- I can not tell you the reason behind this (yet) .. 

3. Always have some stash money set on limit, I usually do 20-30% of my total investment. Say LTC is up at $300, I always put limits to buy at $200,$175,$145 - and that is the money I never sell because I already bought it at 25-50% off. 

4. Urge to sell/buy: Just because someone said it will moon , and it is mooning -- you are probably buying coin at ATH (all time high). Go back to strategy of limit, set your buy at 25-50% lower from ATH.. wait few weeks and viola... What goes up MUST COME DOWN.. -- that money you should NEVER sell at least not between Jan-mid Dec. 

5. Avoid paying high taxes (US) : Hold your coin for over 12 months then withdraw, and PAY your taxes if income is grater than $600 

6. Shi^coins will always be shi^coins unless they make it up to top 5 and are consistent top 5!. When buying shitcoins you either are going to be lucky to sell it on time, or you will end up waiting year or two to get your money and some gains back. I see many people sh** on Tron - sure its a shi*tcoin, but eventually it will go back to 20-30-40-50c (wait till mid July) and drop down again to 15-20c ,all coins do that. Some coins have been around for years like Ripple I considered it shitcoin for years, now not so much because it matured with marketing, devs, and gained trust of many people. This is no shill dump/pump -- its reality of most coins that get to top 10 market cap. They think they can outbeat btc/eth/ltc well tough cookie .. even with billions behind the coin, investors know what they are doing. 

7. Machinelearning: There is tons and tons of algorithms, tons of data to feed from and tons of metrics to go off.. I can tell you that none of it can predict the future, it can speculate the future but not predict the coin growth, so don't fall for even my ""machine learning"" BS or TAs. Reason why is because data gets skewed all the time by different types of events. Here are some top ones: Bad Marketing, John Mcafee and similar, Bad Founders/Developers reputation, Hacks. 

8. BTC for most part why it grew so much is thanks to your grandmother and grandpa as well as f**ed up uneducated SysAdmins who allowed 50000 company laptops --  desktops -- servers to be ransomwar'ed and on top of that paid the hackers because they did not have solid disaster recovery. 

9. I know a lot of people think ""What if I put my 50K of 401K and make 500K out of it"" well that can happen if you have guts to wait for years and pay 30-40% of to IRS. I do not believe that this year will be another year as 2017 where most crytos go up 1000-30000% up . So don't play with your 401K , invest what you are willing to lose and watch it drop to 80% down and backup again to 150% and go down 50% again. What I am trying to say: Once you buy it, treat it as an investment and don't dwell on ""oh man, I sold my btc when it was $10000 and now its $19500"" 

10. Back to machine learning: It is helpful yet not a predictor, it is helpful because sometimes human eye can not catch things like repetitive pumps and dumps, machine learning is not for long term holders 5-10y. Data is skewed often and should be purged, when market makes correction, you learn your machine to correct it self as well so that you rely on pure data and repetitions and events of when big pumps / dumps are coming up. Coins of less than 6-12 months of data can not be predicted , its a shi^show and shi^coin at least in my opinion. To predict anything closely of an 'event' you need 2-5y of data 

So my dear holders, stay strong though this last dip of January, buy with what you are willing to lose and stay strong because this is a year of tests that will pay it self off in next 3 years.

personalfinance,"Credit union has approved me for an auto loan. This is my first real car purchase, and could use advice.","Backstory:
 I'm 21 and all the cars I've ever bought have been 3rd party, or through family. My current car broke down, and is becoming unreliable, and in need of constant repairs. I just got hired on with a bank making very good money, and have about 2 weeks before I start (about 2 weeks to find a car). The thing is I've never bought a car through a dealership so I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to bargaining or things to avoid or anything really. I figured if I could go anywhere for help about a large purchase it would be here. 

The Details:
I was approved for up to 10K from my credit union at a 12% interest rate and they'll only pay 80% of KBB value due to credit not being the best but not the worst. (As my credit goes up i can speak to my loan advisor and they can lower the interest rate) I'll realistically be buying used around 2010-2013 depending on price. I have about $800 to use towards a down payment at the moment which means my goal is to bargain as much as possible. Will add more information if necessary. 

Edit: 2pm PST thanks for all the advice guys! It seems like I'd rather not want to get killed on the APR, and would benefit from riding out my old car as much as i can until im a little more set in with the new job, and have some savings put away!

personalfinance,I went to the doctor when I was 21. A $400 medical bill went to collections and has sabotaged my credit.,"Hi all,

Texan here. Let me preface this by saying that at the time when I was a college kid, I was totally unaware and oblivious about money. All of my education expenses were being put off by federal student loans. All of the money I made in university was negligible compared to the loan balance I had. Loans offered me a false sense of financial security. I realize this isn't a good excuse; but far too often is the case in the US. 

My parent's health insurance had always taken care of my medical bills and I only found out that I had a bill in collections destroying my credit when I learned what credit even was (I was about 23 or so).  

Now, here I am at 25 with a horrible credit score (500s). I have no credit card debt, just a single medical bill that is in collections that is worth $401. I have student loans as well, but I am in graduate school and they are deferred at this point and ""in good standing"" on my report.

I want to do the following things (if they are possible) and I'm seeking advice from people who have experience with this/have pulled this off:

*  Pay only a fraction of that $401 debt
*  Wipe this thing from my credit if possible
*  Increase my score 

Instead of letting you guys do the work, I'm going to attempt to have a stab at the issue and feel free to correct me if it's not the best course of action. I have called the debt collector and requested a transcript and validation of my debt back in December 2016. I received something in the mail that maybe I can show one of you. I have been unable to pay this bill since I received this letter. I was thinking about calling the debt collector which now holds my medical debt and telling them that I want to negotiate the amount that I owe and that I will pay promptly if we get a written agreement that the debt has been settled in full and that the incident will be wiped completely from my credit report.

I'm probably a little naive, but I'm seeking enlightenment. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Credit Cards &amp; Psychology (long),"(edited semi-repost from a couple weeks ago)

----------

**1. Introduction**

It’s common knowledge that personal behavior is deeply rooted in personal finance.  The /r/personalfinance wiki cites [The High Cost of Keeping Up With the Joneses](https://web.archive.org/web/20140622080001/http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/28ga39/grs_the_high_cost_of_keeping_up_with_the_joneses) and [Psychology](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/psychology), and although the [snowball method](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_3.3A_pay_down_high_interest_debts) is not financially optimal, we [routinely discuss](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=snowball&amp;restrict_sr=on) how it can be the best way to tackle debt anyway.  The wiki states [“do not underestimate the psychological side of debt payments”](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt) and that should include the credit cards that create debt in the first place.  

----------

**2. Research**

Behavioral economics studies [1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239810637_Do_Payment_Mechanisms_Change_the_Way_Consumers_Perceive_Products), [2](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-12802-002), [3](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/your-money/credit-cards-encourages-extra-spending-as-the-cash-habit-fades-away.html), [4](http://forum.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty/mthomas/VisceralRegulationofVices.pdf), [5](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/retail-therapy/201306/why-we-overspend-credit) have consistently determined that people lose more money when using credit cards over cash or debit.  Yet still they are the recommended default payment method.

----------

**3. An arbitrary definition of ""responsible"" - setting a low bar**

People believe that as long as statement balances are paid in full every month there are [literally no cons to using a credit card](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ooc52/seriously_get_and_use_a_credit_card/).  There is a myth that because someone is avoiding interest they are beating the system - they are “responsible” and therefore the research does not apply to them. 

If you use credit cards and never carry a balance that means you understand basic arithmetic. That has nothing to do with being responsible.  With that logic, you should pat yourself on the back for responsibly being at a gas station and smartly not letting your tank run dry.  At best you have the self-control to stick with your own plan that you created.

That does not make you immune to behavioral economics and an exception to research findings.

----------

**4. Importance**

The consumer strategies behind credit cards are grossly underestimated.  Even within the investing world [cognitive biases](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/five-cognitive-biases-hurt-investors/), [group-think](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/04/29/investment-decisions-how-to-avoid-groupthink/), [herd behavior](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stein/files/aer1990_0.pdf), [FOMO](http://networthadvice.com/fear-of-missing-out-an-investors-worst-enemy/), [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt), [risk blindness](https://hbr.org/2014/07/3-reasons-you-underestimate-risk), and [speculative bubbles](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/04/bitcoin-is-a-dangerous-speculative-bubble-yale-expert-says.html) are well-regarded realities.

The psychology rooted in airline miles, balance transfers, cash back rewards, credit scores, introductory interest rates, and sign-up bonuses is just as relevant.

----------

**5. How people can be affected**

Consider “Joe” who uses only credit cards and while armed with his best 5% cash back card buys a $100 wallet.  Joe is getting what he wants and is rewarded a “free” $5.00 for doing so.  A part of him feels like he is winning because he feels good knowing that he used his best card - his purchase is fun.

Compare with “Tod” who uses only debit and also wants to buy a $100 wallet.  Tod is getting no cash back and no points – there is no incentive but the product.

The genius of the cash back system is that it convinces people who spend $50 at a restaurant that they are getting $2.00 of free money.  MasterCard makes people feel like they are winning $10 to hide that they are losing $190.

In addition, because credit cards defer loss (payment) for an entire month, users may be [riding the float](https://www.youneedabudget.com/are-you-riding-the-credit-card-float/) and unaware that they are in a paycheck to paycheck cycle.  The credit score system also encourages purchases that cannot be afforded - they enable people (especially those with good scores) to easily qualify for financing and so they have an [increased willingness to pay more](http://web.mit.edu/simester/Public/Papers/Alwaysleavehome.pdf).

“Sally” only has $200 budgeted for a new phone but may be inclined to get the latest $600 phone anyway - she has a 12-month 0% interest credit card and can just pay over time.  Similarly, “Rick” saved $5,000 for a new vehicle but thanks to his 750 credit score might just finance a $15,000 one instead.

Perhaps your budgeting, discipline, and financial literacy makes you immune to such effects and an exception.  Though likely not - [most of us have upwardly biased views of our own abilities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3835346/).  You might not have as much self-control as you think, and if you have ever been addicted to gambling, porn, smoking, social media, or video games, or have ever caved to peer pressure, fallen for advertising, had buyer’s remorse, impulsed something, procrastinated, tried to lose weight but failed, or tried to motivate yourself but failed, then you should realize that.

----------

**6. Addressing the usual pro-credit arguments**

* **“It is more secure to use a credit card over debit.”**

This is true because debit cards grant direct access to one’s bank account.  If your debit card is used fraudulently, while you can file a dispute to get your money back, until that happens your checking account could be empty while important bills are due.

However the increased risk can be easily mitigated to the point that the differences are superficial:

* Create an “inflow” checking account, freeze its debit card, and use it only for direct deposit income.
* Create an “outflow” checking account, turn off overdraft protection, and use it only for purchases as needed.
* Have an emergency fund in a separate savings.

If your debit card is used fraudulently, only the minimum in your outflow account can be at risk because the bulk of your funds are in your inflow account.

Yes, potentially you could be out of funds for quite some time until the bank agrees to return them.  However by not being in poor financial health and having an emergency fund that possibility will be “spilled milk” and a non-issue.

There is a $450 liability difference between the EFTA and FCBA assuming the customer takes more than two days to report the fraud, nevertheless in practice banks waive the liability and simply remove the fraudulent charges.  Nothing except fear-mongering and paranoia suggests that banks are any less likely than credit card companies to issue favorable determinations in case of fraud.  Also consider only conducting business with banks that (like credit card companies) have a zero-liability policy.

If you are unable to handle a temporary loss of funds from one account and you need credit cards as a buffer then you are financially weak.  And rather than using credit cards as crutches realize that you have a problem and save to fix that problem.  You can also just use prepaid or virtual debit cards in which case all additional risk goes way.

* **“Using credit cards improves your credit score.”**

Considering the research, ideally a person should have a few credit cards and use them only for expenses that are unlikely to change due to spending habits (commuting, subscriptions, utilities, etc.).  This would improve their credit score while simultaneously avoiding an increase in spending.

With that said, while it can be useful to have a good credit score, it is a complete myth that one is needed. Employers [cannot see an applicant’s score](https://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/job-search-credit-report/) and even mortgage lenders can grant [no-credit mortgages through manual underwriting](https://budgeting.thenest.com/benefits-manual-mortgage-underwriting-31948.html).  Yes, there are several insurance companies and many landlords that use the credit score model and also many who do not.  There is no shortage of no-score options.

The credit score phenomenon is a lower and middle-class product.  The higher your score the easier it is to borrow money.  Perhaps our society should question why it is so fixated on borrowing money in the first place.  Generally speaking, signing up to finance what cannot be afforded otherwise is signing up to never build wealth.

* **""Credit cards offer a suite of other benefits like extended warranties, purchase protection, etc.""**

Many credit cards do offer miscellaneous benefits. Some of these are useful (though for example most car insurance companies have rental coverage built-in), so it may be wise to use them for larger planned purchases that would have been bought with cash anyway.  Yet these benefits alone do not justify a [12-18%](http://www.businessinsider.com/studies-help-explain-why-credit-cards-make-us-spend-more-2014-7) or [19%](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/78ce81/i_ran_a_selfexperiment_where_i_went_from_using/) increase in overall spending.

* **“I churn my credit cards for free money.”**

Many individuals like to take advantage of sign-up bonuses.  Depending on the circumstances, this can provide thousands of dollars per year.  Like the cash back incentives however, realize that the sign-up bonuses require losing more money than what is returned in the first place.  Of course there are exceptions - mortgages can be prepaid through services like Plastiq and the costs could be employer-reimbursed.  In which case congratulations.

----------

**TLDR:** It is harmful to claim that credit cards should always be the preferred payment option even when used “responsibly” because they incentivize spending.  While credit cards can be useful tools, people should realize that simply avoiding fees and interest does not automatically mean there are no cons to using them.",finance
personalfinance,Pay off car or pay down on HELOC?,"Hi PF

I just got $6996 in RSUs vesting today. My initial plan was to put that towards my HELOC which has 18,000/26,000. HELOC Interest rate is 5.750

My wife expressed interest in using RSU money and HELOC to pay off my car note (14,288 payoff at 2.99% interest). This would ""save' us $400 per month to use on other things, like put more towards my Student loans or towards the HELOC. Currently our house is worth 120k more than I owe.

I have around 52k in student loan (only federal) and another 40k in credit card/personal loan debt combined with my husband.  I'm planning on paying off the credit/loan debt first.  Is paying off student loan all at once a good idea?

Even after I pay off everything I want to make sure 300k is not wasted.  Any ideas on what to do with the money? Real estate around my neighborhood is pretty expensive so I'm not sure if buying a house is ideal.  Where do I start? Is it worth it to meet a financial advisor? What are some good things to study/research?",finance
personalfinance,Are we on the right track? Next steps?,"Here's where DH and I stand right now:

After facing financial crisis at the tail end of 2016 and into 2017, my husband and I are finally getting back on our feet. 

Long story short, husband was out of work, we got behind on bills, etc. Now we're current on bills and basically moving forward again. I just killed one of our (high interest) debts, which felt great!

Moving forward, we only have my student loans left to pay back. (Totaling close to $38,000 with 5% interest.)

We have a budget that we stick to and have finally moved past living paycheck to paycheck (due to paying back past-due bills, etc). At this moment I put any ""leftover"" money (amount depends on if DH worked OT or not) into an emergency fund. It's in its infant stages now, at $1000. 

Looking at the flowchart (bless whoever took the time to put that together!), it seems like we're in the ""build a small emergency fund"" stage. So right now we're working on having one month's worth of expenses.

This is where things get a little sticky for me. DH's employer does not offer any kind of 401k match, but part of his check does go into a pension plan, so we skip to the next step.

So the next step is to build 3-6 months worth of expenses into an emergency fund. Okay, sounds reasonable!

Then next is pay off small interest debt. This is where my student loans come in. As I mentioned above, the interest rates on these loans are 5%. Because of the financial hardship we went through, I at first put the loans in forbearance, then when things got a little better, switched to an income-based repayment plan.

Through the IBR, I pay about $70 a month. Not bad, BUT. I am charged about $150 a month just in interest. So this payment is not even touching the principal. This is obviously not what I want to do for an extended period of time. This is where I'm wondering what I should do.

Should I bump up the student loan payments to something like $200 so I can at least touch the principal? We can afford to right now, but it would take away from that ""build emergency fund"" goal. Then after building a 3-6 month emergency fund, throw everything I can at the student loans? 

The ""leftover"" money after paying all the bills and such averages about 400-600 a month, again, depending on if my DH is able to work OT or not. It would be $200 towards student loans, $200-400 towards the EF. 

So my options seem to be either pay all of the 400-600 towards the EF until it reaches 3-6 months' worth of expenses OR split that leftover money between the loans and the EF which would lower my student loan principal, but would hinder the growth of the EF. What's my best choice here? (Or if anyone has a better option, throw it my way!)

Right now I'm a stay at home mom to two kids and pregnant with #3, so I also have to take future medical expenses into account (we have fairly good insurance, so by the time the baby is born, it would only put a bit of a ding into our EF. Unless, knock on wood, an emergency happens...but that's where the rest of the EF would kick in.)

I should also add that yes, I am taking the new baby expenses into consideration. Luckily, my other two children are young, so I don't need any ""big-ticket"" items. Our monthly expenses really shouldn't change very much.

Another reason I bring up my ""mom status"" is that I plan on going back to work when the older two are in school (so in about 2.5-3 years). I plan on really attacking my loans at this point.

One last point/question: My husband and I are planning on buying a house in 8-10 years (I know, far down the road!) and I don't really see where saving for a house falls into the flowchart. I feel like we better start saving right now (that could be my anxiety talking...)-- but again, this takes away from the loan repayment, the EF building. Should we wait until we accomplish those goals before saving anything for a house? That kind of drives me nuts, I feel like I should start stashing something away just to know that we've started something. But maybe that's not the smartest idea?

If you've made it through this all, THANK YOU. I appreciate any and all opinions and advice.",finance

btc,"Reposting this daily until the Foundation responds. Brock Pierce, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, is a Clinton Global Initiative member who has been accused by 3 child actors of running an underage sex ring in Hollywood.","It appears the entire domain of Disobedient Media has been shadowbanned across Reddit. 

Here is an archived version of the link: http://archive.is/I5RIU

Twitter link from the author: https://twitter.com/ElizabethleaVos/status/950571057060118528

Please visit the site to support the journalists, but I don't want this post to be shadowbanned so I am abstaining from giving a direct link to the site. Full text from the article:

Brock Pierce is a controversial figure who has received surprisingly little attention despite connections to the Clinton Foundation, digital currency Bitcoin and involvement in a notorious scandal involving a child abuse ring. Pierce’s involvement with a child abuse ring, Digital Entertainment Network and The Clinton Global initiative were first highlighted in the documentary An Open Secret, Directed by Amy Berg.

As detailed in Berg’s film, Brock was a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, former child actor who appeared in films such as the 1992 classic Mighty Ducks and Disney’s “First Kid,” and Chairman of the Board at the Bitcoin Foundation. Pierce also co-founded the Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), a forerunner of video sharing site Youtube. In 2010, Pierce also was also a participant at the Mindshift Conference, which was hosted by now disgraced billionaire pedophile and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.


DEN was founded in 1996 amid the rapid growth of the dot-com bubble. It raised $72 million in investment before even opening in 1999, a massive amount of capital considering that, at least on the surface, DEN was not yet providing investors with anything in return. At the time news sources scoffed at the massive salaries top executives were paid when the company was not even creating revenue.

An SEC filing obtained by Hollywood periodical Radar Online reveals that DEN’s investors included a shocking number of big name personalities such as media executives Garth Ancier and David Geffen, former Yahoo CEO Terry Semel, film producers Gary Goddard and Bryan Singer, Wall Street czar Mitchell Blutt, A&amp;M Records head Gilbert Friesen (now deceased), former Disney executive David Neuman, manager and label executive Gary Gersh, investor Jeffrey Sachs, former Congressman Michael Huffington, actors Ben and Fred Savage, and tech companies such as Microsoft and Dell. The lack of apparent revenue raises questions about what investors in DEN were expecting in return.

In 2000, DEN suffered an absolute disaster amid claims by employees and several Hollywood child actors such as Michael Egan III that Pierce and his partners, Chad Shackley and Marc Collins-Rector ran a child abuse ring with a number of other Hollywood directors and A-list actors, many of whom were financially tied to DEN.

As covered in the Amy Berg film An Open Secret, Egan alleged that between the ages of 15 to 17, he would be given alcohol, cocaine and other drugs and was raped repeatedly along with other young boys who were present. The abuse allegedly occurred at the house shared by Collins-Rector, Shackley and Pierce as well as on trips to Hawaii. On at least one occasion, Collins-Rector threatened Egan with a gun to force him into compliance. Egan filed a civil suit after his reports to the LAPD and FBI fell on deaf ears. Individuals named in the suit included Pierce, Collins-Rector, Shackley, as well as Bryan Singer, Garth Ancier, Gary Goddard and David Neuman.

Mr. Egan’s allegations mirror other similar claims made by actors such as Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood that child sex abuse is rampant in Hollywood. Pierce and his co-accused resigned from DEN and fled hurriedly to Spain to escape the FBI. Collins Rector was apparently primarily concerned that investor David Geffen wished to kill him over the scandal. Depositions taken from Pierce revealed that Geffen had purportedly been paying an employee to spy on DEN, and that he had been fed information and stolen faxes.

Ultimately, Collins-Rector was the only individual charged with sex offenses in relation to the scandal. Brock Pierce was never able fully escape negative public opinion over the role he played however. When he became the Chairman of the Board at the Bitcoin Foundation, at least 10 members resigned in protest. Several resignation letters explicitly listed Pierce’s association with pedophilia and child pornography as the reason for their departure.

Pierce is one of several public figures dogged by allegations of child sex abuse with financial or social ties to the Clinton Foundation.",cryptocurrency
bitcoin_cash,I tried to get a business checking account at 10 banks.,"I own a small bitcoin mining operation, and I was looking for a way to legitimize the income and maybe even give uncle Sam his share. I filed the LLC paperwork and got an EIN number. These weren't that hard, I thought that getting a bank account would be much harder. Here are my results from calling 10 banks.


Wells Fargo

Would not sign me up for account, considered business MSB and High risk. Banker compared to a Marijuana dispenary Business and said that as of this time would not allow me to sign up for an account. He did say that if there was a business that was a “Health Shop” that also sold marijuana, the bank wouldn’t know and they could get an account as long as they didn’t know; and the same thing would apply to bitcoin.


BBVA Compass

They said that their company does not currently allow bitcoin business bank accounts at this time.


First Bank

Said that as of this time, they would not allow business checking accounts for businesses that operate in the bitcoin space. Asked to talk to a manager, waited for 10 minutes before giving up.


Arizona Bank And Trust

Won’t do business with me because it is bank policy to not do business with bitcoin operations. Recommended me to Bank of America


Bank of America

They do not do business with bitcoin businesses.


MidFirst Bank

Would not do business with certain types of businesses including bitcoin businesses. Nice lady who answered the phone, very friendly also recommended a credit union because they have different rules.


Arizona Federal Credit Union

Initially the lady who answered the phone did not know what cryptocurrency or bitcoin was. I was then placed on hold, while she asked someone what bitcoin is. Finally answered and got an official no from the banker.


Alliance Bank of Arizona

Would not open account for bitcoin business


Mountain America Credit Union

They will not do business with company’s that do cryptocurrency transactions or accept cryptocurrency.


US Bank.
Bitcoin is one of their prohibited businesses and they will not bank with anyone who does bitcoin business

personalfinance,Traditional IRA to a ROTH,"I opened a traditional IRA in 2017. I visited a retirement adviser and he recommended that I convert it to a roth IRA. The process requires I define a percentage for tax withholding. My retirement adviser stated I should enter my taxable income rate.  He stated it was better to be taxed up front so you dont have a tax bill at the time of retirement and due to the fact we have no clue what the tax percentage will be at the time of retirement. 

This is very confusing because it appears Im going to pay 50% of the original earned value of the money in taxes. I originally paid approximately 20% in Federal tax and 5% in local tax which was deducted from my paycheck. I am now having to pay the same tax again via a tax withholding.....

personalfinance,Unique Situation with Car and Student Debt,"I have a peculiar situation that I can't seem to find anything online about. Here's my situation:

I took out my last student loan about 8 years ago. I fell on some really hard times back then and I defaulted on it due to never making a payment. I haven't made a payment on that loan to this day, I don't even know who has it at this point. Since then, the amount for that loan is not showing up on my credit report. My federal student loans (which I'm current on and have been for a few years now) do show up on my credit report in addition to my minimal credit card debt. My credit was very poor years ago and has since greatly improved and I now ""good"" credit. 

Last year, randomly, my bank at the time wiped my savings account out leaving the minimum account balance of $100. I called them, and they said it was a write off due to the outstanding debt I had (which I denied). Since then, I switched banks so they couldn't take anymore money from me. I've never heard anything since. If it matters, the statute of limitations for my state is 5 years.

Flash forward to now. I bought a new car 2 weeks ago. I am now realizing the loan is through the bank that I had the private student loan with that drained my savings last year. My question is: since the outstanding private student loan debt and the new car loan are from the same bank, can they repo my car for the debt? If so, is there a way I can switch banks the loan is through to avoid this? I'm unsure how this works - why would they give me a loan if I defaulted with them previously?",finance

personalfinance,New IRS impersonating scam targeting immigrants doing rounds!,"I got a call today morning from a person describing himself as an IRS official (with the number that was actually on the site). He claims  having an arrest warrant under my name for not having provided reasons to IRS for wire transfers I had made to my native country in 2017. He connects me to a sheriff from San Diego who was talking about detaining me in Seattle for 72 hours and puts out three federal rules that I am supposed to follow while am on the call - I should not inform any third party about this, I should not get on the internet or call anyone else. 
 I tell them that I haven’t received any sort of mail from IRS regarding the situation to which they replied saying that the IRS had sent out mails and they got returned since I was out of country for three weeks (which is true). I did start getting slight suspicions around this time but not was still scared.  I tell them that I don’t want to get detained for 72 hours and it doesn’t make any sense since I haven’t made any wire transfers in last year.  The sheriff cited the possibility of identity theft scenario behind wire transfers and gave me another option to hold off the warrant for 72 hours during which they would contact the US embassy near my hometown to go over my local bank transactions.  And that I have to apparently pay a security deposit of 3780 dollars to a Walmart Billing Center which would be refunded once I am found not guilty.  I was supposed to be on the call with them until I pay out the money (half in Walmart and other half in CVS). 
It was at this point that I confirmed it was a scam. I started questioning the “IRS official” to give out whatever information he has on my file like Birth Date and why I should pay in Walmart or Moneygram if it is directed to IRS. The official tells me that the Sheriff would call me again to clarify.  The sheriff called and started threatening me for questioning the officials. All through this, I was messaging my friend. We decided to screw them back. I added him in a conference call with the Sheriff and he tried to act as my attorney.  They fraudsters cut the call immediately. 

I should have known that IRS sends out mails first and they go to mailbox directly instead of getting returned. I panicked. I guess they are targeting immigrants especially those who are back from vacation. 

If you ever get such a call, please remember that,
1.IRS never compels you to pay immediately 
2. Walmart or CVS is never a mode of payment
I cannot imagine how many naive people they would have cheated on, particularly those who are new to the country. 
I have reported the incident to IRS and am sharing it here with the hope of it helping others. This is tax season and pretty sure there are thousands who are going to be affected.",finance

personalfinance,On to the student loans!,"Since October 2017, I've become serious about my financial health, and have been taking saving/investing/being responsible with my money seriously.

Since October I've:
Paid off two credit cards ($1000)
Raised my credit score 50 points
Cash flowed snow tires and a car repair ($1500 all said and done)
Cashflowed Christmas (1st time ever! $500 including travel)

It's not a lot, but I thought I'd share how I did it!

I got a second job on weeknights &amp; Sunday mornings. (Around 15-20 hours a week, bringing home around $180 a week, averaged) The money from this job goes in addition to my minimum payments. 

I used the snowball method. I started with my credit cards, $700, $300. While it doesn't seem like a lot, to someone living paycheck to paycheck, it's very freeing to have those cards in a drawer, sitting at a $0 balance. I plan on continuing using the snowball method with my student loans (100k, private and federal)

I cut dining out. In October, I tracked every penny, and saw that I spent $150 on groceries, and $400 on dining out (Starbucks, fast food, takeaway, drinks, etc). I've set my budget to $175 for groceries and $175 for going out (It's my only social hobby)

By cutting out on dining out, I've been able to cash flow things that would have gone on my credit cards.

This month, I made my first double student loan payment, everything else is getting paid minimum, while I work on getting $2,000 in the bank as a baby emergency fund.

Other ways I'm working on getting more money towards my debt:

I found a bike on trash day, and spent $35 on a tune up and a new chain. When the weather warms up, I plan on riding it to work (3 miles to the day job &amp; 1 mile to the night job), only using my car for late night trips or taking my dogs somewhere.

I'm looking for a roommate. I rented a two bedroom because it was cheaper to have a guest room in my city then pay for a one bedroom. My landlord gave me the okay to look for someone to add to my lease.

I comparison shopped and got my prescriptions &amp; my dogs' monthly treatments on cheaper alternatives. In total, this saved $50 a month.

If all things fall into place, I'll have another $800 or so a month to tackle my debt. If I paid an extra $800 a month on my student loans (and if everything stays the same, income wise) my student loans will be gone in 11 years instead of 25!",finance

# Details (for those interested in anonymous strangers' financial history)

I'm 30, wife is 33. $55k/year solo, $105k/year combined. I'm a junior developer, she's in public education.

This month marks a huge milestone for us. The student loans shown ~~are~~ were my wife's, whose interest rates and balances were much higher than mine (7% vs. my 3%). I decided to avalanche, as I was very motivated to kill that payment. Worth noting that even this was just for the portion of grad school that her father couldn't cover on a payment plan, and he paid 100% cash for undergrad. Yeah, she married down... Since the wedding, however, we've been on our own financially. 

I worked my ass off and came a long a way to get where I am^1 now. I was raised by a single mom with a little brother. Absolutely clueless about wealth building and money management. My entire family leases cars. Some of them have filed bankruptcy multiple times. My point is, I had to learn all of this on my own. All I knew was that I didn't want to end up like my family.

That said, ten years ago I was diving dumpsters for most of my food (and booze) and living in punk houses. I worked at coffee shops and restaurants and made peanuts. I  spent a lot of my money on going to shows and backpacking gear, and the rest was spent on baggies of various illegal substances. My student loans from my halfhearted ""attempt"" at a Fine Arts degree were all defaulted^2 . I was in collections for *library fees*. I had revolving credit in collections. Even if I had a six figure income, I'd have been broke. 

Everything changed when I met the ol' lady. I went from having no faith in the institution of marriage (thrice divorced parents) to *needing a ring*. What the hell? I knew I had to turn everything around and I had a lot of work to do. For some reason, she loved me and didn't care what I ended up doing, as long as I had ambition to excel at it. I was a barista at a late night coffee house. I was getting really sick of getting home at 1 AM and making two to three hundred dollars per week. I started looking at college programs again.

I caught a small break that got the ball rolling. I used a small inheritance from my grandmother (about $1k) to start making good on my debt payments. I made regular installments for six months just to get my loans out of delinquent status and went back to school to learn computer programming. After a year at state school, I decided to try my hand at finding work with an AS. I'm still paying off that one year... I had taken out extra loans for play money while in community college (I was still very stupid). Combined with the uni tuition at 10x what CC cost, and I have a $25k associates degree.

Starting work worked out for me, though. I landed a paid internship, and then a full time job after the wedding. Started at $18/hr full time and I felt rich, but that feeling didn't last long. I blew all my money on stupid crap and quickly became frustrated that the my investment in a new career hadn't yielded bottomless pockets. I would later look back and realize with horror that **I was spending over 10% of my income on video games and PC parts.** The majority of games in my Steam library have 0-2 hours played. I quit playing computer games and starting playing D&amp;D again, and it's so more rewarding than video gaming had been in a decade. At some point, I was just chasing the joy that my dad's SuperNES brought every other weekend, or the old days of LAN parties. It just wasn't bringing me joy anymore. D&amp;D brought back that feeling for whatever reason. I digress.

One day, I watched my friend pull up in a brand new sports car **that he paid for in cash**. Having only ever driven $2k vehicles, I congratulated him and jokingly suggested he must have gotten a promotion and a big bonus or something. He told me that he had been budgeting for ten years and is debt free. He figured out what the payment would be for the car he wanted would be on a six year loan and put that into a money market every month for five years. Due to the buying power of cash, he didn't even spend all of what he saved. He introduced me to budgeting and Dave Ramsey^3 (in spite of Dave's feelings on new cars, it's what he wanted). It's been all uphill for me since then.

I budgeted on my own for a year and half as my wife and I never combined finances. Partially due to laziness on both our ends, but I think mostly because she didn't trust me with money. That realization hurt my ego back then, but now I understand. I still don't understand why she married me in the first place, but that's another story...

In this time I paid off several of my loans while also covering my previous responsibilities. She was initially frustrated by my responses: ""Let me check the budget"" and ""That ain't in the budget."" She'd get these typically when suggesting we go out to eat. 

Wifey officially came on board when I booked our ticket and hotel up front with no credit card for a summer trip. One of her best friends decided to get married in Mexico. I took that as an invitation to send them a card, but it was apparently required that we go because she had attended our wedding as a bridesmaid (FYI, it was 20 miles from her house). So I guessed at how much it would cost, added 20%, and secretly saved for 16 months, and we went for a week. It was worth it 

It's been a wild ride. While I started with Dave Ramsey's book, I've learned a lot on this sub, so thanks for that. =D

The good news is my wife just graduated college last year and so starting this Septmember has begun earning an income for the first time in our relationship, 100% of which has been being applied to our debt. We are down to 26% credit usage now with my score having jumped back up to 700 flat and hers 610 (Fico Scores are about 720 for me and 650 for her).

We should be debt free come June which is why we had originally planned to wait to purchase a vehicle then, but if we can help her mom now without hurting ourselves we would like to.

I currently have one auto loan in my name, but where I have the better credit know I'll qualify for a better rate opposed to if my wife takes on the loan. Could taking on a second auto loan potentially hurt me? Would it be wiser to take on the higher interest rate now under my wife's name, and then look to refinance in a few months when he score improves?

Thanks for any insights and advice.

CryptoCurrency,What if a crypto trading blanket ban comes?,"In the hypothetical case where major countries decide that cryptos are out of control and flatly ban all exchanges and private trading of decentralized coins, would anyone still want to trade them? If so, how could the traders keep injecting fiat easily and anonymously in exchange for cryptos? 

As to why major countries would want to implement a ban, there is the case that with cryptos penetration large enough, states would lose a correspondingly large leverage over their monetary policy. In addition, there is the usual argument that cryptos facilitate money laundering.

As to *how* trading could continue, I see the cash by mail or in person in exchange for cryptos or peer-to-peer exchanges where individual users could use wire transfers to move money directly without intermediary.

Could somebody enlighten me? I often hear that many cryptos can't be taken down because or their decentralized structure but if it becomes very difficult to trade them for fiat their utility appears diminished.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt (repayment options),"Thanks to some quality of life sacrifices followed by my first real career bump, I'm finally in a position to really tackle my student loans safely. I need some advice, since I'm not creative with money at all.

One loan is at a fixed rate 5.5% and will eat up 8% of my savings to pay off immediately. The other one is at a variable rate 6.5% right now and will eat up 90% of my savings to pay off now. So I'd get cleaned out paying off both, but theoretically it is a possibility for my personal net worth being positive for the first time in a decade. It took 3 years to build these funds up, btw.

My credit is good (750+). I do not have any loans out other than student loans. I have a good, but not terribly long employment history (7 years). I invest in a 401K through my company. I have steady income. I want to pursue a Master's.

My options as I see them (the big one has to get refinanced and I know it's long overdue for it):

1) Pay off the small loan and refinance the large one from a variable to a fixed interest rate through SoFi. This is the option I'm pursing right now. I will eat a heavy upfront cost on the small loan but will remove a liability, permanently.
Refinance options for the larger loan (honestly I'm struggling with which would be the best option):

- 5 year term at 5.25% fixed

- 7 year term at 5.75% fixed

Take the money I'd use to pay off the large loan and start investing into an IRA.

2) Keep paying both loans but refinance the large loan to one of the two terms above. Invest in an IRA with the funds I would have used to pay off the small one.

3) Pay them both off right now (just putting this here, I know this isn't the best idea)

4) Consolidate them (I don't see much point in this and would make things worse)",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage with investment $?,"Hi all, hope I can get a decent answer on what to do here.

My wife (32) and I (31)  along with our newborn child are currently 3 years into living in our ""forever home"" and are paying $1300/mo as a mortgage payment, which includes an extra $200/month to get it over with quicker - we are on track to have the house paid off in 9 years. We owe $75k on the house with a 3% interest rate. 

We recently paid off all our bills and have 0 debt. We bring home $140k/yr salary, $25k in savings, and have $140k in an investment account that we were planning on leaving alone until we retire (hopefully at 60).

personalfinance,Debt relief - How can I negotiate with creditors?,"Hi, PF. My fiancee and I are working on getting our debt under control. So far, we are keeping our heads above water, but at the same time, we're hardly making any headway. It's gotten to the point that we decided to seek help. We were close to entering a contract with National Debt Relief, and when reviewing the terms before signing, I had some questions and came to this sub looking for insight. Every post that is specifically about this company has the same advice: you can negotiate on your own; you don't need NDR with their large fee. So, we've decided to try just that. 

We'll begin calling our creditors probably tomorrow, but we don't really know what is reasonable to ask for, other than vague ideas like ""lower interest rate"" or ""some amount of forgiveness"".

Our situation looks like this

* Credit card #1. Chase Bank. ~$12000. ~15% interest.
* Credit card #2. Discover. ~700. ~5% interest (increases to 12% in August).
* Credit card #3. Citi. ~$7000. 0% interest until 2019.
* Credit card #4. Care Credit. ~$750. 0% interest for the next 5 months.

Student loans from Navient:

* Subsidized Student loan #1. $4,752.58. 3.400%.
* Unsubsidized Student loan #1. $7,014.97. 6.800%.
* Subsidized Student loan #2. $4,807.03. 3.860%.
* Unsubsidized Student loan #2. $6,122.92. 3.860%.

We were going to give cards #1, 2, and 3 to National Debt Relief, and they claimed they could take care of all of them over 29 months for ~$14500 including their fee.

What are some specifics that we can ask for when we call these companies? Will the student loans be willing to do anything with us? We're already paying more than the minimum as able. Our combined income is $3400/mo, with about $1700 tied up in rent and utilities.",finance

personalfinance,College student here needing some serious advice about moving out of parents home (not peacefully),"Hello PF, it's my first time posting here. 

Some background about me; I'm currently a Junior enrolled at a university (expected to graduate May 2019). My major is Computer Science (engineering). At the end of this semester I will have completed 99 credit hours and so far my tuition has been paid completely by parents and I've also lived at home for all my college. I haven't had a proper job yet and I have about 1200$ in a bank account (just money I accumulated over the years). I am not in debt at the moment but I also do not have much money. 

For the past year or so things have been really rough at home. There's been intense tension and it's at a tipping point to where I just can't handle it anymore and it's negatively affecting my mental health. I'm convinced that the only reason my dad paid for my tuition this past semester was because I told him I'd pay him back once I was graduated and earning from a full time job (which I intend on doing). I won't go into all the details about my family since this is a finance subreddit, however here is what I need advice on:

I've been thinking once this semester ends that I'll move out of home and be completely self sufficient. I will receive $3k in pell grants and another $1.6k in State grants for tuition. My tuition (cost without any grants) will be 6k per semester so I'd be paying a total of 12k till I graduate. Now on top of the tuition I will also need to pay for rent, food, travel costs(I don't have my own car). Food and travel and other miscellaneous expenses won't be much as I cook home, walk a lot, etc however the thing that worries me is paying rent and also actually getting approved for an apartment. I won't be able to get my parents to cosign the lease since they'll see me moving out as a bridge burning act (I'm 21...). I would also be finding part time retail jobs once this semester is over. And BTW, I don't do drugs or alcohol so that isn't an expense. 


I need advice/pointers as to how I could get my own place and job and how I will be able to sustain it all till I graduate in  May 2019. I am open to taking loans since I'm confident I'll be able to pay them off once I get a full time engineering job, however not sure as to where exactly I could get a loan from (besides the federal Stafford loan which won't be enough to cover everything)

Thank you in advance for any tips and sorry for the long post.

personalfinance,"21, not exactly sure where I fit in on the wiki rules for 18-25. Personal advice would be greatly appreciated.","Hi r/personalfinance,

I'm 21 and currently a junior at a prestigious liberal arts college (typing that makes me feel gross). I'm hoping to go to law school either directly after or 1/2 years after graduating, and my current LSAT score and GPA could possibly get me into a T14 school with significant scholarships, but none of this is guaranteed. I'll be graduating school with about $20k in debt, and my parents with about $80k in student loans for me as well, which I want to help them with, so you can assume $100k in federal loans.

I've about $2000 in a 1.55% interest rate savings account and will see another $1900 coming in within a few weeks from my campus job, but don't work much because of academics. By this May I'll have earned another $700. During the summer, I'll be taking on an internship--ideally I'll be able to net $1000-2000 of the stipend I receive, but I cannot count on that.

I've no credit card debt and barely use the card I have and always pay it off in full. My FICO score is currently a 755. 

Basically, I'm not sure if I should be freaking out about my future or just continue with school and be stingy. I thought about throwing $500 into a Roth IRA with Wealthfront, but I'm scared I'll need as much money in liquid savings as possible for any reason and should just worry about retirement and focus on paying off my student loans once I have an actual job and am not working a few measly hours a week.

investing,Getting into weed ... earlyish? MJX vs. ACT ETFs or other options?,"So, I'd like to jump into the sector as soon as possible, because I don't think it's a stretch to say the market is going to explode as states continue to legalize, but questions remain.  
For example how involved are banks willing to get and how might the fed punish them for skirting federal law.  I found this article talking about the two main US weed ETFs and how they were formed in very different ways.  Basically MJX was a totally unrelated fund until Dec. 2017 when they converted their holdings to MJ business.  This is significant because they didn't need to submit the ETF for approval because the old fund had it. 


ACT on the other hand went through he submission and approval process and holds MJ adjacent, federally legal businesses - medical MJ, cigarette companies - assuming that federal legalization will seem them jump into the recreational market. 


It seems to me like it's a matter of time before US bank drops MJX or at least forces them to restructure holdings in a way that won't draw the ire of the federal government. 
 
I wonder - if US Bank drops custodial status of MJX what happens to the fund and their holdings?

***  
***
    
A ""Fedcoin"" created by the government would surely fail, according to this article (linked at bottom, ref. 1), however... 
***    
***    
**...The fed already controls Ethereum and a bunch of other cryptos.** 
    
***
***
Why would that matter? The NSA and CIA have already been caught trying to create backdoors into our computers and OS's (ie. Windows, Linux). (See references 4 and 5). They could attempt to do the same with blockchain technology, implemented into a crypto that becomes a standard within a few years, like Ethereum or Cardano, for example (ref. 6). The fed is actually funding crypto development (see below), meaning they could influence whether some form of spyware could be implemented into the blockchain. 
***

Also, we must note that **a cryptocurrency that is transparent (public ledger) is great for the government, because they can track your every transaction, and possibly move.** If cash becomes obsolete (the assumed goal of fedcoin), we will have much less control and freedom in the way we can spend money. No more ""tax-free"" cash transactions. **Some countries, like Italy and Spain, have already banned cash transactions above 1000 euros (~$1200).** (ref. 11 and 12). 
***

They could also potentially program purchase restrictions as a smart contract (ie. didn't pay your taxes? You can't buy 'luxury' goods like movie tickets, you can only buy food and pay rent. Too fat? Can't buy sugar. Not a police officer? Can't buy ammo... transaction rejected for this Ethereum address... etc).
***

China and Russia can ban cryptos (communist harsh world approach) but the US is trickier. Just like controlling hearts and minds with media (alot more effective than force), the US has a more efficient plan. They're just investing into development of cryptos. That way they don't need to make a fedcoin, they will have influence over existing coins. The cryptos we love and stand behind WILL BE the fedcoins.
***


&gt;""The Federal Reserve already is the primary investor of basically every cryptocurrency and blockchain project in existence. While in a previous article I dug into their investment arm the Digital Currency Group and how they heavily funded operations like Coinbase, Coindesk, Kraken, Ripple, I’ve since discovered the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. (DTCC): an open member of the Federal Reserve. They are responsible for the remaining spectrum of the blockchain, including Ethereum.""
***


&gt;**""There will be no FEDcoin, however there will be an attempted global central bank currency that no one realizes is centralized until it is too late.""**
***
***

**Note:** 
I hope I'm terribly wrong about this. I'm both all-in into cryptos, and hate the thought of more government control. But I also have heard people talking about a ""one-world currency"" conspiracy for a long time, and if it would be true, this theory is not far fetched at all.
***

If anyone has any ideas to prove this wrong, or on how to stop it from becoming true, please do post. 
***

The article in in ref. 10 suggests the best response will be ""a better technology that sprints forward and leaves those who wish to ‘tame’ it coughing on its dust."", however how would we know that the cryptocurrency(ies) we come to adopt are 100% safe?
***
***



**TLDR:** 
The Fed is funding cryptos so they can control them and also potentially install / program spyware into the blockchain. The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp (DTCC) is an open member of the federal reserve, as is the Digital Currency Group (DCG). Through these entities the Federal Reserve has funded and built the cryptocurrency market. Better technology can prevent this, but how would we know if our favorite crypto is 100% safe?

That is, as inflation works it's way through the economy, commodities (I'd expect) would be a lagging market, not sinking until well into a recession and inflation taming monetary policy.

CryptoCurrency,"My biggest regret, a saved email from 2013.","12/20/13 K: Hey man, it's K. Is your name D? Anyway...getting money onto BTC-e can be tricky if you are trying to deposit USD. I kind of just had to learn by trial an error because I didn't know anyone that could teach me, because i am the only one that invests in crypto currency that I know.

Anyway, coinbase is probably the best bitcoin wallet service in the United States. It is definitely the largest and most reputable. Use this referral link: Once you sign up using this link, it will give us both some free money after you have purchased some bitcoins. The process takes a little while to get all started up, but it is worth it because it is so easy to use after. You can instantly buy bitcoins, and then use those bitcoins to send to BTC-E to purchase whatever other coins you want. I invest pretty heavily in LTC. The only way I have been able to do that is by buying bitcoins on coinbase, and then sending them to btc-e. Let me know if this works for you..

K: Let me know if the email reached you

D: Yep. I got it. Two to three days for the deposit verification into my bank account. Thanks for the advice. I take it you work in finance?

K: Yeah I do :). Coinbase takes a bit for the verification process but it is super easy to use after that. When you sell bitcoins, they just deposit the money right back into your bank account. It's the easiest service that I have found that is reputable.

D: Have you ever tried trading for small margins? I made about 0.60 USD since I started last night. I got my initial funding by mining FTC. I'm trading BTC.

D: Actually up to 10.81 after my last trade. Got in at 625 and sold at 639.

K: I mainly buy and hold for long term. I bought some NMC to flip, but it dropped in value steeply so im still holding it. I buy more every time it dips. Sent via wireless, please excuse any typos...

D: Cool. No worry about typos. I type all day at work so don't mind as well. I give up on accuracy at 5. My friends also aren't very much into crytpo currencies. I like the technical aspect but I'm more interested in trading on BTC-E. I must have watched about 12 hours of bitcoinwisdom since yesterday. It was my first time analyzing real time data. I can't believe how much info you can obtain just from identifying patterns. I have a quick question about a 401k if you don't mind. So far my year to date is 26%, is that good?

K: Yes, very good. You must have had it set up aggressively with the investing choices (which is better to do when you are young). Good stock market returns are around 12% so you are more than double, but don't be surprised if there is a correction to lower on the returns there too.

D: Yes. I'm over 50% in small cap and am young. Is there anyway to avoid that correction by reallocating?

K: Nah, just leave it. At least you have a 401k, most people are paycheck to paycheck

D: Defiantly. I can't imagine how some of my co-workers get by paying overdraft fees each month. Have a good night. I'll let you know when I buy some coins on that site.

K: Cool, let me know. Let's make some money! :)

12/22/13 D: Howdy K, I'm still waiting on the deposits in my bank account by Coinbase. Thanks for the referral link, I'm looking forward to that free $5 of BTC. Up to $12.30 USD on BTCE, looking to break $13 tonight. Can't wait to get some more trading funds.

K: It takes a bit for the initial deposit. I think it took my bank almost a week :(. Once you are done though everything is quick. If you add a credit card too, you can buy up to 10 btc instantly per week

D: Awesome. Have any suggestions? (pic) attaches picture of small gains trade history

K: What do you mean by sugggestions? Like on your trading?

K: Can you deposit more money? It looks like you aren't fully able to enjoy the full gains of your trades because the amounts that you are trading are a little small. If possible I would suggest buying 1 btc when the price is the lowest of the day, and then trade from there..

K: Also i would stay away from ftc for time being

12/24/13 K: Hey bud, i just got some free money from coinbase :) did you get it too? Pretty cool huh?

D: Yes sir. 4 days for my order to fill, can't wait.

12/25/13 D: Merry Christmas!

K: Merry xmas! If you add a credit card you can instant buy up to 10btc. What other coins are you buying right now? I mainly just have BTC and LTC

D: Does the credit card have to be a Visa? I'm mining about 8 FTC per day and trading for BTC at market. Then I trade BTC/USD for 0.10 - 0.40 profits. Working on a spreadsheet right now which you can see if you are interested.

D: spreadsheet sends corny orange and grey spreadsheet

K: Think it can be mastercard or amex too...

K: Nice LTC rally today :). I just picked up more LTC yesterday too

D: I tried adding a mastercard and discover but it wouldn't work. I've been watching the rally. Waiting to buy in to BTC at $656.

K: Shit that sucks, email support and ask if they accept mastercard? I find that odd that they would only accept visa

D: No worries. Deposit should clear 12/31

12/29/2013 K: Hows it going? Did you get your btc?

D: Hey K. Not yet, they will be deposited 12/31. Bought at $651

K: Nice so you are already up :)

K: How much did you buy? You should buy some and hold long term if possible too

1/2/2014 D: Happy New Year, K. I only bought 0.2 BTC for about $131. I'm at a total balance of $179.07. Started mining FTC again for the few extra dollars per day.

I think I read somewhere that there is a cap of 21 million BTC that will ever be in existence. 21 million on the internet is subtle considering how many views cat videos get on youtube. 21 million out 7 billion people is even smaller. Sometimes I find it hard to imagine millions and billions but I always think about this one thing: 1 million seconds is about 11 days, 1 billion seconds around 31 years. I'm very optimistic about the long term. Probably going to set aside at least 1 BTC in the near future.

Have you ever seen BTC listed on ebay? I created an auction yesterday for 0.1 BTC, $120.00. It sold within 3 hours but the buyer flaked out after I told them they would be receiving the BTC-E redeemable code in the mail. They created a dispute stating that the ebay/pal accounts were accessed by an unauthorized third party which is currently in process. I didn't lose anything and actually sold back the 0.1 at $775 after buying at $740 last night. I'm considering re-listing some BTC on Ebay but don't want to deal with reversed payments. Have any insight?

K: I heard ebay can be a nightmare with sellers getting scammed by buyers with chargebacks. If you are going to do it, I would recommend selling maybe paper wallets only, that you actually have to mail to them. That way you can have a tracking number for your shipping. If you want to sell through paypal, be careful, I think any mention of crypto currency can get your account frozen. Not positive about that though. Try selling to people on the forums, I think that would be easy. Honestly, I think just buying what you can and holding long is the best option to make the best returns. Look how the market has gone today D

K: 21 million BTC is not even enough btc for each person in my state to have 1, let alone the United States, or the entire world. As long as the demand stays high, the price could become astronomical if some major players like wall street enter the game. Just think, if Wall Street threw like 100 mill at Bitcoins (which is not that far-fetched), the price would probably jump to like 3-4k per BTC after that 1 day alone…

D: I don't think I'm going to sell anything else on Ebay until I come up with a better way of protecting against charge backs. The market has been awesome today.

D: That's very true. I think my next purchase will be 0.5 BTC to keep in my wallet.

K: Have you seen the stuff on zerocoin? Looks interesting, should be out this year...there has been a lotta hype around it..

D: Haven't heard anything about it until just reading an article now. Looks interesting and they make a good argument about anonymity. I only read over it briefly, but it appears what they're proposing would add an additional transaction fee the the process. Cool concept. Are you good with candlestick charts and patterns?

K: Somewhat. I learned them in college but stopped using them until now, so I am pretty rusty…I get the concepts and all, but I am not a professional at them by any means. I saw my buddies wallet the other day…he is pretty stacked. Over 250btc and over 1000 LTC!

D: That is pretty stacked. About 500k stacked, right? Are you familiar with the creator(s) of bitcoin ""Satoshi Nakamoto""? Is it actually one person? There are quite a few claims as to who or whom Satoshi may be.

K: Im not familiar, i heard it was a team of people under that one name

D: I wonder if it was created by a goverment. Like some NSA type agency. Kinda like how the darknet started off as a Navy project.

K: Nah I doubt it. Government wouldn't create something that could possibly pose a threat to its own currency.

D: That's a good point. The future of BTC is exciting.

1/6/2014 D: Started trading NMC recently. Check ou the spreadsheet attaches another shitsheet Still just testing the water before I start making bigger trades. Buy any more BTC/LTC lately?

K: Cool man.. Year i got some LTC at $16 right before it went back up :)

1/7/2014 D: Nice buy. Catch the market today? China's equivalent of Ebay banned the sell of btc, ltc, mining gear, etc.

My understanding on of China: China’s central bank regulated the virtual currency for the first time on Dec. 5 by banning financial institutions and payment providers from conducting transactions in the virtual currency

Chinese central bank officials told third-party payment service providers to stop offering clearing services to online Bitcoin exchanges

China's Ebay bans sell of BTC in accordance to the central bank's ban effective Jan. 31. Acting as a clearing house of BTC.

I'm now $180 long NMC. I might invest 1k soon on BTC, any thoughts on an upcoming entry point?

K: Hmmm not quite sure on entry point. I am in the red as of today on NMC. Im trying to get it back to 0.01 btc to convert my nmc back to btc, i missed it on the last push. If you are investing 1k and holding long, then any of the daily ups and downs dont matter because in the long run we hope it will be way up. If i were you, i would just wait for a big red candle and then try to by at the bottom. Maybe $800/btc is good?

K: The part that sucks is that it seems like BTC value works so hard to creep up and up slowly, and right when it seems like it is going to pick up some momentum, BAM! More bad news comes out and slams the market. This cycle seems to keep repeating over and over right now…

1/9/14 K: I got 2 more btc :)

1/27/14 D: Sorry, haven't check this email account for a few weeks. Been working a lot of OT. What price did you buy in at on 1/9? I just sold a majority of my coins for cash. I picked up 3 LTC at 19.50 though. What's gonna happen 2/1/14?

Also, do you know how long it would take for a tax return check if you have your taxes in prior to the 31st? I finished those 2 weeks ago if it matters.

The other day the dow finished pretty low. Do you have any thoughts about the US economy over the next 6-12 months?

K: What’s up man…huge dump off of BTC right now on almost all exchanges (except gox which is bs anyway). I bought some more LTC at around $19 too.

I am holding all for long haul, although it would have been profitable to sell this morning, and re-buy after this dump off. I have no idea what is going to happen on 2/1. Last time when senate met, everyone thought the party was over, and then there was a huge rally in prices instead.

I am trying to figure out the right price to buy more btc right now… what do you think?

D: Sorry. Copied and pasted instead of attaching the pic. I think we'll have to see if it breaks that support. What about the arrest of that guy at bitinstant? *attaches picture of BTC 4h chart with a random line pointing downward

K: I don’t think that one arrest will tank the market like that. I am wondering if the confiscated silk road funds are being trickled through the exchanges by the feds. It seems weird the sell off right now. It almost seems systematic. Like there is a huge sell off that clears all the buy orders. Then it is calm for a few minutes, then repeat. Really strange…

D: But I wonder how they brought charges on him? Could they hold anyone accountable who sold BTC to a person using it to buy drugs on silk road? If the Feds are selling that would explain it. They seized 144,000 and they're saying the owner of silkroad may have 600,000 stashed in a wallet.

K: I think the number is more like 30,000 btc

D: The spokesperson says the approximately 26,000 Bitcoins seized are just the ones that were held in Silk Road accounts. In other words, it’s Silk Road users’ Bitcoin. The FBI has not been able to get to Ulbricht’s personal Bitcoin yet. “That’s like another $80 million worth,” she said, explaining that it was held separately and is encrypted. If that is indeed what he’s holding, that’s close to 600,000 Bitcoin all together or about 5% of all Bitcoin currently in existence. (Update 10-25: The FBI says it’s seized 144,000 Bitcoins, or about $28 million, that it believes belong to Ross Ulbricht.)

K: I don’t understand how they were able to confiscate them, when bitcoins are not yet considered money, so they shouldn’t fall under forfeiture rules…

1/17/18 - D: Wish you the best K and hope you held those coins longer than I did.

personalfinance,[HOUSING] Buying my parent's home out. Is this a good idea? NYC,"To give you some background: 

I'm currently 27 years old in NYC and I'm thinking about buying my parent's home out. The reasons are two-fold: 

1. My father is currently 62 years old and my mother is 52 years old. They've been struggling from paycheck to paycheck and I've been helping them out for a while. As my father's age, he would qualify for medicaid and nursing home assistance. However, to involve the ""medicaid"" claw-back rule, we need to have them ""spend down"" their assets. This is for estate-planning.

2. In addition, I would get a better mortgage interest rate with my income. 

Currently the house is worth $500k. My parents have agreed to give me a gift of equity of $150k. They have a remaining $350k on their mortgage. I would buy the property from them. I would then pay down the loan $50k and take out a mortgage of $300k for 30 years. 

Do you guys think this is a good idea? My parents have agreed to be ""tenants"" and pay for the utilities. I would pay for the mortgage (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) and the water bill. 

My payment at a 30 year fixed rate conventional loan around 4.3% would be $2,124.55


1. Mortgage $2,124.55
2. Rental Income ($1,525) (Basement and first floor tenant) 
3. Net payment out of my pocket is $599.55
4. Plus the water bill $300 (on average) 
5. Total is $899.55


6. Edit: To clarify, I currently live with them. So my rent would be $899.55.

7. My current income is $60k and I have the following assets: 

a. Savings $80K 
b. 401K $40K vested
c. IRA $30K 


I would use my savings to paydown the home. Do you think this is a good idea?",finance
personalfinance,Tips on getting late student loan payments removed?,"Hello all,

Just to cover my bases I've browsed through the [Debt Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt). To answer the questions there.

- Are these debts mine to pay?

    Yes, undeniably.

- Can I reduce the principal of my debts, or the interest rates?

    No, I've contacted them about this.

- I need more money to be able to pay off these debts

   Already implemented. I'm not *currently* having trouble paying them.

- What's the best way to pay down my debt?

    Kinda irrelevant to my question. But I'm implementing the snowball method.

So on to the actual question. Back in '13/'14 I was having some financial trouble. I wasn't necessarily bad with money. I just didn't have any. So I ended up missing 7 payments which, since I have 13 individual loans with two student loan agencies, ended up being... a lot of missed payments. Currently my on time payment history sits at 86%. 

I'm 12 points away from excellent credit. I was debating ways on trying to make that final push. One of the ways I was considering was to contact them and see if there was any way I could get them to remove the missed payments from my report. So...

1. Is this reasonable?

2. Would they likely be willing to provide me with an avenue to do this?

3. Would it hurt my credit to ask?

4. Would offering to pay back the missed payments on top of my current payments make them more disposed to help me?

5. Am I just stuck waiting until '21 for those to fall off my credit report?

personalfinance,Public Service Loan Forgiveness,"I'm in the middle of my 8th year as a public school teacher. I have about $33,000 in subsidized and unsubsidized student loans, which I was originally overpaying on, and then moved to a graduated repayment plan, with repayment over 30 years. I currently pay about $240 per month combined. I was under the impression that I would be able to apply for the PSLF program after completing 120 payments while continuing to work full-time in education the whole time, which would have happened about two years from today. I wasn't sure that my graduated payments would still qualify since their website mentioned other repayment plans but not mine specifically.

Today, I called to confirm with FedLoan Servicing. My account is not with them, but I spoke with an adviser. She asked me questions about my tax filing status (married/joint), our household income (about $180k), and determined that I am not and will never be eligible for PSLF because ""you need to be considered under financial hardship for the duration of the 120 payments."" Nothing on their website, nor any PSLF forms, indicate anything about income. Is there actually an upper income limit? According to their representative, even if we filed taxes separately, I still make too much money (I live and work in an expensive urban area that compensates teachers well). Does anybody have experience with loan forgiveness? https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/special-programs/pslf/pslf-completing-ecf

Additionally, my last hope is partial forgiveness through this program: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher
I am considered HQ and work in a high-need subject area with low-income students. I'd like to hear if anybody has any insight about this program either.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone! Any IBR or RPAYE plan would have me paying quadruple digits every month. My spouse and I have determined that we will refinance for a lower rate and pay off aggressively.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off some of my CC debt or buy a car for my wife?,"Hey PF! Long time reader who needs help breaking this all down. I'm in a deep hole and need help making a budget or getting some advice to climb out of it. I currently have about $21.7k in CC debt and just borrowed $5.5k from my 401k to pay off some CC. My wife's car is an old 2007 Versa with 300k miles and is pretty close to dying. I give it maybe a year left. This morning I was wondering if I should just get her a decent car with the money or pay off some of my CC debt. We keep our finances separate although we are both extremely transparent with our accounts and financial info. Here are the numbers:

**Credit Cards:**

CC #1 - Balance: $7,080.00 - Minimum Payment: $173.00 - Interest Rate: 17.24%

CC #2 - Balance: $4,921.00 - Minimum Payment: $113.00 - Interest Rate: 23.99%

CC #3 - Balance: $2,008.00 - Minimum Payment: $61.00 - Interest Rate: 23.24%

CC #4 - Balance: $1,849.00 - Minimum Payment: $56.00 - Interest Rate: 22.00%

CC #5 - Balance: $1,825.00 - Minimum Payment: $53.70 - Interest Rate: 24.24%

CC #6 - Balance: $1,255.00 - Minimum Payment: $31.00 - Interest Rate: 16.40%

CC #7 - Balance: $1,215.00 - Minimum Payment: $43.00 - Interest Rate: 27.99%

CC #8 - Balance: $648.00    - Minimum Payment: $30.00 - Interest Rate: 20.49%

CC #9 - Balance: $300.00    - Minimum Payment: $PIF every month

CC #10 - Balance: $166.00  - Minimum Payment: $25.00 - Interest Rate: 25.74%

Total Balance: $21,567.00 ----Total Minimums: $585.00/month

**Monthly Expenses:**

Car Payment: $421.00

Fuel: $150.00

Insurance (2 cars and renters) - $197 (best rate I have found)

Life Insurance for 2: $79.00

Utilities: $130.00

Rent: $90.00

Internet: $65.00

Netflix: $13.00 (we disconnected cable a while ago)

Phone: $165

I don't know what else I am forgetting and I checked my monthly statement to see if I had any other expenses. 

Total Monthly Expenses: $1,890.70

**Income:** 

Monthly Income after taxes: $2,152.00 (Already deducted bi-weekly payment of $49 for 401k loan.)

I currently drive a Civic and had some negative equity on my last car rolled into it. I wouldn't be able to sell it for what I owe and if I did sell, I'd still owe about $4k. 

So should I pay off some debt or get a car for my wife? I was actually going to give her $1,600 to payoff the rest of her school. Once she graduates and finds a job (around May) she will be making about $13/hr and by the end of the year should be around $15/hr. I'm not counting on it of course since anything can happen and you don't want to count your chickens before they hatch. 

Thanks for the advice and I am so sorry for this extremely long post.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I went over my statement for the last 31 days and noticed I spent $250 in junk food and vending machines. I will be cutting that out immediately since that's money that should have been for bills.",finance

personalfinance,Sudden medical bills ($10K) and surgery while trying to control Credit Card and loan debt; guidance needed,"After 3 ER visits, I (31F) have sudden $10K in medical bills. At this point, I need surgery (costs around $5K AFTER insurance), so total is now +$15K; however, I have $14K in CC debt ($500/mo. total), $18K in loans ($480/mo. total for personal and school) and $27K auto loan ($500/mo.). I was told I can trade in my car (2017 Honda accord) and get a used one, but I don't understand how that would help (can someone help me understand?). Also, can I avoid taking out another loan to pay medical bills (they don't have any interest rate, right?) or avoid opening credit cards. Thank you for taking the time to read this and helping me (or pointing me in the right direction).",finance
personalfinance,Use ESPP to accelerate debt payoff?,"I'm considering whether it would be a good idea to divert **some** of my debt snowball to an ESPP to accelerate paying off my car loan, and if I'm right in my assumptions I think it will end up working in my favor - wanted to get the thoughts on from the /r/pf community though first.

Basic financial information:

* For 2018 *taxable* income is going to be around 74k. Filing as HoH, that puts me in the 22% bracket and around $8k from the 24%.
* The total amount of money I'm throwing at the snowball is $2500/month

Minimum monthly payments on debt:

* Motorcyle Loan: $393.30
* Car Loan: $639.55
* Credit card debt: ~$450.

In general, I'm following the Avalanche method for the snowball, with the following modifications:

* $350 of the credit card debt is going towards the balance of a 0% promotional financing (balance transfer and furniture purchase). The minimum payments are far lower than $350, but this is what I need to pay to have it paid off prior to the promo expiration.
* The car loan is actually the lowest interest rate (7.79%) other than the promo balance (the rest is mid-teens or lower), however due to it being the highest payment, having negative equity (so I can't refinance it), and needing a bigger vehicle within the next year, I want it paid down as fast as possible (Don't do what I did kids and roll negative equity in to a super-long-term car loan. Lesson learned.). I know I'll end up paying more interest over paying off all of the debt, but it's still substantially less than if I was just making minimum payments, and I'm set on paying this off ASAP.

Now, on the the ESPP.

It's a new offering so some of the details I don't have (and won't until 2/1), but here's what I do know and what I'm assuming for now (if the assumptions don't pan out, then this may not be an option anyway).

* 15% discount, with lookback
* Assumption: 6 month purchase period
* Assumption: Can sell the stock as soon as it's purchased and credited
* Assumption: 10% of salary can be attributed to ESPP

With those assumptions, I would have at minimum a 17-almost-18% return upon selling the stocks, unless the stock value goes up during the 6 month period - at which case, the return also goes up thanks to the lookback.

If my assumptions are correct, my thought is to max my ESPP contribution (even if the maximum contribution amount is higher than 10%), and reduce the debt snowball amount by the contribution amount. When the ESPP purchases stock, sell it off right away, putting aside 22% of **just** the profit for taxes and putting the rest in to the snowball. 

Does this sound like a sound idea? Seems like even after taxes are set aside from the profit, I should be getting back more from selling the ESPP than the savings from smaller principle balance, even more so as I use the lump sum to boost the snowball. Am I missing anything?",finance

I want to be able to make the right choice now so that I can build a life without fear of student loans and insurmountable debt. If you could please help, that would be amazing.

personalfinance,TSP Retirement or Student Loans,"Hi PF,
I've been debating about how to best utilize my income, and I'm stuck between whether I should focus on retirement or student loans. I'm just going to put some other information because I'm not sure if it matters or not, but the barebones info will be at the top.

I currently work for the government, and have been here for about 6 months. It's not my idea of fun and I want to get out ASAP, but the TSP matching vests after 3 years, so I'm willing to put in the time to get that (not really, but financially it makes sense). I already am putting 5% in to get the full match.

My plan after that is to work full time on a business, which provides very little in the way of retirement.

I currently have about $27k in student loans, 90% of which is federal. The interest on these loans average out to about 4.0%.

After all expenses, my extra income is about $1000/month. And then those sweet two extra paychecks.

If I'm aggressively paying off my loans, I calculated the pay off date to be about Sept. 2019.

Since I'm planning on leaving behind a very generous retirement plan in the future, should I be throwing my money into the TSP and paying the minimum on my loans? Or should I be paying off my loans aggressively, when at the end of it all, I'll only have about 6 months to really contribute to my TSP before I leave? Or a mix?

--

Other Information:

My boyfriend and I live together and currently make a combined $110k, with a take home of about $5.6k/month ($3.4k from me, $2.2k from him). All our expenses in our high COL area (yay for $1600 rent) come out to be about $3k/month, which leaves us with $2.6k/month to play with.

My boyfriend has about $60k in student loans, with interest averaging 6.2%.

We only have about $2.2k in emergency funds and am looking to add about $400/month, so that leaves about $2.2k/month in extra income.

We keep our finances separate, but I pay for everything except my boyfriend's gas money, and our food. So I allocated him to use about $500/month for those, $400/month in savings, and the rest of his income to his loans (about $1.3k/month). His retirement plans isn't the greatest, so he only puts in 4% (matched $0.30 on the dollar).

I control the finances for both of us, so I basically have free reign to say who pays for what bills. Such that, I can make it so that I'm throwing a full $18.5k into my TSP if I wanted to.

What's the best way to use our money? Thanks :)",finance
personalfinance,Paying Off Student Loans By Targeting Maximum Principle Reduction? (Adjusted Avalanche),"**TL;DR: I have multiple loans with the same interest rate that the interest is not currently capitalizing on. Should I pay the one with the lowest unpaid interest first, so I'm reducing the principle by as much as possible?**

Hey everyone. I've been working towards paying off my student debt, and am in a situation I haven't been able to find addressed here. Currently, my student loans are in deferment as I'm attending grad school. There are no minimum payments, but I'm still paying off what I can and want to do it in an optimal fashion. I understand the avalanche method is the way to go, but there are multiple loans with the same interest. Again, I know it doesn't matter which loan is paid at this point, but the trick is because the loans are in deferment, interest is not being capitalized. To put some (notional) numbers to this:

* Loan 1: $5,000 principle, 6.8% interest rate, $2000 unpaid interest
* Loan 2: $10,000 principle, 6.8% interest rate, $5000 unpaid interest
* Loan 3: $15,000 principle, 6.8% interest rate, $0 unpaid interest

The unpaid interest will only be capitalized once I leave deferment on graduation. My lender allows me to choose how my payments are distributed because they're all above the minimum payment of 0. So far, I've been paying at least $600 a month on Loan 3. The rational is this reduces the capital that is currently having the interest applied to it, and so should reduce the total amount in the long run. Once that's paid off (assuming I'm still in deferment), I'd then move to Loan 2 to see if I can start shrinking its principle before the interest is capitalized. Is this an accurate way of thinking?",finance

energy,What happens to the energy sector of interest rates go up?,"I haven't seen any speculation about this on r/energy but thought some of you would have insight given your knowledge of the economics of energy.

personalfinance,Student Loans and Credit Score,"TLDR: Pay loans in full or try to boost credit score  at minimal cost

INFO: Defaulted on student loans (dumb I know), resulting in my credit score plummeting to low 500s. Roughly a year ago I started paying them back. I managed to save up the full amount (8k, 6.8% interest rate).

Now this is where I would appreciate some advice. Even though I know you should never keep debt around to help credit score, I was wondering if I could pay a huge chunk, say 95%, and then keep making the small monthly payments to increase my on-time payments which is poor on my credit score. OR would it look better to just pay them in full and forget it?

personalfinance,How can I calculate how soon my student loans will be payed off?,"I have 2 loans, lets say one is $7000 with 4.29% interest and one is $3000 with 3.76% interest. I have never taken the steps to consolidating them but they are handled by the same loan service. So the amount given to me to pay each month is made up of both loans, like $30 for one and $80 for the other. 

My question is, since I pay more than the $110 each month how I can calculate how much is going into each loan so I can track my own payoff date? Or is there an easier way to do this? I'm mostly confused by the different interest rates for the two loans. Also, if anyone can help me understand how to include the interest rates in calculating months til payoff I would greatly appreciate it. I would like to make something that will automatically show me the total depending on how much I pay each month, in case I ever have enough money to pay off a larger chunk at once.",finance
personalfinance,"[Planning] Got lucky on a rental property, need opinion on what to do","Hi Guys,

We got lucky and purchased an 8 unit apartment in a pretty nice area in Southern California for $2m back in 2009. We still have about $906k in mortgage on this property.

Our rental income is about $200k / year, but after expenses, our income (without depreciation) is about $60k. If we include depreciation, our reported net income is $6k.

If were to do a comp in our area, similar apartment units will now sell for about $5m - $6m.

While discussing this on another subreddit, /u/Richralph mentioned that (assuming $6m valuation) my rental yield is only 0.1%, which is rather stupid. 

If we were to sell it and try to reinvest in a different asset class, we would have to pay a significant Federal and State taxes (50%+), which I don't really comprihend on the amounts involved...

My question is:

1. Should I look at this investment differently? Judge the return by our original purchase price ($2m)? If we use this, our rental yield would be close to 10%, which is very respectable.

2. Should we really bite the bullet and sell the property to reinvest and pay the tax man? 

3. Should we 1031 exchange into another property, but judging from the property in our area, there's nothing good that we can get that's below 20 GRM (Gross Rent Multiplier). 

4. Do nothing. And keep working at this apartment. Any repairs on this building would put us in the negatives for reportable income.

5. Something else we're missing?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,APTC: Federal or State Credit?,"Please pardon my gross ignorance, but just trying to understand the APTC. I reported an estimated income of $27k for 2018, and was approved for an APTC of $451 a month ($5412/annually) What I am trying to understand is if this credit comes off my federal tax liability, or just my state? It seems to me that if it just comes from state, my liability won't be nearly sufficient to cover the credit, and I'll end up owing money come tax season. Any advice/clarification would be much appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment,"Repost because this got buried.

Hey /r/personalfinance friends! I need a second opinion on the best way to tackle my student loans, car payment, and savings. I've been following this sub for a few years now and I know the sidebar rules. AKA have an emergency fund, contribute to 401k, pay down credit cards etc....I feel that my situation has multiple routes to choose from so I would appreciate any input from you lovely people. See the breakdown below: 

**Gross Salary @ $60k/year, paid weekly @ $706**

-Here is what is taken out of my weekly check:


* 8% 401k contribution matched at 6%

* Health &amp; Dental Insurance

* Taxes

*  $100 auto drafted to my personal savings account.



**Expenses are roughly $2300/month without any debt payments.** I use YNAB and track everything diligently. I can provide a more detailed breakdown if requested. Also, I live alone in a 1 bedroom apartment. 


**Savings:**

* $4000 in a Ally account @ 1.25% (Emergency Fund)

* $1000 in my personal savings

**Debts:** 

* Credit Cards: $1500 - To be paid off in the next month

* Car Payment Starting Feb '18: $316/month @1.9% for 60 months. 

**Federal Student Loans:** Currently on income-based repayment. Minimum $55/month til 11/18

* Loan 124: $1870 @ 3.15%
* Loan 125: $5603 @ 3.15%
* Loan 126: $603 @ 6.55%  
* Loan 127: $5616 @ 3.61%
* Loan 128: $2205 @ 3.61%
* Loan 129: $5511 @ 4.41%
* Loan 130: $2220 @ 4.41%
* Loan 132: $21,000 @5.59%
* Loan 133: $21,000 @5.06%

**The Gameplan:**

I am expecting a total loss check for my totaled car for $3200 in the next couple weeks and planning on using that to pay for my new car tag &amp; 6 months of insurance which will roughly be about $1200. The remaining money will pay off credit cards. I also plan to use any tax refund money to go towards paying off the 6.55% student loan and add more into the Ally e-fund. I know I should pay off the highest interest debt first but I'm wondering if that really is the best course of action. See questions below:

1. Should I tackle the lower interest loans (124-130) first and then refinance through SoFi for Loans 132 &amp; 133 to **hopefully** get an interest rate 2-4%?  
1. Or should I hit Loan 132 hard for the next couple years while the others accrue interest?  
1. My car interest rate is really low and paying it off early doesn't sound like the best use of my money. However, it would reduce the length I have to pay $316/month. 
1. Am I good at keeping my emergency fund where it's at considering I have the debt to pay or should I get it up to $7000? 

What's the best course of action here? Thanks Friends!",finance

Banking,"Should I switch from Capital One 360 to NFCU? [USA, FL]","I'm 23 years old and about to start my first full time job as a registered nurse, making about ~$60K per year on nights. Consequently, I want to make sure I'm getting the most bang for my buck in terms of bank accounts and interest. For years I had Wells Fargo because they had an agreement with my university, and upon realizing I was getting basically zero return on my money, I closed my accounts with them and opened both a savings and a checking account through Capital One 360. While I know Ally has higher savings account yield, I had the goal in mind of eventually saving up to $10,000 so I could transfer it into a Capital One 360 MMA with a 1.3% APY. I also wasn't totally keen on the idea of a completely online bank; Capital One at least has physical branches where I can receive some assistance if need be. 

However, I've been thinking about Navy Federal Credit Union due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews I've seen about it on here and because I much prefer the idea of a credit union to a big bank - smaller, owned by their consumers, (hopefully) better customer service. My father served 9 years active duty as an Air Force doctor, so I have an in for any military bank I want. I would appreciate advice on whether I should just stay where I am (I've had no issues with Capital One 360 thus far, after all), or if I should make the switch. I've also heard NFCU has very good loan rates, and if I decide to buy a house in the future, I want to borrow from somewhere that's familiar with me. 

Other random thoughts on NFCU:
-I have a dream of eventually joining the reserves as a nurse, and having a military-friendly bank would be very helpful
-They also seem to have decent credit card deals

Any and all feedback is appreciated! Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"Government job, might be temporarily unemployed, need to make money in the meantime","SO first off, everything is still up in the air, but a while back I was hired for a job funded by the federal government, and I am set to begin next week. Well, apparently there may be a government shutdown if Congress can't get their shit together by Friday, and because I haven't officially started my job yet, I won't have any retrograde pay when the hypothetical shutdown is over. However, my job is still secure, and I will be able to start whenever the government resumes.

I just moved to a new city in the event that the government shuts down, I will need to find a way to make money temporarily but I am unsure of where to start. Shutdowns haven't lasted any more than 3 weeks, which is too short of time to pick up a bar or restaurant job. I thought about Uber, but I am worried about wearing down my car doing that. 

Rent is about 700/mo, and I have about 40k in savings, which is a good amount I think, but I do not want to get into the habit of pulling from my savings or borrowing from family members. I also want to be able to live comfortably enough to go out and meet people without eating up my savings. Any job recommendations or tips would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Unexpected inheritance; Down payment or debt payment?,"This is a throwaway account for privacy.

The long and short of it is that I unexpectedly inherited $10,000 and I’m conflicted about how best to use it. Due to a lot of emotion wrapped up in the acquisition of this money, it is currently sitting in a savings account at 1.25% interest until I can figure out the most practical thing to do with it.

This is a multifaceted problem, and my questions require a lot of background, so please bear with me.

* The money comes from the dissolution of my maternal grandfather’s estate in Kansas, and I live in Southern California. Would I need to pay any taxes on this? I haven’t found anything saying I do, but I want to be sure. How much would I be expected to pay?

* My grandfather worked very hard and lived very simply his whole life to be able to give his children something and because this money comes from the sale of the farm he loved so dearly (and I only received by way of my mother’s early and untimely death), my emotional reaction is to invest this into my first home in order to have a tangible investment in my family’s future, partially funded by my family’s history, thereby somewhat extending his legacy. While I didn’t know him well due to familial animosity, I always respected what he did for his family. However, it doesn’t really feel like my money, so I want to be very responsible with how I use it. The inheritance would only be anywhere from 1/5-1/3 of a down payment in my area, and, theoretically, if my husband and I save a bit more, we could get a mortgage with SoFi and have a low down payment with no mortgage insurance and get into a condo within 1-3 years depending on our savings strategy (which would become more aggressive if we chose this option). But it would get us started earning equity while extending my grandfather’s legacy, so to speak.

* My husband and I have a combined student debt of just over $90,000 (I detailed the loans below). I had been snowballing one of my loans that was at 10.3% and I paid it off last November. I began putting that payment toward the other loan that currently sits at nearly 10.8% and I should have it paid off by March with snowballed payments, tax refunds, and employment reimbursement (more on that below). We have 12 more undergraduate loans , and 1 graduate loan ranging from 3.4% to 6.8%. My husband consolidated his loans into 4 large loans (3 payments) and I have 9 small federal loans left all below $5k. I am currently in graduate school, so everything is in deferment and I do not technically have to pay anything right now except $25/mo on my high interest loan. However, I have been paying $150 on my small loans the past few months in order to put the remaining payment budget toward killing off my higher interest loans faster. I only recently noticed that this wasn’t sufficient in paying a bit of principle along with the interest, so I will be upping that to $200/mo. And I am taking out more loans for grad school. I’ve listed the loan amounts, interest rates, and monthly payments below for clarification.

* My job will reimburse me for educational expenses up to about $4850/fiscal year (July-June). This pays for over half of my yearly graduate expenses ($477/credit hour, 15 credit hours per fiscal year). However, since I thought that my graduate loans were not currently eligible for repayment, the plan was to use that reimbursement to kill off older, higher-interest rate loans instead.

* My loans had been eligible for Public Service forgiveness after 10 years since I work in public service, but my HR department has screwed up my paperwork each year I've applied. Additionally, payments made while in school are not eligible to count toward the 120 consecutive payments made since working full time. And, frankly, I do not want to stay in this job longer than absolutely necessary. The job already requires 6 months employment beyond the date of graduation, which is more than enough.

* Consolidation and refinancing are not options as it removes our IBR plans and deferment options as well as increases our overall interest rate. Because my husband’s job is not as stable as we’d like, I would like to retain the federal protections currently offered with my current lenders in the event his job becomes even less stable. We will continue to aggressively snowball these loans while we have the lower interest rates and protections the loans offer.

* My husband and I did rough calculations and believe we may be able to eliminate 3 loans this year (including my 10.8%), effectively reducing our debt by about 28%, freeing up money to save for a home, or snowball the remainder of the loans and potentially be nearly debt free (save for my graduate loans) by the time I finish my master’s degree in spring 2020. The only way we found to do this is to use my inheritance to kill off one of my husband’s loans, and then snowball payments to the other loans. This seems like the smartest long-term option, but it feels like I'm just throwing a glass of water into an ocean.

* My father and paternal grandmother have been paying monthly on a parent PLUS loan. They are not the sort to discuss finances in detail with me, so I have been unsuccessful in finding out how much they’re paying each month, (though I believe it’s between $250-$450), what the remaining balance is, or what the interest rate is. I feel guilty they’re paying at all, and would, ideally like to help ease that burden if possible. Should I push to do this or, as my husband says, “let them do something for me”? My father is already paying my car insurance (he’s listed me as the head in order to get a discount for my bachelor’s degree and pays $300 for 3 vehicles). But he also frequently mentions how he’s had to get payday loans and how he can’t afford his medications/electricity bill/etc., so I don’t know if this would even help ease the burden on him. I’ve tried many times to help him find ways to save money and budget, but he is stubborn and unwilling to communicate. Is this even a battle I should be fighting?

* Is there an investment I could make that would be more sensible long term? Does it even make sense to invest this when we have such a large debt load?

Current Loans

* 18,387 - 5.750% ($260/mo~)

* 14,210 - 5.750% (~)

* 10,405 - 4.125% ($176/mo)

* 10,139 - 4.125% ($117/mo)

*   6,472 - 10.759% ($1025/mo; snowballed)

*   4,834 - 5.60% ($200/mo')

Our current monthly budget breakdown:

Income: $7400 (variable $7000-$10,000 depending)

Rent: $1612 (stabilized; no more than 3% increase every year)

Student loans: $1778 (Husband: $117, $176, $260; Me: $200, $1025).

Utilities/car/phone/internet/etc.: $980-$1100

Gas: $150-$200

Food/Dining: $1000-$1600 (we frequently go over budget on this, though we’ve been meal prepping to try to reduce)

Savings: $450 (more if we have a good month)

The remaining goes to various car repair, vet bills, birthdays, outings, clothing, emergencies, etc. If we can help it we throw it into savings, but oftentimes it is used up when one of the other categories is unexpectedly high or generally for something unexpected (like I had to replace my tires last summer).

I know if we really buckle down, lessen or eliminate most of our social obligations, we could aggressively pay off a lot more debt without having to use my inheritance. But is using this inheritance to pay down debt the smartest thing to do? It feels like a drop in the bucket compared to how much we owe. And regardless of the high amount, I don’t worry much about our student debt anymore as we have a bit of a reign on it (we’ve paid down about $10k-$15k in the past few years before we began aggressively paying), so it feels like a safer kind of debt that we can easily manage without using my inheritance on it. At the same time, my husband has pointed out that if we were to take on a mortgage, not having so much student debt would make our income feel much more stable, and would allow us to invest more in a property, renovations, etc.

I slept on it all and am still a bit torn and could still use some advice. It may be overly sentimental, but I really would like it if the the money from my grandfather’s farm could be used to get us into our own home. And while I can see that freeing up our debt load will allow us to spend less on our loans and save more in the long run to achieve that goal, it still feels like sinking $10k into our student loans is throwing it away. Any advice is appreciated.

CryptoCurrency,"Why we won't have a long term bear market, and how to systematically pick your future investments in crypto","With so much uncertainty right now it would be a good time to take some time to go over what happened recently and how to invest moving foward. We've seen a peak bubble at around 850 billion total market cap in the first week of January, consolidated down to $750 billion and have now just experienced a 40% correction. 

#What's happening now and how bad will it get?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all you should realize that there is a [January Dip that happens every year, when we see a roughly 20-30% decline around mid January](https://i.imgur.com/VXEHw0W.png). This year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top.

Different theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the ""January Effect"" that happens in the US stock market), but the two major theories are:

1) Asian markets pull into fiat because of Asian New Year spending needs

2) People in the US sell in January to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra year

While this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well:

* [Yet more scary news on China cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/)

* [Korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low)

* [European governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html)

* [BTC futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down

* Bitconnect Ponzi finally collapses

* We had a new breed of speculators come in during the November/December timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the Bitcoin 10K landmark. While cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Monero and Ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. Many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure.

So in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. Currently I don't see this as being a systematic crash like Mt.Gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and I suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. All the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. What range the market trades in will all depend how Bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10K but I'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term MA curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kKVsoUt.png). I don't expect us going below that support line anytime soon without any systematic breakdown. The fact we got closer to it is actually quite healthy in the long term because [it is a valuation that can be logically justified using the cost factors of the mining network.](http://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/) In addition when I run a regression on the price history before the crazy Nov/December bull run, [the first Fibonacci level seems to be just around $8000](https://i.imgur.com/L6aDQRG.png). So I think we should consistantly move above that support level, possibly with a few weeks of fluctuations between the $9-$13K range. 

**What should you do if you recently entered the market?**

If you did buy in the last few months at or near ATH, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. You shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait a few months. You have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more China fears. Unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during Mt.Gox, the market always recovers. 

The other worst thing you can do is unload into Tether as your safety net. If there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its Tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. It would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. I don't know when the next Mt.Gox meltdown will occur but I can almost guarantee it will involve Tether. So stay away from it.

**What should long term investors do?**

For long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each December and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at Gemini (whose US dollar deposits are FDIC-insured) and simply wait till around late January to early February to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next December. You can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various Q1 opportunities you anticipate. Others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout January which is also a perfectly fine strategy. The cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late January and early February, then we see a rise in March and generally are recovered by end of April. Obviously this decision whether to sell in December to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. Do your own math sometime in November and follow suit.

#How to construct your portfolio going forward
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. If you have been FOMO-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling.
 

**Follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Memes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but I know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. I can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. If you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). 

There is no ideal or ""correct"" methodology but I can outline mine:

**1) Initial information gathering and filtering**

Once I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. 

* Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like ""Web 4.0"" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? 

* Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?


**2) Fill out an Investment Checklist**

I have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:

* What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?

* What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?

* Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?

* What current product exists?

* How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?

* What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?



**3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** 

I have a background in finance so I like to do Excel modeling. For those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also Chris Burniske has a great blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto.

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit).  You can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic.

Once you have a model set up the way you like in Excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. Think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a ""dividend"" coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? Use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund.

The benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future.  Do your assumptions make sense? What would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? You can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates).

If you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do

* [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. 

* Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

* If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. 

Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead  you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.

Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how ""smart money"" does it.

**Think about your portfolio allocation**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You should think first in broad terms how you allocate between ""safe"" and ""speculative"" cryptos. 

For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC, ETH, LTC. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.

You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain, Walton, WABI...etc

* Promising/Innovative Tech segment - Raiblocks, IOTA, Cardano...etc

You should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a technie who loves the technology behind Cardano or IOTA, invest in that segment.

**Think of your ""circle of competence""**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? 

This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 



**Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.




**Technical analysis isn't that useful over the short term in crypto, so stop daytrading**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical analysis was initially developed by financial professionals primarily to measure momentum based on historical data. It can be useful in regulated efficient stock markets for a very good reason: patterns are fairly predictable in stocks since they are a result of intrinsic events (such as quarterly earning reports) or extrinsic events (interest rate change announced). Its true that we also have movement that is based around insider information, however we have laws that keep that to a minimum. Add to this the fact that most stocks are held with large institutional investors and bought and sold by financial professionals who slowly add and decrease their position over long term plans, which is why its rare for the wild swings within short periods. These different intrinsic and extrinsic events all have a correlation in price, and because the markets are regulated and efficient we can use them to predict movement within a reasonable degree of confidence. 

None of this is true for crypto. Its completely unregulated and insider trading and PnD schemes are rampant. No technical analysis in the world takes into account that all it takes for a crypto to double is John McAffee to post a single sentence about it on Twitter, or a sub of a smaller crypto to organize a shilling operation on /r/CryptoCurrency. Its also filled with weak hands who will dump on any sign of sellling pressure.

This is why trying to use technical analysis tools from the stock market for short term trading in crypto isn't that useful. Technical analysis was meant to predict pricing movement in a regulated and efficient environment. 

So stop daytrading. If you use technical analysis, use it for long term trend confirmation. Any attempt to trade short term based on price momentum is pure gambling. If you want to gamble get a girl and some friends and go to a casino and drink while you do it, its much more fun.



#Summing it up

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in Decemeber/early January, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. I don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming.

Basically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. Make a commitment to value things rather than chasing FOMO, and take your time to make a decision. Long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach.

Take care and have fun investing :)",cryptocurrency
litecoin,Republicans/Conservatives should love cryptocurrency,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I just thought of this regarding the political sphere in the USA..

A large part of the Republican/conservative platform is the belief in a limited and ""weaker"" federal government. In short, they don't want the government to have their hands in as many aspects of society as possible. This also holds true for other platforms such as libertarians. 

With that being said, doesn't it make sense for those said political affiliates to be in support of a decentralized currency? To take the government out of the control of money? 

I realize that this theory would apply to the general population, but I doubt that actual politicians would subscribe to this because in the end, subscribing to cryptos could have a huge impact on the power of a country. Just think about how much actual debt the United States is in. What would we do if we couldn't just create money to support the country itself? Is centralized money justified if it means keeping an entire nation of 300 million+ in a society worth living in?

A separate but similar note: It seems to me that cryptos are generally supported by younger and more left leaning people. The lefts platform is to generally supported a stronger and more controlling government, which isn't exactly aligned with how crypto currency works. Do you think it's possible that one day the right will adapt the idea of cryptos because of it being decentralized, and then identity politics will kick in and all the left leaning people will oppose it just because the right supports it?

Just some thoughts , would love to hear everyone's opinion and comments ! Maybe I'm thinking crazy, idk

CryptoMarkets,@ALL CRYPTO urgent: How to deal with the crypto price changes due to Bitcoin Futures Market - small guide,"this-&gt; https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7r4vlc/why_we_wont_have_a_long_term_bear_market_and_how/

+my 2 cents:
***most important takeaway:  IGNORE any futures dates in the future!! because IF anything happens close to one futures date, it would mean its happening because of the artificial futures, and NOT because of any FUNDAMENTAL relevant changes or news about any crypto! therefore, nobody should care about the futures dates! let them play, they are not powerful enough to drive the market ! it is JANUARY! they got lucky due to parallel FUD from korea and china etc.! in january it ALWAYS dips! just now a bit more!  do not panic and dont fall into any psychologic traps do your research!!***

1) take a look at these bitcoin futures contracts official webpages of CBOE and CME where you find the exact amounts and settlement DAYS

CBOE: http://cfe.cboe.com/cfe-products/xbt-cboe-bitcoin-futures CME: http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_product_calendar_futures.html

2) remember those days mark them in the calendar and write BIG: DONT PANIC just hold and ignore! 

3) basically, the settlement cycle is every 2weeks: CBOE contracts settle apparently every 2nd wednesday of each month // CME contracts settle 2 weeks after the CBOE ones (detailed dates in above links)

4) now, everyone who is skeptical, i am not going to argue ,, just stating once this: how big of a coincidence is it that the btc/crypto prices fell ABRUPTLY by more than 30% just ONE day before the CBOE contract settlement day? :-)

5) now a 2nd thing to make clear: the futures are traded/settled solely in USD$ nothing to do with actual BTC! people have to understand when we talk about futures, we dont claim the futures by themselves influence the btc price-&gt; but rather say that the futures investors who hold such contracts go into the actual bitcoin markets to buy/sell intensely to achieve their goals (be it dumping or pumping)-&gt;""goals"" meaning, to end up on the ""winning"" side at the futures settlement date!!

6) Now EVERYONE must understand: this game is not possible if everyone just CALMS DOWNS and does not panic and just ignores entirely that there are even any kind of ""settlement"" dates in existence!! REMEMBER: Those are BITCOIN futures! so even more reason to ignore them entirely if you are into ALTCOINS!! Altcoins are totally irrelevant to Futures investors, keep that in mind!

because if you behave just normal (lets say you plan to hold your favorite coin longterm), then just hold it longterm as you have planned to do, entirely ignoring what happens in the markets at those monthly settlement days! their game cannot be pulled off, if people dont panic and inform themselves

7) crypto is here to stay people! switzerland, germany, usa, singapore, japan, all major countries embraced already crypto and collect taxes on them! that means crypto is already legalized basically (otherwise you cannot collect taxes right;)! and do not get it wrong: REGULATION is GOOD because it takes fears away and opens up to real businesses initially reluctant to join!

8) do not get fooled and panic sell for every negative news guys! crypto is like the internet, it will be always in our lifes, this at least has to be the common believe otherwise it would not exist! value can only go up if people believe in it and support the technology longterm! its just a small baby now, mass adoption is not even starting! imagine what happens when mass adoption arrives and all those great projects deliver on their roadmaps with working products! :) people are now just very uninformed and greedy with betting shortterm on some nonsense.coins without any githubs, innovation, or real life solutions! people will do more research and be informed, so that panicking will not be caused easily anymore!

Buffett says: buy low! wherever lows, there are chances

PS: yes, the CBOE/CME bitcoin futures shorting guys could try to short always every month, BUT if people to not let influence them by that and do abovementioned things like research, dont panic, etc. the futures should not be able to ""play"" with the market like they did yesterday! also dont forget: negative news hitting from kroea and china supported maybe the ""short"" players. 

POSITIVE: but global renowned firms like NYSE, ICE and Bloomberg already provide bitcoin services (for example price information), blockstream got lightning ready, japanese biggest bank anounced new crypto exchanges.... Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis just wrote ""Bitcoin itself could over time assume a similar role as gold.”
and of course, Bitcoin futures themselves are an indication that more institutions, like those on Wall Street, are becoming willing to recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset---paving the way for real ETFs!

so many positivities, too :) stay calm and inform yourselves:D

personalfinance,Should i buy a house? Details inside.,"Yes sorry for another one of these. Ive had mixed suggestions from family and friends and wanted another set of opinions. 

Im a 26M, single. I live in a metro area and currently pay $1,100 for a one bedroom apartment with a garage. Ill make around $60k this year before taxes and anticipate 5% growth with a bigger bump at some point when i move up positions.        
 Now the more unique aspects: I work in property management, this means     
1. I have a real estate license and can act as my own agent and save a couple thousand on closing, realizing there is other costs as well.        
 2. I know tons of vendors and maintenance guys who can get work done for cheaper than the average home owner.          
            
 I work for a smaller firm and Im family friends with the president, id consider my job stability very secure and plan to stay where i am near my job and family. I also am very lucky in that i have a well off family member who has told me they have cash laying around and would be willing to give me as a gift a downpayment and then finance the rest of the home as a personal bank at the current interest rate (id make mortgage payments with interest to them).             
            
SO, ive been thinking that a decent idea would be to move to a ~$200k house and start to build equity and realize potential appreciation in the market. As well as not having to share walls or floors with people. Even in the event i decide i want to move (which like i said i view as unlikely atm) I feel confident that i could lease out the house to cover the mortgage and manage it myself (thats kinda what i do for a job lol).       
        
One family member said it was great idea to get started building equity. Another said i was too young or should wait until i get married (not sure i want to marry but thats another long post) and should stay in apartments for now.

My wife has good credit around 725, and we where planning on trying to get a usda first time home owners loan which requires no downpayment. 

My major questions:
1)Does anyone have more information on the usda loans for first time home owners as a viable option?
2)Would it make sense to borrow from my 401k to pay off my loan, which should raise my credit some also?
3)Is it a better idea to wait for our taxes to come back and pay off the loan then?
4) what are the major downsides of borrowing from a 401k?

Thank you for reading this far, and for any information you an provide.

Ps writing on mobile so please excuse typos

Info I probably should have included. 1) I shouldn't have any more student debt. My work is paying for the rest of my schooling, I only took out initial student loan because I need a few things that went along with my major. 2) My wife made about 78k last year, alot of which went into paying her student loans, which our now gone, and I made about 55k. So I believe we would be fine with morgage  and stuff, we just don't have a downpayment saved up. 3) We have to move to a bigger house soon (babies on the way) and in our local area anything bigger would be a 400+ increase in rent.",finance
solar,Going Solar (CA),"Hey there r/solar!

My family has been considering solar as an option for our southern CA home for some time now.

We recently just placed a deposit with a Tesla representative to have them come and take measurements on our roof for the installation of a 4.5KW system. This was determined from the annual usage of our home calculated at 5300kWh in 2017. Just this past week we changed out 42 bulbs in our house to LED, as well as updated a few appliances to lower our consumption slightly.

The system was quoted at $26,436.25 which would include 18 panels producing 7,475kWh of power annually, as well as one Powerwall 2 module rated at 13.5kWh of power storage. This system was designed with the mindset that we would be obtaining an electric vehicle and see some increase in our annual consumption, as well as the expectation that we would run the air conditioning slightly more than previously, given the ability to do so with solar energy coming into the home.

I had a few questions for you guys..

1. How quickly could we see a break-even point on such a system? Our out of pocket expenses currently, after federal tax incentive is looking at about 18k. My calculations tell my that we would be saving about $800 per year (our power bill is typically 50-80 per month) and that just with those savings alone over a 30 year period would generate about 24k in savings.

2. Are there any other incentives that are known to the state of CA that I should be looking into? I have gotten in touch with SGIP representatives and they say that solar/PV systems are not qualified, but I was under the assumption that the Powerwall would be covered by that program.

3. Has anyone else used SolarCity? What is your experience with them?

4. How many Renewable Energy Credits can I expect to earn in a year, and are they worth any value in the state of CA?

5. Any other pointers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I've looked at the recommended cards from Nerd Wallet and Credit Karma, and have narrowed it down to Citi Diamond Preferred (21 months 0% APR) and Double Cash (18 months 0% APR) cards. Both have 3% transfer fees which isn't bad considering my current interest rate.


Credit Karma says my chances of getting approved for Diamond Preferred are ""good"" and ""very good"" for Double Cash.


I'm looking to transfer ~$8000 from my Capital One Quicksilver account. I've repeatedly asked that they review my interest rate but they will not budge under 20.15%. TransUnion and Equifax credit scores are both 720.


Does anyone have experience with either card? I would prefer the longer interest free period but I'm concerned that I may not get approved or if I do, the limit may not be enough for my transfer. Has anyone successfully raised the credit limit after just opening a Citi account?


I'm open to suggestions. I would like to be able to use the card after it's paid off (paying the balance in full each month of course), so the Double Cash is looking good. However, I've read on other posts that a product change is possible so I may be able to switch to it later. anyways I plan to do more than the minimum payment each month if possible.

financialindependence,Looking to be FI/RE - Analyze our financials,"Hello Everyone!

Hope this is the right place to post this. 

My wife (24) and I (29) have been diving deep into our finances lately. Being FI has become our main goal in the next 10 years. We will always figure out a way to side hustle once we hit the FI point. We believe we are on the right track but are kind of stuck in limbo at the moment. We are mainly invested in real estate at the moment and are looking to branch out. Real estate is our main investment and will continue to be as time goes on. If another investment opportunity comes up with real estate we will want to be able to grab it. We have been looking at money markets and vanguard funds to place some money. We just purchased our 4th house and have finally built our savings to a point where we are comfortable and are ready to look at our options.  We definitely lean more towards the conservative side when it comes to investing and don’t know much about wall street. For FI having the houses paid off is definitely a goal if not the necessity. What should our next move be? BTW we have also been meeting with a financial advisor. Just curious to get feedback from a community that might understand a little better. 

We would like to get some advice on what people are doing for healthcare when they are FI/RE? This is a big concern for us and are not sure what are options are.

investing,Investing vs. Student loans,"A little bit of background first. I currently have about 120k in student loans debt which I recently refinanced to get my interest rate down to 5.09. It was up over 7. I currently make a little over 6 figures in income right now. I have a roth IRA and will be signing up for my jobs 401k in the near future.

I am having some issues trying to figure out how much money I should put every month towards my student loans versus investing. I also would like to work towards buying a house in the future and would like to slowly set some money aside for that. My initial goal was to just pay my student loans off as fast as possible, but I don't want to miss out on starting to save for my future. I guess I am just looking for the right balance. 

Anybody else in a similar situation? I am fairly new to investing and have about 3,000 in my IRA right now with plans of getting that up to the max of 5,550. I also have about 1,500 in crypto (I know).

Please let me know your guys thoughts on putting funds towards loans versus investing.",finance

personalfinance,Question about avalance/snowball method of debt payment re: high balance/lower interest debt.,"I am well versed in the avalanche vs snowball method of debt repayment and have read the sticky in the debt section on the right side of the screen. Unfortunately, the examples used were low balance with lower interest vs higher balance and higher interest.

Is it still mathematically better to use the avalanche method if you have lower balances on high interest debt?

My example: I have Card A with 15.24% interest and a $14,162 balance. Card B, however, has a 26.49% interest rate, but only a $4,882 balance. There are also a few other cards with lower balances and lower interest rates. 

The minimum payments on Card A tend to be very large when compared to the lower balance cards with higher rates. I recently came into a $7,000 windfall and want to use it as efficiently as possible to pay down debt now that I am working on reducing my expenses and tackling my debt. 

Any advice is welcome and thank you in advance for your time.",finance
personalfinance,19k in loans at 10.2% APR... should i try to refinance?,"Here's my situation...

$1500 /month disposable income
$19k in private loans at 10.2% APR
$6k in subsidized student loans at 4% APR
$6k in credit card debt (currently no interest for 6 months)
716 credit score
My plan is to make payments on the credit card to have it paid off exactly as interest starts kicking in, while making the minimum on the subsidized loan, and putting the rest towards the big one. Would you do any differently?

My real question though, is what sort of options should be available to me for refinancing my big loan? I keep getting these refinancing 'deals' offering me 25%+ APR for a $30,000 loan.. yeah no thanks. That makes me feel like what I have is pretty decent but I can't stop myself from thinking I could get a better deal. I've applied for refinancing a few places but keep getting the same as the letters, credit card interest rates, and I just keep feeling like I'm missing something.

Any suggestions?",finance

Both jobs apply well to my career field, have growth and a degree is not a barrier of entry to my long term career goal - (pursuing bachelor’s currently, main goal is owning a research/consulting firm of my own - working mostly off govt grants). 

Currently have 2 more years until B.S.  in sociology - currently at a community college with guaranteed admission to every UC/CSU. I’m 26.

personalfinance,My younger brother (23) has asked my mother (53) to cosign a 40k loan so he can finance an art degree from Full Sail University. Please help!,"I generally stay out of my brother's business, but my mother asked me to look into this. She had been hoping and saving for a down payment on a house. She doesn't want to rent anymore. My brother asked her to help a lot more with babysitting his two kids, (4 &amp; 1yrs old). Both he and his wife work, they tried her not working and she was miserable and they nearly divorced. I told my mother that this loan will probably work against her if she were to apply for a home loan. I don't know anything about this school except what I've been reading from their website.

My mother has an eighth grade education and she asked me to look into this because she says she doesn't understand much of what my brother is saying to her. Though she and her boyfriend make enough to support the two of themselves comfortably, they don't make enough for their bills and the loan. My brother says he would be the one paying it off but as you all know... best laid plans. I want to emphasize to her that anything could happen to him, he could lose his job, and she is stuck paying off the loan.

She says he told her what he actually needed was 60k, and this is a two year degree. She says he said he'd need to work five more years in his current job in order to pay off the loan. He's a corrections officer in the Southwest.

Here are the questions I'm going to give her to put to him:

If it will take you five years to pay off the loan, why enroll now? Why not wait three years, live frugally, put the ""loan payment"" money in a savings account with good interest, and graduate two years after that with no debt? Wouldn't it be better to wait to enroll so at least the oldest is in school, and the youngest would be in Pre-K, and you wouldn't be sitting for three years twiddling your thumbs which wouldn't look good to hiring managers?

Which scholarships have you applied for? Which scholarships did you research but weren't eligible for and why?

Where did you hear about this loan? What is the interest rate? What other loans are available to you and what do their interest rates look like?

What is the hiring rate for graduates from this program? What is the difference in value from this program and the local community college?

And if she's comfortable with it,

Can he provide her a schedule to submit receipts that he is staying on track with his loan payments? Can he show her the budget he's made that backs up this five year plan?

I don't want my brother to hear no, but I don't believe he's done his due diligence. From what I've heard from him he's already enrolled or will very soon... but he's only just now thinking about where they money will come from? Our parents were terrible with money and I'm afraid we're not very much better. This is my brother's dream and I want to be on Team Make This Happen, but I don't think he's going about this in a logical way.

Eta: Thank you so much for your comments, this has been **very** helpful! I sent my mother the questions and some additional stuff you guys pointed out. I intend to gently steer my brother away from that school, I don't want him to be taken advantage of! My Reddit search on full sail didn't turn up anything promising, so along with the info provided here, I hope that I can convince my brother that the local *accredited* community college would be just as useful, and mounds less expensive.",finance
personalfinance,Being a savvy consumer of financial services,"As someone who has recently moved to the USA, I think I need a rundown about bank accounts here. 

I noticed on my bank statement the other day a $2.50 fee for a foreign transaction. Long story short, I had hired a car through a vendor based in Europe, even though the vendor charged me in US dollars. 

It's something that I've never experienced before. Back home in Australia, if you are billed in Australian dollars then you don't suffer any foreign currency transaction nonsense.

Then the other thing is about sending money. This one was definitely a culture shock. The bank charges me for incoming wire transfers. Nice. Again, back in Australia zero cost for incoming wire transfers, zero cost for domestic wire transfers, and to the best of my knowledge, zero cost for outgoing wire transfers. Crazy! Okay, maybe if the bank charged something like an ad valorem fee of 1% or $30, whichever is the lesser in each case, I might think that's tolerable. But imagine having to send less than $100 and the cost of sending it is 30%? I mean, I can't imagine that the cost of interbank clearance in America can really be that astronomically high as to mean that no bank could be competitive on those rates?

And another one that I noticed was lost cards. Back home, I run around with an empty wallet and my credit card with no fear of losing it. On each occasion I've had any fraudulent charges refunded to me (admittedly it takes up to a month) and there's zero cost for a replacement card. 

It's almost as if banks aren't profiting off the zero rate of interest they're offering you. I recall closing my savings account within a day of opening it at the laughable 0.01% interest rate.

Okay, so rather than complain about it, how do people get around these fee issues? One is to use Venmo between friends, sure. But what else should I be aware of?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Flixxo - A Decentralized Video Platform by the Founders of Rootstock and Popcorntime,"**What:** 

[Flixxo](http://flixxo.com/) *- Aiming to create a decentralized video distribution network where users will be the owners and beneficiaries of their content. Flixxo eliminates intermediaries by letting advertisers, viewers, and content creators engage with each other directly*

&amp;nbsp;

**Exchanges:** KuCoin

**MarketCap:** 25M

&amp;nbsp;

**Why:** 

It's no secret that YouTube has the monopoly in this market but if their platform doesn't support it's creators then there's an opportunity for Flixxo to disrupt. This has recently been highlighted with YouTube changing the monetization rules which stops smaller creators benefiting from uploading content. Flixxo is designed to provide incentives for viewers and creators no matter how big or small their involvement is on the platform.

&amp;nbsp;

Flixxo has an excellent opportunity for word of mouth advertising with creators using their social media followings to direct users to Flixxo where the creators earn money for their work. There's also no reason why creators who are still eligible to earn money via YouTube can't upload their work to Flixxo and earn more revenue. 

&amp;nbsp;

**How:** 

Active developers with industry experience. YouTube earns $6billion dollars a year from advertising revenue. If Flixxo achieves as many users as **Federico Abad's** previous project(Popcorn Time - 100M users) then Flixxo would earn $1b a year from ad revenue. Creators will flock to the platform where they will be rewarded for their hard work.

&amp;nbsp; 

The economic model allows advertisers to buy Flixx Tokens from the market and offer them together with ads to users, viewers watch ads or seed content to earn tokens (or buy them, but it's not necessary), viewers can pay content creators in form of donations, likes or monthly subscriptions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Who:** 

* **Federico Abad** - Creator of Popcorn Time(compared to NetFlix for ease of use, 100M+ Users)
* **Pablo Carbajo** - Creator of Riecoin. 15 year experience developing embedded systems at IBM, Toshiba
* **Adrián Garelik** - Co-Founder at RSK Labs. Developing solutions for OTT since 1998. Film producer.

personalfinance,Debt payoff suggestions,"Sorry for the wall of text, on mobile. 

My wife and I are planning off paying off / down some of our debt with our tax return this year. We are finally in a position to make headway, and maybe have most of it payed off in the next 18 months. 

My question is, which debts should we prioritize with our return? We have 3 revolving debts we could pay off completely, higher interest rates, or one fixed loan with a lower rate, but higher monthly payment. These are not our only debt, just the ones we could pay off with the return. I am leaning toward the loan, because it will free up more cash flow to pay towards other debts, but my wife is thinking we should get rid of the higher interest rates first. Suggestions and reasons please?

personalfinance,"Mortgage Payments, Monthly, weekly or daily to save money","This seems to be an old topic but have read the comments it has brought a few things to mind.

Paying your mortgage weekly, monthly or daily depends on the terms and conditions of the mortgage.

Most important is your morgage interest calculated Daily. If it is, I think you can use to save some
Money. I’m going to start a spreadsheet on this but in principal I think it’s right.

Many people said that why would you pay weekly or daily when your paid monthly etc.

Well if you live hand to mouth, have no savings and are max debted, you’ll be working for the man the rest of your life

If you have a rainy day fund, the best advice I have read is six months living costs with no income chances are you have that liquid cash siting in a very low interest account. If that interest rate is less than you morgage read on.

Let’s say I have £5000 emergency funds and my morgage monthly repayment is £500.

If the interest is calculated daily, I could therefore use some of the emergency fund to finance weekly or even daily payments and then use my salary to replenish the £5000 emergency funding

You can do this a home with on a spreadsheet for a really simple example

Such as 

£7 is borrowed for 7 days at 10% per Day  for the 7 day terms

Do those numbers

Now same as above but every day payback £1

When I get home will put it on a spreadsheet but I think you have the gist.

In short I think but I haven’t proved it to myself at least that  if you have emergency money in an account that is paying less interest than your morgage. 

And you morgage is calculated daily this should help.

personalfinance,(x-post r/studentloans) Roth IRA vs. Student Loans,"Hello r/personalfinance -

I am a 26F who has aggressively paid down my student debt over the past 3 years. My starting balance was $41,000 (with capitalized interest) and I have brought it down to just over $12,000. All federal - no private. My question - how should I prioritize retirement from here on out vs continuing to hit these super hard? I have already opened an IRA with Vanguard and am currently trying to make extra payments before the 2017 contribution deadline - though I doubt I can reach the yearly maximum before that date. My income is about $45,000 after taxes. Is it better for my long term equity to pay more to the IRA at this time and drop down to the minimum payment? (Which is $250/mo). At this point the lion's share of any payment is mostly hitting the principal (I paid less than $600 to interest in 2017).

Other expenses:

*Rent + utilities + internet: $750

*Food: $225/mo

*Auto loan at 2.25%: $332/mo (car insurance is $160/mo due to a full coverage on a lien) note: I realize this is a bit of a luxury, but I don't work an ""office job"" so I end up driving a lot to meet clients.

*Obligate heath insurance: $194/mo (which is mostly covered by a small subsidy from my workplace, catastrophic)

*Current student loan monthly: $500

*Spotify: $9.99/mo (very high usage)

On average I am ahead each month by ~400-600 bucks - 200 of which go into my emergency fund (give or take). The rest usually sits in my account as a ""just in case weird stuff happens"" cushion or I use a bit for takeout/fun stuff.

I currently use YNAB, and every single debt/utility is on auto-pay.

Loans and interest for reference:

*Subsidized Stafford $3,329.80 3.150%

*Subsidized Stafford: $4,139.51 at 3.150%

*Subsidized Stafford: $4,151.13 at 3.610%

*Unsubsidized Stafford: $770.33 at 3.610%

Suggestions? Tips? My commute is a minute or two and I live in a very rural area so spending on take-out and luxuries is low because it really does not exist. My main question is - should I pull back on the $500/mo and take the extra into my IRA? How much am I selling myself short if I prioritize the student loans? My loose plan has been to be student loan free by late summer of 2019 by hitting it a bit harder as I got closer and throwing tax returns, etc into the student loan.

personalfinance,Old Medical Debt,"Hello PF.

Throwaway just because I don't want anyone to see this and worry about me.


I have a medical bill from a hospital for 3k ~ USD that is in collections. I was diagnosed with cancer in 2015 and the blood tests alone were the 3k USD after my parent's insurance. After that, I qualified for free care when I transferred to a different hospital and am on State and Federal Health benefits now so this old medical debt is the only thing I have left. (I am cured and doing well now, so don't feel pity :) ).

The debt disappeared for awhile once I got free care at the new hospital I went too, but it just came back today and dropped my credit score 80 points. This new agency has not contacted me about the debt and it is just now showing on my credit report.


I have state health insurance, but it wasn't retroactive to the day I got those blood tests that total ~ 3k USD. However, on credit Karma, it shows the bill was sent to collection after the retroactive date my state health insurance kicked in. 

This is probably rhetorical, but is it worth contacting my State Health insurance to try to pay off this debt since it is medical, or because it is in collection/before the retroactive date it applied, they will most likely not want to pay it?

Also, what's the best way to go about paying this debt to delete so I don't have to pay it in full. I am in college and run off FAFSA and whatever else my college gives me, so I can't really justify putting that money towards a medical debt. I use all of my income from Federal aid for rent, food, phone, etc.. (I am on disability because the cancer is gone, but I have a lot of after effects...).

So I have done a lot of research into this, but I just forgot about it because it disappeared on my credit report for the longest time I thought it was gone, but unfortunately is back.

In your opinions should I do any of these?

A) Forget about it and hope it expires in 7 years or however long it takes debt to disappear off a report?

B) Start a payment plan for the minimum due and just forget about it while I lose a bit of money.

C) Try to pay to delete it aggressively and refuse to start a payment plan. 

D) Other?

The agency has not contacted me yet, but I know how to contact them (I googled the agency I see on creditkarma). 

Also, I have free care at a different hospital system but in the same State and I'm back near the hospital where I was diagnosed and could easily get free care there too probably. Would they go back and get rid of that debt or is it now only in the hands of the collection agency? 

Thanks for the help.

I know in the long run this debt isn't that bad, and credit score isn't end all, but I really don't want to pay this debt because I feel that it was ridiculous that getting a blood test cost so much and my insurance couldn't make it a lower bill for me at the time especially giving how I went through a couple years of cancer treatment, etc...

- I am a freelance writer who makes between $20-40/hr but only  works 20-30 hrs a week 

- I worked two years on marijuana farms when I was younger and banked a years worth of emergency funds (13K) and have a baby 4K stock portfolio thanks to that

- I haven't paid rent in 4 years, just couch surfed, communes, lived in squats, boats, work-trades, the occasional sublet, move every 3-4 months etc. 

- only had a phone bill as my overhead and food bills when not work trading , live very FIRE friendly, quite minimally 

NOW some changes good/bad for FIRE have arrived on my horizon: 

- I just inherited 48K 

- I have a steady income of $2000 and that could easily jump within the next 40 days or so to $3200 depending on some things

- I am going to get an apartment that will cost utilities incl $650/ month

- transport will be $100/month 

- trying to stay in one place for an extended period of time due to a temporary shift in mentality 

I am viewing this $48K inheritance as my golden ticket to continue to only work max 30 hrs weekly from home and then continue to live on a shoestring and just make sure I put away $5,500-
 $8K annually and continue to grow my investments in recreational marijuana and crypto on the side in addition to some kind of index fund - 401k - IRA situation with the 48K compounding in it?  Am I completely delusional? 

I conceptually understand everything I read on Reddit about personal finance, but am not good at executing, there is just a screw missing in my brain there. I cannot for the life of me decide what kind of IRA to get and how to hire someone to manage my money for me or how to even get started? Who to call? It just doesn't click for me. Is it silly of me to hire someone to help me manage or advise for only 50K? 

  I am nervous that I am far too flighty an individual to take this on alone. I am good at hustling and being frugal... but am trying to be realistic about my ability to manage funds over a long period of time without shooting myself in the foot.

personalfinance,Questions about my Kentucky Housing Corporation (KHC) Home Buyer Tax Credit,"I was told I got the KHC home buyer tax credit when I bought my house but I never received the certificate in the mail. 

For starters, the KHC home buyer tax credit lets you count 25% of your mortgage interest each year as a federal tax credit for as long as you live in the house.

So backstory, I bought my house in fall of 2016, I closed on it roughly a week or two before halloween that year. When I was applying for the mortgage at Stock Yards Bank &amp; Trust my lender told me that I qualified for the KHC Home Buyer Tax Credit. (He is listed as one of their loan providers on their website) So I spent the extra time and hassle filling out all the paperwork, providing all the additional necessary financial information, and jumping through the hoops to get approved for it. This also meant finding a house that fit the criteria for the tax credit. So after doing all this, I closed on the house near the end of October and I asked my lender at closing, ""what all do I need to do when tax time comes around to apply my tax credit to my return?"" He told me that I would receive a certificate in the mail that I would want to hold on to, and thats what I would use each year when I do my taxes, to receive the credit. He said that it usually takes a few months to get the certificate in the mail so I might not get it til after the first of the year. Since I only paid one mortgage payment in December 2016 and I hadn't received the certificate yet I didn't think it was worth dealing with it on my 2016 tax return. But now that I'm about to file my 2017 tax return, that 25% credit could really boost my return. But I've never received the certificate in the mail at my new house or my old house.

So TL;DR basically i'm at a loss of who I should contact to find out what I need to do. I got my mortgage from Stock Yards but they sold the loan after closing to Franklin American Mortgage Company. KHC is the one that approves the tax credit through certain approved lenders which Stock Yards is one of them. So do I contact KHC to see if they have my loan on file? Or do I talk to the guy I dealt with at Stock Yards who set my mortgage up? Any help would be appreciated",finance
personalfinance,University Student Trying To Build Credit Score Looking For Advise,"To start, I am 19 years old, in university. I have taken out $26,000 in student loans so far. I am quite frugal with my money and I prefer to save than to blow, so debt is not a terrible idea but it is not a fun start to life. I want to start getting on top of my credit score now so when I graduate I will not have insane interest rates for major purchases like a new car or a home. 

Recently my mother has passed away. I will be getting a large amount of money very soon from the insurance companies and was wondering what everyone thinks of my ideas of what to do with it. 

I can take a few different routes with this: 

For starters, I can pay off my student loans and live debt free, get a credit card to pay for things like dinner sometimes and pay those credit card bills to improve my credit over the next few years, all while saving the excess money I do not spend on my education. 

Or, I can just use the money to pay for my education and hold on to my student loans, let them collect interest to build my credit score to pay them off slowly, and to do the same with credit cards. 

I guess the question is whether I should pay off my student loan debt before it starts collecting interest or should I wait and let it help improve my credit score when I graduate.

CryptoCurrency,@ALL CRYPTO urgent: How to deal with the crypto price changes due to Bitcoin Futures Market - small guide,"this-&gt; https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7r4vlc/why_we_wont_have_a_long_term_bear_market_and_how/


+my 2 cents:
***most important takeaway:  IGNORE any futures dates in the future!! because IF anything happens close to one futures date, it would mean its happening because of the artificial futures, and NOT because of any FUNDAMENTAL relevant changes or news about any crypto! therefore, nobody should care about the futures dates! let them play, they are not powerful enough to drive the market ! it is JANUARY! they got lucky due to parallel FUD from korea and china etc.! in january it ALWAYS dips! just now a bit more!  do not panic and dont fall into any psychologic traps do your research!!***

1) take a look at these bitcoin futures contracts official webpages of CBOE and CME where you find the exact amounts and settlement DAYS

CBOE: http://cfe.cboe.com/cfe-products/xbt-cboe-bitcoin-futures CME: http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_product_calendar_futures.html

2) remember those days mark them in the calendar and write BIG: DONT PANIC just hold and ignore! 

3) basically, the settlement cycle is every 2weeks: CBOE contracts settle apparently every 2nd wednesday of each month // CME contracts settle 2 weeks after the CBOE ones (detailed dates in above links)

4) now, everyone who is skeptical, i am not going to argue ,, just stating once this: how big of a coincidence is it that the btc/crypto prices fell ABRUPTLY by more than 30% just ONE day before the CBOE contract settlement day? :-)

5) now a 2nd thing to make clear: the futures are traded/settled solely in USD$ nothing to do with actual BTC! people have to understand when we talk about futures, we dont claim the futures by themselves influence the btc price-&gt; but rather say that the futures investors who hold such contracts go into the actual bitcoin markets to buy/sell intensely to achieve their goals (be it dumping or pumping)-&gt;""goals"" meaning, to end up on the ""winning"" side at the futures settlement date!!

6) Now EVERYONE must understand: this game is not possible if everyone just CALMS DOWNS and does not panic and just ignores entirely that there are even any kind of ""settlement"" dates in existence!! REMEMBER: Those are BITCOIN futures! so even more reason to ignore them entirely if you are into ALTCOINS!! Altcoins are totally irrelevant to Futures investors, keep that in mind!

because if you behave just normal (lets say you plan to hold your favorite coin longterm), then just hold it longterm as you have planned to do, entirely ignoring what happens in the markets at those monthly settlement days! their game cannot be pulled off, if people dont panic and inform themselves

7) crypto is here to stay people! switzerland, germany, usa, singapore, japan, all major countries embraced already crypto and collect taxes on them! that means crypto is already legalized basically (otherwise you cannot collect taxes right;)! and do not get it wrong: REGULATION is GOOD because it takes fears away and opens up to real businesses initially reluctant to join!

8) do not get fooled and panic sell for every negative news guys! crypto is like the internet, it will be always in our lifes, this at least has to be the common believe otherwise it would not exist! value can only go up if people believe in it and support the technology longterm! its just a small baby now, mass adoption is not even starting! imagine what happens when mass adoption arrives and all those great projects deliver on their roadmaps with working products! :) people are now just very uninformed and greedy with betting shortterm on some nonsense.coins without any githubs, innovation, or real life solutions! people will do more research and be informed, so that panicking will not be caused easily anymore!

Buffett says: buy low! wherever lows, there are chances

PS: yes, the CBOE/CME bitcoin futures shorting guys could try to short always every month, BUT if people to not let influence them by that and do abovementioned things like research, dont panic, etc. the futures should not be able to ""play"" with the market like they did yesterday! also dont forget: negative news hitting from kroea and china supported maybe the ""short"" players. 

POSITIVE: but global renowned firms like NYSE, ICE and Bloomberg already provide bitcoin services (for example price information), blockstream got lightning ready, japanese biggest bank anounced new crypto exchanges.... Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis just wrote ""Bitcoin itself could over time assume a similar role as gold.”
and of course, Bitcoin futures themselves are an indication that more institutions, like those on Wall Street, are becoming willing to recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset---paving the way for real ETFs!

so many positivities, too :) stay calm and inform yourselves:D

personalfinance,Deciding whether to attack student loans or wait for income-based repayment loan forgiveness? (long/detailed),"Dear Personal Finance, 

I finished medical residency 4 years ago and have been on an income based repayment plan the last 5 years.  I borrowed to attend med school - I think my debt was initially $250-300K.  I've been working between 2 and 4 days a week the last 5 years making $100-150K/year in family medicine (one of the lower-paid specialties).  Working part-time because full time is exhausting, I always stay late at work so my days are actually 10-11 hours, and I have a 2 year old child.  I also get bored easily so I have different jobs in different  settings/with different patient types.  I'm partnered/co-habitating but we aren't legally married (and I don't want to be).  

Just realizing my minimum payments are not even covering interest, so my loans are now $375K (any criticism received for not paying attention to this earlier is justified!)  I rent, do not own, my share of rent is $1500/month.  Kid's preschool is $1500/month.  I slightly subsidize my partner mainly because he takes care of our kid a lot more than I do.  Monthly income based repayment is $600-700.  Some of my loans are at 2% interest rate but most are at 6.5% and I think some might be 7.5%. 

On income based repayment, the remaining loans are forgiven after 25 years of payments (I've done 5 of those 20 so far).  I'm aware of the 10 year public service loan forgiveness program (loans forgiven after 10 yrs of payments and 10 years of working at a non-profit at least 30 hours/week) and I'm considering that but I don't think I want to do it, for various reasons (don't want to commit to 30 h/week, don't want to commit to working at a single place that is non-profit). 

My question is (assuming I don't do the 10 year public service loan forgiveness): does it make more sense to start attacking the loans (putting any and all extra money into the higher rate loans, with the goal of paying all $375,000 as soon as possible), OR to just wait the 20 more years for forgiveness?  I am aware that the amount of loan forgiven counts as taxable income, so I will also have a tax bill then.     

I also have $5500 in an IRA account, and I have no idea if I want to try and buy a house in the future.

Thanks for any advice, I realize this is long AF!  If you want to give me advice and PM me a medical question I can answer for you in return, that's fine!",finance

personalfinance,"I think this phone call was a scam, but I don't know what they were after. Can anyone fill me in?","If I'm in the wrong subreddit, please let me know. But I figured you guys would be likely to know this.

So I got a phone call today from a guy who said I was eligible for a federal grant from the department of education, to promote further education. I thought ""Yeah, right,"" but he said I didn't need to pay anything or give my card number or anything like that, it would be mailed to my address.

So out of curiosity, I figured I'd follow along for a couple minutes.

He asked some general survey/qualification questions that I didn't mind answering (are you a US citizen, are you interested in going to/going back to college, are you employed, how old are you, are you in default on any student loans) and then transferred me to his supervisor. Supervisor checked his answers and then confirmed my personal information, which I had NOT given them.

What they had - correct spelling of my unusual name, phone number (West coast area code), current mailing address (East coast), but only 4 digits of my zip code. Like if my zip was 12345, they thought it was 2345.

Then mr supervisor said, you qualify, I'll arrange for the next guy to call you. He'll ask you some questions, here is what you should answer, if you answer wrong he will hang up on you and the money that would have gone to you will be given to charity. Stay by your phone.

So guy #3 calls a few minutes later, establishes that he's talking to the right person, and asks the questions I was told he'd ask. I answer ""incorrectly"" (truthfully) to the first question, ""Did anyone promise you money or incentives to complete this call?"" Which they did. He immediately hangs up, not even an ""ok, sorry you don't qualify, have a nice day.""

I'm absolutely positive that they were calling from another country, despite their claim that they were in Rochester, NY. For one thing, they didn't see a problem with a 4-digit zip code. Also, all three had the same strong accent. One guy with that accent might have moved here, 2 out of three could be a coincidence, but 3 out of 3 strains credibility. Third reason - the grant money will be given to charity, if I don't qualify? Yeah right. 

But what did they want?",finance

(JEL G23, E50, E59)","https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/2018/01/10/a-short-introduction-to-the-world-of-cryptocurrencies.pdf


&gt;5 CONCLUSION
The Bitcoin creators’ intention was to develop a decentralized cash-like electronic payment
system. In this process, they faced the fundamental challenge of how to establish and transfer digital property rights of a monetary unit without a central authority. They solved this challenge
by inventing the Bitcoin Blockchain. This novel technology allows us to store and transfer a
monetary unit without the need for a central authority, similar to cash.
Price volatility and scaling issues frequently raise concerns about the suitability of Bitcoin
as a payment instrument. As an asset, however, Bitcoin and alternative blockchain-based
tokens should not be neglected. **The innovation makes it possible to represent digital property
without the need for a central authority. This can lead to the creation of a new asset class that
can mature into a valuable portfolio diversification instrument. Moreover, blockchain technology
provides an infrastructure that enables numerous applications. Promising applications
include using colored coins, smart contracts, and the possibility of using fingerprints to secure
the integrity of data files in a blockchain, which may bring change to the world of finance
and to many other sectors.**

I also like this think piece by the NYT: 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/magazine/beyond-the-bitcoin-bubble.html

&gt;Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical — almost communitarian — possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don’t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.

&gt;**Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain.** Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can’t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.",finance

I have worked in my field on 3 different continents, thus moving caused me to jump ship frequently. I had worked for major global firms, and made better money than here now.

I got a lower paying government job ($66k) that has great benefits, 38hpw of work, I'm surrounded by semi-competant staff that are cruising along, and I have been free to take charge and lead my senior coworkers into some great success over the last 3 months. 

I work in control of private sector, auditing companies that have won certain government multimillion $ contracts. I have sniffed out a lot of malpractice and have fined a major company substantially, and helped reorganise them.

Well, they don't seem to be upset, general managers for the country came down and commended my effort and thanked me for helping them resolve issues. I am sceptical of their sincerity, and I am not a trusting person in general. 

They (upper management) have been hinting for some time about ""turning me to the dark side"" and then unsuspectingly, in the middle of nonsense chat, dropped the bomb ""come work for us, $175k, you can star tomorrow"". This is to fill a role of a manager that got let go due to me finding out...

It is a lot of money, and it makes the promotion I'm due for ($84k) seem insignificant. (84 with yearly step up to $110 over 5 years). 

I keep thinking that they just want me out of my chair more than they wish me on their side, and that I would be let go shortly after.

personalfinance,Won NYC housing lottery... affordable unit still too expensive... should I do it anyway?,"So I haven't quite won. I've been selected to interview for a studio or 1bd unit in a couple weeks. This is only step 2 of a very long process that I’m more than likely going to lose, but I'm wondering if I should bother going in since even the cheapest unit they have is $1450/mo for a studio. My current take home pay is about $1000/week and my current rent is $850/mo. On top of that I have about $68k in student loans left (federal) that I pay around $750/mo. 

Even if I do get the chosen for the unit I feel like it would be a very unwise decision financially. The thing is the building is near central park and literally looks like a spaceship. I could never conceive living in a building like this since studios go for around $4000/mo in this building. It would be tempting since I could lower my student loan payments and just tough it out a little bit... I get to keep the apartment even if my income goes above the initial required maximum, so this might pay off in a year or two.. (also expecting a raise in about a month... and my job might go union in the next 6...)

I'm just desperate to get out of my current apartment... it's impossibly small, the management company is a nightmare, things are constantly falling apart, and I have to deal with 3 other roommates and share 1 bathroom. The thought of having my own studio in a futuristic high rise with a balcony is almost unresistable... especially considering this as a long term decision. 

The only other thing thats a bit of a negative is that it's on the far west side of Midtown manhattan about a 50 minute commute to my current job. Right now I live about a 10 minute walk away from my office in Brooklyn so I save about $120/mo on a metro card. So on top of the added expensive of the new apartment I'll have to factor in the extra $120/mo and 45 minutes to my commute. Then again I don't see myself staying at this company much longer anyway and most opportunities I'm looking for would be in the general area of this new apartment.

financialindependence,I can't imagine retiring with healthcare being so expensive,"Healthcare ruins the 25X expenses rule for me. I run the numbers and it becomes pointless to estimate my retirement expenses when I'm old to my expenses now given how much healthcare costs will factor into the calculations. 

I can only see healthcare costs rising in the future and it makes me feel like even with compound interest and expected equity returns, they will be completely dwarfed by the exponential rise in healthcare/insurance costs when I get older. I certainly won't bet my retirement on the hope that costs will come down.

The 4% rule is supposed to provide some justification and reassurance to quit my job and retire. I don't think I can ever feel reassured with healthcare always looming over everything.

personalfinance,Can opening up a new credit card hurt my credit if I currently don't have any cards and have lots of student loan debt?,"I am looking to boost my credit score by opening up a new credit card, and only using it for small purchases that I can pay off each month. I currently do not have any credit cards at the moment, and have not had any in the last 7 years. I have about $16k in student loan debt + about $8k car loan (lease payments), totalling about $24k in debt. When I signed a new lease on my car, I was told by my parents that it would bring up my credit score by tracking the payments I would be making. To my dismay, I actually saw my credit score fall quite a bit, as my amount of debt increased, and auto dealer added several hard inquiries to my account. My current debt to credit ratio shows as 0% on Credit Karma. Because my credit score isn't super (high 600s), I won't be approved for a high credit limit or good interest rate. I am worried that because of my wall of debt, that opening up a credit card will hurt my credit by showing a high debt to credit ratio. But I have also read that loans do not impact your debt to credit ratio in the same way that credit card debt does. Can anyone advise as to whether or not it would be more harmful or beneficial to my credit score to open up a new credit card at this time? Or if I should wait until I've paid off some of my debt?

personalfinance,"2016 Tax Bill, Debt and a Roth IRA Rollover","So, I have a tax bill from 2016 for close to $3000. I have 2 credit cards maxed at $5k and $8k and a car loan of $6k. I really need to take care of the tax bill and didn’t have the cash to do so. I’m ready to clean this mess up. My CPA tells me that I can take the rollover roth I set up a couple years ago and take out the $9000 I rolled over and leave the growth. Roth money is after tax so I shouldn’t be penalized. There might be a 10% fee depending on how old the account is. 

Here is what I’m thinking, pay off taxes, keep $1000 for a starter emergency fund then put the rest on the $5k credit card that is 25% interest. Then start paying off everything little by little.

personalfinance,Which loan should I pay off first? (Car vs. Student),"Hi all!

Thanks for the advice. I currently have the following.

$90,000 a year income (after bonuses)

Student Loan: Original: $18,000 - $12,000 remaining (avg 3.12% interest rate)
Car Loan: Original: $30,850 - $12,372 remaining (2.39% interest rate) 

Couple things to note:

1. I brought the car loan down from $18,000 over the course of 1-2 months by paying the max $2,000 every 2 weeks the credit union will allow. (I figured the car loan was more expensive)

2. I've just been paying the minimum $164 for the student loans every month.

My question and what I've been stressing over for the past couple months, is whether to pay off my car loan or my student loan or invest in the stock market. 

Background info:

I've already matched the 6% my employer gives me for my 401k, I'm invested in the company stock plan which gives me a 40% match on the max 10% of my monthly check , along with a $20 subsidy a month (takes maximum 10% of your net check monthly) and I've contributed the max $5,500 a year to my ROTH. 

I've pulled my money out of all stocks I've personally invested (not the company ones) and I wanted to know which loan to continue throwing money at.

I understand it comes down to peanuts for these two debts, but it's been driving me insane figuring out which to pay off first or if I should just invest (don't want to miss out on the gains)

personalfinance,0% Balance Transfer Fee &amp; 0% Interest for a Year,"I am fighting myself currently with my finances. I WILL be out of debt by 2019, at least I tell myself. My wife and I make approximately $70K a year, and are $22K in debt. I have made stupid decisions with finances in my past, but I am 21 and have had my dumb spending moments. 

Moral of the story, I most recently transferred an auto loan, for my motorcycle (was 7.1% interest) to a credit card, through Navy Federal. Navy Federal has a ZERO percent balance transfer fee, and ZERO percent interest for a year, from the end of their promotional date. I have a $15,500 dollar credit limit on that card, and after 2 balance transfers, I have roughly $5K on the card. I have another auto loan for my car, which is $10.5K on a 4.1% rate, that I am debating transfering to my card so I will not have to pay interest on it. I have roughly $22K in credit limit on cards. I have a small emergency fund, and I am trying to rely solely on cash by 2019. I have about a 750 credit score, and know it will take a hit once I do the balance transfer, since my overall utilization will be about 65%, and on that card alone, it will be mid 90's. While still living comfortably and paying monthly bills, I can put just over $2K towards the balance a month. Also, I talked to an employee and found out that the interest DOES NOT compound, or backtrack, at the end of the promotional rate, which doesn't expire until the end of February 2019.

I just don't know if it will be worth it to almost max out a card that I have. I do not plan on buying a house, or another car, opening another card, anything, in the next few years. With that being said, I am not extremely worried about my credit score at the moment, I am more worried about being debt free.

personalfinance,Excessive Credit Card Debt,"Well, I should probably make a throwaway for this, but...screw it I'll swallow my pride.  I have 25k and some change in CC debt, due to some irresponsibility, and some factors outside of my control. The minimum payments for all these are $900 per month.  Factor in another $270 car payment, for a total of $1170 per month.

Between my job and some small rental income, I net $4420 monthly.  

I tallied up all my non-debt expenses, such as mortgage, bills, food, etc. and it comes to 1750 monthly.

I have $1200 in investments, and roughly $4k in assets I could sell quickly if needed.

So in the end, if I saved every dime, every month I should have $1500 left over.  Incidentals happen as we all know, but I should be getting roughly close to that.  With these numbers in mind, I'm trying to be credit card debt free within the next year and a half.

The problem is, I feel that due to this being spread out over 6 cards, with varying interest rates, that I could do this more efficiently by consolidating my debt, and paying less in interest.

  I've tried to get a debt consolidation loan through my bank and spoke to a company I found online about it, and I can't get approved.  The bank doesn't trust me enough to give me a personal loan to cover all the credit card debt, and the debt agencies say I'm not in a dire enough situation to qualify for any of their programs.  Which I suppose they are right, having $1500 left over isn't exactly drowning.

Keep in mind I've never missed a payment on any loan or credit card ever, and my credit score is 640ish (due to having high outstanding credit card debt).  I've tried to explain that after the accounts are paid off, I will close all but two credit cards to keep for emergencies.  I guess the risk that I will just take the banks money and not pay off the credit cards is what keeps them from lending to me.

But I seem to be in a no mans land, not bad enough to qualify for debt relief or declare bankruptcy, and too indebted to get a consolidation loan.  What should I do?",finance

personalfinance,Question on NSO compensation element on W2 in Box 12,"Hi all,

I will eventually consult a tax professional on this but I couldn't resist asking for a quick opinion from the sub. I have always done my own taxes so I like to know the answer myself first :)

I exercised NSOs (non-qual stock options) this year through my company. The exercises were spread across a few grants and thus a few different strike prices, but the aggregate relevant details are:

* Cost basis of shares - ~$16k
* Fair market value of shares - ~$72k
* Total tax bill - ~$27k

Just to state what's probably obvious to anyone still reading this post, the difference in FMV - cost basis (the ""compensation element"") is taxed as ordinary income when you exercise NSOs. For what it's worth (although I don't think it matters for this question), I exercised them in early 2017, am still holding these shares and will be for a while, and am actually leaving this company in a couple of months. 

As I understand it, all of this information is reported on your W2, and the compensation element is reported in Box 12 as code V. The taxes are combined w/ other taxes since it's just all tax paid on ordinary income. 

**BUT, my company's finance department did something that I don't fully understand**. Instead of reporting the compensation element in Box 12, they increased my compensation in Box 1 by the amount of TAXES I paid. 

**Verbatim from our controller** - *""Due to some system and personnel limitations at [payroll provider] we processed the taxes as regular income. So in total, you had $27,XXX in taxes (Federal, State, NYC, SS and Medicare). We grossed up your income to equal that same amount to remit those taxes to the state. Your check was $27,XXX and taxes $27,XXX, so the net pay was 0.""*



It SEEMS like I'm getting credit for the tax without reporting the associated income (which would be $72k-16k = $56k). 

**Is what my payroll team has done correct, or do I need to ask them to add the compensation element to Box 12?**

The other BOA account had a small balance, I'll just have BOA transfer the credit.   


Well, something happened that the 6 people I have spoken to can't (or won't) verbalize.   I found they *reversed* my payments, transferred the credit, and then CLOSED THE ACCOUNT.  I was shocked.   Initially, I was told the account was closed because I had not made a payment for several months (completely wrong).  Then I was told the code as to why the account had closed just wasn't in the system.   To add insult to injury, they had just charged my annual fee, which they reversed, resulting in a credit of $39 on the account.  They never sent it back to me, and it is still showing on the account.


I have gone up the chain without any satisfaction. I've dropped a great deal in credit score because I just lost $14,000 of available credit.  When I asked to reopen the account I got a polite ""that isn't possible"" and then received a corresponding letter with the reason being ""the terms are no longer available.""   I'm guessing it is because my max interest rate was 9.99%.  

I have a rather large deposit (over 10K) that I have been shopping banks for the best interest rates/bonuses.  Do you think if open a new account I can convince them to re-open the credit card account?   Incidentally, there is still a credit on the account.   And, out of curiosity, I made an additional payment of $20.00 which posted to the account just fine.  Currently, the account shows a $59 credit.

Always a pleasure. I've been in the process of purchasing a new construction home that we've had a $5k deposit on since November.

I passed on it.

The rates today I'm being quoted to lock now that I got a closing (yesterday) are 4.375%.

We can afford the home, that's not the issue--but these higher % rates are putting me where I did not want to be on monthly payments. I'd like to shave those extra $40/mo so I can feel better about it. Overall though, this is more about quality of living and lifestyle than an investment.

personalfinance,Defaulted Federal Student Loans. How much will they generally take for a settlement?,"Asking for a relative. Here’s the basic info.

He took out $15,000 in federal student loans between 2007-2009. He ignored them, never made a payment. Currently about $25k is owed ($15k principal, $5k interest, $5k fees and costs).

He is doing better financially now and has a good opportunity to buy a house from a relative at a very good price. He’s looking to get a FHA mortgage to buy the house. He’s been trying to fix his credit over the last few months - paid off all credit cards, has no other debts other than a 0.9% car loan.

He finally responded to the debt servicer that holds his defaulted student loan debt and entered into a rehabilitation agreement with them where if he pays for 9 months his debt will come out of default. However, that time frame is a quite a bit longer than  the owner of the house wants to wait to sell to him. 

We’ve been told that if he pays the debt off, he’d be able to qualify for a mortgage much sooner. So I’d like to help him negotiate a full payoff of the debt. His parents are willing to loan him $10k to help, and he can scrounge up $3-$4k more if needed. My question is, how much can we expect to be able to negotiate down to? I figure they might accept a much lower number since they haven’t seen a dime from him in 10 years, and would rather take money now than trust him to keep paying over time. 

So what’s the best way to approach negotiating a payoff amount?

CryptoCurrency,Why I Love Tether,"I'm somewhat new to Crypto, so I was very curious as to the point of Tether until the market dip.

My funds had hit my Coinbase Wallet and I happened to be in a position to buy the dip. I bought some ETH  hoping it would level out since the shills here at the time were advocating safer investments.
However, the price dropped form $1,014 down to $900 and my hands were feeling weak. Wanting to get into a coin that would bounce hard, I bought XLM. After the bounce I had profited handsomly. Feeling greedy however, I waited to cash out my initial investment past $.56, the approximate high of the most recent bounce, hoping it would go higher.
Once I saw the market start to go down again, I wasn't sure if I was in the middle of a dead-cat bounce or a leveling-off. I sold my initial investment's worth just to be safe. I'm now in a position I can be happy with; it's not nearly as much as I wanted but now I have ~$800 XLM in house money.

What brings me to Tether is this: what I could have done is transfer all my investment to Tether and not worry about having to go from XLM--&gt;ETH--&gt;Coinbase--&gt;USD Wallet/Bank Account and getting stiffed hundreds
of dollars in fees. I would only have to pay the Binance XLM--&gt;USDT, then USDT--&gt;Whatever coin I wanted to buy next.

In fact, I still might just keep my reserve in USDT in case I'm extremely confident about a good buying opportunity;  my initial investment was financed by interest-free debt, but I still have those maintenence-costs to consider (admittadly, I didn't consider this going in so I'm glad the bounce happened quickly).

Otherwise, I can at least put my remaining XLM into USDT if the market crashes again, then buy the dip again.

CryptoCurrency,How would a federal shutdown affect crypto prices?,"That’s stipulate that a federal shutdown WOULD affect crypto prices one way or the other - it’s not like any markets for anything would have no reaction at all to a federal shutdown that also has whispers of a debt ceiling battle that could go either way. 

My anticipation is that a shutdown would spike crypto prices the way it does gold - that certain segment of buyers who view cryptocurrency as a hedge against the failure of global economic systems will buy because a shutdown is a panic-buy moment for the crisis hedgers. 

At a higher level, a government shutdown that might entail a debt ceiling fight weakens faith in the dollar and by extension weakens faith in many related fiat currencies. Currencies not either dependent upon the stability of the federal reserve or those affected by it tangentially include cryptocurrencies and not much else. A general sense of weakness in fiat as a storehouse of exchange in normal economies is good for cryptocurrency. 

Third, a federal shutdown means that new regulation slows down and enforcement reduced considerably at least during the time of a shutdown plus the backlog that accumulated during one. I worked at the department of labor during the last shutdown and I can tell you that the backlog problem is huge for federal agencies. Because federal agencies have basically been manned by skeleton crews without an ounce of extra manpower for years now, there is very little extra bandwidth to deal with a backlog on top of the normal workload that accumulates when the government reopened. We had about two weeks of backlog during the last shutdown and it took us four months borrowing an hour here or there to clear it. 

Fourthly, a shutdown means that ordinary investors will see short term large losses in highly regulated industries like banks. Their panicked rebalancing may push more money into alternative investment strategies - like cryptocurrency. 

I see a shutdown as good for crypto prices at least in the short term. What are your thoughts?",cryptocurrency

How can I help myself get out of debt or out of this loan?,"I need help reddit. As the title says, I was young, dumb, and thought it would last forever. I wanted to support my then bf by co-signing a student loan so he could go to school to get a good job and career. He wanted to do better for himself and us. Things looked good and he was really good at computer programming, which is what the loan was for. Then he discovered that he would have to start at the bottom and work his way up to the kind of money he wanted to make. That's when things got bad and he decided to quit school.

So that's the prequel. Here we are 7 years after the breakup and he hasn't paid that loan for almost 2 years now. Collectors called non stop of course. They threatened to garnish my wages and send me to collections which would hurt my credit. I have good credit because I take care of my shit. I started paying the loan because I do want to be able to buy things like a car or a house.

I tried to taking him to small claims court in the beginning. The papers never reached him to appear in court as he gave me bogus addresses. We messaged via facebook and every time he said he'd take care of it. Then there were excuses as to why he couldn't pay it. I reached out to his family for help, with no response.

I've talked to a lawyer who said there is nothing I can do because as the co-signer, the student loan company will come after me first, every time. As long as they get paid, they're happy. This is a private loan too.

Is there anything else I can try to get out from the burden of paying for an education I didn't receive? I have my own student loans and personal debt. I now have a family. Daycare eats the majority of my paycheck. I'm losing money every month and at this rate, I will have to default and they will have to start garnishing my paychecks, which I'm trying to avoid.

If anyone has had any success in a similar situation, I am more than open to advice. If you have any advice on how to relieve my own personal financial burdens or get in the positive again, I'm listening. Thank you in advance!

Edit - What about taking out a personal loan to lower interest rates thus reducing the total amount I'll end up paying in the long run? Is that a good idea? Bad idea? 

Edit - I didn't post this to be told how stupid it was. I clearly know that now. Unfortunately, I didn't then. I didn't have anyone tell me how much of a burden it was or how I could be stuck with it in the end. I didn't grasp the concept of a co-signer. If I did, I wouldn't have done it.",finance
CryptoMarkets,"The Crypto King Report Jan 19th: Attending the North American BTC Conference (DASH, ARK, Augur), Northern Trend Following the Options Expiration, Picks for January (STRAT, ICX, NEO) and February","The Crypto King Report Jan 19th: Attending the North American BTC Conference (DASH, ARK, Augur), Northern Trend Following the Options Expiration, Picks for January (STRAT, ICX, NEO) and February 

I am excited to announce I attended the North American BTC Conference and am currently writing this shorter piece from the actual conference during the lunch break. Many more updates to come in the upcoming days! I have found some new ICOs and great February plays to discuss in coming reports. However, for today we will give a quick summary of the conference along with market updates.

The tickets peaked at $2500 per ticket and there were thousands of people here (I believe the total ticket sales approached 5,000 in total). If anyone was curious to if BTC and crypto was going away they were very wrong. There was more money in FIAT and BTC floating around this conference than imaginable. We are on the cusp of a financial revolution and what we witnessed in 2017 will be dwarfed by what we witness in 2018. I had an individual come up to me and ask if I knew where he could unload 10BTC because he didn’t bring fiat to Miami and the after party was at a gentleman’s club. That same person text me 20minutes later asking to know if I knew someone who had 90BTC because he sold his 10BTC and someone wanted another 90BTC. The revolution has begun, there is no reason to trust bankrupt governments of the world over the block chain. 

A couple of interesting tidbits from the conference. There are many new spectacular ICOs coming out in the next 30 days. I still highly recommend the two I’ve been purchasing into. Yet February will be exciting with many new ICOs on the horizon. Most of which presented and had booths at this conference displaying some pretty revolutionary tech.

From ICOs to major players like DASH the conference provided a wealth of information and confirmed one very important thing. That market crash we just witnessed was just that it was a crash, a required correction. The total market cap of cryptos had spiked above $700 billion, almost doubling in less than 60 days. This correction although anxiety provoking and displeasing for our portfolio was “healthy” and 100% required for the market to maintain momentum. With more and more institutional investors spreading their wings and investing outside of strictly BTC the entire crypto market, BTC included should have a significant pump in the coming weeks. This conference was the turning point for the BTC correction. Following this conference we have events in London, Manilla, San Francisco (DevCon hosted by NEO), Dallas, and many many more! Block chain is the future and whether your understand it 100% or not every individual in the entire country by the end of 2018 should have a holding in crypto. If you have money in the bank earning 1% or less per year, what is your risk? 

Nothing I say can be construed as financial advice but you can’t make gains in this world without significant risk and hard work. We all have the ability to put in the required work to understand blockchain and learn trading techniques to profit unimaginable amounts. If the Buy and Hold technique made investors 700-2000% this year. Imagine if you knew how to actively trade on market dips, buy and sell walls, all essentially very basic trading techniques.

I am excited in the coming weeks to help explore more educational topics while also sharing many of the insights I gained from this conference. I have 2 new coins I love for February and 2-3 ICOs depending on how well they put their platform together over the next 2 weeks. 

The current plan remains stay the course, the moonshots will all recover with ferocity in comparison to the regular cryptos “BTC, ETH, LTC.” I had faith in them 1 week ago, I have faith in them now and still maintain holdings in each. The safe plays remain just that, safe. STRAT has huge news coming next week which should push the price between $25-$30 (under $15 right now). ICX has a conference in the tallest building in Seoul, South Korea, which they are hosting and releasing their mainnet at, predicting a $15-20 price point by the end of January. This will be beyond huge and takes place January 25th. South Koreans already love ICX and with the recent FUD reversed this should be a great 2 weeks for ICX. NEO is hosting DevCon and the exposure along with introduction of NEO specific ICOs should pull some market share from the slowing, increasingly priced ETH network to the faster, cheaper NEO network. The buy and holds for January remain STRAT, ICX, and NEO. 

All prior moonshots if funds are available should be doubled down on based on charts. Most fluctuate in these turbulent markets 30-40% a day. If you are catching it in a dip, purchase with a sell order at approximately a 15% gain from your purchase price. As the associated price fluctuates throughout the day this should be an easy way to extrapolate a 15% gain with little effort. However, this does take monitoring charts so this is not for beginners (nor is this financial advice).

I have 2 picks for February that will be absolute game changers but will wait a day or 2 to release those along with new ICO plays. I want the market to recover so we all feel as though we have funds we can rotate around (not at a loss). I hope everyone will have a lovely weekend and enjoy the impeding bull rally that just begun! Prior to the closing of my favorite January ICOs make sure to get involved! PM for Discord link to the KINGDOM or ICO recs!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Pay off singular loan with higher interest rate or amalgamation of loans with lower interest rate?,"I have several loans from school, one of which is ~$10,000 at a 5% interest rate. My payments are $111 a month, while only paying down the interest is $43 a month.

My second set of loans is ~$22,000 with an average of 4.5% interest rate. My monthly payment would be $241 while only paying down the interest would be about $18 a month (if my math is correct).

I was advised to start paying down the amalgamation of loans first because the individual loans have differing interest rates and of course, my lowest interest rates would be the first to go, some of which are as low as 3%. None of those loans go above 5%.

Is one better than the other to pay off first?",finance

personalfinance,My car note interest rate is too high and I'm thinking about returning the car to the bank.,"Getting straight to the point, I'm 28 and aggressively looking to get rid of debt and pay down/off my student loans and credit cards (upwards of $30k, not including my car note) before I turn 30 years old.

I'm currently paying $410/month for my car (2012 Honda Fit), on which I still have 45 more months left to pay ($18,450). Granted, I've already sunk $11k in car payments, but I would really like to free up the monthly cash I pay towards the car+insurance ($600/month).

So, I'm considering returning the car to the bank, letting them auction it off and paying them the difference. It goes without saying that my credit is far from great and at the point, taking a step backward momentarily seems more fiscally responsible than riding this car out for the next 4 years.

With regards to how I'd get around without a car, I work from home and I have access to a sibling's car that I can use.

CryptoCurrency,"Tether, why is this even a problem?","I've seen a lot of content posted on the sub recently about Tether. Most seem to believe that they're just printing new coins at their fancy, and don't have anywhere near that much USD actually backing it. I would probably agree on that. 

But why does that actually matter? Fiat isn't backed by anything, it's just trust in the applicable country's economy. USD is printed by the federal reserve, and has nothing to back it apart from the trust in the US economy.  

So, we all currently value Tether at $1. Nobody has audited their accounts, so we can only trust that they're telling the truth and have actual USD backing. Do we even need the USD backing as long as there's that trust? 


Or do we even need to put our trust in a shady company, or can we use our *trustless technology* of the blockchain to give us our Tether 2.0 - a completely automated, trustless and decentralised blockchain which is always valued at $1, without the need for fiat backing?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How high of an interest rate justifies making more than the minimum required payment?,"So i've been thinking a lot about student loans, and loans in general, recently and I'm curious as what PFs thoughts are on the interest rate at which point it becomes better to pay off the loan vs putting the money in a retirement count or mutual fund.

The way I see it there are 3 major factors involved, the interest rate of the loan, the expected return on the market, and ones tolerance for risk. 

So how would you balance these factors? Would you spend extra to pay off a loan with 6% interest if the minimum payment was 10% of your monthly income? What about 3% interest if it was 20%? Other numbers? Where do you draw the line? I'm curious to know your thoughts.",finance
personalfinance,Options on Consolidating Debt While in School,"This is my first post in this sub so advance apologies for any faux pas. My questions are fairly straightforward: 

I'm currently a non-traditional student. When I decided to come back to school, I vastly underestimated the strain my program would put on my schedule and finances. As such, I'm trying to take a few basic steps to improve my debt situation and reduce stress on our single income. I have two questions: 

I currently have two credit cards that have about 10k on each (20k total). On our single income we can afford the minimum payment, but we can't pay these down fast enough to get out of the whirlpool of revolving debt, so I'm considering taking out a consolidation loan to pay off the cards and reduce our monthly payment. Minimum payment on both cards is about $260/ea. A $20k loan for 5 years at 10% would be about a $420 payment, saving $100/mo and also serving to reduce the amount of total interest over time by a large margin. The goal is to relieve pressure for the next 18 months until I can contribute to the household income again, at which point we would pay the principal down much faster. 

I'm also considering moving all of my financial business away from Wells Fargo and into the USAA Credit Union, for which I am eligible thanks to my fathers' service in the Air Force. 

Are these two steps strategically wise? Do you think a consolidation loan can be obtained at a reasonable interest rate under these conditions? I have ""fair"" credit, mid 600s. Are there any other concerns I should be aware of before making this move? Thank you, in advance, for your attention and time.",finance
personalfinance,"I made the same after tax with my last job, although I had a lower wage. Why?","I live in Georgia if that helps. I worked at a grocery store and was paid $9 an hour. After tax I usually made $8-8.5 an hour when I divided my paycheck by the hours I worked.

I now work at an electronics store and my wage is $10.25 an hour, however after tax I still only make $8-8.5 an hour. Why is that?

I never touched a W-4 until my newest job. I figured they were withholding more money for tax than my last, but I checked and since someone claims me as a dependent, I have no dependents to claim, and I'm single, it's taking out the right amount. 

So why would my last job be withholding less?

Also, on my W-2 forms, for my last job in box 2 for ""Federal Income Tax Withheld"" it was only $14. I worked at that job in 2017 from January-October and made $6K. At my new job that I started at the end of October, it has $180 in that same box. 

When I attempted to file my taxes on TurboTax, it said it was refunding me that $14 for my first job. I figured it would refund me for the $180 when I put in my new job's W-2 
(and that extra money would be the money I've been missing on my paychecks), but instead it didn't give me the $180 back and said I owed $10... what?

Can someone help me make sense of this? I don't get why I make the same amount of money for a higher paying job, nor do I understand why I'd get refunded the $14 but not the $180 in the same box on the other W-2.

personalfinance,"Got screwed in the housing bubble, next home still looks out of reach?","Hello PF thanks for your help today.
My spouse and I bought our first home in 2006 - a small condo in the Orlando area for $185k.  The value almost immediately tanked and bottomed out somewhere in the high $30s (barf) before slowly recovering over the last decade.  We refinanced under HARP into a 15 year loan in 2012.  We have been counting down the months till we break even on debt-to-value ratio and finally we have **just** crossed that checkpoint (woohoo!) We are still paying PMI every month. 


We now have two children and this place isn’t large enough for us anymore.  We also make more than 2x what we were when we bought 12 years ago.  We started looking into homes and were excited to see that with the current low interest rates we could live in a $400,000 home for about the same monthly cost as (our current mortgage payment) plus (the amount we are saving monthly for our next home).


The trouble is that because we have almost no equity in our current home it feels like we won’t ever have the out of pocket funds to make the next home happen.  Here’s the numbers, please let me know if I’m missing anything.


Current home loan balance - $110,000

Current home value - $110,000

New-home-fund monthly contributions - $900

Other debts - $0


* New home sale price $400,000
* New home down payment 5% - $20,000
* New-home-fund savings - $35,000


That leaves me with $15,000 for remaining out of pocket costs.  This is where I get dejected.

* Closing costs for selling current home - $2,400
* Closing costs for buying new home - $20,000
* Realtor fees - $8,000
* Movers - $2000
* Lawyer - $1000?

Total - $33,400


I’m $18,000 short, and 20 months away from making up the difference with my savings, at which point interest rates will certainly be higher and Central Florida real estate prices will most definitely be higher.  (We are one of the top booming areas in the nation.)  Sure my home’s value will increase but it’ll be outpaced by the value of homes in the price range we’re looking at.  

I’m sick of still living in my “starter” home after 12 years and I’m afraid that even if I resign myself to saving another two years rising  interest rates and housing prices will place a great home out of our reach yet again.  Rent prices for a place our size are lower than our mortgage payments, so renting our place isn't an option. Is there anything that can be done for someone like me with great credit, no debt, solid income, but not much cash for out of pocket costs?

CryptoCurrency,Calling all economists or monetary policy experts,"Forgive the long preamble, but I want to set some background for my question. It's motivated in large part by recent news that several banks, such as CapitalOne and Santander, are blocking transfers and credit card purchases to crypto exchanges. These moves could be an effort on banks' parts to avoid regulatory concerns, or they could be some sort of hegemonistic play to protect their unsuspecting customers from the evils of crypto markets. Or, they could be trying to dissuade investment in competing asset classes and value stores. But when I don my tin foil hat, I begin to wonder whether these banks are acting out of concern for their balance sheets and cash reserves (i.e., are they seeing too much capital being withdrawn in a short timespan by customers looking to buy cryptocurrency, such that it jeopardizes their liquidity?). Hence my question.

The combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies was recently as high as 800+ billion dollars. Meanwhile, the total amount of US dollars in circulation is approaching 5 trillion. I know this is sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison, because I'm looking at total crypto market cap on one side, and only US dollars (and not other fiat currencies) on the other. But...

Do you see a future in which the growth of cryptocurrency poses systemic risks to banks and the monetary system as a whole? At what point (market cap, level of adoption, etc.) would you see that happening? What would the early symptoms be, and what might you expect to see as a knock-on effect?

personalfinance,Former employer wants me to repay them taxes they didn't collect,"Here's the situation. I did some work over the summer. I was paid and told I'd be 1099'd later. I made my estimated tax to the IRS before the end of the year based on being a 1099 and submitted payment before the end of the year.

After paying, my accountant recommended that I should be a w-2. I agreed. Told my former employer that i'd be submitting a form ss-8 to dispute my status, and he immediately said he'd issue a w-2 to avoid involving the IRS. Great.

He then tells me that the IRS requires employers to pay the employee's tax obligation. So even though I submitted my portion of the obligation to the IRS already, that I need to write them a check so they can pay my portion to the IRS instead.

Round numbers to illustrate: 

- I was paid $10k 
- I paid my income taxes, plus $1500 for fed tax, self employment, soc sec, etc
- as a w-2, I am only responsible for half that, so I should be getting $750 back (my employer's obligation)
- my employer is saying that my $750 has to go through them, so in reality I should get $1500 back
- they should then pay $750 for them and $750 for me and I should pay them $750 (that they incorrectly never withheld)

My answer is ""the IRS has the money. Let them sort it out"". Their answer is, ""the IRS won't take federal obligations out of the prepayment so it has to go through us"".

personalfinance,Advice on Emergency Fund when Living at Home.,"Hey PF!
Looking for some advice on what the title says.

Background; I’ll be making about $50,000.

So I know an EF should be about six months of expenses, but I’ll be living at home. Thus rent, utilities, unexpected housing repairs, and even food will be not be in my budget. (Food I’m trying to keep at about 50-100 a month. Parents will take care of most of my grocery bill for me).

The only big expense I’ll have is my student loans. I’m going to pay close to double the payment amount, but those have federal protections on them in case the unforeseen happens.

So with no real expenses, what should my EF be? I was thinking maybe like $3,000. This covers my deductible on any insurance in case I visit the hospital or something. As well as any unforeseen maintenance I would need on my vehicle.

Does this sound about right? I’ll be graduating with $6,000 in the bank. Thus allocating $3,000 for EF, $2500 to my savings, and $500 to start with in usable cash.

During my time I’ll be saving at least $2500 a year for moving out (plan to live at home for about 4.5 years.) after that, insurance, loans, and gas, it gives me an average of $375 to play with a month.

That would be used for entertainment, what I don’t use will be split with a portion being rolled over for the next month and then the rest into a vacation fund.

If the rollover amount is too high or my vacation fund is taken care of and I’m waiting for the time off, I would put leftovers into my savings.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin and the Tax Changes in the US,"So Uncle Sam has not been kind to us crypto junkies. With the change of the tax code, each transaction now is effectively taxed as income (not capital gains) meaning you can pay up to of 39.6% in federal taxes alone depending on which tax bracket you're in, and if you do not live in a state that does not have an income tax then the state is going to also want its fair share as well.

I first must say I'm not a tax advisor and any information I divulge is food for thought. With that in mind, there are many ways to minimize your tax liability if you have a significant holding in bitcoin or any other crypto currency.

Imagine many of the concepts and recommendations given by financial planners and tax experts to an individual that has won a large lottery jackpot still applies in this scenario.

Lets say for example you have 5000 BTC and a big smile on your face, it would be ridiculously stupid to cash out any large amounts above $470,700 as Uncle Sam would be using the largest condom he has to rape you. If you cash out lets say 10 million in BTC, you're going to be paying nearly a little over 4 million in tax if you're in an taxable income state. If you're in NY or Cali then you should just move unless you don't mind giving boat loads of money to politicians that spend it on everything under the sun.

Lets say you take that same 10 million dollars and you were to cash out as an S Corp, lets say for example; Nakamoto's Cafe, Inc.

Because this is a pass through tax structure in which case any money that you invest into the business is a tax write off (for the most part). At which case you and your spouse become employees of Nakamoto's Cafe and each take a nice salary of $200,000 per year in which case the first 120k is taxed with Social Security. Your company will provide you and your spouse with 100% benfitits paid health insurance, life insurance, dental, vision and a very nice 401k with 100% match up to the maximum federal limit at currently $18,500 for a total of 37k yearly contributions tax deferred.

Your company is so great that they even provide you with a residence to pay rent free and covers all property taxes and utilities. Also very nice luxury company vehicles are provided to the executives with insurance covered and fleet gas card.

Your company provides you with lavish first class airfare when you travel for your business purposes ;) such as managing your bitcoin portfolio while sipping some coke and rum on the beach of Fiji.

The company of course provides very nice computers and mobile devices so you can run maintain your business anytime anywhere.

Ultimately there will be a time where you have to pay money on taxes for pass through distributions, in which case if you manage your money correctly you will not have any distributions and will be able to maintain your lifestyle the way you like. Also keep in mind giving to charity is much better investment than giving to Uncle Sam to invest. Seriously we bomb a country only to pay to rebuild them... lol

Any who these are just thoughts based on recommendations I've had from tax professionals and business lawyers. I'm sure this is easier said than done but from my understanding, this type of stuff is done quite often by the super rich obviously.

Please note that I'm not encoring you to avoid taxes, that would be stupid. I am however encouraging you to be smart with your money as the system is obviously rigged in favor of those who understand it and know how to take advantage of it.

Keep in mind you're doing nothing legally wrong by paying the least amount of tax legally required of you ;)

Now that Crypto Currency is evolving and the SEC is becoming interested in Tokens and ICO's as they represent Securities, there is clearly a legal argument that crypto is not a property and is a security in which case would be taxed as capital gains and not income :) but hey we'll have to see how this one plays out.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,No Federal Income Tax Withheld On My W-2?,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,Employer hasn't paid overtime and wrongly classified employees as contractors,"Hello!  Currently, I'm working as a sleep technician with a medical group as a full-time employee.  The group is located in Arizona.

Recently, I've noticed that, despite working in excess of 40 hours a week, I haven't received overtime pay.  Also, my fellow technicians and I are classified as independent contractors by the business, but we're definitely not contractors; we're working full-time only in service to the sleep lab, and have been for quite some time.  During the hiring process, we were not given anything indicating that this would be a contracted role.

This all came up recently when my coworker received a call from the IRS stating that the business had been audited, and the audit revealed the payment and classification problems.  The IRS worker said that we would be due compensation for our overtime up to a cap of $5,000, going back two years, but we could take the case to the federal board to look further back in the records and to have the cap on reimbursement removed.  Both my coworker and I have worked for this place for three years.

My primary question is whether there's a tradeoff for going to the federal board with this.  From what I looked into, it seems like we should be going to the federal board, given our work history and overtime compensation, but I wanted to make sure this was the ideal course of action.

Also, is there a particular time limit on taking action on this?  We'd like to put together some more money before we bring this forward, since the practice is likely to drop all of its technicians once this is brought out, so we don't want to be left without a safe cushion of funds.

Any insight on the matter is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Could I have gotten a better deal (financing)?,"Hello,

I recently purchased a used car (2005 Lexus LS430 with 108k on the clock). It is my first car purchase. I bought it from a 3rd party seller (friend) and took out a loan from a local credit union to pay for it. Just for some context, here are some info about me:

* 25 years old 
* 38k/year salary (I bring home $2600/month)
* I have 4 credit cards (26k limit total) 
* owe 32k in student loans
* 2.5k in credit cards debt
* No savings at all (2018 financial goal: 10k cash)
* credit score: 772 (at time of approval)

Expenses per month:

* $100 in student loans payment (PAYE/work for non-profit higher ed institution)
* $500 tuition (MS program - online)
* $250 gas 
* $150 auto insurance
* $0 living cost (I live with my parents)

So with all this, I went to my local CU to get a loan to buy my friend's car. I asked for a $7500 auto loan. I honestly thought all they cared about was my financial info before approving me for the loan. They not only asked for my financial info, but some standard info about the car too (VIN, year, make, model, and mileage). I asked them why that info matter and apparently it's needed to factor in the interest rate (understandable). I was approved with a 5.2% interest rate (no co-signer). I thought it was high. I was hoping for around 3.25%. I was told that they added an additional 1% purely because the car has over 100k on it. I was then trying to ask them what's the max I can get approved for (I'm trying to buy a 25k car in 2 years). They would not answer this question, said I'll only know if I'll be approved for the amount or not. 

Questions:

* Is this true? 
* How does this work? 
* Could I have gotten better financing elsewhere (I only went to 1 place)? 
* What can I do within the next 2 years to be better prepared for my next purchase?

Thanks in advance for the help!

personalfinance,"Debt, Cancer, My Forever Home, and Having Fun","Hi Reddit,

I would like to give a little background on myself before I ask my question

Early 30s, $70k Annual Salary, $8k in debt on CCs, Single — Never married and no kids.

In the last year I have purchased and done a complete renovation on an older home. In total about $55,000 (tore down to studs, new flooring, bathrooms, roof, kitchen, HVAC, etc). Fun right? So this is where the bad part comes in. When I was a teenager I was diagnosed and treated for a very rare form of cancer. I was able to be treated successfully and I spent my 20s enjoying life without many worries in regards to that. However a few months ago unfortunately it relapsed and metastasized to the point where it is not treatable. There is a slight silver lining… The general consensus amongst all the doctors I have seen is that I can live with this condition from anywhere from 10-15 years. So obviously my long term plans have changed and now I’m just kind of here trying to figure out how to best enjoy my life. 

One of the things I want to do now is do some fun things with my house so I can enjoy it before I pass away. Ideally I would like to build a deck, install a pool/hot tub, do some landscaping, and some other miscellaneous things. My question here is what would be the best way to leverage this using the equity that I have put into the house so far? 

I purchased the home for $150k and dumped about $55k into it. The home is located in a older established neighborhood in a very desirable location. I believe the house will appraise well. What do I need to do to leverage this and utilize the equity? Are there any other avenues I can utilize for additional funds (401k?). Obviously I don’t really care about the interest because the loan will more than likely outlast me. As of right now I think I owe about $137,000 on the house. Some other information - I have about $1700 a month to play around with after bills.

Sorry for the rambling as it is kind of hard mentally and emotionally to articulate this

TLDR - Have terminal cancer. Want to know how I can best utilize my assets to do fun things and obviously don’t care about interest rates due to shortened lifespan.",finance
Vechain,Soup Dumpling and Pu'er Tea,"*Puts on tin foil hat*

&amp;nbsp;

/u/Cocacolakid_OG sends whispers of Pu'er tea and soup dumplings. It's one of the main motifs to his messages along with PBoC 'rumors'. 

Both of these delicacies are enjoyed at a dim sum meal.

&amp;nbsp;

...But it seems that dim sum also has a major meaning in Chinese finance... specifically the bond market.

&amp;nbsp;

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dim-sum-bond.asp) 
&gt; A bond denominated in Chinese yuan and issued in Hong Kong. Dim sum bonds are attractive to foreign investors who desire exposure to yuan-denominated assets, but are restricted by China's capital controls from investing in domestic Chinese debt. The issuers of dim sum bonds are largely entities based in China or Hong Kong, and occasionally foreign companies. The term is derived from the Chinese cuisine that involves serving a variety of small delicacies and is especially popular in Hong Kong.

&amp;nbsp;

Dim sum bonds are a way for foreigners and other organizations/entities to in invest in Chinese debt i.e., getting an IOY in a strong currency like the Yuan without getting caught up with PBoC regulations. 

&amp;nbsp;

[As well, Europe's central banks want to start replacing reserves with Yuan because it is becoming so stong.](https://qz.com/1180434/europes-central-banks-are-starting-to-replace-us-dollar-reserves-with-the-chinese-yuan/) But they are hesitant because *""capital controls and a lack of regulatory transparency make financial institutions reluctant to invest in Chinese assets.""* Centralized controls like the PBoC heavily regulate Yuan cash flow in and out, even though they have shown a [change in attitude in order to keep the Yuan strong in the global economy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-09/china-is-said-to-shift-way-it-manages-yuan-after-currency-s-jump). 

&amp;nbsp;

**VeChain** 

&amp;nbsp;

We have already seen VeChain partner with Fanghuwang, which is a financial services organization that focuses on providing property mortgage loans, and collateral backed lending (debt). 

&amp;nbsp;



PBoC needs a way to keep the Yuan strong at home against other currencies like the USD and Euro. Traditionally they have achieved this by heavily regulating the flow of Yuan in and out of the economy. But they also want to turn the Yuan into a successful global currency used in foreign reserves and allowing foreign investment, which requires less restriction on cross boarder capital flows. Two priorities that conflict with each other.

&amp;nbsp;

PBoC is not making a play to use VEN or VEN tokens as currency necessarily, but using it as a platform for international debt markets and monetary policy oversight. Blockchain, specifically VeChain is the way China will internationalize the Yuan. It provides transparency for PBoC to as to where/ how much Yuan and Yuan backed bonds are distributed globally. As well gives regulatory transparency/confidence for foreign financial institutions to take on Chinese assets. 

&amp;nbsp;

*Disclaimer:* I am not an expert on monetary policy and foreign affairs. I would appreciate a look over and will make any edits needed.

personalfinance,College student looking to live off campus next year; sticky finance situation,"Hello, I’m currently a sophomore in college and I’m in a frustrating/sticky situation as far as my living situation goes for next year. I normally take out my grant and loans to pay for school. I was planning to live off campus next year, so what I was going to do was take out the same amount of money that I normally do (as if i was living on campus) and get a “refund check” from the school because I obviously wouldn’t be paying the school as much money (my room and board would be off campus). I’ve done some research on this and people do this, however, I realized I might not get as many loans next year if I’m not living on campus, which means I wouldn’t be able to pay for the monthly rent. I will have a job in the summer making as much money as I can, but I am paying for school on my own. Is there any way I could take out a private bank loan/should I? Also, I accepted too much money on one loan this year, so I actually have a refund check, I was going to return it to the government, but should I keep it for next year (this particular loan has a high interest rate)? Thank you very much in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Loan repayment question.,"I have a student loan with 4,800 owed (4 1/2 years to payoff) I have a credit card maxed out at 2,000 dollars (16.49% interest)

My 401k balance is about 15,000. 

I am strongly considering taking a loan for 6,800 from my 401k, and using that to pay off the full balance of my credit card and student loan. I can afford to pay the 140 a paycheck (biweekly for 2 years) for the 401k loan pretty easily as I’ve been wanting to pay off my debt quickly anyway but I’m not good at saving a lump sum and paying off my loans in bulk. 

The main thing that made me want to do this is that the interest from my 401k loan goes right back into my 401k and I would much rather pay myself interest instead of the government and a credit card company. 

I understand the interest rate is a little higher on a 401k loan but I would pay it off in half the time so I feel like that’s better.  

Anywayyyyy am I insane?  Or is this a good idea?  I understand that there may be better methods out there that require more discipline but I’m really not the greatest yet. I’m working on it.",finance

personalfinance,Sell stock to put in Roth IRA?,"Thanks to this sub I've made my first contribution to a Roth IRA (1 share in Vanguard VTI - a small start)! Now I'm wondering if I should move some stock I have from a high school/college job into this account as well before my income level increases? 

Here's the details:
Stock: [Publix](http://www.publixstockholder.com/stock-and-dividend-information) - a non-public stock offered only to employees. I no longer work there, so cannot purchase more stock or reinvest dividends. 

I have 13 shares equaling $479.05

The cost basis is $16.95 = $220.35

So I think my amount subject to capital gains = $258.70

Stock Performance: 

Publix: 08-01-2012: $22.00, now = $36.85 (67.5% increase), ~$2.99 quarterly dividend check (just goes in my checking account). 

Vanguard VTI: 07-31-2012: $70.37, now = $143.92 (104% increase), ~$2.69 annual dividend reinvested. 


Other info: Moving from GA (~6% st capital gains I think) and WA (0% st capital gains I think) in July – would wait till then to sell. My wife and I will likely be right at the threshold of having to pay the 15% federal capital gains tax. This will depend on summer work, so will know when we move. We will be in the 15% bracket next year (2019) and beyond. 

I'm not sure how to compare the benefits (and risks) between the quarterly dividend checks and the smaller reinvestment into the roth ira, but my initial thought was to sell the stock when we move to WA to pay as little on taxes as possible, then put it in my roth IRA (more VTI for now). 

Thanks for any advice.",finance

I'm 19 years old and stationed in Hawaii, never used a credit card before, never bought any serious item that needed commitment to pay off. My food and living arrangements around automatically dealt with as I live in the barracks.

I'm trying to get as much money out of this lifestyle so far and I have been doing quite nicely in comparison to my peers but I have just been banking it and letting it sit in my checking account while not doing much of anything with it except the average payments, food,haircuts, monthly Wifi payment.

With all my deductions from taxes and what not I make a final of approximately $2,100. But I have TSP Roth set up and with that I think is $190 a month or it may be each paycheck, unsure about that sorry. I just got my first credit card sent to me and its fresh and new so I have nothing for credit right now. Good news is I have literally zero debt, not a single payment except my Wifi. I think thats good news?

Goals are to purchase a car as I am stationed here for the next 4 years, nothing too expensive mainly looking for under 5-6k as most others here have around that price. Really trying to save as much as possible here so I can be financially secure and to thrive in the future.

Long story short I have about $2,100 a month to play around with right now and I want to invest and get the most out of everything as long as I am in.


Many thanks to anybody that reads this and more gratitude for anybody that can help in any way possible. Apologies for any mistakes I made, if any more information is needed I will be more then happy to help!

Back in August I got stuck in Atlanta (during hurricane Irma). The airline canceled my flight twice and i ended up having to stay an extra 4 days that i did not plan for. i was staying with someone i considered a friend but ended up feeling unsafe so i applied for paypal credit and i was given a 1k credit line. with the hurricane most hotels in the area were booked so i had to get a more expensive hotel in buckhead. Cost around 850 dollars for the 4 days, i used the rest of the money for food. I immediately began paying it back once i returned home however, i have been unsuccessful in paying it off. The APR is 24.99% which will start in February. 

In November i got my first credit card with 0%APR for 14 months. 
i tried to use the card to transfer the balance from paypal but apparently you cant do that, just my luck. 

Ended up using the credit card to pay off Christmas gifts. i gave the credit card to a friend to hide , so i couldn't use it while paying off the amount spent ($821).

my total cost per month is: $150 

i am concerned about the paypal credit debt. it is currently the only debt i have that is about to start accumulating interest. To add to the mix, i recently had to throw all of my furniture away and need minor repairs done to my car. 

so here was the plan: 
I would take out a personal loan for 5,000 with an interest rate of 19% and consolidate my debt from both cards. I would use a  portion to buy necessary furniture items(i.e. bed and couch), make the repairs to my car, and put the rest back on the loan and split my taxes between the personal loan and my car loan(car loan was 13k, so far  have paid off 4k in a year with a monthly payment of $259 but i usually pay more so about $300).

this would take everything down to 2 payments a month. 
personal loan:$125
car loan:$259

Does any of this makes sense? what should i do? 
i have asked everyone i know and i am getting mixed responses. 
please let me know if you need me to clarify anything.

thanks.",finance
CryptoCurrency,How the US Gov SD affects Gov Employees,"With the (less than 2 hour old) news that the US Government is shutting down, I'd like to share a personal story about how it affects me and potentially other government employees in regards to crypto. 

When the Federal Govt shuts down, they stop processing payments for the majority of government employees, including military. I am in the US Navy, and so fall under the group that will be working without pay. 

Over the last 6 months to a year I have watched crypto grow and have put away what money I could spare to invest. I also enjoy mining crypto as a hobby and put some money into that. All of this was with the intention of hodling because I think that crypto in general is a pretty awesome thing, and has great potential. However, now that i will be working with no pay, I must cash out all of my current holdings to ensure that I have enough dollars to make monthly payments for the necessities of life. 

Its my hope that other people can share how this news affects them and although unlikely maybe we can get the people in DC to listen and see how they are hurting millions of Americans.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I take out a loan from A lender off Credit Karma?,"I’m 23(m), married and have a one year old daughter. My wife is in the military and I have a job off base. I’ve always struggled with debt but i have always made my payments on time except for two times back in 2015 but that’s just been keeping me a float in my debt situation. Never really getting rid of it because I was naive with my credit cards. So recently I’ve calculated my total debt to be out to about 8k and II’ve been working on my credit score for a few months now and it’s risen quite a bit, almost 700.  Credit Karma has been suggesting prequalified loans from a couple vendors to pretty much consolidate all my debt in to one bill. I’ve read some reviews under the lenders and in each one people say they regret going that route and should’ve gone to a bank or credit union for a loan or balance transfer. 
 I want your guys opinions or if anyone on here has received a loan through the vendor, how’d it go? I’ve always been a little weary about loans. 

Also, since my wife is military I was able to get an application from Bank of America to lower my interest rate down to 6% on my credit card through them. A few days ago I was approved for a $1800 credit card from them with a 15 month no interest so I’m using that as a balance transfer with my recent purchase from Ashley furniture. Which will cover it fully. 

My three highest accounts are Bank of America credit card($3600) capital one credit card($1400) and Ashley furniture’s lender($1800)",finance
Bitcoin,The Tragedy of Dollar The Ungold,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Dollar The Ungold? I thought not. It’s not a story the Fed would tell you. It was the main event of the Great Hyperbitcoinization of the year 2028. 

The Dollar was a fiat currency, so powerful and so malicious it could use the Inflation to force the citizens to finance wars, tax extortion and other crimes.

Its master, the Fed, had such a knowledge of the dark side that it could keep the Dollar from dying even after it was decoupled from gold. The dark side of the Economics is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. 

Dollar The Ungold became so powerful… the only thing the Fed was afraid of was losing its power, which eventually, of course, it did. 

Fortunately, a decentralized boi called Bitcoin has learned from the faults of the Dollar, and killed it during yet another government shutdown. 

Ironic. The Dollar was backed by the strongest military in the world, but was defeated by a bunch of geeks with computers.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Looking for advice on my 5 year plan, and what to do from there on.","I'm 37 years old. Using a throwaway because there could potentially be enough detail here to ID me, and I don't want to take that chance. 

So, here's the deal.  I spent most of my 20s fucking up, to be honest.  I survived, and was a decent person, but I was clueless about personal finance, and didn't make enough money for it for it to really matter anyways.  

My current situation: 

I have a really great job (by comparison) finally.  

I made 70k in 2017. 
I will make somewhere around 90k in 2018. 
I will make somewhere around 120k in 2019. 
Probably about 135k in 2020. 
Probably about 150k in 2021. 

I'm in sales, so at some point, I'll run into an economy of scale issue.  I simply will run out of bandwidth, and my growth will slow down considerably.  I suspect (based on historical data and others that have roughly the same level of talent and determination), that I will probably reach 150k in the next 5 years, growth will slow down, and it will probably top out at somewhere around 200k no matter how long I work my current job. 

Currently:  I have about 80k in student loan debt.  About 10k in the bank, and about 10k in 401k.  I have no debt, other than the student loans.

Note: my consolidated interest rate on the student loan debt is 4.8 percent, and the payment is manageable, so I'm thinking there's no good reason to hurry to pay that off, as I can probably put extra money to work making a higher interest rate than 4.8. Right or wrong?  I'm thinking that if I can keep in good standing credit wise, that I shouldn't pay anymore quickly than I have to, but I would like to hear from experts on this.  

Here is the current plan that is in place, which I know is both not perfect, and incomplete.  I'm really looking for help in refining my short term plan (5 years), and to be educated on what I should do after that, which I haven't given a ton of thought to.  

Here's the current 5 year plan:

2018: 90k income:  Get around 12 to 15k into my 401k (traditional).  My company matches 20 percent on the dollar up to 6 percent of total earnings for the year.  I would also like to max out an IRA at 5500, and save 10,000 in actual cash after all is said and done.  

2019: 120k income: Max out the 18,500 in traditional 401k, as well as the 5500 in IRA.  Also save another 10 to 15k in cash which should leave me at 30k or so to do a 20 percent down payment on a reasonable house, with a 15 year mortgage.  Housing is pretty cheap in my area, so I'm thinking that I could buy a duplex, live in half of it and get my tenant to take care of probably half of the mortgage payment.  I'm calculating this based on 30,000 down on a 150k house at 4 percent.  That would make the mortgage payment 1,100, and I figure I could get 5 to 600 from a tenant.  

2020: 135k income: Max out traditional 401k at 18,500.  Max out IRA at 5500.  Continue living in the duplex as before, paying my 500 share of the 15 year mortgage payment.  This is where I'm not quite sure what to do.  I should be able to save quite a bit of money. Should I pay ahead on the mortgage?  Should I pay ahead on the student loans?  Should I do neither, and look to invest the money for a higher rate of return than the interest I'm paying on the loans?  

2021: 150k income: Max out 401k, max out IRA. But what I do here depends on what I did the year before, and I'm assuming the strategy that made sense in 2020, is going to continue to make sense in 2021.  

2022: 155k income: Max 18,500 on 401k, max 5500 on IRA.  Assuming I didn't rush to pay any debts off early, I should have enough to put down 20 percent on my house, and rent both sides of the duplex and break even on the mortgage indefinitely.  

These assumptions, of course are assuming that we don't get hit with a recession, which is certainly possible.  Assuming we don't, I feel very confident about my income projections.  

I'd like to hear suggestions on how I can improve my 5 year plan, and what on earth I should be looking to do after that.  My goal is to be retired by 60 at the latest.  

Thank you in advance.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Tether isn't a scam. It's too profitable.,"First off, I don't own any tether, I've never owned any tether and I will likely never own any tether. DYOR, this is my opinion only and not investment advice.

I find it extremely hard to believe that the controlling entity of tether would give up a long term cash cow for the sake of short term gain, even if the amount contributed is getting close to USD$2 Billion.

1. I see a lot of people mentioning the point that tether can't physically be redeemed for USD$1. The only reason this would be the case is so tether can be bought back at a lower rate when demand drops (which may be hard to believe for the large percentage of people here who think this is going to go on forever). Short term fluctuations mean it's going to drift above and below USD$1, even if it's only to 98 cents or 102 cents. By using their USD stockpile, they can buy back tether at 98 cents, locking in a 2% gain and keeping the coin relatively stable. 
2. The interest accruing on their current USD balance would be huge - assuming a very low interest rate of 2%, their interest payments would be close to $100,000 a day. Banks love having big chunks of fiat currency sitting on their balance sheet, especially amounts that are likely to sit there for a long time.
3. The audit process of this business would be like nothing an accounting firm has dealt with before. I'm an accountant in Australia, and knowledge in this area generally is close to zero. They engaged
4. Some people seem to believe it's impossible for tether to have USD$2 Billion stockpiled in a bank account. It is a lot of money, but there are entities out there with a lot more. Apple for example has [USD$16 Billion in cash and cash equivalents](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/Q1FY17ConsolidatedFinancialStatements.pdf). It's not impossible for the exchanges issuing tether to convert their local currency to USD, and send that USD in exchange for tether - especially when they'll be taking in trading fees on transactions using that tether.

I feel like the majority of people here calling tether a scam are just jumping on the bandwagon. I'd happily wager that tether will be ticking along, business as usual 6 months from now.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,[Update] I Feel Like my $20K Debt Won't Ever End,"I am sure most of you saw my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7rihei/i_feel_like_my_20k_debt_wont_ever_end/) yesterday about my debt situation.

Before I say anything, I really really really want to thank everyone who has taken time out of their lives to point out and offer suggestions about my self-induced situation that I am only to blame for- *THANK YOU!* 

I also want to say thank you to those who offered some hope for me in this situation- it can feel pretty isolating and scary to be in this situation, but hearing your words of hope and advice has really helped me gain some momentum and motivation to change this, *THANK YOU!*

So, after considering everything that was offered in the last thread, and knowing myself and the specifics of my situation, this is my plan of attack:

* 1- I will reevaluate my budgeting and trim the fat even more.

* 2- I am going to call the credit card company and try to negotiate a lower interest rate and contract with them to close the account if they so please. (I will tell them I will go to a 0% card if they don't want to play ball)

* 3- If #2 doesn't work I will attempt to find a lower interest rate on a personal loan through a credit union and pay the card off with that and pay the personal loan VERY aggressively.

* 4- If this all doesn't work out, I will sell my investments, take a hit on the fee and penalty, and start all over. (this sounds the most appetizing right now, just because I know myself, and the idea of starting from a clean slate with better habits sounds *so* good at this point)

Some notes:

- I don't feel comfortable with lending clubs, etc.- I understand they are legit, but I irrationally just don't care to use them.

- Due to my credit score being as low as it is, I don't think I will be approved for much of anything on other credit cards so doing a balance transfer seems unattainable for me.

I have gotten myself into this mess, and thanks to all of your great^(and some not so great) advice I feel supported and ready to tackle my debt. Thank you again!

CryptoCurrency,Misconception: Authy App is less secure than Google's 2FA app - It is not,"So I just watched [
Doug Polk Crypto claim Authy App is less secure than Google's 2FA app
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBVCn7q_fSI) and I think it's time to kill the misconception. If you set it up properly, not only is Authy App just as secure as Google's 2FA app, but it also offers easy 2FA account backup, device transfers, and more. In fact, it offers more security since you're not doomed if you ever lose your phone, and either forgotten to write down your 2FA keys or have lost them otherwise.

**First misconception: Authy App is insecure because you just need to know someone's phone number**

When you install Authy App the first time, you must register an Authy App account. The ""username"" of your account is your phone number, so to speak. If you ever need to reinstall Authy App, you need to verify your phone number via SMS or phone call to gain access to your Authy App account.

To gain access to someones Authy App account, you need to receive SMS on their number. Just knowing their phone number isn't enough. So lets move on to the next attack vector, or misconception.

**Second misconception: Authy App is insecure because you can spoof someone else's phone number and receive SMS and phone calls on their number**

Yes, if you can receive SMS or phone calls on a phone number, you can get access to the Authy App account registered on that phone number. However, when first installing Authy App, you also had to create a password. The password is an encryption key for AES-256, and all the 2FA account keys are encrypted with AES-256 using your password. If you do not know the password, you cannot read or use the 2FA account keys, and you cannot authenticate with any of the 2FA accounts. Spoofing a phone number isn't enough, we also need to know the password to gain access to the 2FA account keys and be able to authenticate with the 2FA accounts.

You can test this yourself with Authy App by installing it, adding a password, adding a 2FA account key, enable backup (this is important), and then deleting the app. When you reinstall Authy App, verify your phone number (pretending you spoofed your own phone number), and you still cannot access the 2FA account keys without knowing/entering the password.

Just for completeness: The encryption happens entirely client-side, that means, in the app. Your password is salted and hashed with SHA-256. Since the encryption is entirely client-side, your password (or rather, your salted password hash) will never leave the app, and is never broadcasted or transmitted over any network. The only way for an attacker to get hold of your password, is for them to have installed a keylogger on your phone, and snap the password as you type it in. Source: [How Authy 2FA Backups Work](https://authy.com/blog/how-the-authy-two-factor-backups-work/)

But wait, the backup, isn't that stored in the cloud? How can that be secure? lets move on to the next attack vector, or misconception.

**Third misconception: Authy App is insecure because they store the 2FA accounts backup in the cloud**

Let's be clear, the Authy App do store your backup in the cloud. The misconception however is that it is insecure. Remember how your password was salted and hashed using SHA-256, and then encrypted entirely client-side, in the app, with AES-256? The backup that is sent out to be stored in the cloud is already encrypted when being sent by the app. For someone to break into the backup of your 2FA account keys, one of these things need to happen:

1. They know your password.
2. They guess your password.
3. Both SHA-256 and AES-256 are breached.

The last point, both SHA-256 and AES-256 being breached, is so unlikely that we can just rule it out as impossible for now. If these two algorithms are breached, the consequences extends far, far beyond just your 2FA key backup being compromised. Bitcoin's PoW mechanism is compromised. The entire secured web is compromised. No, it's just very, very unlikely to happen.

What is more likely to happen, is the first two points. Therefor, choose a good, long password that is hard to guess, and hard to figure out by using dictionary attacks or brute-force. **Your password is the weakest link when using Authy App.** Choosing a damn good password will make your 2FA account keys just as secure in Authy App as they are in Google's 2FA app, while also not dooming you should you ever lose your phone, forget to write down your 2FA keys or lose the keys otherwise.

You can find more details about the encryption and hashing in this blog post from Authy: [How Authy 2FA Backups Work](https://authy.com/blog/how-the-authy-two-factor-backups-work/)

personalfinance,General Financial Planning,"EDIT: Forgot to mention I am 28.

Hey guys, apologies for the long post. These are some questions I have tried to ask my financial planner and have a difficult time getting solid answers out of him (which is why I will either be dropping him or finding a new one).

Basic story is I am a physician at a hospital. I am in my first year of practice and I am attempting to set up for either early retirement or at least cutting my work load to 50% by about age 50-55. I currently have 240k in medical school debt and my wife has 150k in debt (our average interest rate is ~6.2%). My current salary is ~230k/yr with some minor fluctuations for extra shifts (so +/- 15k). My wife has just started in her practice and will make ~80-90k per year. We have a home and our current monthly expenses after budgeting and BEFORE paying for student loans is ~3500/month. My wife and I plan on contributing ~4300/month to student loans with extra payments every quarter or year based on how well we are doing financially. I have 6 months of emergency funds in a capital one MM account earning 1.4% APY. I have a 401k and 457b at work which I am maxing out (assuming 18.5k contribution limits) and have ~10k as of writing this. My wife and I have a Roth IRA with ~8k in and traditional IRA with ~4k in. I do not receive a match on 401k until one year of employment (sucks right?) and then I will be receiving 4% match on every paycheck (so I can't just max it early in the year). 

My plan is to continue to max my 401k/457/IRA contributions each year and then spend whatever is left on student loans (highest interest loans first). Is this a good strategy? I understand that some risk is involved in ""heavy"" investing which could go towards student loans but I have subscribed to the theory that ""time in the market beats all"" assuming of course that we see ~7% return. I don't want to aggressively pay down my student loans only to find that I am behind in market investments. I also believe that the relief of tax burden by contributing to retirement funds is tempting enough to make me want to invest, however I have not sat down and cranked out the math.

Questions:
1) does my current plan sound good? Should I change my strategy?
2) This will be the first year that I will not qualify for Roth IRA, however I have been contributing to a Roth IRA and Traditional for some time knowing that this day would come. Does that mean that THIS YEARS contributions only should be rolled over to a traditional, or do I have to completely get rid of my Roth and switch all the funding to a traditional?
3) As stated before, I am not super happy with my financial advisor and the IRA account that he has me investing in has not performed well over the last 3 years (8% gain, however Vanguard target date has ~11% over the same time period). I would like to change my investment fund for my IRA, however I don't know if it's worth it to roll it over to fidelity/vanguard given that I have a Roth AND traditional. Also, I just don't know what the process for that is.

Those are my basic questions. As some aside, my wife and I have done some basic research about refinancing on student loans and based on my credit score (which aint bad but aint great) we would only save about $72 per month on refinancing so we decided to just roll that into our payments so we keep the advantages of federal student loans. If you guys have any tips or suggestions, please let me know. I am open to any and all ideas mostly because I am flying blind out here. Thank you guys so much. Apologies for the long post.",finance

personalfinance,Investing vs. Debt,"I've recently come to the realization that it didn't make much sense to chase 5-10% gains from investing in the stock market when I was paying ~14% interest on credit card debt, so I paid off my credit card balance. I think everyone would agree this was the logical thing to do.

However, this got me thinking about other debt that I'm paying interest on, and if it would be more beneficial to pay that off to avoid paying interest, or if market gains would outweigh the interest being paid. I think with the credit card debt, the answer was fairly obvious, but with other debt it's a little less clear.

I'm curious what the general recommendations are regarding investing in the market vs. paying off auto loans and mortgages. Let's assume ""current averages"" for everything: the average gains from this current bull market, average interest rates, etc. and also that the average person probably doesn't have enough cash/investments to pay off their mortgage. Also, I should also point out that I'm not referring to IRAs or retirement-type investing in the market.",finance

personalfinance,Student tax questions?,"Not sure if I can post this here, if not I can come back for tax Tuesday- just let me know and I will delete. 


Basically, I decided to go back to school and started my first semester in Fall of 2015. In 2016, while filing for taxes (which I usually get $400-600 back every year), I somehow managed to get a $1200+ return. Which, I believe is due to being a student as my friends who are students told me they got bigger returns for being students (however I'm not sure if they receive grants or pay themselves). 

I receive federal pell grants, and in 2015 I did not have any personal expenses that my grant did not cover. 

Then in 2017, when I was filling my 2016 tax return- I got around $400+ as my total tax return. I was confused because I was expecting a much bigger return considering I was a full time student for both spring and fall of 2016, but I didn't really question it. 

Now, this year, 2018, I am filing for my 2017 tax return. I was a full time student for spring and fall of 2017. 
I spent $400 of my own money on education expenses one semester (books and a calculator that were necessary for school). I kept the receipts for these things because I was expecting to take advantage of a student tax credit for spending my own money. So while I was bummed to spend that kind of money I figured it would be worth it come tax season for a credit. 

I get small refunds from my pell grant if there is money leftover. In spring of 2017, I got $171 refunded to me during the middle of the semester. I spent my own $400 at the beginning of the semester, so by the time $171 came into my bank account it didn't really help reimburse the the $400 I had spent, so I guess I used that for general expenses like gas, bills, or mortgage. 

During my fall semester 7 months later, I was refunded again from my pell grant, this time $225. I didn't have any personal education expenses during my fall semester so that money went to general expenses. So in total my Pell grant refunded $396 to me throughout 2017.

Now I'm filing my tax return and I'm once again only expected to get $400+ back on my tax return, and my $400 credit in education expenses I was expecting is apparently negated by the $396 in grant refunds so now they're only giving me a $4 credit. 

Obviously I know taxes don't work on the fairness of the situation, but how do I go from getting $1200 back for going to school one semester and now I'm back to $400 returns when I'm a full time student? And is there any way to get that student expense credit for the $400 I spent and count the $396 refund from my grant as taxable income? 

Idk if any of this makes sense. I usually just plug my numbers into turbo tax because I can have it done for free there. Figured it wouldn't hurt to ask Reddit.",finance

I am from Canada originally so filed taxes in the US for the first time last year. I started my work in 2016, but only worked half the year. In 2017 I received a tax refund of nearly $7,000 federal, $1,600 state. 2017 I worked the entire year and received a bonus of $21,000, making my taxable income for the year about $120,000. I just did a quick tax refund estimate on Turbo Tax's website and it said it would be about $3,350 this year. This looks normal since I worked the entire year, not half the year like 2016, but it is still higher than I'd like. 

Do these numbers make sense? After receiving such a large tax refund for 2016, I was hoping to make adjustments to my W-4 so that I'll receive that money on my paychecks regularly, instead of having it withheld in tax. I already have 2 allowances listed in my W-4, but I think I could at least push it to 3 if I can file as head of household.

personalfinance,Money Market Fund Interest Rate Comparison,"Hi,

I am confused by Money Market Funds. I did some reading but I am not sure about the ROR since the percentage is listed a little differently.

For example, a Vanguard Money Market Fund states a compound yield	at 1.45% ; is this true? Is this % comparable to the current interest rate (in the USA)? 

In other words; if I am making money and putting it into a standard savings account with an interest of 1.35% (Ally bank for example), should I move this money into the Money Market fund in the meantime? At this point, is there even any point in having a normal bank account? Why not direct deposit straight to Vanguard?

personalfinance,"New to personal finance, is this the best plan for me going forward?","Warning, this may be lengthy: 

Never really thought about finances all that much, never was discussed when I was growing up, basically survived up to this point (mid-20s) on part time jobs and random luck barely making paycheck to paycheck. 

  Well I’ve recently finished school and have a new, stable, full time job for ~50k/year before taxes. Here recently I stumbled on this sub and had my eyes opened in a big way. Doing more research for myself lately and I have some new, financially responsible goals in mind. 
I’ve been tracking my spending for several months &amp; have started working on a budget to help keep me further on track with my goals. 

My first and main issues I want to tackle are my debt &amp; my (lack of) savings. 
Despite two part time jobs during full-time school I still had to resort to student loans and living off a credit card for a little bit. On top of this I have some debt from home repairs/remodels. 
Here is a general breakdown: 

Home repair debt: ~3500 with 25% interest (total of a smaller and larger debt)

Credit card debt: ~5700 with   14% interest

Student loans: ~6900 with 4% interest

I also currently have nothing in savings &amp; a basic checking account doing nothing for me. At BoA. Who I hate for many, many reasons. However I’ve had an account there for 10 years now. 

Here is my plan going forward: 

1.	Pay off the debts as quickly as possible, starting with the highest interest rate (I worked extra over the holidays &amp; have enough this month to knock out the smaller of the two home repair loans – so that debt’s monthly charge will go towards the next debt now as well). 
2.	Throw $3-500 into a 1.4% APY Discover online savings account as an emergency fund &amp; continue to build this every month. 
3.	Close out my plain checking account to an Alliant High Yield Checking Account
4.	Transfer the balance on my credit card to a $0 balance transfer, 18 month 0% interest online Discover credit card. 
5.	Once I have my debts gone, my emergency fund saved (~5K) and a $1000 buffer in my main checking account, I plan to look into investments. (eventual goal is FIRE)

I am closing my main checking account since I can’t meet the requirements for keeping it without charge &amp; it’s doing me no good, but should I keep the credit card I’ve had for so many years? Will closing it and opening all these accounts together ding my credit? I’ve got a 700+ credit score as of right now. 

If you’ve read through all that, thank you! 

Please let me know anything I’m not considering or if there is a more lucrative/better way to go about this. Even just beginning to learn the ins and outs of finances, I shudder thinking about all the horrible decisions I’ve made with money in the past, however I’m doing a lot of self-study, learning all I can here and on the MMM &amp; ERE blogs as well.

personalfinance,Student Loan Financial Planning?,"27YO in US. Sorry it's long. I'm just explaining how I've been doing my loans so you've got the full story. 

I have around $280k in total student loan debt from 7 years of schooling. I've got a great job and make good money for the most part. I can afford my loan payments, my rent/living expenses, money to go to savings/investments/retirement most months. My wife and I took a recent family vacation which set us back a little bit for my planning, but otherwise, we normally have enough to put aside every month towards building up the emergency fund. 

My question though is this: 

With the amount of loans I have, there are probably 10 separate loans, some that started as small as $2k and some as big as $50k. Some have interest rates from 4-5.9%, but some are higher around 6-7%. 

I'm on a 10 year graduated payment plan. My payments right now are minimum of around $1800 a month. I've been putting around $2100 a month in so that I can pay some back a little quicker. I'd like to get my loans finished in under 10 years so I can start putting more towards my wife's loans (she's got the same profession and same loan totals). 

When it comes to the loans, how should I go about paying these off? Should I pay down the high interest/lower principle loans? Should I just focus on the high balance loans one at a time and let the lower balance/higher interest loans continue to accrue? 

My dad and I have discussed this and he was suggesting paying the oldest, highest interest balance loans first. So we did that for the last 6 months and paid back a $2000 loan that was around 7%. I think the total loan when all was said and done was around $3k. 

I received a $9k bonus at the end of the year. I gave my wife $2k to pay for some vacation expenses, I put some towards my expenses from the vacation, put some into my Roth IRA, and then some into my savings. Then I put about $1200 into my loans to take another one of the $3,000 balance loans with about 7% interest and take it down to $1900. 

Is this a smart move? I believe it's referred to as the snowball method of paying back the smaller loans and gaining momentum towards the larger loans. 

My plan (which isn't a solid plan, but more of an idea), was to pay off a lot of the smaller, higher interest loans, then look into consolidating the bigger balance loans to a single smaller interest rate. 

I've already set myself up on auto debit every month with the loans to pay off the minimum required, then I go in and add more money to specific loans. Reason for auto debit is that it reduced my interest rates by 0.25% on all the loans. 

Sorry, again, I know it's long and a lot of information. Once I've got a general idea of what I want to do, I do intend on sitting down with a financial planner to discuss where to go next.",finance

First, a quote from the [/r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gfkjq/rbitcoin_faq_newcomers_please_read/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)
&gt; Decentralized - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down... 

For people who are cautious of centralized institutions (the majority of cryptocurrency investors and innovators), events like the US failing to fund itself is just another reason to remain cautious or even skeptical. The soon-to-be BTC users need reasons to come to the conclusion that decentralized assets are the way to go, a central govt shutdown is one that could be pointed to as a significantly negative aspect of centralized institutions in general. Now that Bitcoin news is becoming more mainstream, the cons of centralized systems will be increasingly criticized since there is actually an emerging alternative. 

Even people who invest in crypto just for profit are more likely to see the US gov shutdown as inherently bullish because of this contrast of centralized and decentralized money suppliers, as well as the core principal of Bitcoin and other blockchain assets.

Bitcoin is the face of decentralization, which is the big reason why I believe the shutdown positively effects it, the effect on the economy is less relevant to me. The fact that it is a major example of problems with centralized institutions, and that the recent adoption of decentralized assets poses potential solutions, is why the shutdown is relevant to Bitcoin. 

The big picture, the social/technological changes and movements, is what explains possible correlation in these kinds of events. We'll have to wait and see If I'm right or wrong though. *What are your thoughts?*

Bankera is building a digital bank to last for the blockchain era. As a traditional bank, Bankera's services fit into three groups:

Payments including payment accounts with personal IBAN, debit cards, interbank foreign exchange rates and payment processing. All services will support both traditional fiat currencies as well as cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, DASH, NEM, ERC20 compliant tokens and others. In the long term, Bankera will implement innovative solutions such as gross-domestic-product (GDP) linked currencies and the use of exchange traded funds as a substitute for money.

Loans and deposits will be a key competitive edge as well as core service of Bankera. Current deposits will receive interest just as savings do. All Bankera clients will be able to benefit from higher interest rates due to proprietary information about borrowers' cash flow, as most loans will be given to business clients who use the payment processing solution.

Investments will consist of low-cost investment products such as exchange traded funds (ETFs), crypto-funds (a portfolio of various cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens) as well as roboadvisory solutions for wealth management. Eventually, Bankera will offer investment banking services including financing corporate strategies of our business clients.

Each holder of Banker (BNK) tokens will be entitled to a referral commission, paid weekly; this will be constituted of 20% of Bankera and SpectroCoin net transaction revenue. This will be implemented by taking 20% of Bankera's and SpectroCoin's net revenues and sending them to the smart contract. For example, if net revenues of Bankera for a week are 10,000,000 EUR, 2,000,000 EUR as referral commission will be sent to the smart contract.",cryptocurrency

We're making minimum payments. Earnest loans will be payed off in about five years, assuming we don't fall behind on payments. It's probably worth mentioning that we've somehow paid on time for the last 7 years. Earnest loans were refinanced about two years ago. The reason my loans are less is that I dropped out before getting a degree.

* Emergency: $10000
* Current 401k: $7400

**Monthly Income**

* Take-home: $9150

Income is between the two of us. She is on contract, I'm salary but feel as if I get paid more than I'm worth and don't know how long this is going to last. At least another year I think.

**Monthly Expenses: $7293**

* Internet: $80
* Phone: $90
* Software subscriptions: $60
* Groceries: $500
* Restaurants: $250
* Commute: $110

These expenses are for both of us. We live in Seattle so cost of living is high (that rent is for a studio apartment.) We're slowly working on lowering the grocery bills. We haven't been going out with friends, traveling, or visiting family. We don't buy clothes or furniture, and basically just avoid any optional expenses. I've accepted that it's not realistic to do these things with our amount of debt, and might never be since we're almost 30. We stay home and play video games to save money.

Now that we have a decent emergency stash, we need to do something with the ~$2000 monthly surplus. My plan is to pay down the highest interest loans first, aka avalanche. Is that a decent strategy? Is there anything else we can do to pay it down more effectively?

personalfinance,Some wisdom needed. 55 y/o thinking of taking some to cash. Not a market timer but jeez!!!,"First a little background
55 years old
Spouse 46 years old 

So right there I have to take into account the different timelines for myself and my spouse.

I’m talking about 401k funds in  our largest 401k. 
My spouse has a smaller one, we have other assets, House, college funds, taxable savings. This 401k however is about 1/2 of our NW and 80% (not including home) of our long term savings. With Fidelity.

So our combined timeline is somewhere in the 10/15 year range but me being 55 I’m simply more nervous.


Reasons 
- TMC/GDP ratio in nosebleed territory 
- Same for Shiller PE - very high
- Flattening yield curve
- Fed shrinking its balance sheet (could an economy hooked on the heroine of low capital cost start going into withdrawal)
- No shortage of potential geopolitical turmoil, though I suppose that always the case.
- Unstable US political situation

Another important note. I have not been a market timer. I’ve been DCAing into the market for the past 20-30 years. Realize my time horizon isn’t at 2 years but getting to the point that a single large correction or protracted bear market would have a huge impact.

Targets would be cash or close 
- Fidelity Money Market FRGXX
- Fidelity Stable Value Fund
... are some options 

Still deciding if I’ll gradually take 10% off the table, maybe every quarter or just start at 25%.

So just wanted peoples thoughts given my situation.

On a side note. And I hope this isn’t a amateurish question but the flattening yield curve seems to run counter to the news that the fed will be shrinking its balance sheet. Doesn’t the latter signal the end of a period of low interest rates. I think there is something I am not getting here.


Any and all advice welcome.
Thanks!

personalfinance,Question on which is my biggest snowball,"I listen to Dave Ramsay, and I should just call the show I guess, haha! I am debt free except for my truck and my house (no CC, no student loans). Truck is about 760/mo at 4.5%, house is 1620/mo 3.99% I'm at about 18% equity in the house, and I'm getting about 10k back in taxes.

I'm wondering which would be smarter: put the 10 in my house, which will push me over the point of PMI. My loan is structured so that I can have the PMI removed at 20% without a refinance, so I'll be saving about 65 dollars a month that way, which I can then put against my truck.

On the other have, Bank of America will refinance my truck to a 2.9% interest rate supposedly. If I refinance and give them the 10k, my monthly payment will drop to like 600ish, but I will not be able to pay down my PMI for a while, and putting cash into a depreciating item doesn't seem ultra smart.

I should add - if my payment drops I'll continue paying my previous amount or more, meaning more into principal, loan paid faster.",finance

As the republican tax plan is in full effect and people and businesses are provided increases in income,this should further compound the problem. The fed may have no choice but to more aggressively administer rate hikes, to prevent the economy from overheating.

personalfinance,Fellow Spreadsheeters: Check my math? (Formula for Federal withholding),"I wanted to make a cell that calculates Federal withholding after inserting a few values based on the [IRS Notice 1036](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/n1036.pdf). It seems to be working for my situation, so I thought I'd share it here to make sure it works for anyone who doesn't already have a cell like this. I'm using it to calculate my paycheck impact from adjusting allowances.

I keep Row 1 and Column A for headers/titles.

* B2 = Gross Wages
* B3 = Traditional 401(k) contribution
* B4 = Other pre-tax deductions
* B5=(B2-(B3+B4) Gross Wages after pre-tax. Post-tax deductions I place further down on the sheet than the Federal withholding.
* B6 = # of allowances claimed

Results in:

    =79.4+(((B5-(B6*172.9))-1275)*0.12)

For my situation, the sheet assumes 3 things: Married, Semimonthly pay period, and wages between $1,275-3,706. I left those numbers static rather than referencing cells because those figures are less likely to change with regularity. But you could swap them out with cell references for even more modularity, like

    =B7+(((B5-(B6*B8))-B9)*B10)

Currently I am about a year and a half from finishing my stats degree, but financial situations at home and school had caused me to put things on hold and get jobs to help supplement things until I start again.

Currently, I have 6500$ in student loans and just managed to breach enough money to pay it off in one payment. I know that these loans are attached to my credit score in which I could boost my score if I don't pay it off and do some payments first before paying it all off, however, I do not want to deal with the crazy interest rates on the loans and would rather just get it squared away. How would you all recommend going about this? I want to preface your answers by saying I have some credit built up with a couple cards, but last I checked my score was Fair (650?).

In addition to this, I am looking to rent an apartment in the coming months and in San Diego, the rent prices are about 2 weeks worth of pay. If I were to pay off my loans now, I would have enough in my main funds to pay for a month's rent. But that would still give me a good 2-3 months to re-accrue that lost savings. Current expenses are minimal being 22, but I am willing to get more into budgeting and prepping for the upcoming fiscal responsibilities that come with renting and fending for oneself.

Initially I am not sure how to go about this since one hand I do not want debt, but on the other I can build credit for my future and thus I would like some advice on how to go about this situation.

Many thanks.

personalfinance,Defaulted on private student loan. What now?,"Preface: I know that the fuckup was mine.  Not looking for what I should have done. Looking for how to fix this mess.

When I was fresh off the turnip truck at age 18, I took out some private student loans.  I didn't qualify for grants because my parents owned farmland that they inherited but rented out and they ""made too much money"" and had too many assets. My parents were also not creditworthy enough to co-sign and I was all on my own for school.

Long story short, I got out of school, got overwhelmed when it came time to deal with the student loans (I had multiple lenders and navigating that world was confusing as hell to me. 
It felt like playing whack a mole... Once I had one dealt with, suddenly something went wrong with another, was not good with finance to begin with, depression from being in the wrong career, and defaulted on one of my private loans through Iowa student loan/aspire.  I know I fucked up.  That is no question.

I am now 30, making more money, depression is under control, all credit card debt is paid, car was bought outright and am rebuilding my credit in hopes of buying a house with my husband.  No This is when I discovered that I had this loan I had never dealt with.  I feel stupid enough about it and don't need that woulda coulda shoulda lecture.

Most of my loans are now in good standing.  My federal loans are consolidated and my private loans are being paid slowly but surely.  Navient let me rehabilitate the loans I had with them.

...but aspire is not.  Basically, they said that all they can do is have me sign a letter in which they agree to stop my loan from accruing interest and in turn, if I ever make a late payment they can immediately take legal action against me.  The worst part is though, it will not be taken off my credit until it is paid in full...  Which at $40,000 will take a bit.

Most lenders will not consolidate or refinance defaulted debt (even though I am making payments, it is still in default status) and I can't get a loan to pay it because I have a default.

I feel like there is no way out.  I want to pay and be in good standing, but there seems to be nothing but obstacles.  My credit score is bad, but getting better. I have raised it about 70 pts over the last 5 months.  But I feel like this default is what is really holding it back.

- I had a psychiatric episode in 2016 and moved in with my aunt. I remember almost nothing about my life in 2016-17. I have some memories of the years before that. I have to look at old records for a lot.

- Now I frequently fall out of touch with reality. I see/hear things that aren't there. Sometimes I can read/speak fine seem normal. Other times I cannot process anything very well. Not sure what my diagnosis is yet, my symptoms do not fit a specific box well.

- My healthcare plan does partly pay for one of my meds. I have 3 meds though. It doesn't cover my visits with my counselor or psychiatrist, they are sliding scale. My previous counselor charged the full cost, that is why I have the medical debt.  

- Recently my counselor and psychiatrist have both said they don't think I can work full-time. They aren't sure if I can work part-time yet either.

So I cannot pay anything on my loan right now. I will probably have to deal with these symptoms for the rest of my life. And now I am scared my aunt will end up responsible for my student loan debt somehow. She was the cosigner. I'm not sure what the full rules are about that.

You can visit before, during and after production.  The actual barrels will bear your name.  The mash bill is 51% corn, 45% wheat and 4% malted barley.  We already grew the grain, so we're not able to change the mash bill without a 30% upcharge.  

The barrel price includes three years of storage and insurance.  You can transfer your barrels to any other bonded facility as soon as they're made or anytime you like(there is a small delay for regulatory paperwork).  We recommend you sit on them for at least two years because they tend to go up in value about 20% per year, sometimes more, sometimes a lot more.

If you have us hold it for you, you'll have some decisions to make when it matures.  If you want to start a brand, we can help. We can also bottle the finished whiskey for you, and ship it to your local store (subject to your state's laws and state and federal taxes and packaging costs), or we can help you dispose of it on the open market.

Subject to price variations, we will sell a 7 barrel lot (371 gallons at time of barreling including barrels) for 1 Bitcoin.

I invite you to learn more about us, our fine whiskey and our solar powered production facility.

personalfinance,Need some advice on paying off old collections accounts.,"I make around $1,800 /mo after taxes. I've cut my total spending (Rent, food, bills, insurance, car payment, etc) to $1,200 per month. I have a lot of old debt that I'm finally trying to tackle, I've read the FAQ's and could still use some help with my game plan.

**I pulled a credit report today and found:**

*7 accounts in collections from a hospital visit, totaling $1,250 from 2013-2016. Most are around $100, two are $300.

*Two charged off credit cards, for $2,500 and $775.

*A private student loan, I pay the minimum $40 each month on $1,100

*Federal student loans I pay nothing on (IBR) totaling $45,000

With a little wiggle room in my budget, I have around $500 each month to save or pay off debt.


**Here's my game plan:**

1. Call each debt collector and request a verification of the debt to be mailed to me. (Should I also dispute each account with each credit reporting bureau?)

2. Send pay for delete letters to each account that validates the debt.

3. If they agree, I pay them and the debt is removed from my report. If they don't agree, I pay them the full amount and the debt stays on my report, but is marked as paid (Is this correct? Is there a better way to handle this?)

4. Save the $500 for a few months, then call my credit card companies. Offer to settle for a portion of the total (They offered 50% discounts as it was charged off, is it typical to do this with charged off accounts?)

5. If they refuse and want the full amount, set up a payment plan.

6. Continue to pay as much as possible until all that remains is student loans.


**TL;DR:** I have about $4,500 in debt to pay off this year, is there anything else I can add to my plan to improve my credit score or reduce the amount paid?",finance
personalfinance,Buying a new car for the first time,"Hi guys, this may not be the appropriate subreddit, sorry in advance. 
I’m a college student looking to buy my first car probably used but possibly new from a dealership. I’ve been doing a lot of research but I have a couple questions. 
When buying a new car, can I put my current car down as my “down payment”?
What affects the interest rate? Is it predetermined by dealership or does your credit score have an impact?
Also, is it wiser to get a loan through your own bank (I use a credit union) or to get a loan through the dealership?
I realize these are probably dumb questions but I would greatly appreciate any feedback!",finance

I'm looking for some general advice re: our current financial situation and associated budget.  

&amp;nbsp;

This is the first time that I've felt comfortable financially, and as though we can take action towards debt reduction / savings / investment rather than just maintaining our current financial position. The savings has started to climb since my wife finished her degree, and now that we am feeling comfortable with my monthly operational budget, we're looking for some advice as to how to proceed.

I've attached our current, working budget as well as a breakdown of our debt. We would like to buy a house in the next couple years. Ideally, I'd like to try to figure out what to target financially - more savings, knock down the debt, retirement, save for a down payment on a house, etc. I feel as though targeting higher graduated loans is the best course of action, as they will jump in monthly cost in the next 2-4 years.

The primary goal is to secure a second income and start directing that cash flow appropriately.

Bitcoin,Libertarian Paradise,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.

History has shown that Wall Street money is bullshit so inevitably we get crashes to ‘press the reset button’. Print more money. Forget the debt, sorrow and repos. Easy. 

Bitcoin changed all that by removing the power to ‘print more money’ (at will) by restricting the flow of the asset and made the Ledger public for all to see. Great.

So Bitcoin is the new gold. Shit coins are the Wall Street. USDT is the new lever to co trip it all.

If non-transparent USDT can print money why are we any better?

If shitcoins are not regulated how will people know what’s real and what’s bullshit sales talk?

So here’s where I need your help....

1. How do we protect OUR new fairer financial system against governments and their USDT bubble makers.

2. How do we stop or protect against ICO and shitcoin scams while supporting genuinely useful coins.

3. Do we have the collective power and integrity to maintain freedom or will capitalism and the ages always eventually control everything?

My current job is a service industry job (nuisance wildlife issues) that is structured in a way that I only get paid on the commission earned from jobs I've sold and collected money from. The company will pay me no less than 2.5k/month, but if I fail to sell enough to cover that, I am on the hook to make up for that in the following months. That being said, I typically can make a fair amount more than this, with the average being 3.75k/month, but at my baseline salary, I have enough to pay the bills and that's about it (forget about food, gas, etc for non-rigid expenses) and hence in tough months I've had to put grocery bills on my credit card. The problem I am running into is that because my income can fluctuate so much, I find it incredibly difficult to adhere to any solid budgeting plan. It seems as though any progress I make can be wiped out by a bad couple months and I have very little control over generating business. 

I am planning to go back to school for a masters degree so I can get out of this field (current goal is to matriculate fall 2019). I would be going back to school full time, perhaps with a small amount of income being earned as a TA. This means I would be taking out more loans. I am  (albeit begrudgingly) okay with this as I've done extensive research into the field I am entering, and both median salary and predicted job growth can justify this investment. 

To prepare, I am trying to attack my current debt. I have federal student loans, which are not my priority. Current CC debt is $6900 and I have one small private student loan that has $3100 remaining on it. I have a strategy and want to make an aggressive attack on these to eliminate what I've just realized neatly adds up to $10k in debt, but it becomes extremely difficult when my income can fluctuate by roughly $1000 or more from one month to the next. My credit card debt is mostly from college and being a naive young adult, but as previously mentioned, I have had to put some living expenses on my credit card in tough months

TL;DR: I have a job that pays on commission and thus I don't have a consistent income to budget off of, and I want to pay off CC debt in 20 months before reentering grad school. Any help would be significantly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,I have some extra scholarship funds and I need advice on where to put the money.,"Okay so I have some extra scholarship money from graduate school. I'm talking about 10k per semester.

I'm terrible with finances but it is one of my goals this year to be better with them and learn to put my money where it belongs.

So two things I have in mind, I have about 45k in student loan debt from my undergrad. Majority of it is federal loan, while I have one private loan that is about 9k at the moment. 

My other thing is getting a car. I currently have a car but it is a total piece of junk and needs a lot of repairs which will end up costing me more than its worth. I could get it repaired to last me another year but I want to put a decent amount of money on a newer car that will last me another 5-10 years, have it completely paid off. That way I don't have to worry about if I can get to school or work.

I live in a suburban area, working full time and my school is about a 30 minute drive away. So ideally I'd want a reliable vehicle, especially coming out of grad school while I'm looking for a job.

My credit is pretty poor mostly for not being able to keep up with my student loan payments. (The long/short of it is that I have a BFA and now I'm going for a MS in software engineering with better job prospects since I can't find any and I'm tired of being dirt poor) so coming out of grad school I don't know that I'd have a decent vehicle to help me get around and since I have the finances right now to get one, it might be a good option. 

At least that is how I'm justifying it in my head.

personalfinance,Grim realization of 22k+ in CC debt,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for some help on the best way to knock out the insane amount of debt I have recklessly racked up. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7rihei/i_feel_like_my_20k_debt_wont_ever_end/) from a few days ago has been a massive help to me. There are a lot of great suggestions that I've taken upon myself to do the research on. Here are a few things I'm looking at and could use some guidance:

**Situation:**

* Have $22k of cc debt on one card. 

* Have $2.5k of cc debt on a 0% balance transfer card to be paid off in 8/2018 - paying $350/mo

* Wife has $10k on one cc card, mostly from her recently buying and starting a new business.

* $12k in student loans ending in 2021 and paying $300/mo

* Personal 0% interest loan from my parents and paying $400/mo

* FICO around 720.

* Debt to income ~ 50% or so

* My income = $65k - taxes/stuff = $3400/mo take home.

* Mortgage/bills = ~$1100/mo


**Options:**

Personal Loan - Applied for $26k
    
a - Went to Sofi and got declined. Turns out Sofi approved me for a 9.99% loan, but they were forced to decline me because the State of IL has a statewide restriction of those loans at nothing can be above 8.99%. Weird. I've never heard of that, but Sofi said it was because they aren't actually a bank bank, they just lend money out from their investors? Damn, I fee like this would've been a solid option.
    
b - Approved for a loan with Discover card @ 18.99% for 60mo. My cc is at 19.99% right now. This seems like it wouldn't help much...
    
c - Approved for an Upstart personal loan @ 16.31% APR (13.90% + org fee) = $603/mo for 60mo
    
d - Unsure on calling banks or credit unions for a personal loan. I bank with a regular local bank and have a $3k unsec loan with them that I'm paying off. I feel like a bank would instantly deny my app. If you walk into a new bank or credit union you don't have a relationship with, do they immediately lower your chances? The way I look at it they just want to make free money off of you paying interest, but there's probably some sort of risk involved.
    
e - I thought these types of loans would've been a lower interest rate, like around 7 or 8% according to that previous post I was reading. So far not the case. Probably because of my high debt to income and lowish credit score?

Balance Transfer

a - I've dug in on this before. I did a total of 2 transfers and I'm finishing up the last, noted above. I did the Chase and Citi transfer deals. Can I do those again? Or were they one-time special offers to opening the card? Should I? I'm not sure I could afford a payment to those based on the 12mo and 18mo 0% payback time windows with the other debt obligations I'm in. For example, the Citi and Chase have about a $6k limit.

personalfinance,Help Deciding 457 Investment Allocation,"My 457 offers a fixed fund at 3.5%. That's where my entire election goes as it was set up a decade ago and forgotten about.

personalfinance,"I have a friend who has asked me for a $1500 loan. I plan to loan it to him, any recommendations on interest rate &amp; contracts, or other tips?","Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this question, I know it isn't typical here but I wasn't sure where else to do it besides maybe /r/AskReddit.

I'm not particularly happy about the loan---who would be---but long story short this friend found a job that sounds decent and he'll be making a nice salary so indications are that he should be able to pay me back. He has been unemployed for some time and needs some money now to pay rent for him and his 8mos pregnant girlfriend, his half-baked plan of making money with cryptos backfired rather severely.

So, anyhow, I am a good friend, I could afford to lose $1,500 today and I plan on loaning it to him, but I would like to do everything in my power to make sure I get it back at some point.

* Should I outline the terms of a payment plan/schedule, or just leave it up in the air? 
* What's a good ""Helping a friend"" interest rate? Based on my searches it looks like maybe 1.5% though I would have guessed higher.

personalfinance,Here is how to calculate your new take home paycheck based on IRS Notice 1036,"IRS just published Notice [1036.](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/n1036.pdf) It explains how your paychecks will be processed going forward.

Here is how anyone can calculate what their new paycheck will be. 

You need your most recent paystub, and you need to know what your W4 says in terms of allowances. Also, this assumes your gross pay is same paycheck to paycheck. 

* Look at your last paycheck and write down ""FIT Taxable wages"". This is the part that is being taxed.

* Look at page one of IRS notice. Bottom left, if you are paid byweekly and have 2 exemptions on W4, then you do $159.60x2. 

* Subtract this number from ""Fit Taxable Wages"". Use this new number on tables on page 2 to determine how much will be withheld from your check.

* Look at your paystub again and look for federal taxes withheld. Difference between this number and the number you just previously looked up is how higher your paycheck will be. 

Note that this is withholding guidelines only, and your tax liability at the end of the year will still be influenced by number of factors. This is just a simple way to determine change in your paycheck come February payroll.

personalfinance,Should I get my car (in my mom's name only) refinanced under my name?,"Details:
I had a Camry that my parents paid for until I got to college. In my mom's name only. I picked up on payments (just sent mom the money) and it was close to being paid off when I got rear-ended January 2017. Totaled.

So time to find a new (used) car. I'm a temp and still in college with a decent credit score, but less than a year of credit history. Long story short, we find a used 2016 Mazda and get it financed in her name only, as the interest rates were pretty low (I don't remember exactly) compared to my name being on it and the payments were where I wanted them at the time ($400).

Fast forward to now, I've been making the payments (in my mom's name only), have a good credit score of ~730, and still owe quite a bit on the car. Owe $23k and the kbb value shows about $16k for trade-in. I work full time now in government (great job security/benefits). I have budgeted my money into: 10% into ""fun"" account, 40% into necessities (house, bills, car, gas, groceries), 50% into savings.

Now for my question.. I got this car because of the situation I was in at the time basically. In hindsight, I should have gotten something different. Maybe cheaper/older, whatever. Maybe should have taken the higher interest rate to have my name on it. But I know I don't want to keep this car long term. I know it's frowned upon, but I want something nicer that I actually *want* to keep long term. So with the future in mind, what should I do? Do I need to get this car in my name somehow so my credit looks better for future car purchase? I have ~730 score, but it's just credit card payments and bills basically. About 1.5 yrs of credit history, very low utilization, paid off each month, etc. Should I pay my car down until I'm not upside down? Should I make higher payments to pay it down quickly? All my living expenses/recreational expenses leave me with ~$1800 going into savings so I could definitely afford to pay the car quicker. Just not sure my best route from here.",finance

investing,White Houses Release Infrastructure Plan Today: Expands Private Activity Bonds and Removes Caps,"https://www.axios.com/draft-white-house-infrastructure-plan-1516644555-0d43f417-6ccd-43f7-9eae-3ccbe711314d.html

Private activity bonds (PAB's) allow for private utilities and other companies to essentially piggy back off of a State's bonding authority to issue tax-exempt bonds.  For example, without a private activity bond, $AWK would have to issue corporate debt at relatively higher interest rates to invest in water pipe infrastructure.  A publicly owned system gets to issue debt at a lower interest rate that's usually backed by the public issuing entity or the revenue (in the case of revenue bonds) generate by the system.

States cap the volume of private activity bonds per Federal government requirements.  There's been bi-partisan support, usually involving New Jersey politicians (where American Water is headquartered), to *expand* private activity bond volume caps.  The White House plan seeks to *eliminate* them.  This is very good news for private utility companies and other privately held infrastructure entities.

Here's part of the conclusion of a [report](http://www.awwa.org/portals/0/files/legreg/documents/pabreport.pdf) released by the American Water Works Association (AWWA):

&gt;  First, removing the PAB volume cap for water and sewer projects would eliminate a significant restriction on the use of tax exempt private activity bonds for these projects. The removal of water projects from the volume cap would be expected to enlarge the pool of capital available for investment in the water and wastewater arena.

personalfinance,Just looking for some advice (US and UK),"Hi all,

Without getting into too many details I have a fair amount of debt. I have a a few thousand in credit card and an astronomical number in federal student loans from the US. 

Recently, I have come into some money. Not enough to make a scratch in my US student loans, but more than enough to wipe out my credit card debt. 

To give a bit more detail about my situation, I am an associate professor (US term, UK I am an lecturer) with a fairly nice salary though more than 50% goes to mandatory spending (this includes professional membership dues - that I have to pay for and can only claim like 22% back on taxes; and even then the process often isn't worth that 22%- rent, bills, and food). In fact, I spend very little of my monthly salary on discretionary items - and often find myself still having a tight belt month. (I just cut my discretionary spending by quitting smoking... so yay me). However, due to this (and several emergencies) I have very little in savings (not even a month's salary). 

So needless to say I am not in a good spot. 

My plan is to use the money I am receiving to clear out my credit card (US) debt, to put about between 7k and 10k (GBP) in my bluebooks saving (for my emergency fund, and this would represent 3-5 months of work after taxes). The remaining sum (which would be between 10k and 7k (GBP)) I am not sure what to do with. Clearly, I know I to invest it. But I do not know what makes the most sense. 

* 1) The money is coming in from the US, should I leave it in USD and invest from my US account? If I do how will this effect my student loans?  I am not too worried about my student loans, this is something I've planned for.  (Despite having a PhD, I am still a student, so my loan repayments are being deferred - I am paying off the interest monthly - but I plan on using income based repayment plans to mitigate the amount of impact my debt will have).
* 2) I've read though this site, and honestly, I feel a bit out of sorts in terms of knowing where to really start. All my previous research (and reading here) told me to start with actively managed funds or mutual funds (I think these are the same thing, I just included the 'or' in case I was wrong). However, my sibling (and some stuff here) suggest investing in a market index. Given my financial situation, what would you guys advise? 
* 3) If I'm already paying into a retirement fund (UK), should I worry about investing further into my retirement? (This is UK based because I know very very little about retirement in the UK; this is an employer sponsored scheme and I believe it is a matched-scheme, but I will double check with HR tomorrow just to make sure as I may be wrong, and it may be  of the ones where they contribute even if I do not - which is what I am double checking).
* 4) My mandatory spending is going to increase for the next 12 months (this will be between £100 and £200 a month) and then will go back down. What should I do to prepare for that incoming extra cost?
* 5) What do I need to be aware of regarding taxes with windfall money in this situation? (I live in the UK, I am a US citizen, the money is coming from the US). 

And if I missed any details you need, please let me know. The topic of finances (and especially having savings to my name) is very new to me. The issue may also be, while I've done the reading here and elsewhere, and have asked family, because I have not done with the information I may be 'overthinking' some really simple things.",finance

btc,PSA: Capping the blocksize at a level below transactional demand is a form of central planning.

The miners should be free to choose the blocksize they want, as they are most incentivized to keep the network functioning. Block space is a scarce resource, and like any other scarce resource, market forces are far better at deciding the clearing rate than any central planner could be. An artificial and arbitrary blocksize cap disrupts the free market forces, and destroys the economics behind Bitcoin.

personalfinance,My mom’s car was repossessed (options?),"So she has poor credit and is currently paying (probably) around 25% interest rate on a 2017 car. Her plan was to pay that until she builds her credit back up then refinance. I’m aware that was a poor investment which is besides the point. She’s racked up 35K miles and was two months behind on her payment and contacted the lender to make a payment arrangement for this upcoming Friday of the past due amount. They asked her to provide her routing number but she was driving so she asked if she could just pay it online with her card and they said she could and to just provide the confirmation number. So two days later they file for repossession and today her car wasn’t in the driveway. She called them because the payment wasn’t arranged to be paid until Friday, and they told her she was supposed to call back with her routing number, and because she didn’t they filed for it to be repossessed. She spoke with a manager who was a complete ass and basically said that the notes reflected she was supposed to call back with a routing number and that it was their word against my moms.

Now to get her car back they are requiring her to pay the entire past due amount and repo fees which comes out to around $2900.

I have a few questions, the first being if they are allowed to do this or if they are in the wrong. My mom is very poor with money management but she’s also a very smart person. She makes 6 figures and had the caller told her she was required to call back with her routing number she would’ve done so. It wouldn’t have costed anything as the payment still would be made in Friday. Despite this they are not letting up. 

I’m curious what her options are, and if she should pay it to get the car back or cut her losses and let them auction it off. She still owes $26000 on it and the blue book is only 17000 and she would still be responsible for the difference which will most likely be more than that considering it’s an auction.

My first idea was that she pay it off and I refinance under my name so that the interest rate is lower and more affordable. I’m aware of the possible consequences but if the payments are greatly reduced which they will be (she pays $600+ monthly on a stock base model Kia), she will have no problem paying it. She would direct deposit to my account the monthly payment as well as the difference it would cost for me to insure the car, AND the $80 I would save to refinance my own car. I’m willing to do this because she has helped me out in the past and I absolutely trust her. It will also build my credit. 

My second idea was to cut her losses and gave the car back, but then she would be left paying off the difference of a car she doesn’t have and would still need a car. My dad has a 07 Escalade with 180k miles (lifespan could be 250K) that was used as a limo and passed smog and has no issues. He owes her a lot of money due to not paying child support and I thought I could easily broker a deal between them to make it worth while for both of them. But that deal only sounded good had she not still had to pay the other car difference. 

What are her options? Was the lender wrong to repo and then refuse to take blame? Does she have any right or power to get her original agreed upon payment arrangement reinstated? If not what would the best route be moving forward?


Any help is greatly appreciated. 

I am well aware of her poor financial decisions and I want to help her to change and correct them as best she can. She’s putting my sibling and I through college (with help from my dad),raising my other sibling and paying a low house payment to my grandparents on a house they own, and has other bills and payments to be made. She is not good at budgeting which is something I’m going to need to help her with. But this is the most immediate issue that needs to be addressed and I want the bad decisions to stop here.",finance

personalfinance,Employer Underwithholding Supplemental Payments,"Hi All, 

Once a month, my employer sends a payment on my behalf to my student loan servicer and records this payment in my earnings and leave statement as supplemental wages (a monthly bonus, basically). While my employer separately records the correct taxes taken out for Medicare, SS, etc., the student loan repayments are withheld (for federal income) at 3% when they should be withheld at 25%. In order to make up the difference, I have to pay more in federal income taxes from my ordinary wages. In other words, it's like getting an additional paycheck (or two) without the taxes taken out, but that paycheck never reaches my bank account, so I have to pay the taxes out of pocket.

Because the student loan repayments are more than my minimum balance (and I only need to make the minimum payment because of Public Service Loan Forgiveness), I asked my employer's payroll department to adjust the 3% withholding to comply with existing regulations that require 25% (there's another method that comes out roughly to 25% as well). *See* [IRS Publication 15, Circular E] (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf) at Page 19. 

They refused. My employer said that their payroll system is working as intended, despite the obvious problems. For example, they sent me the Circular E to justify their approach, and when I pointed out that the Circular seems to suggest that their 3% approach is wrong, they told me that they trust the system's judgment. 

So now I'm stuck here wondering how in the world do I get my employer to withhold the correct amount? Or am I just wrong? I understand that I am responsible for the federal income taxes on the supplemental wages regardless of whether my employer withholds the correct amount, but is there anything I can do to pressure them into compliance?",finance

btc,"[Article] Debunking the theory that a ""deflationary"" currency cannot be the basis of a functioning economy","Many economists argue that a low level of inflation (approx 1-2%) is required in order to maintain a productive and functioning economy. This is evidenced in the fact that most central banks have low level inflation as a target of their monetary policy objectives: The European Central Bank, Bank of England, and the Federal Reserve to name a few [1]. 

As a result, detractors of bitcoin say that it can never become a currency as it is deflationary in nature [2]. That is, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence. This means that over time once all of these coins are in circulation, there will be no new supply of bitcoin, and so any demand increase will result in a price increase. Currently there is around 4.3% annual inflation of Bitcoin's supply [3], and by 2028 that is projected to fall to below 1% [4]. Furthermore, if the anonymous 'Satoshi' has truly vanished then there are another 1M coins out of circulation [5]; and some studies suggest the total number of lost bitcoin is nearing 3M coins [6], a number that can only increase over time. 

Due to these 'missing' bitcoins, the supply of Bitcoin will become increasingly scarce, and so their value is expected to rise given a constant or increasing level of demand. This means that goods and services will fall relative to their bitcoin valuation, resulting in deflation (deflation = the price level of goods &amp; services in an economy decreasing). The traditional argument then goes as follows: due to goods &amp; services becoming cheaper over time, saving is incentivized. After all, why would one buy a car for 1000 bits when it can be purchased for 998 bits tomorrow? A common example people point to as evidence for this is the infamous 10,000 BTC pizza purchase in 2010 which at today's valuation costs 100M USD [7]. 

*However, this argument against bitcoin as a currency is flawed on two levels.*

**(1)** When pointing to examples such as the pizza purchase, or the rapid increase in bitcoin's value, people are misattributing the cause of the deflation by assuming it is to do with bitcoins supply. In fact, in the years since the pizza purchase, the total supply of bitcoin has increased from 3 million BTC to 16 million BTC. This is a more inflationary supply increase than even the USD over the same period of time [8]. The real causes of bitcoin's price increase (and thus deflationary properties) in this period can be attributed to the parabolic nature of adoption that bitcoin has seen since its creation [9]. When looking at the practical nature of bitcoin as a world currency, and then drawing stats from the coin in its infancy, you are committing the fallacy of false equivalency [10] as the evidence presented is from a period of increasing adoption while a global currency would imply full or near full adoption. At the 'early adopters' stage we will see major +/- % fluctuations regularly, however if worldwide adoption was to be achieved then these value changes would be far smaller and much less significant. For example, the dollar, the world reserve currency, fluctuates on average by 92 pips in a day (1 pip = 0.0001 USD). Applying this same level of stability to a mass adopted bitcoin, and we see that the price fluctuations would become far smaller and less significant the greater the capitalization of the currency. Thus, in order to assess the viability of bitcoin as a world currency, one must start with a situation where bitcoin is a world currency in the first place. 

**(2)** The second flaw of this argument is to assume that deflation will always lead to a deflationary spiral and thus collapse of the economy. With this same logic, one could argue that inflation will always lead to an inflationary spiral and thus an economy collapse as people see price levels rising, and thus are incentivized to spend their money NOW before they increase any further. This then leads prices to rise further and the effect to spiral out of control. CLEARLY though we can see that inflation does not always lead to an inflationary spiral as all western economies operate on an inflationary model. And thus to try use this logic that is empirically flawed as an argument of deflation is self defeating: Levels of inflation will not always lead to inflationary spirals, and levels of deflation will not always lead to deflationary spirals. It is this excessive quantity of inflation or deflation that will result in a spiral, not the attributes of inflation or deflation in isolation. 

In the same way that 1-2% inflation per year is small enough to not trigger an inflationary spiral of panic, a small amount of deflation on a yearly basis would not trigger this deflationary spiral. In fact, we have evidence to support this claim. In the UK over the period of 1983-2006 we had interests rates that were higher than the rate of inflation [11], this would mean that consumers are incentivized to save instead of spend as they would have greater purchasing power in the future(i.e. there is deflationary pressure), yet we did not see an economic meltdown during these times. What we actually saw over this time period was a DECREASE in the savings ratio of the average UK household [12], from around 15% of income to just under 10% despite the fact that any money saved would have compounded 5% more inflation adjusted purchasing power per annum. At first this might seem to be irrational behavior but there are some speculative reasons as to why this was the case. One theory suggests that consumers do not notice inflationary or deflationary pressures in small quantities and thus do not make economic decisions based on them. Another one would say that despite the deflationary pressures, there are some purchases that are necessary and therefore cannot be delayed. i.e. the supermarket shop might be a small % cheaper in 1 years time, but it is necessary to do it now in order to survive. Finally, it can also be argued that as deflationary pressures make consumers feel wealthier, they are more inclined to go out and spend this wealth, thus decreasing their savings rate. 

The arguments presented above show that perhaps Keynesian economic thinking is too narrow, and that an economy can be run on the back of a currency with deflationary pressures as these pressures in the right quantity will not result in a deflationary spiral, and have the advantage of not eroding the wealth of the population in a way that benefits the wealthy and hinders the poor (see: threshold effects of inflation for more information on this matter). While this article has argued that a deflationary currency can run an economy, it is a topic of future article to discuss which model of the economy is preferable.

personalfinance,Advice on dealing with a CPA who made a mistake,"My 2015 returns were filed incorrectly. 

I was double-taxed on stock income from my company ESPP program. The W2 income already reflected (the majority of) the stock income, but the 1099 she submitted also said I had short-term capital gains of the same amount. Therefore, income was over-reported.

What ended up happening, was that I was told I owed roughly $3500 to state and $11,000 to Federal. I was also told that I should absolutely pay all of state immediately and anything I couldn't pay, set up a payment plan with the IRS. So that's what I did. 

I cut a check for all of state, paid *some* of Federal, and set up a payment plan for the rest. 

Just before the end of 2016, I took closer looks at my returns for that year, and did some digging. It was then I found out that she had most likely overreported my income. 

So I decided to go to a different CPA who was recommended by a friend, and wanted to see if he could confirm her mistake or if my findings were wrong, and she was actually correct.

He agreed that she made a mistake, and I asked him to prepare an amended return for me, which he did. He also prepared my 2016 returns. I eventually received my refund for 2016, and my money back for what I overpaid on 2015 taxes. 

I recently emailed the old CPA to explain what happened, and she looked into it. I originally suggested that what I felt was a fair reimbursement for everything I went through was refund for her incorrect return service, refund for what I paid to the new CPA for the amended return, as well as $110 on top of that, which included about $50 for the monthly payment setup fee, and the rest was interest/fees I owed for not paying the full balance immediately. These were not refunded to me by the IRS when all was said and done. If you want more details about how I arrived at that figure, let me know and I can provide. Short answer if I took the money I overpaid to State and applied it to what I owed to Federal if the tax return was **correct**, then I would never have set up a payment plan. 

So what she wrote back to me is that she eventually agreed that she made a mistake, but disagreed with the fee for the amended return because she said she would have done it for me for free. And she disagreed with the other fees/installment fee because she said ""I would have owed some money anyway"" and ""IRS would have refunded anything I overpaid"". 

Aside from that last part which I'll explain to her in my next email, do you think her answer is fair?

We went through a ton of stress with juggling money around on various credit card balances in order to deal with paying all this tax we were not expecting. I don't personally think my request is out of line. 

Do you think it's out of line to ask her to compensate the amended return from a different CPA?",finance
personalfinance,"The stars seem to have aligned, but it still feels like a shot in the dark: buying a house after divorce","I make 120k/year.  
  
  
I will shortly have a QDRO provided 401k distribution of 125k. If I don't take this out, I will pay an additional 10% when/if I do. Not sure it will gain that much in the next 1.5 years (which is when I need to either go back to renting a shitty apartment, or buy something) without further contributions to be worth losing that 10%.  
  
  
With the 2 combined that's 245k of income (that's just going to be for 2018, and I may get a raise this year as well at some point, but don't think that will affect my tax bracket, just my take home).  
  
  
Current federal tax payout on my paycheck looks to be about: 21k/year  
State tax payout looks to be about: 8k/year  
  
  
By every calculation I can find I will have to pay 33k (in total 53k) in federal tax, and 11k (in total 19k) in state tax, which leaves me with: 81k from the 401k.  
  
  
I have 10k in savings, plus I am saving 700/month until I buy a home which might be as soon as 8 months, so an additional 5.6K or more.  
  
  
In total I will have 96.6k (that is flat broke empty accounts after paying 2018 taxes).  
  
  
I am looking to buy a home that is around 525k, which for this area is a bargain for what the house is. I can't touch even a condo for that in my area. I am moving farther away, but it's fine, since I can and do remote work.  
  
  
That is just shy of 20% at %18, so I'll have to pay PMI most likely unless I can come up with another 10k somewhere (sell my paid off car, if I can even find a buyer)  
  
  
I gross 10k/month, I can math, and take home with current deductions is $6,256  
  
  
But here are my bills:  
$130/month insurance on 2 cars (yah I know, again might sell my other car)  
$50/month internet  
$111/month on cellphone  
$160/month for utilities (this is max it's ever been)  
$315/month on car payment (need this car for 3 kids)  
$600/month on child support  
$510/month on childcare currently may go to $1090/month (fuck me, little one is going to preschool, so all 3 of my kids will be in care)  
  
  
$700/month in savings ( may starting saving closer to 1280, just to cover my childcare going up, and see how much I can feel the financial pain )  
$2100/month in rent  
  
  
I am budgeting:  
$400/month on transportation (this includes $250 in train tickets, and whatever is left for gas, to train station, and 2-3 days a week of driving to/from where my kids live with their mom)  
$500/month on food/groceries/coffee  
  
  
So total payout is (at extreme childcare payout)... 6156, which leaves me with $100 exactly, LOL, so in other words this is doable.  
  
  
I got pre-approved for a loan of 420k already, I'll need one closer to 429k, if I can't save or find money elsewhere.  
  
  
I am projecting with taxes, insurance, and MI, I will be pretty close to $2800, which if you combine what I pay for rent and save, is that number. If the number is over that, I am screwed, and it might be in the end.  
  
  
I really want to have a few mortgage payments saved by that time, so I will see what the numbers look like when I actually try and get the loan.  
  
  
I'm sure everyone is going to tell me I'm insane, or maybe you'll tell me I am paying too much for x, and should clamp down more, and it is doable... at which point that's great, I'll fucking do it, for long term happiness, and financial stability.  
  
  
I have 3 young children, 7, 5, 3, and have them about 14 days out of the month, and I have to obviously feed them, so cutting food costs will only get my so far.  
  
  
The house also gives each of my kids a room, and me an office, and a garage (which if I buy a condo or a mobile home, I would not have or be able to afford any of that), the office isn't a necessity, it's more of the fact that the house has a loft that can be converted to a bedroom, and the bedroom downstairs is not suitable for my young kids to sleep in, as it's downstairs.  
  
  
3 other facts:  
- I cannot move out of the area (or further than I am planning), away from my kids, it's not an option  
- If I continue to rent, it will just continue going up and I may end up paying just as much in rent as I think I might have to for mortgage (this is easy in the area I live in, my rent is cheap in comparison to most)  
- If I don't invest I will have to pay additional 10% or foot the tax bill without any benefit (no interest or taxes to write off for next year, which may hurt even more)",finance

Is there anything that I can do to further help or is it just a matter of playing the waiting game?

personalfinance,Liquidating Investment to Pay-Off Debt?,"Need help making a financial decision; what am I not considering? Based on my research, a good rule of thumb is: if the debt's interest rate is less than the investment rate of return, I should probably not liquidate in order to pay off debt. However, I believe I have a unique scenario where I can reduce my opportunity cost and potentially replace what I'm liquidating.

My scenario: I have private company stock that I am pondering liquidating in order to pay-off personal debt. Typically would not do this, but consider the following:

*investment has averaged 15-20% return per year

*debt is at 6% and would likely take 8-9 years to pay off at current amortization. Do not expect any large windfalls to expedite the debt being paid ahead of schedule.

*through an ESOP, I can allocate my retirement savings (401k) toward purchasing additional company stock.

*will replace the monthly debt payments that will be paid off by allocating more toward my 401k. In fact, as a result I will be able to max out my 401k contributions and hit $18,500/yr with this change. 

*employer match is 8% on top of my contributions.

*assuming annual 3% cost of living raises, it is very likely I'll be able to recapture approximately half of the stock I would sell in this scenario over the next 4 years due to the increase in my 401k allocation, further reducing my opportunity cost. 

*Potentially all of the stock I would liquidate now could be ""recaptured"" after 9 years through my 401k; just depends on how fast the stock grows and at what price I can purchase over that time with my increased allocation.

*in this scenario i also assume my yearly taxable income would be reduced as more would be allocated toward my 401k (no state income tax), so I'd have immediate tax advantages.

*im also assuming a 15% long term cap gain tax on the initial liquidation due to my 2018 tax bracket.  Stock was purchased 3+ years ago.

I obviously would like to max out my 401k AND not liquidate the investment, but this is about behavior modification (thanks Dave!) and reducing the amount of debt all while minimizing the opportunity cost of liquidating the investment.

3. House price: $430k
4. Savings: $77K (should be $80k next month)
5. Both have great credit scores 770+

Situation: Currently found the home of our dreams and are looking to see what our options are for purchasing. We obviously don't have enough for 20% down, 2% earnest payment, and closing costs (~$12k) and want some advice on our best move moving forward. Currently have talked to some lenders and below are a few options:

1. Take out a 80/5/15 loan and have a higher interest rate on the 5% (I would prefer not to escrow real estate taxes so this seems like a good possibility. Lenders are all saying I need 20% down or I have to escrow the taxes) Interest rate on 80 is 4.13% and 4.4% on 5

2. Put down 15% and just escrow taxes and pay the PMI for a while. 

3. Work with the builder and see if they will credit me the closing costs up front but add them to the loan? (suggested by one of the lenders and I have not heard of this but this will allow us to put a higher down payment on the home ~18%).

We are also are open to any other ideas. The builder seems strict on price as he is selling other units but this one has sat on the market for 70 days so I told him I'm in no rush on closing. I still have not tried negotiating as I want to know my options first. 

Edit: 2 other options that were brought up by lender:

4. Work the house price down and put down 20% and have a premium loan where lender pays all closing costs.

5. Put down 20% and have builder cover closing costs up front but add into loan. (is this a thing? lender insists it is)",finance

personalfinance,"I negotiated salary for the first time ever, and I got what I wanted!","Last Tuesday, I did something irresponsible for the sake of my mental health and quit a job where I was miserable, without another job lined up. As the sole income provider this was a huge gamble, but I had an interview on Friday that I was feeling really confident about. 

I should pause here to note two things: 1) I'm a codependent, and avoid conflict like the plague. 2) I am this way because of my childhood, being raised by my narcissistic mother. My former boss was exactly like her, hence why I left. 

So, I killed the interview on Friday. Met the two attorneys I would be working for. They are amazing and offered me a job at the end, but said that they would need the senior partner's approval first, so to wait for his call. 

I got the call this morning. We went back and forth a little bit. My starting point was $X, he wanted to offer X-$7k. He noted that health insurance is 100% employer-contributed, and not only was I getting 2 more weeks of PTO than my last employer, but I would get PTO on my bday (this is actually an awesome perk because mine almost always falls around a federal holiday, which means the potential for a paid 4-day weekend).

I said meet me at X-5k, so he said he'd do X-7 but cut me a personal check each month for gas allowance. When I incorporated that in, I was almost sold. My husband told me to ask for an additional $50. What's the worst he can say, No?

Well, codependent me was terrified to ruffle the feathers. But I thought, although beggars can't be choosers, I'd potentially miss out on an extra $600 a year for the sake of not hurting someone's feelings. 

So I asked. And he actually said that he was taken aback, and felt like I was nickel and diming him! But you know what? I stuck with it. I said, ""Yes, well, I am very eager to start, so if you can meet me there, I can start tomorrow."" He said he had to get back to me.

And wouldn't you know, he did. I got that extra allowance. I stuck to my guns. I put conflict aside to make sure he knew right off the bat that I know what I am worth. And it felt amazing.

You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. And let me also just add that it feels really good knowing you're earning a salary you can support a family on, and that you made it happen by being assertive. It's just a huge weight off my shoulders, that I won't have to worry about whether I can pay all the bills on time.

CryptoCurrency,When will we get more reliable fiat crypto exchanges?,"If you look at the subreddits of any of the major crypto exchanges (kraken, coinbase/GDAX, bitfinex, bittrex, bitstamp, etc) you will find endless posts about missing withdrawals, deposits, and frozen accounts. There was a post about a $1MM account being frozen, and there are dozens of posts about 5 figure fiat deposits/withdrawals not showing up for weeks.

The common explanation is that their customer support department is understaffed, but that doesn't excuse accounts being frozen with absolutely no explanation or message to the client. Also, several of these exchanges have been around for 5+ years so they aren't new startups experiencing growing pains. People are submitting complaints to consumer protection agencies and threatening lawsuits.

I'm sure there are some people here who have a crypto portfolio in the 7+ figures, and I'm wondering, how do you guys cash out if exchanges are so unreliable? 

Anyways, I'd like to hear some thoughts from the community. When will this issue be resolved? Perhaps when cryptos become regulated and put in the NYSE? When your stock broker like fidelity, ameritrade or IB offer cryptos? 

(On a sidenote, there are multiple posts about banks discouraging customers buying cryptos, which is another pressing issue. All these logistical issues make it difficult for cryptocurrency to enter mainstream adoption).",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Questions about blockchain,"Hey guys, I'm new to blockchain and I have a few questions I was wondering if you could help me understand. 

1. Miners choose which transactions to include in their block. If one transaction get's included in two different blocks, would it be proofed twice along with all other transactions? E.g two miners compete to solve a new block, they contain different transactions but have both included transaction X. Will that transaction be proved twice or will one block be discarded? What happens with all the non-similar transactions that were proved?

2. If miners prioritize by fee then some transactions will never be done?

3.  Bitcoins will be lost and it is capped at 21mio. That means it’s in a deflationary state. Doesn’t that allow miners to NOT spend any money thus theoretically could end up with all bitcoins?
Which in turn means they get to regulate the market by controlling supply.

4. How many chains of blocks are there on the network? Just one universal one or several branches?

5. Since solving a block requires a hash from a previous block, what happens if someone adds a block to the chain before I solved mine, I’ll have to do it all over even though it might be completely different transactions in the block. If the hash from block #100 is an input in the block I’m solving now, and someone finds block #101. Then the one I am trying to solve with the hash from block #100 is not correct and I’ll have to stop to compute the new block with the hash from block #101. How would I even know in time if the information is not passed to me?

6. A block contains a hash of previous known block, a digital signature of a transaction, transaction amount, receivers public key, a random number, index (What is this), and inputs. The inputs are a reference to previous unspent outputs which is also checked? Anything else in the block?

7. How do miners confirm inputs? These inputs of unspent BTC are records in previous blocks so a miner would have to access the whole blockchain to find these transactions to prove that Alice indeed has enough BTC to transfer? 

8. If 7. is true, doesn't that create a scaling issue or do they only reference previous transactions just enough to cover the new transaction amount?

9. How is bitcoin price determined, people write supply and demand, but it's not like there's a place where people can bid USD for BTC. 

10. Maybe it's the same as question 9. If Etherum is not a currency, but a blockchain technology for smart contracts and a technology to build upon, how is it priced? Seems like there is no liquidity to Etherum. For Bitcoin at least you have places to spend it for tangible goods.

11. It seems like most of the work done in the network is lost, isn't it very wasteful?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Help with family second mortgage situation,"Hi everyone,

Just want to send my gratitude in advance for all the thoughts on my situation. Helping my parents pay off a bad loan.

Context: Parent own two homes (one as primary domicile and the other as an investment property). Primary home has around 110k in 4 years to pay off and secondary home has around 100k left. The issue is that the secondary home has a horrible loan with 7% interest rate and is through a small local bank who constantly tries to reappraise or increase rates and so forth. My goal is to get rid of that loan by taking a home equity loan on the primary home or a cash out refinance.

Current Situation: I've done a lot of research online and talked to a number of lenders but the main issue I'm coming into is that my parents have extremely low income at around 35k combined so the debt to income does not meet the threshold (or Texas' standard of 50%). It seems that most places they won't pass. I'm considering co-signing on the loan with my income (which is more than enough to reach the right ratio) but I just graduated so I can't provide the 2 years of W-2s... Not sure what to do in this situation to help them get out of the bad loan.

Question: Is there any lender or type of loan that looks strictly at debt to asset for loaning? Or are there any lenders that don't factor debt to income as much if my parents have the assets (through savings) to make sure they don't default? I'm honestly just not sure where to apply at this point since a hard inquiry seems non worthwhile if it won't pass.

Thanks so much in advance for reading! I really seem to lack knowledge and have found this area to be difficult for me to truly help.",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin vs Banks,"I see all these people pissed off at banks closing accounts, not allowing purchases etc.   
&amp;nbsp;Banks are the reason bitcoin exists. The banks run the world. They have hindered the growth of humanity through funding wars, inflation and poor management of the money supply. The US government is not in control of a damn thing - the Federal Reserve took control of the pocketbook in 1913. Since then they devalued the dollar by over 98%. They fund the wars - both sides.  
  Paper currency was invented to show that a bank held gold for a customer. People traded the notes - thinking the bank had the gold- until they found out that they didn't have what they said they did. Furious - note holders would withdraw what they could - causing a bank run.  
This is no longer the case. The dollar isn't backed by anything. They didn't have the assets they claimed they had (gold). They now control the world by forcing oil to be traded in US dollars. Any country that refuses the deal is attacked.   
 &amp;nbsp; Seeing a pattern here? 
  Lying bankers are not to be trusted.   
Bitcoin needs to be used as a currency, not traded for paper.   
Fiat money eventually collapses. The only thing holding up the dollar is ""confidence"". If people realized banks are unneeded middle men then the world would be a better place.  
Don't expect them to lay down and let their scam be exposed. They will fight this with all they have - which is worthless once the scam is up.  
Bitcoin ensures trust through the blockchain - not a shady bankster.

personalfinance,Recently unemployed &amp; Tax incentive clarification.,"So this might be a little out of place, but I'm not extremely articulate with finances. I'm struggling super hard with taxes due to investments from a previous employer. I know it's still really^really^really early but my confusion causes chaos so I start early. 

Essentially, I'm a 25/f  from NH that up until this point hasn't invested into ANYTHING. In 2015 I got a good job and was going 8% into a 401k [Employer matched 5%, pre-taxed from my check]. Eventually I switched it down to 5%.  The company also gave me what looks like 54 units of Employee stock. Then they fired me right after releasing the news they were giving everyone raises. I almost saw it coming. 

I had no intention on touching the stock, but about 11 units are vested so far. My intention was to completely ignore them for a long time to be honest. Then I kept seeing information that you can get a huge chunk taken off of your taxable income if you invest in an IRA. 

Here's the thing; Upon termination I got a severance email where  I received a warning in regard to my 401K that said:
&gt;*""If your balance is below $5,000 **Company** reserves the right to distribute your funds in compliance with IRS regulations. You will receive advance notice if your account balance will be distributed.""* 

which applies to me. I wasn't with the company very long but the money is still substantial enough that I don't want to lose it. I also haven't received any notification they'd be distributed.

At this time the linked account says I'm still employed by the company. So I can move the money. I learned you can put it into a Rollover IRA with nothing crazy happening? Does this seem like the best decision or would the employer still be able to get the money?


So I guess the questions are what would you do? 
Specifically:

Would you invest into the IRA? 

^My ^401k ^has ^almost ^3k ^in ^it ^and ^my ^stocks ^are ^less ^than ^1k ^but ^free ^money ^is ^free ^money   
 
What kind of IRA would you invest in? 

How does the federal tax break work?

Would you invest the stock, the 401k or both? 

Would my old Employer still have access to it at that point? 

How much can I expect to spend out moving money around? 

Though I usually deal with the standard deduction, is there any other tax breaks I should be aware of?

I really appreciate everyone's patience! Please let me know if I can clarify any information without literally handing you my whole ss#",finance

financialindependence,Part Time FI Tax question,"Let's say your yearly spending is $150k POST TAX (to make this example really clear). This is a married household. Your portfolio has enough to cover $120k per year (pretax) so you withdraw that. 

You are taking all of your money out of a taxable account that is now taxed at LTCG. I'm assuming the first $80k you take out is taxed at 0 %. Are LTCG only taxed at federal levels? Not state or city? The next 40k is taxed at 15%. 

I know you also have a marriage deduction of $12,600 per year. To get to your $150k spending each year, you have to go out and make ~50k ish as a family in salary (ballparking this depending on tax). Does this mean you now get taxed on ordinary income for $37,400 for the year due to the marriage deduction? Do you pay state/city/federal/FICA taxes based on the ordinary income of $37,400 and the $120k in LTCG does not factor into all these non-LTCG taxes?

CryptoMarkets,Illegal content on the ETH Blockchain,"I posted this over in the ETH sub but I was censored.  Hours later it still doesn't show up when I search by ""new"", and the mods ignored my private message asking why.  I think they are absolutely terrified of this possibility and that is the reason.  This question has been posted before, but the last discussion about it was over a year ago and I think it needs to be taken more seriously, as no clear answer has ever been given and no conclusions have been reached.  

What would happen if someone uploaded illegal content to the ETH blockchain such as child pornography? Wouldn't every single ETH miner and individual with a copy of the ETH blockchain thus be committing a felony? Would this be an effective way for someone to destroy/criminalize Ethereum?

I am under the impression that deleting things from the ETH blockchain would undermine its mission, has never been done, and is not currently possible without the majority of the miners agreeing to do so. How would the ETH community handle this, what would happen next?

The ETH creator's only response to this is that it would be too expensive to upload image files (UNTRUE, see my edit below), but for someone who just wanted to harm the ETH project I'm sure they would be willing to pay any price.  This is no excuse for not having a plan.  Somebody somewhere is going to do this, it's just a matter of time.  


The laws about this are extremely clear: ""Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and **electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal** visual depictions under federal law.""


EDIT: Just did some quick math and it costs about $250 to store 45 KB on the ETH blockchain.  This is way more than enough for a clear image or even several images.  What the ETH creator said about doing this being prohibitively expensive is total bullshit.  It's not a practical way to save your photos but there are countless black hats who just enjoy ruining things for everybody else, and $250 to throw a wrench in the ETH project would be a very small price for them.

personalfinance,"700 credit score. Auto loan quoted at 19% interest due to ""thin file"". Insight needed please!","My apologies for the long story. I had what I would call poor credit last year. Someone stole my identity and racked up a huge Sprint bill in 2013. I never knew because I didn't care about ""real life"" things until recently. Using Credit Karma I successfully disputed the Sprint bill and it has now fallen off my credit. I also opened a secured credit card through Capital One around 8 months ago and have used no more than 8% of it per month whilst keeping my balance paid in full. These things combined shot my score up from mid 500's to 700 in 8 months. (all of this thanks to PF!)

My total costs of rent/bills per month is less than $600. I have roughly 2k saved currently. (my store was being remodeled so i was effectively laid off for the last 2 months, killing my savings.) I make $350+ a week delivering pizzas and I also have side income trickling in from weekend music gigs. I am also heavily considering Uber.

Forward to today. My current car is nearing its final rest and my delivery job resumes this weekend. I have been researching replacements and found a 2016 Chevy Sonic LTZ with 40,000 miles for 10k. $800 sales tax and $140 a month insurance. The car is from Hertz Rental Company's sales department. I'm not really here to debate the merits of purchasing a used rental car. I am here more for advice on what direction to take now that I have some more information from my first time trying to get ANYTHING financed in my life. 

Hertz financing quoted me $500 down, $230/mo @72mo (19%). Of course they told me that their however-many lenders all denied me except one. They said the high interest rate was because I ""only have one account open on my credit file"" so that was the lowest rate they could get. They told me in 6-8 months I'd be able to refinance (somewhere else) after establishing better credit history.

I understand having a thin file, but is 19% really the only option for me at this point? I was hoping for something more like 6-10% for 60 months to start. I knew that I'd have to eat it a bit on my first auto loan but I didn't think it'd be to the tune of some 7k more than the amount loaned. Is it because I'm a credit noob or because lolhertz? Should I take what I can now and try to refinance down the road, or should I look another car at a ""real"" dealership? My father seems to think I should be getting more like 4% interest and says I should just buy a new car if I'm doing 72 months.

I know some will say just repair my car or buy a cheap used one. I would prefer to get something newer for warranties, Uber driving, and reliability over the coming years. I am also looking to build my credit file so I can get financed on some property in a few years if all goes well. My next step is getting an unsecured card. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading this far!

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for all the awesome advice! I honestly had no idea that so many people would reach out in such a short period of time. So far, it seems like my best course of action would be:

Car Loan: Pay off entirely in case something happens to it. That way I’m not on the hook for a car that I am no longer able to drive.

Credit Cards: Pay off entirely and set up auto pay to pay off the full amount each month moving forward.

Student Loans: Pay a large portion of, and then set up auto pay to make the minimum payments for the remaining balance each month.

Remainder: I plan to put a minimum of 10k in my Ally Savings acct- it has a 1% interest rate.

Last year I decided to finance a car to try and continue rebuilding my credit and I picked a nice cheap Corolla knowing I could easily pay $500 a month and have been paying $500 every month since I got the car. Now I originally got a horrible deal with 15% interest but since I was paying $200 over my monthly payment I figured I could pay this off quickly and not pay nearly as much interest as I was scheduled to and could eventually refinance in a year. Yesterday I was pre-approved by the bank of one of my credit cards to refinance at a 2% lower interest rate but they want to extend the deal to 72 months again compared to the 60 I have left which would increase how much I'm paying in total if I did take the full 72 months to pay. But if I keep paying the $500 a month that I am then I should be completely fine right? I was planning on paying the whole thing off in three years and that 2% drop should save me a bunch over the next two years or am I an idiot? Is this the right time to refinance? Should I take this pre-approval to my credit union to see if they can give me a better deal?

""On the verge of the 4th industrial revolution Russia has unique chances to become a leader in three priority areas: blockchain, quantum and convergent technologies. The development bank creates three world-class competence centers to achieve these goals, said Sergey Gorkov, Vnesheconombank Chairman, at the “Bits+Blocks+Forks” session of the World Economic Forum in Davos. He presented the program of introduction of blockchain in state management.

“Blockchain is not a technology, it’s a part of the strategic development of the Russian economy. Blockchain Commune is already operating. We expect other two competence centers on quantum and convergent technologies to open in 2018. VEB is focused on supporting and developing the Russian innovation ecosystem, creating national innovation champions and integrating them into global context. There are several directions of this large-scale work: legislative expertise (this year we expect state legislative regulation of blockchain to be developed), creating families of funds to attract investment, and developing an effective system to boost breakthrough startups, primarily in the Russian and Asian markets”, Sergey Gorkov said.

It is crucial for Russian innovations and non-oil economy to create additional conditions and sources of long-term investments.

""VEB is studying the possibilities of investing in direct investment funds together with international partners. These funds will finance projects in the key sectors of the Russian economy. We are cooperating with the largest financial institutions in China and India. The system of decision-making and risk management in such financial institutions significantly differ from traditional banking. We will propose appropriate changes to the memorandum of VEB"", said Sergey Gorkov.

Earlier Vnesheconombank reached an agreement to create a joint venture company with the largest Indian infrastructure fund SREI. VEB and China Merchants Capital also agreed to finance joint projects as well as to create funds in the field of high technology and innovation.

Vnesheconombank's subsidiary VEB Innovations is actively developing venture projects. In addition to traditional forms, like loans, the development bank provides other forms of support, such as acquiring a share in the capital. VEB supports innovative forms of state and business cooperation in introducing high technologies. For example, Blockchain Commune is carrying out blockchain technology projects for the Federal Service for State Registration, Cadastre and Cartography in respect of its transactions, for the Agency for Housing Mortgage Lending in respect of shared joint ownership agreements and for the Ministry of Healthcare for medication control. Millions of people will get access to state services due to blockchain.

personalfinance,"Married, total income 80K. Stay in Seattle with the chance to purchase a house or move back to California for higher wage?","My husband and I are currently living in Seattle. We are in our early 30's. We moved here 1 year ago from Bay Area, California, for him to start a Radiology Technologist program. Another plus was for me to get into a hospital to work as an acute care nurse. I've been an RN for 2 years in California but due to oversaturation of RNs there I could never get into the hospital. Currently I'm making $34/hour, but with shift differentials (I work nights) and OT pay, I bring in about 80-85K per year. My husband goes to school full time but works on the side for his brother, brings in approx $600 per month. 

We are trying to buy a house in Seattle. I've been approved for a 400K loan with 4% interest rate. We have about 15K saved, and his brother is planning to help us by gifting us with 20K by March (he makes a lot of money, we would not have to pay the money back). This past weekend we went to look for a 3 bed, 1 bath house listed at 400K. There were tons of people also looking, and the realtor told us that the owners already got a great offer at 525K, cash! The house was on market for only 3 days. We felt a little down, but our realtor told us to not give up since there should be more inventory popping up in Spring time, which should give us better bargaining power. 

This brings us to our current dilemma. With discussions, we came up with a few options. We both have students debt and car loans. We could:

1. Stay and see if we could buy a house way below our loan amount (I'm hoping for something for around $350K, about 10-15 miles from work in a poor but up and coming area)

2. Rent for now then try again when my husband finish school in 1 year. (Radiologic tech avg income in Seattle is approx $53,125-$64,231)

3. Rent for now, then move back to California and live with my in-laws until we save up to buy a house there. 

I'm going back and forth between the options and can't make up my mind. Logically, moving back home would be a practical idea. We'd save on rent by living in a house (they also rent, but we'd probably pay the same amount we pay now, which is $1500). My wage would increase by almost 2/3 or double. Avg pay for RN in the bay area is about $60 an hour, but could go up to $70 or 80 with my experience. Radiologic tech pay for my husband would also be higher, about $45 per hour. We can live there for 2-3 years, pay off our loans, save up money, and then try to buy a house. Of course, the market it much higher there. Avg price of a house currently is $800K - 1 mil. We may also give up the idea of purchasing a house for a long time because we probably won't move back to Seattle. On the other hand, we do plan to have kids soon, and we would have great support there. Both of our families live in the bay area. 

Here are our numbers:

My pay: ~$40/ hour

His pay: ~$600/month

Rent: $1500/month

Utilities: $200/month

Car 1 payment: $250 (x2 more years)

Car 2 payment: $450 (x5 more years)

Loan 2 payment: deferred for while he's in school. Amount of loan ~ $40K 

Monthly spending (groceries, gas, etc): ~$800

personalfinance,Balance transfer a car loan to a credit card?,"Greetings!

My wife used to have pretty shitty credit (like, ~600 according to CreditKarma), and when she needed to take out a loan for an unexpected car purchase, her interest rate reflected that shitty credit score: ~15%. She has been paying this for years without really looking into other options.

We recently took a look at our finances since we just moved to a new place and wanted to find some places to trim some financial fat to help alleviate the costs of moving. While we're doing well overall, it was during this review we noticed that the car loan has a 15% interest rate. This alarmed me, as my loan has something like a 5.5%, so I was wondering if we could get it refinanced.

She only owes something like $2000 on the loan and will have it paid off in about 9 months with monthly payments of ~$250. We called USAA, which issued the loan, and they said that they would not be able to refinance the loan for a lower rate since it's at such a low value already.

So my thought is this:
Apply for a card with a 0% introductory rate for 12 months and transfer the balance (or ask USAA if we could outright charge it to the card, something I know a lot of lenders don't do due to credit card processing fees). While this would increase the time to pay off from 9 months to 10, it reduces monthly payments by almost $100. If a 0% card is out of the question for some reason, she has an Amazon card issued through Chase. I'm not sure of the APR on this, but if it's lower than the car loan, that would be good (or so I think). Or, there's always the possibility of a small personal loan with a lower APR (which may help to pay off some other debts as they pop up) .

Is there anything I'm not thinking about here? Is this generally a bad idea? Should we just not deal with the hassle and pay it off as is, since we're already near the home stretch? Looking for thoughts

Should I use the collection departments (hardship departments of the bank issuing the CC. Not a collection agency) of the CC companies that I have accounts with whereby I close my accounts, dramatically lower interest rate, and payment amounts due? 
or
Should I borrow from a friend enough money to pay this month's bills and (since I got this new job) try to get a signature loan from a bank to consolidate the accounts and keep my CC accounts open?

One of the payday loans I had sent my account to collections and now I'm facing a civil lawsuit in municipal court from the collections company. I called them and set up a payment arrangment to keep it out of court, $100 every two weeks until its paid off. 

I'm just trying to figure out how to move forward. My student loans are in deferment until next month. Meeting all of my minimum payments each month is about $4k which is why I haven't been able to keep up with them. Without the payday loans its about $2500. After taxes my take home pay is $1800 with no OT, so I take home at least $3600 per month but most of the time I make more due to OT. 

I met with a bankruptcy lawyer yesterday and he is recommending chapter 13 bankruptcy. Under this bankruptcy my debts would be reorganized into one payment each month. My monthly payments would be $2070 and would include everything that I currently owe on. The payment agreement would last 60 months. The money I have left over would go completely to living expenses and utilities. 

This seems like a good deal. I would pay $410 upfront to get started. According to the lawyer I wouldn't have any issues in the future applying for a home loan, auto loan, or a new line of credit with a chapter 13 bankruptcy on my credit history. He said I wouldn't have a problem obtaining an apartment. I also get to keep the vehicles.

I guess I just want to see what some of the more experienced people think, I just want to get out of this situation and not live like this anymore.

In need of a little advise about Mortgage Loans. Fiancée and I have been saving up as much as we can in the last year or so in hopes to buy a house. We are tired of throwing money at landlords and never seeing a dime back again. 1K a month for 4 years now. 

That being said we are pretty fortunate in that we have income a little over 50K each (Michigan) We are looking for homes around 200K-300K. As we are both first time home buyers, FHA loans caught our eye. 
We should have enough by summer for a 10%-6% (20K) down payment. FHA ""only requires 3.5%"" but such low down payments scares me that there is a catch and I will be screwed somehow.

I am a numbers guy (kinda...) but this will be my first mortgage so confidence is lower.

Main questions...
Is 6% enough for a FHA loan without being screwed?

Are the only cons with this other than slightly higher interest rates?

Mortgage insurance. I've calculated that this is .80% monthly payment could add $160-$240 month. Is this specific to FHA loans? is it always mandatory?

Am I even in the right direction?

personalfinance,Best way to borrow $7k for 2-3 months?,"I'm trying to sell my car but need to pay off the loan first. I could sell it to a dealer without paying the loan off, but KBB value is about $2-3k higher if I do private sale so I'd rather try that first. Dealer has offered me $9k for it which still gives me $2k after the loan, but why leave that extra $2-3k on the table if I don't have to? I figured if I can't sell it within a couple of months I'll go sell it to the dealer. 

I'm also aware that it's possible to do a private sale without paying the loan off first (use the buyer's money to pay it off) but my loan holder does not hold the title so it's a 2-week wait between paying off the loan and receiving the title. Because that makes it more complicated, I'm concerned about losing a good buyer if there's still a loan.

I don't have the $7k available in cash to pay the loan off right now. The loan cannot be paid off with a credit card, it has to be cash or transfer from another financial institution.

I called my mortgage company to ask about a HELOC, and it's available but has a $500 prep fee if you pay it off before 3 years, so that's not an option. 

The next thing I'm thinking is getting a personal loan. My credit union offers personal loans for 9.5% with no pre-payment penalty and no origination fees or anything. It would end up being about $50/month in interest if I go this route. Assuming it takes 3 months to sell the car (which I hope is worst case scenario) that's $150 in interest. Not bad.

Is this the best option? Are there lower interest rates available for this type of short-term loan? Peer to peer lending? Are there certain places I should be looking?

My wife's currently driving a '13 Ford Focus SE w/ about 65,500 miles. It's a great car for us but there are a few different reasons that we're wanting to change things up.

1. Transmission problems. This vehicle has proved to be one of the many Focuses plagued with Ford's Powershift transmission issue. To put things into perspective, we've put about 50,000 miles on the vehicle and we're on our third clutch pack. The car's under warranty until 100,000 miles but past that point, there's no way I'm going to keep paying to put transmissions into it.

2. Interest rate. Her dad helped her get this loan before I got into car sales and upon taking a look at her purchase agreement, they're paying ~11.25% on this car for a total of 75 months! Anyone can do the math to determine that it's just not worth paying that kind of interest on this car. 

All of this said, we are upside down on the car. We owe $11,095 as of this morning and it's worth $5,000-$7,500 (depending on who you ask.)

I've had some friends tell me to ride it out until it gets closer to 100,000 miles but I'm really hesitant about continuing to pay that kind of interest rate. Others say make double payments, others are telling me to trade it off. 

Frankly, I just need some advice. What's the financially smart move here? Getting out of the loan would be awesome as to knock the interest rate down, but I don't know what I should be looking to do.",finance

So I'm currently in $28k credit card debt, and am fortunate enough that a family member loaned me $15k to help pay it off so the interest doesn't kill me (20%+). I will be paying them back, but won't start for at least 6 months and won't be paying interest. I want to use this the best way I can.

Here's the quick facts:

$16k on one credit card with 21.24% interest ($450 minimum payment + interest)
$12k on another credit card from a different bank with 20.49% interest ($300 minimum + interest)
Credit score is about 630 (making me ineligible for a balance transfer card)
I have a job currently making about $2k/m and my expenses are about $1k/m (not including credit card minimum payments)
My income will hopefully go up in the next 3-4 months (to $3-4k/m hopefully) as I transition to a new career

I have $3k cash + the $15k loan so $18k total cash that I could put towards the debt.

I have my spending in order (I've learned a lot from this debt on that lol) but I want to ensure that I do the most good with this money so I'm in the best position long term.

Here's what I have planned so far, but I'm looking for suggestions from experienced people:

I've looked at creditviewdashboard and messed with the simulator and it says that if I pay off $13k of my debt, my credit score would be about 746 (probably because I'm currently utilizing 76% of my credit and that would substantially drop it?) + my monthly payments and interest would be dropped a lot too since I would pay off my highest interest rate card

With 700+ credit score, I should be eligible for a balance transfer card to transfer the remaining $15k to a 0% interest card for 12 months, allowing me to pay that off over the next year without accruing $200 a month in interest.

TL;DR
I would pay off $13k of the $16k credit card, then take the remaining $15k debt and transfer it to a 0% for 12 months balance transfer card, which I would then pay off over the next year before the interest goes up.

Is my plan flawed in some way? I'd love to hear comments and suggestions to see if my ""logic"" is correct or not.

P.S. I don't have a written plan for how I will pay off the $15k loan, and I'm not worried that I will have to pay it off quickly. I'm more concerned about how I should use the money now.

I have payed every monthly payment on time no problems and regularly throw extra money towards the payment and interest of the vehicle.

What i am confused about is when i transfer money for the monthly payment, why is most of that money going towards the interest and not the monthly payment? Does it not matter which category the payment is going towards because it ends up paying it off in the end? Also, if i am making my payments on time with extra payments on the loan and putting extra money into the interest will this ever lower my monthly payment or does that only happen when i refinance the loan?

Here are five of my last transactions on the loan:
-$40 principal payment 

-$100 regular payment = $7.59 finance charge,$92.41 principal charge

-$35 regular payment = $17.74 finance charge, $17.26 principal charge

-$50 principal payment

-$35 regular payment = $2.54 finance charge, $32.46 principal payment 

Thank you! I’m sure this has been posted before so i apologized in advance. I did look this up before just still a little confused on if I’m putting my money towards the loan in a smart matter.",finance

I will not owe any this year.

personalfinance,"19 year old with a 1.5 million inheritance, including a run down winter property. Sell or keep?","**Warning, 1) I'll be speaing in ""we"" as this concerns my sibling and I,
2) no TL:DR; I believe the context given is necessary to find a better solution that ours to our dilemma**

Hello reddit, throwaway for obvious reasons.

My sibling and I received a 3m windfall last year, split half half gives 900k each in cash on life insurance funds, split between invested and secure, and the rest being a summer loft as secondary residence at the beach and the deceased's main property with an amazing view of mountains and near skiing stations, which was actually our winter home and holds lots of emotional value for us.

Personally we've both been sitting on the money ever since for reasons concerning our studies, we both decided to just leave it there grow while we got over with the toughest part of our studies (we're both in extremely demanding colleges and majors) and that time is now. We've been bringing in around 60k/year passively from the life insurance fund, split between secure placement (4% yearly interest rate) and invested funds (+15% in 2017) for my sibling who had further invested than I, and 20k/year for me since I was much more drowned in work last year, but enough to cover living expenses and college.

Our schedules are finally starting to get lighter so we got around to selling the run down winter property, since neither of us intended to ever go back there to live, and renting is not possible since seasonal. Property was valued at roughly 500k but due to years of not taking care of it before our family member died, rain and leaks have severely fucked up the roof and caused structural damage.
I had it valued last month with this in mind and both the architect and the realtor expected it to be sold at no more than 300k should we be in luck. However as soon as we put it on the market for 350k last week, highballing to see if how the market would react, we got a call from a local millionaire who'd been eyeing the house for years and absolutely wants to buy, will go up to 375k which is 75k positive from what we actually expected.

Now as this offer comes so unexpected and so quickly, we've had to start emptying the house out and realized we had been neglecting the emotional value it holds for us. We heard what the buyer intended to do with the house, which was similar to what we thought we'd do if we ever keep it when we considered all options back in 2017 when the windfall came in, which is basically repair everything that's dilapidated (at least 100k), break some walls make new rooms, renovate nice and modern, build a pool etc... (we're calculating another 100k).
Then we thought we'd keep the house, yearly expenses being easily paid off passive life insurance income, go there every winter with our family, which would be even nicer when we have our own families, basically keeping it as a winter property. 

If we eventually want to sell it back, we predict doing this much work on it, it would sell for around 450-500k representing a 50k loss which is not even what one of us earns passively in one year.
The main issue here is whether the repairing to be done on the house would require one of us to be present or not, therefore possibly time consuming, which we cannot allow at this time in our lives, and we have no one to help us out, we've been by ourselves since the beginning of this process.

We were wondering if we're not making a mistake or being blinded by emotional connection, since we have no one to tell us what's the right move: our financial advisor retired during the year we've been sitting on the issue and the one that replaced him gives no fucks about what's better for us, presses to sell to cash in an additional 175k from each of us, disregarding whether we could ever buy a property like that in such a priviledged place with such an amazing view in the future, for the same price, and if we do purchase a winter property and it costs more than the hypothetical 450-500k in the future, it represents a loss in the long term, financially and emotionally.

Has anyone been through something like this, and what's the right move? Is selling the right move, objectively? We're just afraid to sell and in regret it in 30 years, buy a winter property that costs more for less, and lose all the attachment to the place, however if we conduct works on the house and end up with an uninhabited winter mansion that we only go to every december... I mean 1.5 million undoubtedly qualifies as being rich, and surely once we start working and have time to get into managing our money that number will only go up, but are we seasonal mansion rich?

Thank you for reading through all of it.",finance
personalfinance,Question about paying off credit card debt,"I have about $11,000 of credit card debt. $7500 on one with a 20% interest rate, and $3500 on the other with 0 percent interest for another year.

I understand that we could cut this out and it would make a huge difference, we just need to get the discipline required to cook regardless of how tired we are after work. 

My question is this: Would it make sense to pay our bills and then put ALL extra money in our checking account towards a credit card? In my mind I feel like if we put more money towards the card and then have nothing in checking it will encourage us to feel as though we have no extra money to spend on food and extra things.",finance

I have a few goals I would like to reach and I want to know if my plan makes sense. A little bit about me:

Age: 27
Take home pay: $4600/mo
Rent: $980/mo
Car payment: $200/mo ($11k remaining on loan)
Private loan: $450/mo ($18k remaining on loan)
Federal student loans: $0/mo right now (in deferment due to active military status)
Savings: $3,000
Retirement: ~$2,000 (just started an employee match, contributing 5% and receiving 5% match)

Obviously I have quite a bit in student loans to pay off and the $450 is already a lot to handle, so I haven't made a dent in the federal loans yet. My main goal right now is to save up a bigger amount for an emergency fund, but I also don't know how to approach the student loans.  

Some reading I've done has said it's okay to pay the debt over a long period of time (all loans are 6% interest or less), but the general consensus on here seems to be to try to pay them off very aggressively.  I have some other things I'd like to save up for (main thing now being an engagement ring), but would this be considered irresponsible based on the debt I have? I have about $750-$1k that I can start saving each month, so how much of that should go to e-fund vs engagement ring vs student loan debt? Any recommendations would be much appreciated!",finance

Hello world!
I have amateur knowledge of stock buying and selling and have read a bit of investing for dummies, thats it, however I'm sure you're interested in my story and the $2 million dollar platter on the table. Well, to begin with, I cannot disclose any information at this time about my legal case battle or any information about the accident, other than it was between a company vehicle hitting me, me having to have been out on disability for 2 years, lumbar spinal fusion surgery, pain and suffering yada yada yada. All you need to know is I have a lawsuit case closing in February with $2 million settlement offer, unfortunately because of the policy limit, the maximum settlement is only $2 million. I calculate after hospital bills and leech's (~$700,000), I am only left with between $1.2 million and $1.3 million. I am M[27], I have an Associate Of Science and some school after, undergrad. I am married to spouse who is an active duty member in a branch of the armed forces. 

I know I cannot go back to the job I once had as a Laboratory Technician, so I'm trying figure out what other sedentary jobs I can do, or whether it's smarter to just go back to school, live off $30,000/year untill I graduate while paying for tuition out of settlement and live off of it? TBH I prefer the latter because at least I get a degree and further my education. My wife and I do not own a home and our typical monthly rent expenditures come out to between $1,500-$1,700 with rent included. We have BAH from the military so on top of having a child and that, we really don't have that much to worry about struggling. My SO has previous credit damage of bankruptcy with $130,000 foreclosure and repo, which happened 7 years ago. I have none. I currently bank with Navy Federal Bank, I was wondering if that is a good bank to deposit such lump sum for awhile untill I figure this whole mess out or is there another institution that may have higher interesr rates for CD's?

All I really wanna do is just park the money into some stocks, mutual funds, long term investments and live off dividends untill my late 40's, when I can retire. It sounds like a fantastic pipe dream I'd love to pursue, ever since this blessing in disquise I figured why not me and my SO both retire once her 20 year contract is up. However I don't know where to begin. I'd like to acquire enough cash for the both of us and be debt free. I can't see myself retiring at 65. I mean, no offense I don't wanna worry myself about breaking a hip in my sixties because I've finally retired. I am just coming on here asking for financial advice on what smart way should I invest my money and have it work for me. Currently I am reading Investing for Dummies 7th edition and the smart investor, it's sort of helpful, yet it offers me no data on how someone turned say- million into a networth of over 10 million. What works, what doesn't? This is what's been driving me mad, trying to guess what will give me the most bang for my buck if I left the (stock/mutual funds,ETF/real estate) alone for 20 or more years. This is your perfect moment to shine if someone said ""If you had a million dollars, how would you invest it?""

personalfinance,Planning on moving from a low CoL area to a medium CoL area in the next 5 years,"Hi PF, as stated in the title, I'm planning on moving from a low CoL area (OKC) to a medium CoL area (Denver) in the next 5 years. I'm trying to figure out what my options are. I've provided some specifics and some scenarios below.

&amp;nbsp;

Income - $7.7k/month (DINK)

Mortgage - $1400/month (total mortgage is $180k, own 3%)

Bills - $400/month average

Other fixed costs (health costs, insurance, fuel, pet costs) - $1700/month (I have a LOT of medical expenses every month)

Food - $500/month

Savings - $3700/month average (pending no budget overages)

Esavings fully funded to 8 months expenses.

&amp;nbsp;

We are currently saving to buy a new car with cash later this year. (I know PF is not generally a fan of this idea. Its a combination of want and need.) That should be fully funded this summer. The next goal is getting to 20% on our existing mortgage so we can ReFi with no PMI and a potentially better interest rate. 

From here, we have a few options.

A - Dump all extra money into mortgage. Best case scenario have it paid off in ~ 4 years. Buy house in Denver contingent on selling existing house, hopefully netting a very large down payment on the next house.

B - Save all extra money toward a down payment on the next house, paying just the minimum mortgage payment. This works in our favor if we end up moving sooner than expected, but we have less equity in the current house.

C - Pump our retirement savings to the max contribution a year (currently saving, but nowhere near that), save all extra money for down payment on next house. This option is certainly best for our retirement, but from what I calculate, we will basically never be able to afford to move out of this state.",finance

Basically, my total savings include $100k in my 401k, $140k in an FDIC insured savings account with a relatively good interest rate (around 1.25%),  and another $90 in Vanguard ETFs (a mix of total US stock market and international/emerging markets). And, finally, around $5k in bitcoin. I own a car that's paid off but getting old, and rent an apartment. 

My issue is that I feel like I'm going at this totally cluelessly, and have no idea what I am supposed to do now or if I'm on the right track. On one hand, I want to be conservative in case I get married or have a kid in the next five years (daycare will cost a fortune in NYC).  But on the other hand, I wonder if I'm making a mistake as to my cash vs investment breakdown, or if I should be getting into other investments like real estate at this point. I have always heard that buying property is a must-do investment, but it seems like a lot of time and effort and money to keep up with property, especially since it would have to be an investment property somewhere else (I can't yet afford to buy something I would live in, because I want to stay in Manhattan for now). 

I'd really appreciate any general advice. Thank you!

personalfinance,[$129k income/$375k house] Buying a house and need a sanity check on budget,"Hello all!

My wife and I are wanting to buy a house in the next few months before our rental lease is up (although could do month-to-month after if needed) and would really appreciate some feedback on our situation and budget. What do you think of our plan? Is this a reasonable approach?

We have been putting my wife's salary straight to a separate down payment savings account for the past 2 years and the following is our current breakdown:

* We are 28 and 29 with no kids right now, but planning on one within a year and a half or two
* Salaries: $73k for me (usually get ~10k in OT a year, but don't budget for this) and $56k for her 
* ~$5700/mo combined take home pay after taxes, retirement, health insurance, etc. -- since I am paid bi-weekly, I don't budget for the extra 2 paychecks a year
* Only debt is a car loan with 19k left at 0% interest and $500/mo payment for new (at the time) mid-sized SUV
* Student loans have been paid off for ~4 years
* No CC debt and pay off all CC's each statement
* $10k emergency fund -- would prefer to leave this untouched if possible
* $70k in down payment savings account (will increase ~$7.5k in 3 months when we will most likely want to close on a house)
* $12k in checking accounts (after taking out this month's CC payments, 2017 taxes, etc)
* I can sell a week's vacation for ~$1k after taxes if needed
* I have ~$20k in 401k and $7.5k in Roth IRA and she has ~$25k in her 401k and $7k in Roth IRA -- don't plan on contributing to the Roth IRA this year due to housing expenses, but still adding to 401k
* Credit scores 800+ based on recent credit report

**House:**

* $350k-$375k we are looking to purchase with 20% down payment of $70k-$75k. We have not made any offers yet but this is the range that we have looked into and have liked the most
* Low cost of living city in southeast US
* We would like to stay in this home for as long as possible and have stable jobs to keep us here in this city
* $375k home at 4% interest rate, 30 year fixed is ~$1920/mo PITI ($33% net monthly income, not counting OT or 2 extra paychecks)
* Cost to close from the 3 quotes we have (1 is a pre-approval) is down payment + $2.5k closing + $6k pre-paid, but all 3 quotes have been VERY different so this is conservative I hope. I think the current checking account should cover this already.

**Monthly Expenses (and estimates):**

* Utilities: $300
* Cell phone: $145
* Gas: 100
* Food - Groceries: $300
* Food - Restaurants: $100
* Car: $500
* Auto insurance: $175
* Pet: $30
* Media: $90
* Personal/Recreation: $240 (mainly adding a 5% risk to final amount)
* House payment (PITI): $1920 (est)
* Housing repairs: $315 (est)
* Childcare: $800 (est) -- future planning!

**TOTALS**: Monthly expenses: $5015 of $5700. This seems good on paper, but I can't help to think I am missing something, especially will all of the expected new expenses than can come with owning a new home and hoping to have children soon.

Sorry for the long post and I REALLY appreciate any feedback you have on our plan and if you think the approach is reasonable. It's tough talking to all of these lenders and the realtor who keep saying we are in a great situation to BUY BUY BUY, but I want to be very cautious in making the right decisions before making such a large purchase.

a.) Apply for another balance transfer card and try to get the last 4k transferred at 0%. My credit score is around 660 now so that might be difficult.
b.) Pay off the old CC with an interest rate. ($4k balance at 20% I think)
c.) Pay off the new 0% balance and transfer the remaining balance from the old CC

I'm thinking of doing #1 because Credit Karma tells me that my lack of credit accounts is negatively effecting my score, so having more could be a good idea.

If we don't currently have an emergency fund, is it better to create one with the 5K or pay down the HELOC?  Since we can easily draw from the HELOC at any time over the next 10 years, would it make more sense to put all 5K towards the HELOC now and pull it back out in case of an emergency?

personalfinance,Refinancing options,"I'm looking into refinancing my house due to a divorce.  Currently at 4.25%.  I was originally just going to do another 30 year between 4 and 4.25 percent but for the first time looked into 7/1 ARMs.  I have over 20% equity in my house.

My credit union has a 3.125% 7/1 ARM with minimal fees, that seems like it would save me a lot of money interest.  I realize interest rates are on the rise but even if they rose to say 6% by month 84, couldn't I just refi back into another ARM or a 15 year?

I'm also 29, Male with no kids.  I only stayed in my last house which I owned for 4 years.  I haven't decided if this house will be forever or not.  I think that will be more up to life's opportunities at this point.

personalfinance,"Laptop damaged in transit, Lenovo and FedEx not helpful","I purchased a Lenovo Yoga 720 this past May. It's a great laptop, but there's a widespread issue of internal LCDs separating, which creates a black line that's entirely cosmetic but nonetheless ugly and annoying. In my case, this happened maybe ~40 days into owning the laptop. I was going back and forth with Lenovo because I was pretty pissed about spending $1500 on a laptop only to have this happen less than 2 months into owning it. I was past their 30-day cutoff for returns, and they wouldn't entertain any type of exception or replacement unless I sent the machine to their service center to be looked at. I really didn't want to do this because they said it would take two weeks for me to get it back (translation: it would take at least a month) and I needed the laptop for work. Plus, and more important, I knew there was no permanent fix (according to other unhappy 720 owners who left 60+ pages worth of comments on the Lenovo forum) so I didn't even want to bother. But fast forward to December: I decided that I'd had enough of the machine and Lenovo, and I was going to try and get my money back. I contacted Lenovo, they sent me a box and a prepaid shipping label, and I shipped out the laptop via FedEx before I went on vacation for the holidays. I didn't bother checking the tracking until I got back from vacation in the beginning of January. Surprise, surprise -- upon checking the tracking, I discovered that the laptop never made it to Lenovo's service center. When I call FedEx, they tell me that apparently my laptop/package was badly damaged in transit. Here's where things have become sticky and confusing for me: 

The agent I just got off the phone with said that the next step for me as far as FedEx is concerned is to fill out a claims form to request a refund from FedEx for the price of the laptop. However, she said that if FedEx accepts my claim, the recipient AKA Lenovo would receive the refund, not me. What do I do? I don't know if any of you have had the absolute pleasure of talking to Lenovo's customer service, but they suck ass, so I don't know if I should be contacting them about this because I'm pretty sure they'd do absolutely nothing.... 

Another less important point: Initially, I just wanted FedEx to forward the package to Lenovo in hopes that they'd receive the package and refund me the price of the laptop. I've spoken to FedEx 3-4 times over the past couple of weeks trying to relay this, but each time they told me that their trace department would need to get back to me. When the agent I just got off the phone with brings up the claims form, I tell her I just want to forward the package to Lenovo. She tells me that the laptop, damaged or not, should've still gone to Lenovo, and she believes they refused the package even though the tracking says ""Unable to deliver - Damaged package."" Whether or not this means FedEx was unable to deliver because Lenovo denied the damaged package, I don't know. But now I'm not entirely confident as to where my laptop even is.

So now I'm stressed out and wondering how I can get my $1500 back -- who should I be contacting, how should I approach them, should I fill out the claims form for FedEx? 

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance

I'm a college student with $2,600 in Credit Card debt (Yes I know, I fell for the trap of Credit Cards). I currently have a 650 credit score. I know this is relatively low, but it's not because of any missed payments of defaults or anything like that. On my credit report it says my score is decreasing because the my revolving utilization is too high. I've never missed a payment on anything. 

Anyway, I'm looking to transfer the balance to a new cars with a 0% interest rate for 12-18 months. I currently have a Discover It card as my only card. I got it because of the lack of annual fees and cash back rewards. 

What's the best card I can get for a balance transfer with my credit score? I'm looking for something that would be good to use as a second card after my balance is paid off.

1. I ripped up the carpet in the living room and found natural 3/4 hard wood floors. Instead of replacing the floors like we planned we decided to re finish them. We budget $3000 for the floors and ended up spending $800. ( I know how to do the work my self and borrowed some of the equipment)

2. The minor upgrade for the Kitchen went into full remodel mode. ( per the saving above I budget 5000$ for this job). The cabinets and counter top alone cost us 5000$. We spent another $2500 on floors, fixtures etc.. Than I doubled down and bought all new appliances another 2000$

3. We had credit card debit before I took out the loan, we paid off the credit cards and than started the remodel. Than doubled down and re used the credit cards on the remodel.  I also added a new TV and Xbox one X for the living room, 1500$ and we bought new couches, $650. 

4. Please do not judge, I know were dumb. 

5. Should I increase my loan at 3.99% ( right now its at %3 fixed) for 10 years and consolidate all are debit ( including are 2 car loans) into 1 monthly payment. We would be spending approx $800 Dollars less than we are now.  Another issue is the 3.99% is not fixed and after 10yrs its turns to a variable. Or I can do 4.99% for 20yrs and the monthly payments drop and we spend $950 less a month than we do now. This is considered a second mortgage. Here are the numbers: 

First loan was for $25,000  at 3%- 
New loan would be for additional $55,000 at 3.99% or 4.99%

Paid $5500 mortgage interest. 
$0 points on mortgage. 
Made $400 in charitable donations.

I can make multiple payments to my credit card but it doesn't ever go over 30% so I'm not sure it will do anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Tax Withholding

IRS regulations require the custodian of the IRA from which you are converting to withhold income taxes at the rate of 10% from the converted amount unless you elect not to have withholding apply. 

Withholding will apply to the entire amount of the conversion, **even if non deductible contributions to the IRA have been made. You may still reinvest the entire conversion amount by replacing the amount withheld with other assets. Any amounts withheld and not replaced into the new Roth IRA within 60 days may be subject to a 10% early-withdrawal penalty if you are under 59.5 years old.**

OPTION A

* Do not withhold Federal Income Tax - I understand it's my responsibility to pay Federal Tax.* 

OPTION B

* Withhold the following amount: (must be between 10% and 100%)

&amp;nbsp;

*Regardless of your withholding election, you are responsible for the full payment of any federal income taxes, any states or local taxes, and any penalties that may apply for your distribution. You may be responsible for estimated tax payments and could incur penalties if your estimated tax payments are not sufficient. 

------------------------------------------------

If I choose option A, would I simply need to record the conversion on my tax return and that be the end of it?

If I choose option B and opt for 10% withholding, would that be the end of it? Why would one choose to withhold anything more than the regulatory 10%?",finance

personalfinance,"66 Credit Cards, 300K Debt from Spouse, What do I do?","Dear Redditors,
I am seeking advice on what to do about a family members situation (San Jose, CA) . Jane and her husband Dave have been married for over 40 years. When Dave became ill at 65 years of age, Jane was forced to take over the household finances. She discovered that Dave is in credit card debt and was not being honest about where his money was coming from-- for years. Dave now has a terminally ill disease and lost many motor functions and can barely speak, but has full cognitive function. Jane requested a credit report and saw 66 credit card accounts and even a federal student loan that was taken out in their son’s name. Jane and Dave own their home and Jane has her own business. She was denied for personal loans to consolidate the credit cards because the amount is a little over $300,000. 
Safe to say, Jane should have been more aware about her husband’s financial situation but feels powerless at the moment and doesn’t know what to do. Her last resort is to sell her home. Jane works 45 hours and week and now has to care for her terminally ill husband before and after work. Dave receives social security benefits of 3k per month, but his medically bills are just a much.

personalfinance,Lump sum payment on defaulted federal student loans. Questions about the process.,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,"Filed taxes, forgot to include interest earned on savings/checking","I filed on Monday, the federal return was accepted yesterday. I completely forgot about the 1099 my credit union sent me for the interest my checking/savings earned (a whopping $16.87). This is the first year I've ever earned enough interest to even receive a 1099.
I tried to go ahead and amend on TurboTax (I realize and they tell you that it will have to be printed and mailed, but they'll still walk you through amending it), but it says something about the IRS not being ready to accept amended returns until some time in February. 

So do I just sit back and wait for now? Is it possible that the return will not be approved and I can just re-file? If it gets approved as it is, do I need to bother amending?

I just want to do what's right.",finance
personalfinance,W-2 Employer Did Not Withhold Federal Taxes,"My wife is working for several different businesses, and set up direct deposit with each of them.

Save for house, pay off my vehicle, more into savings?","I am not sure where my money is best allocated given my situation and future goals. I currently have 19 months left on my lease and would love to purchase a home at that time. I also recently purchased a new truck and owe roughly $33K ($535/month).

Current stats, monthly take home is just under $3500/month. No debt and have $13K in savings. I have a budget and have it set to put $600/month into savings. At that rate, assuming no changes in income, I would have over $24K in savings. My question being is whether $24K is a reasonable amount to purchase a first home valued $180-$200K? Ive been questioning whether that is a pipe dream or totally feasible. I have been wondering whether I should put more into paying my truck off sooner. My loan's interest rate is 2.99% and I am currently paying more than necessary at $600/month.

Another note is I am 33, recently graduated and havn't contributed a lot to my retirement. I have about $9k in a 401k at a previous employer. Currently contributing 9% of my pay and employer matches 6%.

personalfinance,I need some advice with my credit cards and debt affecting my credit score please!,"Hello all! I was looking for some help regarding how my debt and credit cards will affect my credit score. 

Currently, I have a 715 credit score. My parents have horrible debt and horrible scores, so as I become a real adult I want to make sure I keep my score up so I can someday hopefully get a house (22 right now and still living at home to manage debt and school). I have three open accounts:

- Capital One Journey card, opened 5/15, currently has $2306 on it at a 20.8% APR (about $28 interest per month). 

- Chase credit card opened 2/2017 with $1006, no interest charges until 5/2018 (and at that point it will be 21% APR). The entire balance on this is a balance transfer from the Capital one card, I was trying to lower interest payments. 

- local bank car loan opened in 7/2017 with $4630, I make $125 monthly payments right now, about $30 interest per month at 7.49% interest. Once I get a job in my field I hope to raise the amount I pay per month to pay this off much faster. 

I can't file my taxes yet, but it is estimated that I should get between $1000 and $1300 back, plus I am getting $200 back from my school for textbook charges. So lets say I will at least be getting $1300 to pay off some debt within the next two months. My plan was to put all of this towards the capital one debt as that has the highest interest rate. 

I am currently a full time student, I graduate in May and I will then have a six week full time internship, so in the summer I will basically not have a paying job, and at the moment I do not make enough at my part time job to make any dent at all in the debt besides minimum payments. My plan was that once I get a real job in my degree (hopefully) next fall, to really hit the remaining debt. I know it's only $1000 on the Chase card and that doesn't seem like much to pay off between now and the summer, but I barely make enough money now to eat anything else but Ramen for each meal, so I doubt I'll make a dent by the summer, and I know during my internship I'll have to use my credit cards. 

So I am mainly wondering this: in May when the Chase card starts gathering interest, would it hurt my credit score to close this card and transfer any remaining balance (will probably be $1000 I'm guessing) to a new credit card with a new no interest period? Or would closing the account hurt my score more than the interest  would hurt me? A friend told me that it's possible the card may charge interest on the total balance transfer if I don't pay it off by May, but I'm not sure if that's true or not. 

I know this isn't a ton of debt for people my age, I am thankful to have a tuition scholarship. But this debt gives me constant anxiety. Thanks for any advice!",finance

personalfinance,"No growth in 401k, even when it's reporting growth..","Hello! I'm a long time lurker and have always enjoyed everyone's thoughtful guidance to each other on here.


My company does 401k through ADP and it's very user friendly.
Now heres the problem.


ADP has said that my retirement fund has grown 16% this past year but after tallying all of my contributions my balance remains exactly the same.
No balance growth except what i put in like a checking account with no interest rate..


For example my company's and my own contributions have totaled 10k.
After one year of 16% growth on average my account remains at 10k.

Looking at the available spreadsheet for my S&amp;P mutual fund and my remaining 20% bonds and the roughly 1% expense/management fee it remains exactly at the same as the amount I have added.
It's almost like they have done the math only at the initial buy in price for every contribution.. a dollar for a dollar without growing with the increase in the mutual funds price.

With how well the funds have done why has it not grown at all? 
Is this some kind of web page error or are my gains being funneled into another account assuming the worst?

My Roth IRA which I have control over reflects it's gains clearly..

Is it possible my company is taking my 401k's gains? I have heard that they have done similar things in the past.

Just in case the fund is iShares S&amp;P 500 Index Fund - Class A BSPAX
Which has done very well!

personalfinance,GAP coverage talking points,"Hi all,

I recently took my car in to get looked at after veering off the road and hitting a ditch. Long story short, my claims appraiser came back to say the car was a total loss. I was smart enough to opt for GAP Plus through my bank at the time I took out the auto loan, and from my understanding; they will cover the remaining balance on the vehicle and give an additional $1000 down towards another vehicle if I take out another loan within 120 days of settling. 

This is my first instance with insurance dealings and all the aforementioned information. 

My main questions are things like -
Would I be able to buy back the totaled car? I've been driving it around since the incident a few months ago. Nothing mechanically wrong with it!

I also took out a loan for the deductible that my insurance company set for $1000 for the repairs. The car is totaled and they won't fix it, so I effectively have a small loan now and surplus of $1200. Would I be better off paying that back immediately so I don't get stuck with the 16% interest rate (1yr loan, but have great credit already) or better to use that and put it towards another car? Some used vehicle around the $2000 mark at that point maybe and effectively have a ~$120 car payment every month which equates to my personal loan amount of $1200?

Any help and insight with this GAP and loan deal is greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time!",finance

I recently got a stable job with a 20k salary, first time holding a job for a full year and therefore my yearly income has become much greater than it was before. I was hovering around 12-14k before.

I recently went through the filing process(not submitted), using TurboTax with my 2017 tax data on hand. I made roughly $20k this year, and according to my w2 $510 federal tax was witheld.

I'm single, no kids and do not own a house or pay mortgage. I claimed 0 on my w-4. Standard Deduction is $6,650.00. At this point I owe about $400 in taxes.

I had no healthcare coverage for 2017, with a $57 penalty for each month coming to about $684 in penalty. This makes the final balance DUE $1068.

I get why I owe $684. I'm a 23 year old homebody who does no vices and eats healthy, and also has 0 credit due to never owning a line of credit. this makes getting healthcare coverage through the marketplace impossible due to credit bureaus having no record of me.

Why is it that i owe the $408 before the healthcare penalty? Did I file wrong? Am I in a higher tax bracket? What can I do to ensure that I do not owe on my taxes(besides getting healthcare) next year?",finance
personalfinance,[Taxes] How did this happen? Laughably small tax return,"Please delete this thread if not allowed.

So I'm a bit upset about the amount my tax return is showing: $50. I used TurboTax.

I made a gross income of ~$17,500 in 2017, which is about $1,500 more than I made in 2016. I had ~4.4% of my income withheld for federal income tax. I paid student loan interest all year, I got a health care subsidy which I owed $90 on (otherwise, my tax return would be $140).

I'm aware that there are thin thresholds for various things, a $100 can change what kind of health care you can get, for example and from experience. I didn't move into a new income bracket however.

My friend says she knows people who are getting small returns and that this is due to the Tax Bill that was passed. But I have no clue myself and if I could get a concrete answer, I'd appreciate it. It just doesn't make sense for me to have my whole tax return swallowed up when I make so little and own no assets.

Thanks to Jahendrix for revising into more legal wording. Can't thank this reddit user enough. I love the internet. 

Jahendrix version: 

This petition, which is digitally signed by lawful residents and citizens of the United States who currently invest in or may invest in digital currency (""cryptocurrency"") is directed towards the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Treasury. The purpose of this petition is to express concern regarding the potential taxation of the cryptocurrency market as laws and regulations in this area develop. Considering the fast-paced and fluid nature of cryptocurrency price changes and trading, both investors and regulatory agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service have an interest in simplifying the taxation of cryptocurrency. Therefore, we would like to propose that only the exchange from cryptocurrency to cash or cash receivables be considered a realization event for federal tax purposes, not taxed in-between cryptocurrency trades, and a tax exemption for transactions under $600, as proposed in, ""Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act Of 2017"", introduced by Rep. Jared Polis(D-Co), and Rep. David Schweikert (R-Az). These proposals will allow the Internal Revenue Service to more easily regulate the trading and taxation of cryptocurrency, and would allow taxpayers to simplify the means by which they report gains and losses from investing and trading activities. An additional concern for most taxpayers in this area is ensuring that any statutory or regulatory law implemented be made clear, simple and streamlined to minimize the likelihood of taxpayer mistakes in reporting and remitting cryptocurrency-related tax. The following signatures represent lawful residents and citizens who have expressed their consent to this proposal and their desire for the implementation of laws and regulations in accordance with the principles espoused herein.

personalfinance,"Line of Credit to Pay off Private Student Loans, good/bad idea?","I graduated college with about $32k in private student loans with varying interest rates and then got them consolidated and refinanced and paid it down to about $21k in one year. My current plan is a 10 year repayment term at I believe it's 9% interest.

My parents own their house and mom brought up getting a line of credit. I'm not super familiar with line of credit my understanding is that it works somewhat the same as having a credit line on your credit card. If you use it you gotta pay it back, but there's interest of course. Mom said we could use it to pay off my loans and and that interest would be around 4% and I would just pay my parents monthly for whatever the repayment amount is on the line of credit. Her whole point was that I would be paying at a lower interest rate.

If I continue to make the minimum payment now I know my loans will be paid off within 5-6 years. I was aggressive year 1 which helped immensely, but I'm planning to move out so I've cut down how much I'm paying.

Is this a good/bad idea to use a line of credit to pay off my loans? What are some risks? Is it worth it? Any insight/advice will be much appreciated.

Im asking in this sub because i know that most people here seem to be very reasonable. Its more a career advice than it is financial.

My current position is in project management. I spend 10% outside on construction sites. The job itself if sometime quite stressful and demands a lot of time. I am now offered two new jobs which makes it hard for me to decide.
My background: Early 30 - M.Sc. Engineering-  soon to be father - plan on building a house for my family in the next 2 years - financially stable.
Location: Western Europe


I would see myself as a semi-extrovert person. I do need the contact with many people but i also take stress home with me and think about problems at work at night.


**Job 1:**   
Project Management  
employer: big and well known company  
Stresslevel: High - very high  
Travel: 20-30% within a radius of 200km  
Working hours: 45-50 (flexible schedule with no paid overtime)  
Bonus: Company car + retirement plan  
Salary: 105k€  
Promotion: High chance of getting into higher management  
Task: Managing many big projects with many people and lots of risks and problems  
Working from home: Maybe sometime if necessary  
Commute: 1h one way (car)  
Cutting hours: no chance  
Pro: Contact with many people - high salary - stable career  
Cons: lots of time in office and lots of work - long commute - lots of stress and responsibility  


**Job 2:**   
Technical Expert for federal government  
employer: government - European state  
Stresslevel: low to very-low  
Travel: 0%  
working hours: official 40 but mostly less (35) - flexible working hours  
Bonus: retirement plan + other bonuses  
Salary: 70k€ and rising to 100k€ after about 4-5 years  
Promotion: Nearly no chance of promotion  
Task: Checking technical document and writing technical reports  
Working from home: Regularly up to 4 days/week  
Commute: 1h one way (train)  
Cutting hours: I could easily reduce to 60% or 80% if needed  
Pro: Very relaxed and quiet job - no stress - i can work where and when i want - chance to work less at home (no time monitoring)  
Cons: Very isolated and maybe sometime monotonous task - working from home means no contact with colleagues  

  
All employers offer 30 days of vacation and have nearly zero chance of lay-offs in the next years.
  
I know that job 2 would be perfect for starting a family, buying/building a house i a more remote area. Im just afraid the work could be to monotonous and after working in isolation for too long i become an introvert hermit.
I could spend time in the office with colleagues but the main purpose of this job is to work from home and not having to travel the 1h to work.

personalfinance,(UK) Advice needed - Payday loan affordability claim - need some solicitor/experienced person's advice!,"Hello all! 

After finally breaking a cycle of 5+ years of payday loan abuse (we are talking totals in the tens of thousands here across multiple vendors) i've begun an affordability claim with a no-win-no-fee solicitors against three of five Payday loan companies that have plagued my existence. 

If you're not aware, the purpose is to submit a claim for refund of all interest and additional fees paid on every loan on the basis that their poor affordability checking coupled with insane interest rates allowed my situation to 'snowball', causing me (and again allowing me) to take out bigger loans to pay of the last ones. This is a clear trend visible across borrowing history (and believe me, mine is extensive)

I want to take action against the other 2 companies also and preferably would like to do it direct without involving a solicitor (who typically takes 30%).

personalfinance,Can I file a late 2016 K-1 online anywhere?,"I just got my 2016 K-1 and I don’t want to necessarily have to go anywhere to file it “late”

I am having trouble finding the right option online for doing this 

Also, I have W2s and a K-1 for 2017, best place to file for these? I’m assuming the same answer for both questions 

Edit: using TurboTax’s desktop software I found where I can amend 2016 and add the K-1. For anyone interested, it was under Federal Taxes &gt; Federal Review &gt; “No I have something to enter” something being “tax forms or papers”

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Debating whether to sell or rent my house when I move,"So here's my situation PF. I am finishing up grad school, and while I've been here I opted to buy rather than rent. I knew I'd be here for at least 5 years, and while the benefits of owning vs renting financially tend to be a wash at that range, there were other factors (no rentals in this city allow you to have 1 dog and 1 cat simultaneously). Anyway, I have an interest rate of 3.5% on the mortgage, have about 45 % of the principle paid at this point. Based on Zillow estimates, the current estimated value tracks with a 4.3-5% value growth over the years I've owned it. Values fluctuate regularly, so I reported a range rather than a specific ROI. All told, the money invested in this place has slightly outpaced inflation when you match value growth against the interest on the mortgage and property taxes.

The mortgage is the only debt my wife and I carry (all credit cards are paid off monthly, and we have no student loans or car loans). We plan to move when I finish school to wherever I get a job. We also plan to rent for the first year or so after moving until we decide where we want to have our next house. Based on rent in similar locations and floor space, I could make $500-700 per month above my costs on the unit (not including anticipated infrequent replacement of appliances as they wear out, repairs, and legal costs to run an LLC).

So my question is this: Would it be wiser to sell the house when we move, and put most of the proceeds (~$50k after selling costs) into diversified investments (ETFs and Bonds) or to keep as a rental property? In one sense the property adds a lot of diversity to my portfolio, which otherwise consists of total US ETFs, total international ETFs, and Bonds.",finance
personalfinance,"Active Duty, LES shows that my fed taxes status has been single for years. Do I need to do anything with our past taxes or just file correct W-4 for here on out?","I've been married since 2009, I've never really noticed that my federal taxes status on my LES is still showing ""single"" and we've been filing ""Married filing jointly"" since 2010. We even had our son in 2015 but I feel that I'm missing out on something. What should I do about my past tax returns? I'm going to talk to finance about changing the status with a W-4 but just wondering if there is anything I should be worried about if I was audited.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: Thanks for the input, everyone. I seems it's nothing big to worry about so I should be good when filing my taxes for this year.",finance
personalfinance,Budgeting Software,"I have 50+ bank investment certificates that yield interest and are used to provide a monthly income for my retired dad. They are spread across each month of the year so that they can provide a steady and near equal monthly income. The thing is some certificates provide interest monthly (12 times per year), some quarterly (4 times per year), and some semiannually (twice per year). To complicate things further, the interest is added to his debit card account on the next day of the certificate issue date, and those 50+ certificates are not issued on the same day so it varies each month.  
  
Is there some sort of budgeting software where I can enter the details of all those certificates (value, interest rate, interest duration, issue date, interest due date) and then it would produce the monthly income preferably spread across a calendar format indicating each day money is deposited to his account.  
  
Example:  
Certificate 1: Value (10,000 pound) - Interest Rate (10%) - Interest Duration (Quarterly) - Issue Date (7th of Jan)  
So this should mean that on the 8th of January, the 8th of April, the 8th of July, and the 8th of October each year his account should get an interest deposit of 250 pounds (annual interest of 1000 spread on 4 payments).  
  
Edit: I'm based in Egypt.",finance
personalfinance,"Alliant, Lake Michigan or Digital Credit Union for my primary checking &amp; savings acc.?","CO-OP Shared Branch is a MUST cuz I travel + better interest rate on either checking or savings to stash my E-fund+ better customer service. I found these three that met my criteria’s (Alliant probably don’t have CO-OP option). My final option is going with a local C.U., but they have shitty interest rate and service from what I’ve seen. My next bet would be something like Chase, BB&amp;T or other brick and mortar banks, but I’d rather go with a CU. If you are using any of the above could you please share your experience? That’d be really helpful. Or maybe suggest a different one. Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Switching to an online bank?,"I'm thinking about switching to ally bank or another online bank account with high interest rates. I currently bank with a local credit union (bethpage federal credit union) which I have had only pleasant experiences with. If I open up an online bank account how Would I transfer money back and forth? Is there a risk to transferring money? Like can the money get ""lost""? Is it worth it if my savings account will probably only have less then 1000 for the next couple years?",finance
economy,One of the arguments for raising interest rates is that we need rates high enough that they can be cut when the next recession comes.,,finance
personalfinance,Looking for spreadsheet to calculate payroll tax,"I am looking for a spreadsheet that will calculate Federal, State (NY), and Local (New York City) bi-weekly payroll. The spreadsheet should take gross pay, all relevant assumptions from the IRS W-4 form, 401k contributions, etc. and calculate net pay.

Note I am not looking for just a calculator that will perform the calculation--I am looking for a spreadsheet that includes the calculation logic. Ideally, I'd like to be able to perfectly replicate the calculations done by firms like ADP.

Does anyone have anything like this?",finance
btc,"Walked into Regions to open checking account, they suggested I don’t if it has to do with bitcoin",Desk slave said “we were told any use having to do with bitcoin was against their terms and conditions because it isn’t federally regulated”,cryptocurrency
personalfinance,High interest savings/money market accounts. Need opinions/recommendations,"So, I'm looking at transferring my savings from a big bank to one with higher interest. After years of working low paying jobs, I finally have one that gives me enough that I can throw money into my savings. Trouble is, I'm getting just .01% APY. 

Looking online, I see multiple offering rates as high as 1.4-1.55%. Still not a lot, but significantly better than my terrible rate. 

The standouts seem to be Barclay, CIT, Ally, Marcus (by Goldman Sachs) and Discover. 

I don't need incredibly simple access to my cash, like mobile apps or anything. I just need a place to park my cash, let the interest roll in, and be easily able to move money into it. I'm trying to save enough to put a decent down payment on a house/car whenever I'd like, or save for retirement. 

Reviews are sparse on the sites I've been to. Any insight you guys have would be great. 

Edit: After all the research (and yes, I've been researching this on and off for months. This wasn't a hasty decision), I've gone with Discover. 

The interest rate is slightly lower than CIT/Barclay (1.4, compared to 1.5% at barclay). But I do like that most, if not all of their support seems to be based in the US. They have all the tech I need (FaceID/ApplePay, for when I get a checking account), no fees except for transfers, no minimum balances, and their ATM network is actually crazy. There's tons of em near me. Only drawback seems to be that you cannot deposit cash at ATMs. Which shouldn't affect me since I rarely have cash on me.",finance
personalfinance,"I'll have an auto loan paid off early in October. Or, should I just barely keep it alive?","I have a 60 month auto loan that I took out in May 2016 that I have been making aggressive payments on since, as the interest rate is high enough (6.15%) that I get more relief from paying it down fast.  I will be able to pay it off in full this October, perhaps by September.

For credit purposes, should I close out the account when that time comes?  Or, would it be better to leave a small balance on it for the remainder of the loan period, so that my average account age continues to increase?  The loan is through Ally, and there are no early payment fees and I would be ""paid ahead"", meaning Ally would need to receive a payment by a pushed off date, so I can go several months, even years, without making another payment.",finance
Forex,"Market report 1/25/18: JPY, MXN","Yesterday was a good day to short the USD. I had issues with my trade execution I need to correct, but I've got some decent positions backed by break-even SLs that I'm hoping will bear fruit going forward. The big thing I learned was the power of waiting for news. During news it's important to make bigger plays rather than small ones. For some reason, I had that backwards! :-P

I'm still short USD, but I'm not convinced it's time to double-down yet. I'm expecting at least some consolidation before having to make a decision. I don't want to ruin my positions by adding now only to be stopped out because price reached the average of my two entries.

Today there was some negative news out of Mexico. Minor reports, but sales data is down. I'm expecting Mexico to fall off given the reports of crime coming out of there. No one I know here in the US wants to vacation there. That has to hurt their bottom line, so I'm long USDMXN for a very small play against the recent low 18.3 established 6am PST. If my broker offered anything other than USD against MXN I would take it. I tried to short USDMXN before and got burned, so like I say, very minor play here, especially considering the negative carry trade.

3:30pm PST today is the JPY announcement. No change in interest rates or core CPI are forecast. YoY inflation is projected higher, but MoM is lower. Overall it appears to be a non-event, other than it could perhaps project USDJPY lower.

I of course had a USDJPY position yesterday, but I got stopped out. Later in the day I [took a contrarian position to one of our forum members](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/7squlh/eurnzd_spiked_up_over_200_pips_in_just_a_minute/) and went short NZDJPY. It was an accident, on reflection AUDNZD was probably a better play. But now I have short NZDJPY and am also in a long EURJPY from before. I'm confident in my SL in both of these and don't anticipate the BoJ announcement is going to have an affect on these trades.

Instead what I'd like to do is watch closely how USDJPY reacts to the announcement. Whichever way it goes that's how I'm going to play it, with a SL above or below the 4-hour candle (since the announcement is at the start of a new daily).",finance

personalfinance,Contributing to a Roth IRA while working overseas,"I was recently told told that there is a loophole that allows you to contribute to a Roth IRA even if you don't qualify.

For example, if you are single and make more than $135,000, you can still contribute to a regular IRA and then roll it over into a Roth.

Personally, I don't make nearly that much, but I worked overseas for all of 2017 and and didn't have to pay federal taxes by way of the foreign-earned income exclusion. My understanding is that this disqualifies me from making a contribution to my Roth, however I'm wondering if I could use the same loophole.

To take a step back, I don't understand how this loophole exists and why it hasn't already been closed. Why even prevent high-income earners from contributing if they can get around it so easily?

personalfinance,College Student: Is Having Two Credit Cards Ok?,"Hello PF!

I'll try and keep it short **(I failed, TL;DR at the bottom)**. I've had my current CC with Discover for almost one year. My experience with Discover has been entirely positive! The card I have (Discover IT) has pretty great rolling quarterly rewards at 5% cashback, and pretty soon (a few weeks I think) they'll match all of my garnered cashback as a one year bonus. This effectively doubles what my cashback by % will have been for the last year, making the 5% I got back on gas purchases one quarter really more like 10%, etc.

After this year however, I see the value of the card declining. Without the match at the end of the year effectively doubling my cashback, I'll just have the quarterly 5% which is dependent upon my spending habits, and 1% cashback on everything else. I also have recently gotten a bit weary of larger banks in general, and have an urge to try and give my business to community conscious credit unions. 

Looking into my local credit union, they offer one card that stands out in particular. It's a Cash Rewards American Express card that has zero annual fees, 3% cash back on gas, 2% on grocery stores, and 1% on everything else. 

I'm a pretty budget conscious college student, so the zero fees is hugely important to me for any card/bank I'm with. I calculated the return on just the gas and groceries using my monthly budget, and I would make roughly $90 in cash back through those two applications alone annually.

Considering this, there is a part of me that wants to apply for the card. Zero fee's, and good rewards that I actually will *always* use (I live in a public transport poor city, and I cook at home everyday). 

On the other hand, as a ""poor college student"" there is a part of me that is nervous at the idea of having multiple credit cards. I know having two cards is something that a lot of people end up having eventually, but I can't help but wonder if I'm being overly...ambitious?

**Financial Situation Breakdown:**

* Monthly Income (post tax): ~$1300

* Monthly Savings Contributions: ~$800 *(This is split however between car maintenance savings, textbooks for next year, etc. About $400 goes into a pure Emergency Fund that I never touch.).*

* Amount Spent Monthly on Gas and Grocceries: ~$280-$300

* Rent, Phone billl, Car insurance: None *(live at home, and parents cover the rest).*

**Debt Breakdown:**

* Student Loans: ~$7000 *in subsidized federal loans with 1 year left in school (two if I concurrently start my masters next year and finish the next). This number will likely at least double next year when I time out of a grant my last year.*

* Credit card debt: $0 *I have always payed my card off in full every single month, and I never let the amount I put on my card exceed more than $200-$300 before I pay it off.*

* Fico Credit Score: 720ish. *The only thing negatively impacting my score currently is the length of credit.*

**TL;DR:**

I have had a Discover IT card for 1 year, so I will no longer receive a cash back match from Discover. I feel that the American Express Card offered through my local credit union offers rewards more catered to my spending habits, and I desire to support my local credit union. I have no credit card debt, and have always paid my Discover IT card off in full every month. I am a conscious budgeter, and actively contribute much of my income to savings and an EF.

personalfinance,Grad student need help with budget and paying off debt! Overwhelmed with information,"Hi all,

I just stumbled across this subreddit. Now that it is time for me to plan my career and budget, I am overwhelmed by how I should go about it. I’ll give a brief background about myself, I am a graduate student about to graduate in May 2018. I am coming out with $32,500 in student debt (I go to a state school for both undergrad and grad) and my job will be paying $45,000 salary on a bi-weekly basis. I don’t live in the same area as my parents so I wouldn’t be able to live there until I pay off my debt. I will live with my girlfriend as she will be going to college. My first priority is to pay off my debt. My parents offered to pay off all my debt so that they don’t accumulate interest payment. Should I take that then just repay them? I am a first generation college student so I don't want to take their retirement money because I don't talk to my parents about what money they have.

I separated my student debt into 3 categories: 

* Total Direct Stafford Unsubsized (6% Fixed) = $13,000
* Total Direct Stafford Subsidized (3.76%, 4.29%, 4.66%) = $14,500
* Total Federal Perkins (5%)= $5,000

After reading this forum over time, I also want to take the advice to save 10% into my 401K offered by my employer:

“For 2018, the Company will be matching 100% of the first 3% of each Participant’s deferral contributions to the Plan, plus 50% of the next 3% of deferral contributions. A participant must contribute at least 6% to receive the maximum employer match of 4.5%”

I also estimated my rent to be around $500 - $750. I feel completely overwhelmed and would really appreciate your help.

personalfinance,My SO lives at home and has somehow been increasing her CC debt,"Short story:

SO graduated 3 years ago, has an entry level job that is low paying - around $15/hr 30-40hr/week. Somehow has been getting further into debt despite no rent or car payments. 

Long:

A few years ago she told me she had about 5-6k in CC debt. We sat down and mapped out a budget and I showed her she can really pay it off soon. Both cards were about maxed out. I taught her a little about interest etc. they were really high - mid 20s?

She payed off one, right before going on a vacation out of state with a friend. By chance the CC company noticed she paid it off (I'm guessing) and sent her blank checks and a new card and a new limit. 

So she wrote herself a check for $500 for the trip. Fast forward to now, with the limit increases it's up to 10k total debt. 

All while paying no rent, no car payment, etc. 

The thing is she isn't wildly spending as far as I can tell. Just here and there she made a few $100 mistakes but besides that she's not buying clothes all the time or going out every night or anything. I am curious where the money goes but obviously I don't want her to resent me for getting in the middle of this. 

Any advice? I'm thinking it may be more of a behavior problem and might suggest therapy?

Btw, I've already showed her Dave Ramsey, she had the book and has been reading it. A while ago I started a new job which offered Dave Ramsey's budget software. I asked her if she wanted to use it, but she got fed up with the pre-questionnaire and gave up :/",finance
CryptoCurrency,History Tends to Repeat Itself: Using the Dot Com Bubble as Your Guide to Investing in Crypto.,"""History repeats itself. So you might wanna pay attention.""  - Quavo


**Disclaimer**

The huge wall of text you are about to read was written by a non college educated, middle aged white man, with bad credit and a wild fucking imagination.  I'm not exactly someone you should be taking financial advice from. If you operate under the assumption that this post along with every other post your read on Reddit is potential propaganda you will be better off.  The bottom line is don't trust me or anyone here.... DO YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH.

**Lets Move On Shall We?**

Back in 2001 I was a 24 year old know it all.  I had it all figured out.  The internet age was upon us and opportunities seemed endless.  By 2001 we were knee deep and unbeknownst to me near the tail end of the Dot Com Bubble.  During this time it was impossible to escape the dot com hype.  Turn on the TV, pick up a newspaper, or listening to the talking heads on the radio it was all the same. EVERYONE was talking about the insane amounts of money being made on Dot Com Companies. That year I'm doing pretty well for myself and decided to open an ETRADE account so i could get into the game.  I deposited $5000 and proceeded to buy stock in stalwarts like Pets.com, DrKoop and WebVan.  These purchasing decisions were in large part made because these COOL FUCKING COMPANIES had ads during the Super Bowl. To make a long story less long I lost 90% of my money within 6 months. 

Looking back now it's clear to me why I lost my money and learning from my past mistakes I'm here to share what I learned.

**What Went Wrong?**

For starters my choice in investments was dictated by GREED &amp; HYPE not actual research..... BIG NO NO.  17 Years later I decided to try my hand at Crypto and after my first big win (XRB at $2.2) I found myself making the same mistakes I made back in 2001.  That's when it hit me.  I needed to study the Dot Com Bubble and use it as my guide moving forward.

**What Did I Learn**

For starters I studied the top 100 websites from 1999 ([HERE](https://random.waxy.org/text/pov_top_websites_1999.pdf)) and looked through who was still around who was gone and who was ahead of their time but failed.  That is when the bells in my head starting going off.

1.  Having a good idea or revolutionary product isn't enough..... If it was WebVan would still be in business (I know most of you dont remember WebVan but basically they delivered groceries on demand think Amazon Prime/Fresh.)
2. Many of the Dot Com Bubble businesses were built on theory, buzz and hype. Very few were built on fundamentals. 
3. Those that did rise from the ashes did so because they had amazing leadership teams and were able to transition business models to meet current market demands.

With this newfound knowledge I began a purge of my portfolio and transitioned from shit coins to hopefully less shitty coins.

**Finding the Phoenix in Crypto** 

With the new foundation laid out I began looking for the following.

1. Looked at the industries that are prime for disruption. Industries or companies that will be effected most by decentralization.  More on this later.

2. Companies that have a platform technology. If 2017 was the year of the coin 2018 and beyond will be the years of the Token. It could be a social network, could be a software service operating in the cloud. 

3. Companies with a strong team and advisors.

4. Companies that have a viable product already (The product itself isn't all that important because remember in order to rise from the ashes these companies will have to pivot..... That is were the strong team comes in).

**Industries Prime for Total Disruption**

1. **Financial &amp; Banking**

  For fucks sake the entire purpose of Satoshi's whitepaper was to disrupt this industry. Occupy Wall Street seems like it was many moons ago but the ethos of the movement is still alive today.  Bottom line is banks, bankers, federal reserve, hedge fund managers etc are in the scope and ready to be taken out.

2. **Education**
Truth be told I don't know much about higher education in other countries but I do know in America higher education is fucked.  It's expensive, semi exclusive, too fucking long and more often than not graduating students have trouble finding jobs and when they do they work 5-10 years to pay off their student loans.  Another industry in the crosshairs.

3. **The Entire FUCKING Internet As We Know It**
I was someone who was hoping and praying Net Neutrality would be reversed because doing so IMO would speed up the process of ushering in a new decentralized internet.  On top of that companies like Google can no longer be trusted.  If there is ANYTHING in this world besides family worth fighting for it's a free and transparent internet.  

I have highlighted a few different industries but for me the above 3 were most important.  It's up to you to determine what is important to you.

**Where I Landed and Who I'm Banking On** 

Here is where I take you down to shill city..... LOL. JK or Am I?

**Financial**

1. **MakerDAO (MKR)** [Website](https://makerdao.com/)

HOLY FUCK!  IMO this is the mother of ALL investments.  AMAZING TEAM, Real WORKING product, and vision for the future.  I'm truly not smart enough to explain MKR but if you believe there is a TRUE need for a Asset backed StableCoin and you would like to leverage your current assets to buy more assets then look no further.  

2. **MelonPort (MLN)** 

Fuck Wall Street Right? Hedge Funds are a 7 TRILLION dollar industry and MLN is a true sleeping giant.

3. **D-Corp (DCRP)**

Peer funding Venture Capital Firm.

**Numeraire** 

* **Education** 

**BitDegree (BDG):** [Website](https://www.bitdegree.org/en/token)

MarketCap: 70Mil

BDG has a strong team, a platform in beta and a models that completely disrupts education as we know it.  Businesses like Coursera, Udemy and Udacity all have current valuations between 700 million and 1.5 Billion.  This one was easy.

* **Decentralized Internet**

Not gonna give descriptions of these companies because I'm tired and there are too many.

No Particular Order

1.  Neo

2. Ethereum

3. EOS

4. Nebulas

5. Gnosis

personalfinance,Help! I'm a 24 year old dependent living alone and having trouble with bills due to a transition period. I have CC debt and am looking for advice!,"Hello, I am a 24 year old male who is currently struggling with my finances. I have always been on top of my spending growing up and two years ago when I left my parent’s basement in search of a better life for myself I had great credit (750), due to my father making me get a credit card at an early age and only using it for small manageable purchases. I also had an average full-time job making around 40k plus commissions per year. I am single and have no dependents so I was able to save roughly 10k before I moved out. The move went smooth and the rent and utilities were manageable around $800/mo but I never calculated the costs of living like a food budget, furniture, clothing, city tax, cable/wifi, etc. At first it wasn’t too bad and I was able to lease a new car for $300/mo on $1000 down to replace a broken down lunker which seems high and unnecessary but again all I was doing was working and had very limited, cheap hobbies. At first it was manageable and I wasn’t struggling to survive, but problems arose quickly. After 3 years with the company I worked for it became clear that there was no room for me to grow inside the company and talk of a raise was simply off the table for my position. My only option was to continue this low level sales gig for the rest of my life to merely pay the bills and exist. So I took a leap of faith and decided to go back to school and further my education (still incomplete) and to achieve something greater for myself by myself. Unfortunately I had made some decisions like leasing a damn car and moving into my own apartment before realizing I wanted to do bigger and better things with my life. So I got a job bartending at a seasonal beer garden which was quite lucrative for what it sounds $300-550 cash a week and also coupled it with some part time dog walking for around $150-250 a week. This was ok at first and again helped with the bills and staying afloat and also able to work around a part-time student schedule, but I was not saving anything and the inconsistency of the pay was hard to budget with, especially with the car payment and school now too. Then things got a lot worse… The beer garden gig was seasonal and once October hit that money dried up quick, and walking dogs in the winter is twice as tough and not nearly as profitable. I knew I had to get a new job and had a restaurant gig lined up but it turned out to be a dud and was not profitable so I bounced around from one restaurant to the next not cutting it close to what I needed, I also took an overnight shift at FedEx ground to try and help compensate but the off-schedule hours and rigorous workload took a quick toll on my body and didn’t leave me with enough energy to maintain good grades and work another part-time job. I had to rely on Credit Cards and cash advances with high interest rates to get me through for the first few months along with the small income from my server gig and some part-time dog walking. I quickly racked up debt and had to make more than a few payments late which caused me to get hit with penalty interest rates and late fees galore. I am now sitting in around 17k worth of CC debt that I can’t make payments on and still maintain an account with my community college’s bursar’s office, I can’t get any credits until I pay. I work at a brewery making $200-500 a week and do any kind of extra shift work I can wherever I can get it but it is so inconsistent. I eat mostly all of my meals at work because I no longer have a food budget, I owe my school almost $750 and my credit score has dropped to a measly 490 in a matter of three months, I worked my life to maintain a good credit score. I know I have to get rid of my car lease somehow and start to work down that CC debt but the collection calls are mounting and there are only so many hours in a day to work and go to school. I guess what I’m asking is how do I get out of this on top and avoid serious depression and please understand I am a hard-working no BS work ethic kind of guy. I am willing to work my ass off and know that nothing in life comes easy but how was it so easy to lose sight of my financial security? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and if anyone has found themselves in this situation before please point me to the silver lining, I am only 24 and know that I am better than this and can achieve greater things than where I am at.

I have always filed my taxes myself using TurboTax. I take the standard deduction and only have one source of income. I'm single, I don't own a home and I have no dependents. It's a simple life. 


This year I made more money than I ever have. I was filing my taxes and my estimated federal refund was $30 and my state was $120.


I brought this up with some friends. Immediately, everyone began insisting I hire an accountant. They say I will get more money back and that it will be worth it. These are all freelancers with many sources of employment and many business related write offs. I think we are in very different tax situations so we will have very different returns, but my friends are adamant I hire someone. 

I live in New York City, I made about $52,000. I have a 403(b) retirement plan that I only contributed $1200 to. I have stocks I didn't touch, a RothIRA I didn't touch or contribute to and no major life events in 2017. 


Am I wrong to think even an accountant couldn't get me a lot of money? Will they magically pull deductions and write offs out of the air? Should I listen to my friends and hire someone? 


PS I want to say I understand a low refund isn't a bad thing - I'd rather not lend the government an interest free loan. I am just second guessing myself after talking to the buddies.

Thanks everyone!

EDIT: Used ""return"" instead of ""refund"" - thanks u/Jmb3930

**UPDATE: Got some good advice, I will not waste any money on an accountant and take my refund as is.

personalfinance,Breaking a Cardinal Rule of Saving,"PF, I need your help. I am about to break a cardinal rule of saving and need your advice on whether this is a bonehead move.  My MIL passed away over the holidays and we are receiving a very small estate that will be split between my wife and her brother. The smart thing to do is to save that money. I currently have a Roth 401k through work that is not maxed out so that would seem the best place to start.  What I want to do with the money is to pay off both of our cars (one at 0% and one at 0.9% interest).  I know what you are thinking. What a stupid move, that is free money you idiot. Start saving it and make more money with that money.  The reason I am looking at paying the cars off even if there is essentially no interest on it is that it takes up a huge chunk of my income. I know, this was a mistake but I can't do anything about it now. The cars take up approximately 18% of the income I bring home.  My plan was to pay off the cars and then take all the money I was putting towards the cars and put about 80% into my 401k and 20% to pay down some student loans (~3% interest rate).  I feel like this will give me some more economic freedom of freeing up more income if money every gets tight. Tell me why this is a bad move.  Appreciate the help!

Edit: I'm adding some clarification for some of the comments made. 1) I am paying both of our cars off so I'm not just paying off my things. 2) We are married so it is our money. I do agree that she needs to be in agreement with what we are going to do with the money but that is why I'm asking advice as we are both confused on the best path.",finance

personalfinance,Newly Married in 2017 - Returns are MUCH lower,"My wife and I were married last October, so we are filing jointly for the 2017 tax season. We have lived together for several years and I have done taxes for both of us, always filing individually before now. She makes roughly $20k and I make roughly $40k. Federal returns for the 2016 tax year were around $1300 for her and $1900 for me. Now that our filing status is married filing jointly, our collective returns are calculated at $1400. 

We use Turbo Tax, and our W4 withholdings have not changed during 2017. I believe we may have entered a higher tax bracket as we are filing our income together now, but I wanted to see what the wonderful folks of /r/personalfinance had to say about it before we filed and sucked up the less-than-expected return. 

Any advice or questions are warmly welcomed, and I thank you for taking the time to read my inquiry. 

UPDATE: One of the users here suggested I re-run our taxes individually to see if I could decipher where the deficit came from. I did this, and I found the culprit.

My wife is a bank teller. In late 2017, her bank merged with another bank. So we have two W2s for her; the first has most of her income for the year ~$20k the second only has ~$3k from after the merge. Upon entering the first W2, the refund looks great and around what she was expecting. BUT, when entering the second W2.. it drops the Federal and State refund tremendously. In fact, it drops by about the amount that we are missing when filing jointly. What could be causing this?

UPDATE 2: I believe I found what was causing it. Out of the ~$3k wages on her second W2, she only paid $140 in federal taxes. Something must have changed with her W4s after the merge took place to where she has paid hardly any taxes, therefore we owe a decent chunk.

FINAL UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your responses. I finally figured out the mystery, this thread is now closed.",finance

personalfinance,"ICU nurse with 1 year of experience. $65,000 in student loans.","Hi Reddit friends!

I’m in a time in my life where major changes are about to occur, and I need some help navigating. My parents have not been in my predicament and can offer little help in counseling.

I am a new nurse with 1 year of ICU experience and close to $65,000 in student loans. Half are federal and half are private through Sallie Mae (I plan to reconsolidate shortly for a better interest rate). 

My original plan was to move to Anchorage, Alaska and work in an Indian Health Hospital. The website for this hospital advertises tuition and loan reimbursement up to $40,000 for a two year commitment. I figured I would garner necessary ICU experience while working in Alaska for two years, which would give me the confidence to travel nurse afterwards. Also, by the time I felt ready and eligible to travel nurse, I will have already paid a large portion of my debt! Alaska also seemed to pay nurses well. It seemed full proof.

This week my plans started to crumble a bit. 

I found this website which adjusts nursing salaries in metro areas for costs of living.
http://nursingonpoint.com/salaries/rn-salaries-by-major-metro-area/metro-areas-cost-of-living-adjusted-spreadsheet/

Other nurses told me that nurses are paid very well in Alaska. The website shows nurses come about average in Anchorage and well below average in Juneau and Fairbanks. Makes sense since everything in Alaska has to be shipped to, well, Alaska. 
Also, my hopes of a tuition reimbursement are also growing dim. The major hospital in the area doesn’t award the money, the government does. Funds are limited and some years folks don’t receive the money. Not to mention it’s based (the nursing recruiter told me) how long you’ve lived there, and the score of the facility according to the Indian Health Services. It is still possible I could receive the tuition help but definitely not guaranteed. 

The website also shows that California, surprisingly, can provide a good standard of living for nurses. It holds the majority of the top 10 spots for nurses salaries adjusted for cost of living. 

My concerns/questions:
1)	Would I be better off in Alaska or the West Coast (or just anywhere on the map that offers a good standard of living and trying to budget and pay off my loans)?
2)	Does anybody have any experience or ideas about working for Indian Health Services facilities? Is it a good option?
3)	Ideas for paying off loans as a nurse?
4)	Any ideas? I just want to gain experience as an ICU nurse, enjoy my life, and do a good job paying off my debt. Is it impossible to do all three?


I love the idea of living in Alaska. Anchorage still handles like a city but wilderness is right at the doorstep. I could gain good experience nursing, work with a cultural entirely different than my own, and “restart” so to speak. But it might not be a financially smart move. 
It seems so difficult to navigate the Indian Health Services website and find opportunities to find work in Alaska or the Lower 48. I don’t really know how to find these employment opportunities or their specific details.

Any help would be much appreciated!",finance

&gt; In recent years, all major countries and regional central banks and monetary authorities have conducted research on the issuance of central bank digital currencies. The Singapore Central Bank and the Swedish Central Bank have already started relevant experiments. The People's Bank of China is also organizing active exploration and research. This article puts forward some reflections on the distribution arrangements of China's central bank's digital currency.

&gt; Fan Yifei, Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China

&gt; I. The Chinese central bank’s digital currency should adopt a two-tiered delivery system

&gt; Large countries issuing central bank digital currencies is a complex system project. China has a vast area and a large population. The economic development, resource endowments, and education level of the population vary widely from region to region. In designing and launching (distribution) and distributing central bank digital currencies, we must fully consider the diversity of system and system design. And complexity. For example, it is necessary to consider the use of remote areas with insufficient network coverage. If one-tier delivery is used, it will be faced with the greatest test of the above factors. In order to increase the convenience and service availability of the central bank’s digital currency and enhance public willingness to use, two-tier placements may be considered to address these difficulties.

&gt; ""Two-tier delivery"" is conducive to making full use of the existing resources, talents, and technology of commercial organizations, and promoting market-driven, promoting innovation and competitive selection. The IT infrastructure application and service system of institutions such as commercial banks are relatively mature, and their processing capabilities are relatively strong. They have accumulated certain experience in the application of financial science and technology and have ample talent pools. Therefore, besides the existing infrastructure, human resources, and mature applications and service systems of commercial banks, the start-up and repeated construction of the commercial banks is a huge waste of social resources. Under the premise of safety and reliability, the central bank and commercial banks and other institutions can work closely together without presupposing a technical route, fully mobilize market forces, achieve system optimization through competition, and jointly develop and operate together. This is not only conducive to the integration of resources, exerting synergy, but also conducive to promoting innovation. Moreover, the general public has become accustomed to handling financial services through commercial institutions such as banks, and double-dealing also helps increase public acceptance of the central bank’s digital currency.

&gt; ""Two-tier delivery"" helps to diversify risk. In the course of the development of the interbank payment settlement system in the past, the central bank has accumulated a wealth of experience, but the inter-bank clearing and payment system is a direct service to financial institutions. The central bank's digital currency is directly serving the public and involves millions of households. If only relying on the strength of the central bank to carry out research and development, to support such a huge system, it is not easy to meet the goals of safety, efficiency, and stability, but also to meet user experience requirements. At the same time, the central bank is subject to objective constraints such as budget, resources, personnel, and technology. Through the two-tier design, it can avoid over-concentration of risks.

&gt; ""Two-tier delivery"" can avoid ""financial disintermediation."" Under “single-tier placement”, the central bank directly puts digital currency into the public, and the central bank’s digital currency will form a competitive relationship with the deposit currency of commercial banks. Obviously, the central bank’s digital currency, which is endorsed by the central bank, has a higher credit rating than the commercial bank deposit currency. This can have a crowding effect on commercial bank deposits, and may cause “depositing of deposits”, which in turn affects commercial banks’ ability to lend. In addition, the reduction of commercial banks’ ability to absorb deposits will increase their dependence on the interbank market, raise the price of funds, increase social financing costs, and damage the real economy, triggering “financial disintermediation”. In order to maintain its lending capacity and financial stability, the central bank will have to subsidize commercial banks. In extreme circumstances, it will also subvert the existing financial system, and the central bank will have a ""great unification"" situation.

&gt; To sum up, the double-deployment model of “central bank-agent commercial organization” is a choice that not only suits China’s national conditions, but also makes full use of existing resources and mobilizes the enthusiasm of commercial banks. First of all, it does not change the creditor's rights and debt relations of the currency in circulation. In order to ensure that the currency is not surpassed, the agency agencies need to pay 100% of the reserves to the central bank. Therefore, the central bank’s digital currency held by the public is still the debt of the central bank, which is guaranteed by the central bank’s credit and has unlimited indemnity. Secondly, without changing the existing money delivery system and the dual-account structure, it will not constitute competition for the deposit currency of commercial banks, will not increase the dependence of commercial banks on the interbank lending market, and will not affect the ability of commercial banks to lend. It will lead to ""financial disintermediation."" Third, because it does not affect the current monetary policy transmission mechanism, it will not strengthen the pro-cyclical effect in a stressful environment, so it will not have a negative impact on the current mode of operation of the real economy. Finally, this model is more conducive to the advantages of the central bank’s digital currency, saves costs, increases the speed of currency circulation, and improves payment convenience and security. In addition, because of the credit advantages of the central bank's endorsement, it helps to curb the public's demand for privately-encrypted digital currency and consolidate my currency sovereignty.

&gt; Second, under the double-deployment arrangement, China’s central bank’s digital currency should be placed loosely coupled with the account and adhere to a centralized management model.

&gt; In order to maintain the attributes of the central bank’s digital currency and achieve monetary policy and macro-prudential management objectives, China’s central bank’s digital currency double-entry system should be different from the decentralized issuance model of various tokens. First, because the central bank’s digital currency is still the debt of the central bank to the public, and its creditor’s rights and debts relationship does not change with the currency pattern, it is still necessary to ensure the central bank’s central position in the deposit process. Second, it is necessary to ensure and strengthen the central bank's macro-prudential and monetary policy control functions. Third, do not change the dual-account system and keep the original monetary policy transmission method. Fourth, in order to avoid the surrogate agencies from issuing currencies, it is necessary to make arrangements to implement the central bank's tracking and supervision of digital currency placement.

&gt; Therefore, the central bank’s digital currency should adhere to a centralized delivery model. However, the centralized delivery model mentioned here is different from traditional electronic payment tools. The transfer of funds for electronic payment tools must be completed through accounts, using tightly coupled accounts. The central bank’s digital currency should be based on a loosely coupled account, which greatly reduces the reliance on the account in the trading session. In this way, it is as easy to circulate as cash, and it can achieve controlled anonymity. The holders of the digital currency of the central bank can directly apply it to various scenarios, which is conducive to the circulation and internationalization of the renminbi. In addition, if there is no transaction third party anonymous, it will reveal personal information and privacy; but if you allow full third party anonymity, it will facilitate crimes such as tax evasion, terrorist financing and money laundering and other criminal activities. Therefore, in order to achieve a balance, controllable anonymity must be achieved, and transaction data should only be disclosed to the central bank and this third party. Under the loosely-coupled account system, the agency may be required to transmit daily transaction data to the central bank asynchronously, which not only facilitates the central bank's mastery of necessary data to ensure that regulatory objectives such as prudent management and anti-money laundering are achieved, but also reduces the system burden on commercial institutions. .

&gt; Third, China's central bank's digital currency design at this stage should focus on M0 substitution instead of M1 and M2 substitution.

&gt; At this stage, M1 and M2, based on commercial bank accounts, have been digitized or electronic, and there is no need to digitize again with digital currency. Interbank payment settlement systems supporting M1 and M2 circulation (such as large-scale payment systems and online payment inter-bank clearing systems, etc.), commercial bank in-line systems, and non-bank payment institutions' various types of online payment instruments are operating normally and are constantly improving. Upgraded and increasingly efficient, able to meet the needs of China's economic development. Replacing M1 and M2 with the central bank’s digital currency will not only help improve payment efficiency, but will also cause huge waste of existing systems and resources. In contrast, the circulation, printing, withdrawal, and storage of existing banknotes and coins are costly, and the distribution system has many layers. It is inconvenient to carry, is easily forged, and is not controllable anonymously. It is used for money laundering and other illegal activities. The risk of criminal activities and the need for digitalization are increasing day by day. In addition, non-cash payment instruments, such as traditional bank cards and Internet payments, are based on a tightly coupled account model and do not fully satisfy the public’s need for easy-to-use and anonymous payment services. It is impossible to completely replace M0, especially in account services and In areas with poor communications network coverage, people’s dependence on cash is still high. The central bank’s digital currency maintains the attributes and main features of cash, satisfies the need for portability and anonymity, and will be the best tool to replace cash.

&gt; It is precisely because the central bank’s digital currency is a substitute for M0 and should not be charged interest. This will neither trigger ""financial disintermediation"" nor lead to inflationary expectations. Correspondingly, it will not have a big impact on the operation of the existing monetary system, financial system and real economy.

&gt; In the same way, since the central bank’s digital currency is replaced by M0, it should also abide by all existing regulations concerning cash management, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing. In order to cooperate with anti-money laundering and other related work, relevant institutions may be required to report to the central bank on large and suspicious transactions of the central bank’s digital currency. At the same time, in order to guide the central bank’s digital currency to be used in small-sum retail business scenarios without crowding out deposits and to avoid procyclical effects in the context of arbitrage and pressure, it is possible to set daily and annual cumulative transaction limits, and provide for large-scale bookings. exchange. When necessary, it may also be considered to implement a graded charge for the exchange of the central bank's digital currency. For small and low-frequency exchanges, no fees may be charged. For large-value, high-frequency exchanges and transactions, higher fees are charged to increase exchange costs and system frictions. In the case of zero interest rates and lower bounds, this arrangement can also create conditions for the central bank to implement negative interest rate policies.

&gt; Fourth, it should be cautious about loading smart contracts into the central bank’s digital currency.

&gt; According to the definition given by Nick Szabo, smart contracts are a set of commitments defined in digital form, including agreements on which contract participants can execute these commitments. Smart contracts are written in computer-readable code. Once the trigger condition is reached, it is automatically executed by the computer. Can be loaded with time, credit and other preconditions, can also be used in taxation, anti-terrorism financing and other scenarios.


&gt; However, as mentioned above, the central bank’s digital currency is an alternative to M0 and has unlimited indemnity, that is, it assumes the functions of value scale, circulation means, payment means, and value storage. The original banknotes did not carry any other social and administrative functions. The Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Administration of RMB stipulates that it is prohibited to intentionally damage the RMB Therefore, adding extra social or administrative functions to cash bills actually damages the renminbi.

&gt; In order to maintain the legal status of unlimited indemnity, the central bank’s digital currency should not assume other social and administrative functions other than the four functions that money should have. The loading of smart contracts in addition to the functions of the legal tender currency itself will affect its deferral function, and even degrade it into a valuable ticket, which will reduce the free use of the digital currency of the Central Bank of China and will also have an adverse effect on the internationalization of the RMB. It will also reduce the speed of currency circulation, affect the transmission of monetary policy and the central bank's performance of macro-prudential functions. At the same time, it may also infringe citizens’ right to privacy and is not conducive to the protection of personal rights.

**TLDR:** You can't TLDR this. I'm still trying to digest it. Notables I've taken away so far:

1) Digital currency under PBoC would be considered M0, or to be only used as ""coins and notes in circulation and other money equivalents that are easily convertible into cash."" Essentially, anything you can do with a physical dollar, you can do with digital currency.

2) PBoC cautions against the use of smart contracts as it hinders the M0 definition (circulation would be hindered as the digital coins could be tied up in smart contracts)

3) It would be a two-tier system. They would keep their already existing banking infrastructure, digital currency would be an additional payment option.

4) Digital currency under PBoC would be loosely coupled to user accounts. Essentially, it wouldn't be like paying your bills with your debit card that is tightly coupled to your bank account and your name. Rather, it would serve the function as cash. I.e. I pay you $20 for mowing my lawn with cash. No need to get the banks involved.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,When to ignore/deviate from the prime directive.,"I've been following this subreddit for a short while now but am currently not adhering to the prime directive. I have my own reasons and justifications for it but I want to hear other people's opinion/situations. Plus I would love for people to test the limits of my reasoning to make sure my judgements/decisions are sound. If you don't agree please tear my reasoning to shreds so we all learn a bit more.

My major deviation from the prime directive revolves around tax and 401k and student loan debt. I have no employer match to my contributions, have a sizeable amount of student loan, yet I still contribute ~%40 of my salary to my 401k. My reasoning is as follows:

1. I can invest in my 401k with pre-tax money. If I invest anything outside of the 401k it will be post tax. I believe this will also help if I am near a tax bracket cutoff, but I didn't really factor that in my decision.

2. I am prioritizing contributions into my 401k over paying down my student loan because my loans aren't credit card loans so they aren't ""high"" interest rates. My rates are all over the place but a significant chunk of them are 8%, which is on the higher end of student loans, but I will finish repaying them within 10 years. I know I'm paying more over the long run, but I'm hoping compound returns on my 401k will outweigh that (because although my loan interest is ~8% and my returns are going to be optimistically average 7% it's all pre-tax investment).

3. I can get away with saving this much right now because I live with my parents. This is destroying my mental health but I've seen the power of compound interest and it seems worth it right now.

Is this logic sound?",finance

Under the loosely-coupled account system, the agency may be required to transmit daily transaction data to the central bank asynchronously, which not only facilitates the central bank's mastery of necessary data to ensure that regulatory objectives such as prudent management and anti-money laundering are achieved, but also reduces the system burden on commercial institutions. .

&gt; Third, China's central bank's digital currency design at this stage should focus on M0 substitution instead of M1 and M2 substitution.

&gt; At this stage, M1 and M2, based on commercial bank accounts, have been digitized or electronic, and there is no need to digitize again with digital currency. Interbank payment settlement systems supporting M1 and M2 circulation (such as large-scale payment systems and online payment inter-bank clearing systems, etc.), commercial bank in-line systems, and non-bank payment institutions' various types of online payment instruments are operating normally and are constantly improving. Upgraded and increasingly efficient, able to meet the needs of China's economic development. Replacing M1 and M2 with the central bank’s digital currency will not only help improve payment efficiency, but will also cause huge waste of existing systems and resources. In contrast, the circulation, printing, withdrawal, and storage of existing banknotes and coins are costly, and the distribution system has many layers. It is inconvenient to carry, is easily forged, and is not controllable anonymously. It is used for money laundering and other illegal activities. The risk of criminal activities and the need for digitalization are increasing day by day. In addition, non-cash payment instruments, such as traditional bank cards and Internet payments, are based on a tightly coupled account model and do not fully satisfy the public’s need for easy-to-use and anonymous payment services. It is impossible to completely replace M0, especially in account services and In areas with poor communications network coverage, people’s dependence on cash is still high. The central bank’s digital currency maintains the attributes and main features of cash, satisfies the need for portability and anonymity, and will be the best tool to replace cash.

&gt; It is precisely because the central bank’s digital currency is a substitute for M0 and should not be charged interest. This will neither trigger ""financial disintermediation"" nor lead to inflationary expectations. Correspondingly, it will not have a big impact on the operation of the existing monetary system, financial system and real economy.

&gt; In the same way, since the central bank’s digital currency is replaced by M0, it should also abide by all existing regulations concerning cash management, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing. In order to cooperate with anti-money laundering and other related work, relevant institutions may be required to report to the central bank on large and suspicious transactions of the central bank’s digital currency. At the same time, in order to guide the central bank’s digital currency to be used in small-sum retail business scenarios without crowding out deposits and to avoid procyclical effects in the context of arbitrage and pressure, it is possible to set daily and annual cumulative transaction limits, and provide for large-scale bookings. exchange. When necessary, it may also be considered to implement a graded charge for the exchange of the central bank's digital currency. For small and low-frequency exchanges, no fees may be charged. For large-value, high-frequency exchanges and transactions, higher fees are charged to increase exchange costs and system frictions. In the case of zero interest rates and lower bounds, this arrangement can also create conditions for the central bank to implement negative interest rate policies.

&gt; Fourth, it should be cautious about loading smart contracts into the central bank’s digital currency.

&gt; According to the definition given by Nick Szabo, smart contracts are a set of commitments defined in digital form, including agreements on which contract participants can execute these commitments. Smart contracts are written in computer-readable code. Once the trigger condition is reached, it is automatically executed by the computer. Can be loaded with time, credit and other preconditions, can also be used in taxation, anti-terrorism financing and other scenarios.


&gt; However, as mentioned above, the central bank’s digital currency is an alternative to M0 and has unlimited indemnity, that is, it assumes the functions of value scale, circulation means, payment means, and value storage. The original banknotes did not carry any other social and administrative functions. The Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Administration of RMB stipulates that it is prohibited to intentionally damage the RMB Therefore, adding extra social or administrative functions to cash bills actually damages the renminbi.

&gt; In order to maintain the legal status of unlimited indemnity, the central bank’s digital currency should not assume other social and administrative functions other than the four functions that money should have. The loading of smart contracts in addition to the functions of the legal tender currency itself will affect its deferral function, and even degrade it into a valuable ticket, which will reduce the free use of the digital currency of the Central Bank of China and will also have an adverse effect on the internationalization of the RMB. It will also reduce the speed of currency circulation, affect the transmission of monetary policy and the central bank's performance of macro-prudential functions. At the same time, it may also infringe citizens’ right to privacy and is not conducive to the protection of personal rights.

**TLDR:** You can't TLDR this. I'm still trying to digest it. Notables I've taken away so far:

1) Digital currency under PBoC would be considered M0, or to be only used as ""coins and notes in circulation and other money equivalents that are easily convertible into cash."" Essentially, anything you can do with a physical dollar, you can do with digital currency.

2) PBoC cautions against the use of smart contracts as it hinders the M0 definition (circulation would be hindered as the digital coins could be tied up in smart contracts)

3) It would be a two-tier system. They would keep their already existing banking infrastructure, digital currency would be an additional payment option.

4) Digital currency under PBoC would be loosely coupled to user accounts. Essentially, it wouldn't be like paying your bills with your debit card that is tightly coupled to your bank account and your name. Rather, it would serve the function as cash. I.e. I pay you $20 for mowing my lawn with cash. No need to get the banks involved.",cryptocurrency

A month goes by after getting the car and I get a letter from the DMV saying
&gt;""The application for a certificate of title on the vehicle described above cannot be approved because certain information or documents were not submitted, or the documents were incomplete or incorrect"".

Around this time I get my first notification from the bank saying they never got the title. So I call the dealership and explain to them what I got in the mail. They tell me the person responsible for the information isn't in right now, so I leave them a message for them to call me back. A week goes by I hear nothing. So I called again, once again the person isn't there, this time they give me a number to text the documents that I got in the mail. Some time goes by and I call the bank to see if they got the title because I heard nothing from the dealership and I thought they might of taken care of it. The bank still hasn't received the title. So I called the dealership again, finally I got to talk to the person responsible for handling this thing. I tell them the situation, that the letter from the DMV needs me and the dealer to fill in information. They look into my case, she tells me that it was odd that I even got the letter that , that is something usually just sent to the dealership. She told me there was no need for me to go to the dealership, that she would take care of it. Shortly after I got a second notification from the bank saying they haven't received the title, since I just dealt with the dealership the other day I figured the information hasn't been sent to the bank yet. Well today I just got my third and final notice saying they haven't gotten the title telling me my loan is now in default. and it states this

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance Question,"Info:


I have about 55k in student loans.  30k is in 4% federal loans, the other 25k is in 7% parent plus loans.  I've got an income of about $3600/month after taxes and 401k contribution to get the match.  I'm living at home without paying rent, and with commuting expenses of about $300/month plus maybe $100/month for other necessary crap.  Basically all other spending is discretionary, so I have about $3000 to throw at the loans each month.  I have about $1000 in savings as an emergency fund/buffer.  Credit score is like 725.


Question:


Can I refinance, and should I? Currently I can use the avalanche/snowball method and throw money at the higher interest loan, and I don't know what type of rate I could get for a refi. I'm also not sure how to refinance my parents' loan together with my own.  But 7% is a pretty high rate, and it would be nice to only manage one large loan instead of like a dozen small ones.  Any advice is appreciated.

investing,Discussion on the place bonds have in a 20/30 yr old portfolio in 2018,"I want to discuss bonds and reasons to won them in 2018. I hope this helps fix errors in my understanding on owning bonds (either directly or through funds) in an environment with low interest rates  that are expected to go higher. Below is my write up on how I understand the subject. Let me know where my reasoning isn't right.

The investment community, including this sub, has long debated on how much of the portfolio should be equities vs. bonds and alternatives.

I get the conventional wisdom that equities will give you the best return over the long term. The trade-off of course is higher volatility. This makes sense since economic growth in our societies is driven by firms so it makes sense that by owning stock in the firm you are reaping its economic benefit.

Bonds  are understood as having a place in a portfolio for protection in times when the economy isn't booming. The reasoning is a little less obvious since it has to do with the inverse relationship between interest rates and prices. In bad economic environments interest rates drop which pushes bond prices higher. I understand this as being the primary argument for holding bonds in a portfolio as it would offset the losses in equities. 

I believe a secondary argument for using them is because your principal, as long as you hold them until maturity is safe (gov bonds), and you are earning income via interest during the duration. Ofcourse, in booming economic markets interest rates are expected to rise to curb inflation and have an adverse effect on bonds.  So you get a 2 fold loss, one that is obvious and what that is not so obvious. The obvious loss is the drop in price due to interest rates going up and the less obvious loss is the opportunity cost of not being in an asset that does well in inflationary periods - stocks.

The general wisdom shared on this sub and other investing related subs is  - if you want to maximize growth and you are young have a 100% equity portfolio. If you want to decrease the volatility then add bonds. I think even Benjamin Graham recommended having 20 - 30% in bonds and no more and no less than 20 (I could be wrong about this). Buffet ahas also suggest equities as being the dominant part of anyone's portfolio. I've heard from many other well known investors as well that they recommend the same for the simple reason that if you believe in long term positive economic growth then equities will outperform fixed income assets by a large margin.

There are others like Ray Dalio and Harry Browne who actually recommend a significant portion of the portfolio being bonds vs. stocks. Tony Robbins claims that Dalio recommended that 30% allocation in stocks vs. 55 % allocation in bonds for the average investor and that would give around the same return as the market (s&amp;p 500) with limited downside in downturns. I find this hard digest but am openminded to change my thinking. However, I don't get the reasoning. How can a portfolio that is bond heavy perform just as well as an S&amp;P? This contradicts my understanding that you buy bonds to limit your volatility with the understanding that you are foregoing upside.

Earlier this week Dalio at Davos said he is certain (like everyone) that the 30 yr bull market in bonds is over and bonds aren't the place to be in the coming years. This statement contradicts  the principle of his ""all-weather fund"" that is so bond heavy. 

I don't own any bonds in my portfolio. My investments are 100% in equities. The rest of my liquid capital is in cash. I could invest a portion of that cash I don't immediately need in bonds or a bond portfolio but I don't understand why I should well enough. 

My understanding is that if I buy a bond fund for instance it will likely loose value as interest rates are poised to rise in the coming years. I get that cash loses value due to inflation but wouldn't owning bonds also cause a loss of value due to rising rates? The only reason then to own bonds would be to negate the effects of market volatility or loss in an equity downturn. But if my equity investments are for the 20-30 year horizon and I will always have cash then why would I buy bonds now? Perhaps I'd buy bonds in a high interest rate environment some time in the future.

Am I missing something? Please correct me if my understanding is off.

Also - If you could point me to resources to better my understanding of this subject please share.",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on using a CC Cash Advance to get 0% APR Balance Transfer offer,"I have a $19000 credit card balance at 9.90% APR with Navy Federal.  They are offering $0 Fee and 0% APR on balance transfers until the end of February.

I have a zero balance card with Chase that has a $2600 cash advance line at 26.24% APR.  

If I were to utilize that $2600 cash advance and pay it towards my NFCU balance, and then do a balance transfer of $2600 from the Chase card back to the NFCU card, I believe I can convert $2600 @ 9.90% to $2600@0% for one year on the same card.

The NFCU card is near its limit, so I figure if it were to take 14 total days to complete the process of freeing up the balance and transferring it back, I would have paid about $22.50 in cash advance interest, but would save $257.40 in interest on the same balance in a year.

I've never done this before, but does this seem like a bad way to save some money so I can pay my debt down faster?  Also, after the balance transfer process completes and the cash advance is paid off, would the cash access line reset back to $2600 so that I could perform the same procedure?  Would that be a big ""No No"" to repeatedly cycle credit back and forth between two cards to convert a portion of my existing balances down to 0% for a year?

I wouldn't do this on most credit cards, but with NFCU not charging fees on balance transfers, it seemed rather plausible.",finance

personalfinance,Question about income tax withholding,"So I'm really confused about this. Maybe someone can shed some light. 
My wife and I both work at the same place. I started in June of 2017 and only made about 4500 (I'm a college student)
She made roughly around 34000 last year. 
She is the payroll account at our job and told me because I made so little I didn't have to pay federal income tax. And that Sage 50 (Peachtree) is setup to not deduct federal income tax if your pay is below a certain amount.

So when I went to get everything in order to file our taxes online I started entering our 2017 wages and I entered hers and it said 'estimated refund 450 dollars'
When I entered my income it says 'estimated refund 25 dollars'

So why is it that she gets a 450 dollar refund but I didn't make enough to pay income tax, and yet it's saying basically I owe them 425? We're filing Married Filling Jointly btw.

Was she wrong to not deduct federal income tax from my pay?

Should bonds be included or not in a portfolio now? What are the alternatives? 


Here are a few of my ideas on why I choose the stocks/indexes above:

* The S&amp;P 500 Index on the US (the heart of the economy)
* I tried to mix US/International. Not fully exposed on the US ... even though if the US goes bad the entire world will go bad.
* Tech/Health which I think will grow in the next 5 years. 
* Berkshire Hathaway has a mix of companies they own and performed well during a long time. More brick and mortar companies here. A bit worried here on how this will perform when Warren Buffet will no longer be with us.


I'm not looking to beat the market.


I want to generate income/keep the value on my hard earned money that are sitting in the bank and doing nothing :( ... inflation erodes them.


Do you think this is a good mix of index funds on exposure to the market?

personalfinance,"How to balance between retirement account, student loans and saving for big purchases?","Hi everyone. I took out a massive student loan when going to law school. It was about $195,000 when I graduated in 2014 and is up to about $230,000 currently. I spent the first few years finding a job and getting laid off twice and only recently got a nice raise and have the money to start looking into my options.

I'm on a repayment plan through the federal lender called PAYE (pay as you earn) where my payments are fixed by my income and very affordable. The plan lasts 25 years and anything not paid off is forgiven but the current tax laws would mean I get taxed on everything forgiven. My payment is currently $310/month and if I went to ""standard"" payments it would be about  $2,700/month. Interest is fairly high, 1/2 the loan is at 7.65%, most of the rest is 6.65% and a small portion is 5.5%. 

I looked into refinancing but most places wont even consider it with the high amount. The only remotely reasonable option was to refinance the 1/2 at 7.65% to about 5.5% but my payments would increase to over $900/month and it still would take 20 years.

I can afford to put about $1,200/month towards some combo of loans, my Roth IRA, saving for large purchases and investing. I opened the IRA last summer and have about $900 in it but want to seriously increase my contributions since I know doing so earlier makes a world of difference. I have about $2,500 in an emergency fund that I want to increase to $6k in the short term and $12k over a longer period of time. I'm keeping this in a high interest savings account (1.45%).  I would also like to pay for a house and wedding some time in the next 2-5 years and start a family not too long after that.

So, I've been struggling to figure out how to balance where my payments should go. One option is to keep making the minimum payments on the loan, let the amount get forgiven in 21 years and plan to pay a lot in taxes and hope I don't have to if laws change while focusing entirely on retirement account and savings.  I could also refinance half the loan but only have a small amount to pay towards the IRA/savings. Or I could do some combo of spending a few years building my nest egg for savings and retirement and then come at the loans much more aggressively.

None of my options seem great but I'm hoping to pick the best one so I'm not in real bad shape in 20 years. Any advice is very greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Does anyone have a Roth IRA through Vanguard? I have some questions.,"Background info first:

I am 31 years old and currently employed working for the Federal government.  I have been working there for 8 years and have contributed the max (or almost the max) to my Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement account every year.  For those who don't know, the TSP is like a traditional 401K retirement account for the government.

I currently have 149K in my TSP and about 25K in a regular savings account with less than 1% interest. I have been looking into a separate Roth IRA and Vanguard really caught my interest. I read somewhere that I could do the following:

- Open and fund a traditional IRA (select non-deductible on the form)
- Once the account is funded, convert the new IRA account to a Roth IRA by submitting the brokerage’s form or calling customer support
- Result: you now have $5500 to invest on which you will pay no taxes on gains, you can withdraw your principal (the $5500) at any time with no penalty, and you can withdraw gains prior to age 59 1/2 to buy a home or for higher education expenses

Can anyone confirm if this is accurate?  I am thinking of taking $5,500 out of my savings account and following those steps to open up a Roth IRA and letting it grow each year at a faster rate since my savings account is hardly making me money.  I am just nervous though as I do not know much about investing (which stocks/bonds to invest in) and what rules are in place if I ever want to withdraw money from my Roth IRA account for home projects, kids college tuition, a down payment on a car, etc.  For my TSP, I just put 50% in the C fund and 50% in the I fund and let it do its job.

Hopefully some or most of you have a Roth IRA through Vanguard and can shed some light on this for me.  If you need more info about my finances, let me know. Thanks!

Edit:  I make 70K a year if that matters

Edit 2: Okay so now I know I can just open a Roth IRA directly. I guess I was confused on what a backdoor Roth IRA was, so that does not apply to me. Got it.

Edit 3: Can anyone please clarify on this wiki rule? What does it mean when they say ""you cannot put past year's contributions back in your Roth IRA unless you return the money within 30 days""?

&gt; 13. Can I take money out of my Roth IRA without penalty?

&gt; You can take out your Roth IRA contributions without penalty whenever you want. Taxes and penalties may apply if you want to take out earnings. You should also be aware that your investment company may have a minimum balance. However, since you cannot put past year's contributions back in your Roth IRA unless you return the money within 30 days, strongly consider avoiding such a withdrawal.",finance
personalfinance,Recently paid off my car and crunched some numbers... 2013 Nissan Altima TCO,"TL;DR: Owned Nissan Altima 5+ years, 100k+ miles... TCO: $0.39/mile

I paid off my car loan in November 2017 and decided to see what the actual cost of the car was over the 5+ years that I've owned the vehicle. This was my first big purchase after starting my first job after college. I am an engineer and lived in a very low COL area when I purchased the car, yet gas was very expensive (rural upstate NY). [Here are some pictures to help you understand my explanation.](https://imgur.com/a/9Eo2T)

**[EDIT]** if you look at the graph and chart linked above, you see that I have a KBB resale value of $9000 (as of 1/26/18) that I factor in to the equation. This is subtracted from the total amount spent and then divided by the total miles to get the TCO/mile

**2013 Nissan Altima 2.5SL**
Purchased in Burlington, VT but registered in NY

**Purchase Price &amp; Financing**
Purchase price of the car was $24,349.82 after all of the applicable fees were added to the sticker price. I was very nervous having never bought a car before and was a little nervous negotiating, so I didn't do a very good job of getting the price down. (*Having bought a car with my wife in 2017, I was much more informed and negotiated a better trade-in value of her old car*) I put $4000 down after saving up for several months. Still living on a college student's budget but making engineering money allowed me to have a lot of expendable income that I stowed away to purchase the car. I had minimal credit, so I was given a 4.99% interest rate if I financed the car for 5 years through Nissan. *[EDIT: Payment was $384/mo for 60 months with some months paying extra]*

* Purchase Price: $24,349.82 (after tax/tag/title/etc)
* Down Payment: $4,000
* Interest Rate: 4.99%
* Loan Terms: 60 months
* Total Paid: $26,984.30
* Interest Paid: $2,634.48


**Gas**
Starting day one, I kept a Field Notes Traveling Salesman edition notebook in my center console and logged the date, mileage, $/gal and amount of gas every time that I filled up. Looking back on the graph, you really can see inflection points during some of my major life events (job changes, extended vacations, etc).

* Total gas used: 4114.286 gal
* Total cost: $10,149.57
* Avg $/gal: $2.50
* Avg mpg: 26.2


**Maintenance, Insurance, etc**
I have tried to be very strict with my preventative maintenance on the car so that I can drive it for a loooooong time. I have gotten oil changes every ~6000 miles (full synthetic) and tire rotations on a similar interval. I have had to buy 2 new sets of tires over the 108,000 miles in 5+ years which have included free rotation, balance and nail repair (shout out Discount Tire!). General consumables, I have replaced myself including brake pads, air filters, cabin air filters, broken interior door handle, wiper blades.

I have had 2 minor non-warranty repairs done on the car over 5 years which were paid for out of pocket.They were: A/C fan clutch &amp; related parts ($1205) and dent on the driver F &amp; R doors from being backed in to ($1318). Having only 1 mechanical failure after 108,000 miles is pretty impressive.

* Number of oil changes: 19
* Oil change cost: $1086.90
* General parts: $334.51
* Repair - non-warranty: $2522.33
* Tires: $1254.42 
* Insurance: $7319.71
* Registration/Inspections: $1144.75


Overall, the Total Cost of Ownership comes out to $42,301.44 (see [graphs](https://imgur.com/a/9Eo2T) for specifics) at time of writing with the odometer reading 108,657. This comes out to a **TCO/mile of $0.39**, which it significantly less than the IRS standard rate. I am happy with my purchase as it has been a very reliable car, **HOWEVER** I do not think that I will purchase a brand new car next time that I am in the market for a vehicle. 

Let me know what you think about my breakdown and my financial decision to buy a new car as a 22yr old individual.",finance

personalfinance,Help with proving flood insurance to unprofessional bank,"So three months ago I purchased a new home and my loan was quickly sold to Fifth Third Bank. A few weeks later I get a letter from the bank stating I need to show proof of flood insurance because my home is in flood zone AE. This is actually incorrect information. My home is in flood zone X which does not normally require flood insurance by banks and I have a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) to prove my flood zone. 

Regardless of flood zone, flood insurance is cheap and I elect to purchase it anyway. So here I am with flood insurance and a LOMA showing flood zone X so you would think I've covered all my bases with the bank, right? Not on your life!

For 3 months now this bank keeps sending me letters threatening to take out their own flood policy on my home if I don't show proof of insurance. The thing is this bank is extremely unprofessionally run. Their requested method of interaction is to send all your information into this blanket black hole email address that I can never get anyone to respond to (I've verified I have the correct address). I've sent my LOMA and my flood insurance to them SEVERAL times with no response. 

I've called every number I can find for them as well and didn't have any success until about a month ago. I finally reached someone that sounded like they knew what they were doing and as soon as I emailed her the LOMA she acted like everything was going to be cleared up. A few weeks pass. Another letter comes. So I email the girl who ""helped"" me back directly and tell her about the new letter. This was Monday of this week. I've touched base with her a few times this week only to be given excuses such as ""waiting to hear back from my research department"" and ""I've escalated this to my manager."" 

At this point I'm fed up. I hate this bank. I have all the required paperwork and something that should have been a simple phone call has now taken roughly 20 hours of my time the last 3 months. 

What can I do to get them to acknowledge the paperwork? Is there an agency I can file a claim with (or threaten to) that will get their ass in gear? At this point I feel like this is going to end with the bank taking out a flood policy I don't need and already have. They are simply deaf to any of my communication attempts.",finance

personalfinance,US - 401k vs debt payoff,"Yes, the classic 401k vs debt question, with a twist. Looking for some outside opinions.

I have a small mountain of credit card debt that, at best, is going to take 42 months to pay off. The effective interest rate over that period is just over 14%.

I have an employer-provided 401k with 100% matching on the first 3% of contributions, and 50% on the next 3%.

NEW THIS YEAR - they increased 50% match to cover an additional 2% of contributions. This debt load has me so strapped that I can't afford to take advantage of that.

I am considering suspending my 401k contributions to pay down this debt. According to multiple snowball calculators, I can pay the debt off in 20 months if I do that. At the end of that 20 months, I can resume the 401k contributions at the new maximum of 8%, taking full advantage of the additional matching.

Net loss of 401k dollars, as near as I can determine, will be about $20K. Interest saved on paying down the debt, around $8K.

I am truly torn on what to do here. I am utterly sick of carrying around this debt, but I don't want to cheat my future self out of retirement money.

Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Do you want to pay debt with an early withdrawal from 401k? Simple math says No.,"Thought I would post an simple analysis that shows why you shouldn't take an early withdrawal from a retirement plan to pay down consumer debt.  

In this example, you have left a job and no longer contribute to the 401k there and the money is sitting there earning interest.  For this example it is $100,000 and earns 4% a year over 20 years.  You also have $20,000 of consumer debt - credit cards or loans.  You are probably contributing to your new employer retirement to get a match so this isn't a conversation about stopping retirement contributions to pay down debt.

**Option 1:**
Let money sit for 20 years, assume 4% interest.

    Start:  $100,000
    20 yrs: $220,000

**Option 2:**
Take out enough to pay $20k, this means withdrawing $33,500 because of 10% tax penalty and assume a 30% Fed plus State tax rate.  The State rate will vary and so will Fed based on income, taking a withdrawal may mean more taxes if the withdrawal bumps you up a bracket then part of that $33k will be taxed more.

    Pay Debt: $33,500 withdrawal to get $20k
    Start:   $66,500
    20 yrs:   $147,000

Initially, it looks like taking a withdrawal from the $100,000 means you will lose out on $73,000 of interest to pay off $20,000 of debt.  But you have to take into account the interest being paid on the debt since that is what you are not paying in option 1.

Lets assume 10% interest, sounds kinda high but lets go with it.  Take the slow road and take 10 years to pay it off at $264 dollars/month and you will pay $11,800 in interest.

You still come out **$61,200 ahead** by not taking an early withdrawal.  Even if you take *20 years* to pay that debt off and pay a ridiculous $26,000 in interest you will be ahead by $47,000.

Now I said simple math and contrived some numbers.  Is there anything major missing?  I bet there are fancier calculations with inflation, future tax rates, etc. but I suspect even with all that, you still come out ahead by leaving the money there.

**Edit**
It was called out below I missed the $264/mo that could be contributed to the current 401k if Option 2 is taken (assuming you don't blow the $264 on misc. stuff).  If the $20k is taken as a loan then it is a wash after 10 years of taking what would be the $264/mo debt payment and saving that as pre-tax retirement for 10 years and then it gains interest for another 10 years.",finance

personalfinance,State Disability or benefits to use for a couple of months while pregnant?,"TL;DR: fiancé is pregnant and working and is in constant pain at 7months. We live in Louisiana and if she stops working, can she get on any disability to help us with her bills? She has to quit her job first?

Hi, not sure where to post this so I am sorry.

Here’s the situation, my fiancé is pregnant with our first child. She is due in April 1, is currently working as a server and is on her feet all day. She doesn’t make enough to have health insurance, so she is using Medicare (for the time being) and this will take care of her and the birth of the child.

I am an between jobs, a full-time student (senior in college) using my veterans benefits with the GI Bill. The GI bill doesn’t give us enough to pay both of our bills, but will pay all of mine. We are living with family so housing is taken care of. I am in the process of getting hired for a Federal job within the government, but start date is unknown and dependent on my security clearance (they said between 3-12 months). They told me not to seek out employment as this could complicate my security clearance.

She is in a lot of pain in her pelvic area. It hurts when she walks, moves, gets out of bed etc. her pelvic bones are dislocated and have been for years. But the pregnancy is complicating everything much more now. I am tired of seeing her in so much pain, but she is working to save for maternity leave in April, but I want her to stop working much sooner (February) since she is in so much pain and won’t be able to work all the way up til birth.

The doctor just says to rest, but she’s been resting for 4-5 days off and it still hurts her.

We are not leechers of the system. We have never used any sort of benefits before, we have never used welfare or WIC and we don’t know much about it. We live in Louisiana and we don’t know much about if the State has any sort of disability benefits for her in her situation. She HAS to stop working earlier than normal maternity leave because she’s in so much pain. After she gives birth, I should be working again and we can get off the system.

Can anyone point us in the right direction?

computers,Boot issues: No post to BIOS on startup.,"Okie dokie, so let's get down to it.  This computer is technically 10 years old.  The cool thing is, I've replaced every single part at least twice over the past 10 years in segments.  So, here's an interesting philosophy question...  Is it still my good old faithful rig I've been putting tlc into?  Or at some point did upgrading it suddenly flip a trigger to ""it's a different computer altogether!""  Irrelevant...  Fun thought though.

Okay, here's the dill.  I travel abroad.  I recently decided to spend 3 months overseas.  After plenty of research, I found that the cost of taking my rig with me was disgusting.  Ain't nobody got cash for that.  So, I read about how other people have handled this situation.  Most everyone disassembled their computer and took it with them in luggage.  

So, I disassembled my rig, left my chassis in the states and packed it all away.  I used the original box for the gpu, a mailing non-static cushioning for the hard drive and ram, but the MOBO was an issue.  I found a cardboard box and stuffed it with newspapers (recommended by many as the best option.)  I layered clothes all the way around the suitcase and wrapped them in clothing for cushioning.  I flew to my target destination and reassembled my rig in it's new chassis.  It wouldn't post.  I double-checked to make sure I hooked up the MOBO to all the right wires, still nothing.  LEDs lit up, fans whirring away, but no post and no feed to monitor, no keyboard, all the thing's you'd expect from not having BIOS.  

So, I pull out the BIOS battery for 5 minutes.  Put it back in, same thing.  I mess with it for a day, nothing.  Then I pull out all my ram, pull the bios battery, start it up, put the bios battery back, and hard restart the rig.  Bios posts and is **SUPER ANGRY** that I don't have ram in the computer.  Cool.  I put the ram back in, it boots up fine, everything works.  Huzzah.  

I turn off my computer and move it to my desk I'll be using from hereon out.  Fire it up, no post.  At this point I hate life, so I pull the power cord, pull the bios battery, pull the ram, plug the bios back in and try to start it.  No post, no tantrum because of lack of ram, nothing.  I plug the ram back in, pull the bios, pull the gpu, put the bios back in, and suddenly post.  I plug the gpu back in, reset the computer, posts proper, then I go to desktop to find that all my icons have been corrupted.  I delete the icon DB, reset my computer to regenerate icons, then find out a pattern.  BIOS only refuses to post if the computer fully powers off.  I can restart my computer all day as long as it doesn't fully power down.  And even then, it's just a matter of ripping things out of it until it decided it wants to post again, then reassembling and getting to desktop.  It's getting worse, and it's becoming harder and harder to make it post each time it fully powers down.

I feel like the obvious answer screaming at me from the innards of the computer I am mercilessly disemboweling on a weekly basis is the MOBO was damaged in transit.  I hate easy answers, and I especially hate spending money.  If it was just the mobo, it would have a little more of a consistent reason why it's failing and a way to isolate the problem, not just ""Hurr, ima gunna gut you like a limp fish!"" approach.  The BIOS battery seems to be a major factor.  Hard resetting is becoming less and less effective, and my soul cries just a little more each time I do it.  Who the hell would resort to ripping a power cord out of their computer and jamming it back in less than a second later to get a computer started?  Apparently this guy, and it's blasphemy.  And probably frying both my computer and my self esteem each time a little more.  

What could I be missing?  The power source is brand new, the motherboard and CPU about 2 years old.  Brand new (ish) GPU, ram is...  I can't remember.  What else could explain this?  Maybe something wrong with the BIOS battery?  It acts the exact same as if the computer was missing it's bios battery.  But then again, it's the same as if it wasn't Posting to BIOS, so that's not an indicator...  The puzzle is missing pieces.  Or it's not, and I'm just refusing to accept I screwed up my mobo in transit.",technology

Multiple [posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7i85rm/can_someone_help_me_understand_the_link_between/) on this -- the first predicting the BTC downturn, posted by a few of us in early December. 

Then [more posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7ru6ud/pls_read_if_you_own_btc_and_do_not_understand_the/) explaining futures and BTC -- together with explanations on:

* Even though 1 long and 1 short for every futures contract - one party is typically a mkt maker - like Cifu

* mktmakers will **net their long and short futures positions** so do not have high amounts to hedge on the physical markets. Different from clients that will take either long only or short only views

* Even though BTC futures contract sizes are small compared with commodity and interest rate futures markets -- they are still material wrt the number of BTC reqd. to sell on the physical markets (1 for CBOE and a few for CME) to flashcrash the price

* Flashcrashing does not mean the price will stay low -- but at the point(CBOE) or points(CME) in time when prices for futures contracts are fixed, they can be manipulated down

* Even though futures contracts are marked to market - the only time a big crash of BTC price pays off big time is on settlement/fixing date -- as the other side is obliged to cash settle.. whereas on any other day, massive price swings will be factored in as mktmakers change their spread - or require an offsetting premium to buy a short contract that has just pnl upped by 20% coz of the BTC price just tanked 

* The short futures / accumulate BTC - then sell BTC on settlement date play is essentially a **spike in the system** that can be played at any point in the future by any government / cb should crypto become destabilizing or a **mechanism that reduces governmental/centralbank control**

* For the moment, **there is no need to worry**, as BTC will have to go through another significant accumulation phase, before any short futures XBTC - accumulate BTC - dump BTC on settlement date (or in the run up to) can be done again

Given all the above and now the uncertainty is over -- **let the January bears become February Bulls** :-)

personalfinance,Mid 30's couple with extremely poor finances.,"Warning this is long…    
I’ve been lurking around the sub for a little while and decided to finally ask for guidance. Its hard to even know where I should start explaining the terrible financial decisions my husband and I have been making over the last 15 years coupled with bad habits…..If I leave anything important out please let me know.      
We spend every last dollar in our bank account, every month. By the time the 21st of the month rolls around we generally have less than $200 left in our bank account. I will not make any excuses for our bad choices. They are what they are. I am trying to move forward and change our spending habits.     
 I am in a position where it is difficult for me to work. We have two young children. Day care costs where we live would cost around $1000 a month. My earning potential where we live is around $1200-$1500 per month, with no benefits. It’s a shitty rural area, I would have better earning potential in a metropolitan city. Husband is 100% against moving. He feels his job pays him exceedingly well, and he believes he couldn’t find a job anywhere else as he has no degree (only years of experience) in his niche field. Crazy enough, the cost of living in our small town is equivalent or exceeds the cost of living in the closest major metropolitan city. He hasn’t had a raise in about 3 years at this job, his boss says he already makes much more than the average for his position…..(probably not true). His position has grown to encompass the responsibilities of three coworkers that retired. He has been promoted in title recently and offered a $4000 performance bonus (to be paid around august). We are essential stuck with these numbers for the foreseeable future.     
Our goals are to:    
Have an emergency fund     
Start a retirement plan of sorts     
Curb bad spending habits    
Get out of debt as much as possible    
Improve Credit Scores (490 &amp; 624)     
Any advice on how we should be allocating our funds and cutting back would really help. I Broke down our basic bills and debts. We know we need to eat out less, it’s a major blow to our finances every month. Groceries are also a big expense I would love to be able to cut down on but only have two (expensive) options to shop where we live. So again, where should we be putting our money, where should we be cutting back? What do we try to pay off first?

Also, I expect some significant purchases for us in our future that include travel, possibly a small home (in a more affordable area) and/or possibly a venture mobile. Still reasoning this out and have yet to make sense of how achievable that is once we combine income. I'm also considering how I might work remotely to travel and live in a more enjoyable, more affordable area for us as my current line of work has that possibility.

**Gross Salary/Wages:** $135k + ~$20k bonuses

**Yearly Savings Amounts:** 0%

0%!? I want to pay off debts. I was contributing 14% (401k Pretax 6%, Roth 8%). 

Once my employer begins 5% base salary match in February, I will contribute up to match.

The aim is to reach 72% savings (~$69k/year) by the time I pay off my debts in early 2019—see Liabilities below.

**Current expenses:** $26,400/year

**Assets:** $138,868

*Previous Employer Retirement:* $44,093 (Should probably roll over to Vanguard for my own management?)

- 44% Domestic stock
- 28% Foreign stock
- 23% Bonds
- 4% Short term

*Current Employer Retirement:* $66,173 (Will begin offering 5% of base salary match in February for first time. So will contribute but should probably roll over with above to Vanguard for my own management?)

- 22% Vanguard 500 Index ADML
- 14% Vanguard International Index ADML
- 11% T. Rowe Blue Chip Growth I
- 11% MFS Value R6
- 10% Columbia Small Cap Index INST 3
- 9% Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 INV
- 6% American Funds New Rold R6
- 5% Columbia Mid Cap Index INST 3
- 4% PIMCO Investment Grade Corp Bond P
- 3% MFS International Diversification R4
- 3% Prudential Total Return Bond Q
- 2% Putnam Global Income Trust R6

*Checking 1:* $2,500

*Checking 2:* $2,910

*Robinhood:* $2,223 (Started this last year for fun to begin learning about stock market for fun—not a good use of money, so should consider what to do with it?)

*Coinbase:* $1,067 (Bought $BTC before the boom and waiting on capital gains—just for fun.)

*2016 Honda CR-V, ~6,000 miles:* $22,125

**Liabilities:** -$50,762

- *Credit Card:* $12,690 @ 0% - Pay off by 8/2018, $1,812.86/month
- *Student Loan 1:* $7,518 @ 5% - Pay off 3/2018 with tax return
- *Student Loan 2:* $7,581 @ 3.75% - Pay off 5/2018
- *Car Loan:* $22,973 @ 2.99% - Pay off 1/2019

Having just discovered FI, I will be contributing $3,300+/month after expenses income to paying off debt as quickly as possible. I will stop contributing to my current employer retirement plan until debt is paid off (until they begin 5% match in February).

The (stupid) credit card debt I transferred to a one year 0% interest account with a local credit union (includes balance transfer fee)—will be paid off prior to interest rate kicking in 9/2018. 

Student Loan 1 will be paid off in March using tax return (~$6,500). 

Student Loan 2 will be paid off in July with aggressive increase in payment. 

Once that's done, I intend to aggressively pay off the car loan—aim to be paid off in 1/2019. 

Then I'm FREE!

---

**Specific Question(s):** 

1. Is my 0% savings to pay off liabilities this year sound? After paying off CC debt and student loans, should I pay off the car loan before contributing to savings? If not, how do I calculate how much to contribute towards savings while minimizing loss on interest of the 2.99% loan? Employer match is easy enough to understand (i.e. ""free"" money), but still not clear how to calculate interest loss vs saving. I just want to be free of debt, but don't want to make a stupid decision. Anything else I should consider?
2. What should I do with my previous and current employer retirement savings? It's very unclear to me how one rolls things over into Vanguard and then decides how to setup the portfolio. Is something like 50% VTSMX, 30% Foreign, 20% Bonds sound? I'm certain there are fees that are hurting me as it stands now.

personalfinance,"Do I need to file all of my W-2s if it lowers my tax return? (&gt;$20,000 income)","UPDATE: Geez Louise. I will include all of the W-2s. 

Hello! 
I am currently on turbo-tax.
key info:
-I am a full time student and server.
-I have worked at 3 jobs this year.
-I put in the information for my current job of 7 months and was said to recieve $900 back federal and $500 state because my tips go on my paycheck and are already taxed. (income ~11,000)
-I put in my 1st job of the year from january 1 - april 1 with an income of ~$2400. The federal return dropped to $600 and my state dropped to $65
-I haven't received my third w-2 yet so I do not know how that will affect it. I made maybe $500-700 there over 2 months.

I am very desperate for this tax return to be good to help me pay for this semester so I am hoping you out there will tell me to heck with it and leave it out.

MY QUESTION:
- Will I get audited/rot in jail if I don't include the w-2 that lowers my return? 
- I was under the impression that I don't even have to file since I did not make over $20,000. Is this true?

TLDR; Adding a second w-2 lowers my tax return, but I made less that $15,000 and am a full time poor student. Include it or leave it off?",finance

CryptoCurrency,If you could short tether easily would you?,"DISCLAIMER: I'm neither radically against Tether or for Tether and don't hold any of it. (I dunno why I even need to say this shit w.e)

Straw poll below, I'm curious if people would consider it.
http://www.strawpoll.me/14933040

As for the product/contract. Imagine a simple P2P contract each contract is 1USDT/CoinPair 

For Example:  *The example below uses ETH but for hypothetical purposes just replace ETH for the coin of your choice.*

1 Eth ~ 1,045.97 USDT, you enter  Long on 1,046 contracts, typically this contract will track closely to the USDT/Coin pair +premium, however when you close this position your PnL is in ETH.

Price of ETH/USDT your contracts are in profit if the price of ETH/USDT falls your Long position is now at a loss.

In the event that tether crashes, your long position would be liquidated but a short position would be in great profit and your profit is in ETH not in tether.


**POSSIBLE BENEFIT OF THIS CONTRACT**:

Futures typically are priced at a premium based on interest rates, the lending rates of tether are typically high (especially when compared to USBON rates) on exchanges like bitfinex. This means that the initial basis (a difference between mark and spot) for futures contracts would be fairly high and incentivize shorting or CnC type liquidity market makers.",cryptocurrency

Was hoping I could get some help and have someone double check my math. I worked 2 jobs this year and ended up making $69,016 for 2017. From this I paid a total of $9,618.49 in income tax so far, I claimed 0 exemptions on both jobs and asked for an extra $25 per check withheld because when I did my estimated taxes at the beginning of the year with the IRS calculator that is what it said to do.

gaming,I need help finding a new fun multiplayer game I can enjoy and not hate myself for playing.,"Edit: Forgot to list my consoles :P I have PS4, Switch, PC and a 2DS. Would prefer something PC or PS4. Also TIL how to format a reddit post :D

I'm going to listen some of the multiplayer games I have played in no particular order:

Castlevania Harmony of Despair (This game holds a very special place in my heart. I used to love grinding away on chapter 7 for Miser Rings or chapter 10 for the gear that dropped there) 

Halo 3 (Infection was my jam. I used to love playing stuff like Close the Door, Raccoon City, and many others that I can't remember)

CoD (I have a love hate relationship with CoD. It's too damn expensive for how much of the same thing they keep releasing. That being said MW2 was my favorite because everything was viable and very rarely did any gun outshine the others) 

League of Legends (I love the premise of this game. That being said, I'm pretty bad at it and also the community drives me up the fucking wall. I used to have a thick layer of skin to deal with people but something happened and I just can't deal anymore) 

RB6 Siege &amp; CS:GO (I list these both together because they basically fall under the same category when it comes to me. I really enjoy the premise of both of these games but I am god awful at them. I played a Shadow Run game on 360 that had a purchasing system similar to that of CS:GO and also really enjoyed that) 

Terraria (Have over 500 hours in it but most of that is actually single player) 

Starbound (Did not enjoy this game near as much as Terraria. Did a coop playthrough with my friend and the game just felt very tedious) 

Halo Wars (I really enjoyed the original Halo Wars because it was very lax for a RTS game. I have tried Starcraft 2 and I just can't)  

Speedrunners (I enjoy the silliness of this game) 

Divinity Original Sin 2 (Really enjoyed this game once I convinced my friend to buy it and play it with me. Unfortunately he lost our 40 or 50 hour save file and I haven't been able to get back into it since) 

Phantasy Star Universe (Grinded the hell out of White Beast and some MAG as well. Also did the Vivienne mission a lot as well)  

Dark Eden (Really enjoyed playing Vampire back in the day but never really got into the end game, barely got into the mid game lol) 

Final Fantasy 14 (As far as MMOs goes I really enjoy this one but idk too grindy and boring for my taste which is weird cause I liked grinding in CV:HD) 

Borderlands series (Bullet sponge robots aren't fun) * L4D2 (Zombies are fun with friends but only with friends. FeelsLonelyMan) 

Destiny (I refuse to pay this much ever again for a game that feels mildly complete)

Dead or Alive (Fun game but I'm bad at fighting games. Also I feel like the ninjas got nerfed in 5)

Diablo 2 &amp; 3 (I really enjoyed my first time through both of these games but lost interest trying to get through harder difficulties)

Warframe (Played it a far bit and go back to it every now and then but like FFXIV it feels very grindy to me. Played up to the part where I unlock sorties)",technology

personalfinance,I did sex work for two years. I now have 11k saved and need to get out of an abusive home. Where do I start?,"Hi. I'm 21 years old and live in the United States. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Until I was 11 years old, I lived with my grandparents. My grandfather died and my grandmother couldn't afford to take care of me on her own, so she moved back to her home country and I moved in with my biological mother. 

From age 11 to age 18, she was physically abusive. She would put out cigarettes on my legs (she didn't even smoke), she would make small cuts in spots that wouldn't be too noticeable. If I talked back or another parent/school counselor showed concern for my well being, she would cut my hair as horrible as possible and wouldn't allow me to shower or eat unless I told them I had lied. 

After I turned 18, I got my first job. The plan was to save every single penny and move out ASAP. I have no family, no family friends, and no close friends that understood what my home life was like. I pushed people away for no reason other than wanting to wallow in my self pity. 

I made sure I had my own separate bank account. I made sure I got a PO box so none of my personal information (bank statements) came to our house. I even got a storage unit so I could keep apartment necessities there until I could move out. 

Out of nowhere, she started asking for $300 rent on top of the $200/mo I was paying for the water bill and half of the electric bill. I was only making minimum wage and working less than 30 hrs per week, so after paying her, I had little to nothing left. I asked for more hours, but I was already taking up responsibilities out of my pay grade and they knew they would need to give me a raise, so in spite my manager decreased my hours as she believed I wanted her job. 

When I was around 19, my mother came to my job and made a scene over me forgetting to wash dishes. They in turn fired me for creating a hostile work environment. The car I was using to make it to work was in my mother's name, even though I was paying the payment, my portion of insurance, and gas she took it back. 

Public transportation is almost nonexistent in my town. It would've cost me $8.75 per day just to make it to and from a local town for work. 

So, in a predicament, I turned to online sex work. I had no sexual experience at all and hadn't even kissed a guy, but watched porn and other girls for a week straight and then made my debut. 

The first month, I made $1100. My mom was still asking for rent, and when she asked where my money was coming from I said that I started doing graphic design online and captioning videos for money. 

Over the next two years, I gained a 20,000 person following. My private subscriber only content has a monthly fee of $20 with a 100 person following, but I only started it within the past two weeks. 

I have $11,000 saved in my bank account. The other money went towards sex toys, cameras, a new laptop, my dog, my mothers bills, etc. I managed to do all of my filming without ever showing my face once. This was important to me as I wanted to still have a viable future afterwards. I even made sure to cover tattoos and birthmarks *every* single time I filmed. 

I already know where I want to move and I've been taking online classes for past year at a community college in that area. My concerns are: 

- A car. I'd like a 2010 Mazda 3, as I know I can do my own upkeep. The car insurance is affordable, the oil/tires/parts are affordable, the reliability is decent, and for the past year on any given day I could do a quick search for one with less than 100k miles and find a clean title for less than $8k. 

I've had an account with Navy Federal for over 4 years. I tried applying for a car loan of $8000 and paying $4000 down on the vehicle but they still wanted me to have a cosigner. 

- Explaining the gap in my work experience on a resume. I applied for a job as a bank teller on a whim, went to the interviews, and was offered the job at $12/hr. I had to decline it, but at least I know I *can* get one. But I lied and said that my work gap was due to school and home care of a sick family member. 

- My credit score. My mom had an unpaid bill in my name from 2014 (she genuinely forgot, and it's the one thing she's ever felt bad about) that was $2000 and she paid for it herself. However, my credit score is only 499. It's up 53 points from last year, but I've been told I need 575 or higher to get a car or apartment.

- Finding an apartment. I have no renter's history, and a dog (who's only 8 lbs and full grown). What do I say when they ask about my job and income? What kind of security depoist/how many months of rental should I be ready to pay up front? 

- Car insurance and health insurance. My mom took me off of her work policy for this year. She's already said I need to find my own car insurance, because she's bought a 2018 Mercedes and my name being on the policy has increased her monthly premium considerably. I'm on a prescription for antidepressants and anxiety medication, and I would like to be able to do this while being clear headed and y'know, not depressed as hell. 

Roommate search - I've been looking for a roommate with no luck. I've posted listings on CL, FB, and all of the roommate websites. People are seemingly put off by the fact I only take classes online, and say that I do online work. I've offered bank statements to prove that I do have the money, but everyone keeps asking to know where the money comes from.

Bitcoin,Startups and Bitcoins in Australia,"Australia's 7.7 millions km² of deserts and wastelands have left a relatively small area for agricultural production. Country's arid climate only worsens this situation. It explains why more than two-third of 25 million Australians are flocking into five coastal cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.

Australia, which gained its independence from the Great Britain in 1901, is the federal constitutional monarchy, where Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state and dotcom multimillionaire Malcolm Turnbull - the head of government. Australian political system, which is modeled after that of the United Kingdom, has been traditionally dominated by two major parties: the center-right ""Liberal Party of Australia"" and center-left ""Australian Labor Party"". After July 2016 elections 150-members Australian House of Representatives is lead by the pro-government 76-members coalition, headed by Liberals with 45 deputies.

The main pillar of the Australian one-trillion-dollar economy is the export of its mineral riches and livestocks to China and Japan. Those two countries consume almost halve of Australian iron ore, coal, petroleum gases, gold as well as beef, wool, meat of sheep and goat. That is why gradually cooling Asian markets are now taking Australian economy down with them into the precipice of stagnation. However, most of Australians continue to enjoy a lofty personal income and to maintain one of the highest standards of living in the World.

In a past decade Australian government has invested significant administrative and financial resources into the development of the local startup ecosystem. Still, Australia is lagging far behind U.S.A., EU and China in a number of world-class technological companies as well as in a size of venture capital allocated to seed investments.

Trading crypto-currencies as well as organizing ICOs are both legal in Australia. However, Australian law administrators follow steps of their Asian counterparts in trying to regulate digital currency exchanges by introducing harsh legislation, which many independent observers call ""draconian"". In an attempt to strengthen its anti-money laundering laws Australian gait keepers threaten crypto-traders by imprisonment due to aggravated offences up to 7 years. As a result, many prominent block-chain startups have already declared their intend to leave Australia.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: marginally friendly;
economic climate: moderately unfriendly;
regions to focus: internationally;
industries to focus: many;
major limitations: the slowing economy (GDP growth rate has been fluctuating around halve-of-a-percent for almost a decade), dominance of natural resources extraction and agricultural industries, geographical isolation, relatively small population concentrated in a few coastal cities;
stimulus: highly educated work-force, availability of seed financing, well-developed infrastructure, government's support;
opportunities: refocus from local to international markets;
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (marginally positive).

personalfinance,Flexible Spending Account New 2018 Rules on Claims and Itemized Receipts Solution,"With it being the first month out of the year I ran into some issues with my flexible spending account due to the new IRS rules on proof of service. Turns out a normal receipt is no longer an acceptable proof  of service because it unless it has this information. 1) your name 2) list of services (abbreviations are not allowed) 3) date 4) providers name 5) cost. 

My issue is that my dentist receipt does not have my name, only the last four digits of my credit card number. And under service the dentist receipt lists chck up. Even though I was able to get an expense processed all last year like this. The new rules mean most of my expenses will be rejected. Pharmacy prescriptions receipts, well they do not have my name or the drug on it. They have Rx*****####. So I called to my flexible spending company to try and get this resolved. I was told to either use their APP and get the doctors signature, fill in a hard explanation of benefits, or get a new Itemized Receipt.  First I cant use the app. I do not have decent data coverage. Called dentist and was told he will not sign or fill in an EOB or sign the app. ""I could use his signature for illegal purposes."" Even the receptionist will not sign it. While they can print a new receipt, they cannot alter the receipt. I called the flexible spending company to lets face it beg them to process this claim as they did for the last few years. I was told they could reprocess it, but it would be rejected until this is resolved. I am so fed up with this by now I am tempted to forge someone's signature on the EOB. Turns out they do not call and check the EOB signature according to the flexible spending account company. I was told this by the nicest manager after being forwarded to four different people. I submitted this post to hopefully give some help to others who are now in the same boat in 2018 with the new IRS rules. I still cant believed they did not advertise this new requirement for claims. I guess you either have to be a crook or pay a large amount of money (for expensive data plan) in order to be treated fairly.",finance

I was trying to buy a new vehicle today, my income between 2 jobs putting the payment below the 15% recommended threshold of gross income, but my credit isn't the greatest so I figured it was a toss up whether or not I'd get approved. So I fill out my loan application, which only gave a spot for one income, nothing later to enter additional income. I tell the salesman that and he said his sales manager would take care of it if it needed to be addressed. Several hours pass and I'm finally talking to the finance manager. He shows me my Transunion score and I'm shocked how low it is compared to my FICO. Anyway at this point I know there's no way I'm getting this car. My income is close, but with that score there's no way, I'm ready to just go since I've been there so long. 

The finance manager is making some calls and he's apparently gotten an approval and is working on another that would have a lower interest rate. Score! He's throwing all the paperwork at me and he's quickly pulling forms as soon as I sign them. After I sign one of the forms and before he pulls it away I noticed he nearly doubled my income on the credit application. I asked him wouldn't the bank need income verification and apparently this one never asks for it. Any bank that did ask he would just hang up on. I was taken aback but flustered and finished signing forms anyway. I should have walked out, but I was so excited for this car I didn't. It's 4 hours later and I feel like an idiot and I need to report this. I'm sure I'm not the only one he did this too and I want to get out ahead of this before the bank calls and I'm the one under investigation for bank fraud. I'm sure the stealership would have no problem throwing me under the bus.

Half that crap is automated now, if we draw one of those the computers will just start buying dollars. I know just who to call to help us here. Get Mnuchin on the phone.

Trump: Hey, buddy! Remember when you used to be a hedge fund manager? What were those things that used to get traders to change from bear to bull?

Mnuchin: Well, there’s several things that would cause a chart to look like a reversal technically. In a short period of time the pin bar candle is something traders would respect. The price just has to move down to set a new low then up over the course of a day. The bigger the move the more interest it would generate.

Trump: Hmm, how can we generate a big move?

Powell: Big moves in currency always come around rate announcements. Draghi is supposed to have one for the Euro on the 25th. They’ve been doing pretty good lately but no ones sure if they’re ever going to unwind their balance sheet.

Trump: Perfect! Let’s use that. Here’s what we’re going to do. Mnuchin, you’re going to have to play dumb and release a statement right before Draghi’s speech that we want a weak dollar. Draghi won’t know what hit him, so when it’s time to make his speech he will have to admit that the Euro is gaining too fast and talk about how it’s really not that strong. Then I’ll swoop in and say how I really want a strong dollar and Mnuchin made a mistake. If we time it right, it should make a perfect little pin on that DXY chart.

worldpolitics,MONEY KEEP AMERICAN POLITICIANS LINED UP IN PRO-ISRAEL CAMP,"**BIG BUCKS KEEP US POLITICIANS LINED UP IN PRO-ISRAEL CAMP**

5/21/95 Independent (London) 15

The Independent - London

Sunday, May 21, 1995
 
John Carlin in Washington

Lobbying/ money and fear

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's refusal to come to London for the VE anniversary celebrations two weeks ago revealed less about the state of the transatlantic alliance than about American politicians and their special relationship with Israel.

Mr Clinton had a more pressing engagement at the Washington Sheraton: attending the annual conference of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). He had to be there. Bob Dole, his likely rival in next year's presidential race, was going to address Aipac and there was no way Mr Clinton was going to allow the Republican senator to steal a march on him. If there is one thing US politicians have learnt - literally half the members of Congress attended the conference - it is that you snub America's powerful Jewish lobby at your peril.

T**he last three weeks have witnessed three developments which Middle East experts believe will do little to promote peace between Arabs and Israelis: Mr Clinton imposed a total embargo on trade with Iran; Mr Dole announced at the Aipac conference that he would introduce a Bill in Congress to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; and, on Wednesday, the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that criticised Israel's confiscation of Arab lands in East Jerusalem.**

**It is no coincidence that Aipac's current three main goals are the containment of Iran; ensuring Jerusalem becomes the capital of Israel, and preserving current levels of aid to Israel, which at $3bn (pounds 1.9bn) a year - 20 per cent of America's total foreign aid budget - represents by far the highest amount received by any country.**

Mr Clinton and Mr Dole made a point of reassuring the 2,500 Aipac delegates that they would not tamper with Israeli aid.

**Indeed, at a time when balancing the federal budget has emerged as the most pressing issue in US politics, when education, health care and welfare are all under the axe, no Republican or Democrat has dared suggest that Israel's share of American taxpayers' money should be reduced.**

A clue to the hold the Jewish-American lobby exercises over Washington is provided by the example of Mitch McConnell, a Republican senator who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. He recently proposed that aid to Africa, $1bn continent-wide, should be slashed. Aid to Israel, however, was sacrosanct, he said.When Mr McConnell last stood for election he received $213,900 from Jewish individuals and more than 50 pro-Israel groups.

Bob Packwood, another Republican senator with an impeccable record of backing the Israeli cause, has been under investigation for some time by the Senate ethics committee for alleged sexual misdemeanours. Last week it was announced that he would face a special hearing to answer to 18 such charges. Pro-Israel groups have given him more than $20,000 towards legal fees.

Aipac, a registered congressional lobbying group, has 50,000 members and an annual budget of $15m. It does not give money to politicians but, after scrutinising voting records and public pronouncements, steers Jewish donors towards the deserving.

Edward Tivnan, author of a book on Aipac called The Lobby, said: ""Senator Al d'Amato of New York, who is of Italian origin and whose politics are appalling to most New York Jews, offers a case in point. When a guy who was a Democrat and Jewish tried to run against him he couldn't get past first base, because d'Amato had positioned himself as exceedingly pro-Israel.""

One Charles Percy, a Republican who sat on the Senate Foreign Relations committee in the mid-1980s, won awards from Jewish groups for his devotion to the Israeli cause. When he started asking questions about the Israeli role in the West Bank, however, Jewish groups around the country, under Aipac's guidance, started distributing flyers denouncing him as Israel's biggest enemy. Funds poured into the coffers of Paul Simon, his rival in the 1984 elections, and Mr Percy was duly defeated. Tom Dine, the president of Aipac at the time, said in a speech: ""All the Jews in America, from coast to coast, gathered to oust Percy. And American politicians got the message.""

Jim Zogbi, president of the Arab American Institute, said: ""What they did to Percy was the equivalent of shooting a dog dead and putting it in your front lawn, a message from the neighbours saying, 'Don't mess with us'. Congressmen still say to themselves, 'I won't become the next Chuck Percy'.""

Mr Clinton, like Mr Reagan before him, promised while on campaign to push for the transfer of the US embassy to Jerusalem. In office both relented, Mr Clinton guided by the realisation that to raise such an emotive issue could disrupt the delicate Middle East peace negotiations. But the Jewish lobby in America, as Mr Tivnan put it, is more Israeli than the Israelis. It is what they want to hear that interests Mr Dole and Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

In a speech to Aipac in April Mr Gingrich said: ""You are the most effective general interest group for an American foreign assistance programme on theplanet. If you did not exist, we would have to invent you.""

**AIPAC's back (oy vay!)**

AIPAC's back (oy vay!).(Right Thinking)
--Eric Alterman

AIPAC is a back, and not a moment too soon for Bibi Netanyahu's Prime Ministerial debut. Moribund for the past four years, the once- feared Jewish ""pro-Israel"" lobby is again flexing its muscles on Capitol Hill and preparing for a period of healthy dissension and confrontation between Washington and Jerusalem.

AIPAC is like the bond market: Good news in the rest of the political economy is bad news for AIPAC. In the 1980s, the more trouble Menachem Begin, Ariel Sharon andYitzhak Shamir caused U.S. governments, the more AIPAC could show its stuff on Capitol Hill. James Baker may have barred Netanyahu from entering his building, but he couldn't afford to bar some of the Republican Party's most important contributors.

The warm relationship between the Clinton Administration and Israel's Labor government, however, left U.S. Jewish machers out in the cold. ""Why is AIPAC necessary if you don't have confrontation?"" asks Yo'av Karny, an Israeli journalist living in Washington. Without any threats to Israel's survival against which to mobilize, or evidence of anti-Semitism in the State Department, or crises in U.S.-Israeli relations, what was the point of a $15 million lobbying outfit? Yitzhak Rabin added insult to injury in 1993 when he traveled to Washington to berate AIPAC's leaders personally for screwing up American- Israeli relations by infuriating the Bush Administration with intransigent demands for unconditional loan guarantees for housing for Soviet immigrants in 1992. In an unprecedented move, Rabin told past and present AIPAC leaders that henceforth, U.S.-Israeli relations would be conducted through the Israeli Embassy, and American Jews could just butt out, thank you very much. (AIPAC supporters argue that this exchange represents only seven minutes compared with years of an extremely amicable relationship. They grant that AIPAC does become more important when U.S.-Israeli tensions arise, but insist that the lobby plays a critical role in building good relations in the first place, particularly in Congress.)

During the 1980s AIPAC transformed itself from a powerful Middle East policy lobby to a fearfully powerful foreign policy lobby, working not only on behalf of Israel but also in support of right-wing dictatorships in Africa and Latin America that voted with Israel in the U.N. AIPAC, according to one Jewish organization bigwig, became a home to ""the real meat-eating Israel Zionist types. This makes a substantial part of the American Jewish community uncomfortable.""

Run informally by a Gang of Four of its past presidents--Robert Asher, Edward Levy, Lawrence Weinberg and Mayer Mitchell-AIPACreplaced its influential executive director Tom Dine with former Justice Department Nazi hunter Neil Sher just two years ago. Sher, however, didn't even make it through the vote-count in the Israeli election. Though AIPAC officially respects the position of the Israeli government on all matters relating to security, according to Washington Jewish Week the Gang ran ""back-door operations"" with other board members to undermine Sher's wholehearted support of the peace process. His job became so uncomfortable that the rather retiring (in both senses) Sher seems to have left without even a convincing cover story.

AIPAC flaunted its resurrection most recently with incessant lobbying for sanctions against companies that do business with Iran. Using Al D'Amato as its designated pit bull, the lobby, according to a Wall Street Journal report, ""orchestrated threats against foreign companies considering commercial ventures with Teheran,"" bulldozed the House Ways and Means Committee and demanded concessions from the Clinton Administration that infuriated America's trading partners.

The conflicts associated with the Iran bill, however, are small latkes to the kinds of tsoris we can expect once the Netanyahu government starts implementing its campaign promises. With Sharon as the Prime Minister's choice for a new ministry in charge of, among other things, building and strengthening new settlements, he will be bullying Arabs and expropriating Palestinian lands. U.S.-Israeli relations are certain to enter a period of friction and frustration. AIPAC can be expected not only to support any Netanyahu moves to withdraw from the peace process but also to prod-within the letter of F.E.C. laws, always--its membership in the direction of Bob Dole. Jeane Kirkpatick, campaigning to be Secretary of State, has promised that if Dole were elected, the U.S. Embassy in Israel would no longer operate as an adjunct of the Labor Party. Her neoconservative allies in the Dole camp, like Richard Perle and the entire Podhoretz and Kristol Mishpocheh, can also be expected to argue vigorously to American Jews that Dole would be more generous to a Likud-run Israel than are Clinton and his Woodstock foreign policy team.

The Jewish Week of New York noted that ""with some 70 percent of American Jews in support of the Rabin-Peres peace process,"" the Israeli election ""underscored our irrelevance to Israeli politics."" But that was then. With relations on their way into the toilet, AIPAC is irrelevant no more. Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles, Netanyahu has promised to introduce legislation in the Knesset to bar Reform and Conservative rabbis from participating in religious councils and from conducting officially recognized conversions. In other words, his neocon boosters are celebrating the election of an Israeli government that all but denies their identities as Jews.

Talk about self-hatred.

financialindependence,New Teacher Looking for Advice,"I've been lurking on this sub for a while - thought I'd come out of the woodworks and ask for your good advice.

I'm a first year teacher, and I was lucky enough to have most of my college expenses covered by scholarships and help from family, but I do have about $21,000 in student loan debt, broken up as follows:

* $8,000 @ 4.66%
* $6,000 @ 4.60%
* $3,000 @ 3.86%
* $4,000 @ 2.98% (federally subsidized)

As a teacher in a Title I school, I can have up to $5,000 of the loan forgiven after 5 years of teaching (so in June 2022). 

With my current income and spending, I have about $1,600/mo to throw at either paying down debt or saving. Right now, I'm putting $200 towards the loans each month (minimum payment of $175) and $1,400 into a 457 plan invested in a TIAA target date fund, which I figure will be great to heavily front-load now for RE to give the funds maximum time to grow. I would love to have enough in savings to RE (or at least be able to take a few years off from work to focus on parenting) in 10 years or so.

I also have about $10,000 in savings beyond my emergency fund, half of which is reserved for going into my 2017 year Roth IRA contribution - I could repurpose this to pay off half the loan right now if that would be a better idea than investing in the IRA. 

Only thing is, I don't really know what I'm doing. Would it be a better idea to aggressively pay down the debt before putting into savings? Pay down the debt but leave $5000 of the lower interest loans until I can have the rest forgiven in 2022? Stay the course and keep balancing between TIAA investments and paying off debt? 

I hate having the loan looming over me, and there would definitely be a huge emotional benefit to paying it off ASAP. I just want to make sure it wouldn't be an mistake missing out on potential investment returns beyond the guaranteed 4.6% return of paying off the higher interest loans.

Appreciate any advice!",finance

*****

&gt; * President Trump's State of the Union Speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's final meeting, and a wave of earnings and economic news will give markets plenty of catalysts in the week ahead.
&gt; * Analysts are watching for an asset reallocation by pension funds.
* Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet all report Wednesday and Thursday.
&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 7 percent for the month so far, its best performance since 2015.

*****

&gt; President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's farewell meeting and a tsunami of earnings reports from tech's heaviest hitters are some of the big events for markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; The stock market could continue its record-setting run as month end approaches, and the S&amp;P 500 is already on track for a 7.2 percent January gain so far, its best gain since October 2015. If positive, January would be the 10th month of gains for the Dow and S&amp;P, the best consecutive monthly winning streak since 1959.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will focus on a range of events, including President Trump's State of the Union address and his expected promise of a major infrastructure spending plan. The president is expected to ask Congress for $200 billion.
*****
&gt; More than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies release earnings, with reports from Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet on Wednesday and Thursday, and from big oil, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, on Friday.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady Wednesday, in the final meeting before Chair Janet Yellen leaves at the end of the week and Fed governor Jerome Powell moves to the chairmanship. The Fed is expected to raise rates again in March, and it forecasts three interest rate hikes this year.
*****
&gt; ""I suspect there's not going to be a massive change. Their views are going to be about the same. You will definitely see more conversation about regulation from him,"" said Seth Carpenter, UBS chief U.S. economist.
*****
&gt; There are also some major data releases in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to February from January, with car sales, manufacturing and productivity data Thursday and the always important monthly employment report on Friday.
*****
&gt; The roll of the calendar itself could be a big event, as investors position for the end of a month where stocks soared and bonds sold off. Some strategists expect to see a continued reallocation from pension funds, which set their allocations in January. Treasury bonds have sold off, with the 10-year yield reaching close to its high of 2.47 percent Friday, and the 2-year piercing 2.13 percent, after starting the year at 1.89. Yields move opposite prices.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC:**
February’s performance generally improves in midterm years**

&gt; Since 1950, February is up only slightly more than half the time and up marginally on average. However, small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the seventh best month for that benchmark.

&gt; In midterm years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all increasing. Here again it is the Russell 2000 small-cap index that shines brightest gaining 1.9% on average since 1982. Russell 1000 is second best, averaging gains of 1.3% since 1982. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 average gains of 1.0% (since 1950) while NASDAQ lags with average advance of 0.7% (since 1974).

# **The Energizer Market**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 notched yet another new all-time high today. Below is an updated look at our tables highlighting the length of days it has been since the last meaningful pullback.

&gt; As shown, we’re now at 445 days since the last 3%+ pullback (a record), 575 days since the last 5%+ pullback (18 days from a record), 712 days since the last 10%+ pullback (not close to a record), and 3,242 days since the last 20%+ pullback (2nd longest).

# **Another 100+ Trading Day Streak Without a 1%+ Decline**

&gt; We’ve been saying this for a while now, but the next time the S&amp;P 500 experiences a drop of more than 1%, it’s going to feel like a crash to many investors. That’s because 1%+ down days have become so foreign lately. As investors get used to only very small declines on very rare occasions, drops of 1%-2% — which were much more frequent up until the end of 2016 — feel MUCH more painful when they finally do occur.

&gt; Below is a chart showing historical streaks of trading days without a 1%+ down day going back to 1945. While the current streak of 108 trading days isn’t that close to the record streak of 184 trading days seen back in 1963, it’s notable that we just had a 109-trading day streak end last March as well.

&gt; Prior to the two recent 100+ trading day streaks without a 1%+ down day, the last two came back in 1995. 1995 was a year that saw very similar action to what we’ve seen over the last 12 months.

###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1pcttradingdays.png))**

&gt; If we tighten up the margin of the decline even more, the S&amp;P 500 has not had a decline of 0.60% in 96 trading days. As shown below, that’s easily a record going back to 1945!

personalfinance,What are the benefits to paying off some of my principal student loan balance before it goes into repayment?,"I promise I googled this question, and all I saw was articles on how to pay off student loan debt faster. I think I have a pretty good handle on how I'm going to budget in order to do that.

I get my BS in May and have $25k in federal student loan debt with ~$600 in accrued interest that goes into repayment in December. I start a full-time job making $67k in June. The minimum monthly payment is $263. I plan on paying anywhere between 1000-1200 per month. In the six months prior to repayment I hope to lower the principal balance by at least $7000. Because of the nature of the industry I'm in, I expect yearly performance bonuses and raises my goal is to get this thing paid off in 14-18 months. 

Will this lower the monthly payments and accumulating interest or will they remain the same based on the original balance? 

Side note: I don't know how I'm getting a degree in mathematics yet the world of student loans is completely foreign to me.",finance
personalfinance,Do I need to file form 709 if I gifted slightly above gift tax limit?,"Hi, I gifted a person $15028 worth of stocks in 2018. The annual federal gift tax exclusion this year is $15k. When I initiated the transfer, the stocks were worth less than $15k but it appreciated in value and got above $15k on the date of transfer. Do I have to fill out form 709?

$145k salary
$30k guaranteed bonus
$30k performance bonus

$20k in Traditional IRA
$10k in stocks (mainly ETFs and select companies I follow. I don’t day trade)
$6k cash savings (I usually keep this at $10k but finished finding my 2017 IRA the other day). 

$20k in student loans

Checking account usually has $5-10k for cash flow. 

I’m planning to max my HSA this year and fund my $401k up to my employers contribution matching limit (4%). I make minimum payments on my student loan ($250). They’re all subsidized federal loans so interest rate ranges from 3-4%. 

General expenses are pretty low. I never think about money - I buy what I want without much thought and always have money every month to fund my accounts and still have some left over. 

How can I better manage my income?",finance
personalfinance,Just paid off my student loan. I will have a modest increase in disposable income and would like to start saving and investing rather than spend it. Need some advice.,"First of all I am really chuffed to have paid it off. I have been browsing this sub for quite some time waiting for the day when I can start making my own investments. It was a non dollar denominated loan as I come from a different country and when I started paying it off around four years ago it was above $30k as per prevailing interest rates. 

Suffices to say that during my two years working and two years as graduate student, which I am now, I saved every penny I could to pay off this loan. Due to this I have grown used to a lifestyle with minimal needs. I rarely go out for drinks and when I eat out it is some cheap place for lunch or dinner. My main expense is rent and one vacation an year to a different country. I was still able to do things I enjoyed without spending too much. I do not own a car and every time I did my calculations I found that insurance payments alone would be more than what I would pay for Uber/Lyft if I used it every time I needed it.

For the first time I have money I do not know what to do with. It is not much to start with but there will be a continuous stream of saving unless I change my lifestyle drastically and I do not intend to do so as long as I am a graduate student. I guess I will have about $1k every month in savings. I basically have two questions here:

1) Should I spend any money on new things and activities which in the long run will be good for me. Maybe create a better personality or just give me a more balanced life. I don't know but I am throwing it out in the wild. I do not mind spending money if it is going to benefit me in the long run.

2) The more important question and one to which I hope there will be quite a few answers. Where should I invest money based on the fact that I wouldn't need it any time soon and I don't mind taking a decent bit of risk? How can I minimize fees and taxes on my investment?

Any advice and comments will be welcome. I would be happy to provide more details if that will help you give me a better advice. Thank you all.",finance
Bitcoin,Coinbase,"Well, now that Coinbase has officially violated the federal Wire Act, it would seem there will soon if not very soon, be precedent for all of us. This violation, and their concept of issuing a case number, then ignoring you completely is going to lead to their demise, in most every scenario. The act is in play because the Fed wires money, and, even within the same state, in the US, this is a Federal method of transport of funds, thus subject to FDIC rules and regs. That being said, by Monday they had best get their act together for every wire they have left hanging, especially those of over 3 business days-this amounts to criminal theft of property and funds. With the basis company being listed as they are; that would spell doom for the biggest ripoff since Y2K that the world has ever seen.

personalfinance,Credit Karma Tax - 2016 OR state return errors discovered,"Just a warning: /u/CreditKarma can lead to some really sloppy errors.

I filed my taxes with Credit Karma Tax after comparing the results with TurboTax and TaxAct. Everything looked right, so I figured why not.

The one thing I overlooked was that they entered my address wrong on my OR state tax forms, omitting my apartment number. I know it was their error because the address on the federal form was correct. For some reason my small state tax payment (just $200) was rejected by my bank due to an inexplicable routing error and the state tried notifying me by mail. Six bounced letters later and they sent it to collections. I guess they don't try calling. Thanks a lot Credit Karma :-(",finance
personalfinance,I worked in three states last year. How do I file my taxes for this?,"Hi! I'm a student, so my employment has been sort of everywhere. I spent winter break working at my home in PA, the school year doing a few hours a week at my school in NY, and over the summer at my internship in CT. 

The job I earned the most at was my internship and I received a W-2 for both NY and CT there. Additionally, I had money put into a 401k that I withdrew into my savings account after my internship ended because I wasn't really sure what to do with it. Income tax was withheld and I do expect to have to pay additional taxes on this due to the fact it is a withdrawal from a retirement fund. 

The state taxes were withdrawn by the state where I was working at the time and all federal taxes and withholdings were done as normal (my exemptions are 0).

Additionally, I'll be claimed as dependent by my parents as they are the provider of my health and car insurance. So, how do I file my taxes in this situation? Would I be able to use turbotax or should I find a professional? And if I need a professional, who should I go to?

personalfinance,"Pay off all my loans, or continue to invest?","Hi PF,  
  
Wanted to share a success story and also ask for some advice! I'm in my early 30's and finished grad school in 2013 with $200k in loans, and a job paying $110k per year, and no money. Since finishing school I have been an avid lurker here on PF and partly from reading all the great advice on here, the following has happened in the last 5 years:  
  
  * My student loan debt has gone down from $200k to $100k (at ~4% interest)  
  * My compensation has more than doubled to $200k+ per year (thanks for all the negotiation and career tips! I know for sure I'd be making **much** less without them)  
  * I adhere to a budget where I live **FAR** below my means (my total living expenses are around $3-3.5k per month and I save or pay off loans with the rest)
  * I now have about $100k in my 401(k) (maxed out to federal limit each year), a $25k emergency fund, and $100k of discretionary savings in a lazy portfolio  
  * Learned what my parents meant when they always said to me growing up ""it's not about what you make, it's what you save."" I have friends who have always made more than me but are not nearly in the same place of financial security. Buying nice things and going out to Michelin star restaurants is fun every once in a while, but throughout all of this I really learned the value of moderation and how much of an effect that can have on your personal wealth.  
  
  
Now for the advice: I was thinking about whether I should pay off the remainder of my student loans with the $100k that I have in discretionary savings? It's kind of a monkey on my back right now, but I know that the interest is lower than what I would be able to get by investing my savings in the market.

personalfinance,H&amp;R Block online really messed up!,"I have used H&amp;R Block for 21 years, a couple years ago I started using the online version, rather then going to an office and paying them $200+.
Subsequent years of using the online version have been fantastic, This year was a different story!

They said I owed federal $3,309, and state $3,830. I thought.. what in the world? So, I wiped it and did it again, thinking I made a mistake... I got the same results, so I didn't file with them.

Thinking H&amp;R Block made a mistake, I went to Turbotax's online service, and they had a refund of $1,151 of combined Federal and State taxes, and it made sense!

I just wanted to warn folks to be careful, and get second opinions! :)

**EDIT**
So I went back to H&amp;R Block once more, and this time I entered all the data by hand, and it now matches the Turbotax results.
My employer allows for exporting the W2 directly to online services (Which worked for turbotax), however H&amp;R Block failed to work in this case, so I uploaded a PDF. While I initially checked values in accordance with what was in the PDF, I didn't notice any differences. 
So this is a strange occurrence, but all is well, it would seem.

So I guess be careful when importing W2! :)

personalfinance,How much should I put down for a down payment with a VA loan?,"I'm an 0-1 student naval pilot. If all goes well I'll be stationed at San Diego next year as an 0-2.

Amount saved for House ~28k
2018 Roth IRA - Maxed out
2018 Roth TSP - Going to Max it Out

I understand that the VA loan doesn't require a down payment, but I'd like to put in as much as possible in order to lower my initial fees as well as my overall interest rate. I'm looking to purchase a house that's somewhere between $500-$600k in the San Diego area (and rent out a couple of rooms for income).

personalfinance,New to the real world. What's the smartest thing to do with the $1420/month I'll have left after taxes &amp; expenses?,"Hi all!

So I’ll try to be as brief as possible.

I’m 23 and a recent college grad with around ~20K in subsidized government loans. That means I won’t have to pay interest on that amount. My bill for that will be $217 a month. I also have another government loan with a 6% interest rate I WILL have to pay- that loan totals around $4k-5k.

In February I’ll be starting a new job that pays me around 38k a year not including bonus or overtime.

My housing costs are $550 total (includes utilities) per month. My car is paid for, but it’s an Audi so it will cost a bit more in gas but my commute is only 10min each way. Insurance in my state for my car costs around $115/month.

I have a credit score of 721. I have a credit card but my balance never exceeds a few hundred dollars. I only have it to establish my line of credit.

After my monthly expenses (including gas+cell phone) I'll have around $1420 per month. My question— What’s the smartest way to handle that money?

Should I double my loan payments and pay them off faster even though I won’t have to pay interest on 20k? Should I invest a certain percentage of my income? Should I wait until I have at least 5 figures in savings before I start doubling down on loan payments?

As a lady I do like to treat myself to an occasional salon visit or shopping trip but I’m not really a big spender at all. I’ve been able to go 1.5 weeks without spending a penny. I want to be able to save and invest as much as possible while still also being able to afford small luxuries like a pedicure, an occasional weekend nature trip, or a pair of heels.

Do you have any advice for me?
Anything helps :) 
Thank you",finance
CryptoCurrency,Why would you want to #PayWithCrypto?,"With more notice around the movement comes more naysayers who don't believe this could ever truly happen. Let me put it as simple as I can by explaining my own situation and how I've used crypto to alter my financial lifestyle.

Every 2 weeks, I get a paycheck for 500 dollars (I work in the film industry, what can I say) and I put more than half of that into my crypto portfolio. With crypto, I basically have a savings account with huge interest rates that grow my money **nearly 40-75% every month**. When I pay rent, I cash out from my savings and use that money to pay what I need -- which will inevitably make me have to pay a bit in taxes when I have to file in the future.

The idea of #PayWithCrypto is to simplify this and integrate it into our daily lives. The moment big companies begin to adopt crypto-based payments, you will definitely see that capital gains tax (in the U.S.) removed or lessened dramatically. What we're trying to do is integrate some already useable and mature cryptos like LTC, ETH, and Monero as a means of payment for our daily lives. But how will this work?

*Simply put, any time you get paid in fiat you convert it into crypto.*

*""Why the fuck would I do that?""* you might ask. Well, if you put your whole paycheck into crypto and every month that money ends up gaining an interest of about 40% (in USD value) you've basically made an extra amount of money you didn't have before that can be traded for goods and services from companies that allow the option to use crypto. 

It's actually not that difficult of concept to understand. But to get to that point, we need to show companies that there is a huge cryptocurrency community and not only do they think crypto is valuable as a form of currency but will also be willing to spend it in exchange for their services. That's why we start with #PayWithCrypto, companies at this moment have no faith in crypto or it's community. The only way to get them to integrate crypto is by demanding users be given the option to use it, and once we get to that point then we'd have started the first stages of public adoption that'll lead to new advances in blockchain tech.

**UPDATE: #PayWithCrypto has reached 1.5m impressions on twitter, almost double what it was last evening!**",cryptocurrency
MachineLearning,[D] Possible large-scale sophisticated AI network? Neural net vs neural net? [x-post Artificial Intelligence],"Forward: I'm a software engineer, have no need/desire to make YouTube videos or spam. I'm a nerd, and seeing this fascinated me. This is the first time I've seen a possible deep-learning algorithm implemented in such scale, and one of the most successful spam bots I've seen in years.

TL:dr Weird network of Russian/Arabic/English children videos. Many separate channels, some of which are being shut down by YouTube, but most of which are able to pull 20 million views in &lt; 1-week. Most of the videos are of the same people, and the comments section are FULL of A.I. generated comments. There's a few things in particular that stood out to me:

I think they may be using large data to make and implement the videos. Each one from different channels are displayed in different ways, with different thumbnails. There all targeted toward children, which most people know are a large-view, repeat-click audience. I think they may be using deep-learning to find other successful videos with X-criteria. Some of the channels only have the Russians, others have a large variety of children's video's. The thumbnails are perfect implementation to the kind of videos 5-13 year-old's would click on. The video content is usually the same if it's the Russians, but in different orders and times.

Some have comments disabled, some have comments sections full of AI. Most comments seem really similar to the Computer-phile video: /watch?v=XyMdpcAPnZc It seems really obvious to me that this is an AI, and not just a simple crawling bot posting copy and pasted comments from other videos. Alot of AI type errors seem to arise, with occasional garbage-type comments. Alot of similar emoji's, comments in 5 or so languages, the English ones being kind of out of order, same user posting 5 or so really weird comments, and the user's actually conversating in really strange ways to each other.

The fact that this appeared in my recommendation means some sophisticated SEO work. SEO was easy long ago, but it was mostly associated with spamer's trying to game the ""system"". Today it's more synonymous with trying to make sure YouTube's algorithm understands what your content is about, and that its presented in the right way. Once you click on one of the videos, all the recommended on the right turn into the many many channels they use. Maybe the change in language makes it more difficult for YouTube algorithms to pinpoint? Either way it has perfected what is bringing views, I'm not sure if it's bot views that's causing it to register as ""viral"", or if it's really ""cornered"" YouTube's algorithms in a way that hasn't been done in some time.

The sheer scale of these videos. So many channels, videos, comments, and accounts. This makes me think of how they get through anti-bot implementations but more on that on 5. So obviously these videos are designed with a specific purpose in mind. Weird, foreign, bright high-contrasting appealing thumbnails, alot of stuff that people share to there friends with a ""wtf"" attached. The foreign languages, and comments that are praising the video further this. Even still, 20 million views in matter of a week, how is something that huge not red-flagged? I did some IMO back in college, never did much with it, mostly just read alot on blackhatworld and what not. From what I know, they track where user's come from, what brought them there, level's of normal engagement, comments, likes/dislikes, what kind of content, location of content, location of viewers, viral-ity, among many others.

How can so many bots, bypass so many different types of security's? The captcha's, IP tracking, and so many other things. The fact that some of these channels are older then a year, means that the bots consistently keep the level of engagement that's acceptable in Google's algorithms. Google does not release any of this data. So this leads me back to number 1, that they have pulled massive amounts of data-sets to implement these.

I am specializing in machine learning, I begin in the fall. I've been saying for years that this territory is so much more then people imagine. I read the other day about the AI-fake porn reddit that's become so popular, which seems like it's straight out of an episode of Black Mirror. So I'm curious, does this mean that machine-learning is now heading for the masses? Spamming is usually a very-low entry level in cost. But to run this large of a network seems to me that it would require a decent amount of money, and perhaps even a large organization? Just seems like a lot of data collection, processing, and ""faking"" human behavior. I also have a hunch of it being an evolutionary neural net, there is a certain degree on polymorphism between all the content, and if the number 1 data-collection is true, I'm sure the succession of each different implementation is fed back into the next generation. I.e. kill off bottom performing 50%, and all channels shut down &lt; week, breed top 50%, all fitness judged on longevity, views, income, and reach.

So does AI like this render things like Captchas useless? Even the tracking of the ""I'm not a robot""? I feel like this is a big deal, more so then just a bunch of spammers flooding junk. Now it's AI vs AI, the same way wall-street is algorithm vs algorithm. I'm curious to see any other thoughts on this, and perhaps this network I've stumbled upon isn't as sophisticated as I think it is? Perhaps it's a hybrid on mixed user and bot interaction? Or a large network of mechanical turk type ""human-bots"". That only explains some though, cause I have a pretty good grasp on what AI generated text looks like, and those comments REALLY point that direction to me.

I really don't want to share these videos, as it just add's to the problem, but it's kind of hard to talk about without a source. So here are some of the ones I've found, these are links to the channel's themselves, so you don't actually give them any views if you stay on them. /channel/UC5SK4xqbIdgvW84SmTmpEug/featured /channel/UCEREgnbM4H1S6f5JG3IfMUw/featured /channel/UCBn0LGNo4e3EYucsEH9rg4g/featured /channel/UCRzo63EHjjE_PNrtAlmje-A /channel/UCMMIpxNLCGiRNyEtvkwV2IQ

personalfinance,General Advice with First Job,"So I started my first real job in September after finishing law school in May. I'm not in dire straits or anything, I just wanted to check in here to see if there's anything I should be doing/not doing/doing differently to maximize my money. Here's a basic snapshot:

* Salary: ~$68k
* Rent: $1700/month
* Cable/Internet: $50/month
* Phone: $100/month
* Amazon: $99/year
* Zipcar: $15/year
* Bar-related fees: $130/year
* I have ~$100k of student loan debt (thanks law school) but currently have a $0/month payment on an income based plan. My job is eligible for loan forgiveness after 10 years so I don't plan to make more than the minimum payments in the meantime
* I have $1500 in credit card debt but it has 0% APR for 12 months, so I'm paying $150-200/month on that to eliminate it before interest kicks in
* I have a 401(k) equivalent that I contribute 5% to which my employer matches

&amp;nbsp;

As of right now I have my paycheck auto-deposit enough to cover my monthly expenses (plus a bit extra to cover the yearly expenses) into a dedicated bill payment checking account. I also have about 5% of my pay split between two savings accounts (each with over 1% interest rate) for an emergency fund and to save for a trip to Ireland I'm hoping to take.  The remainder (~$500/biweekly paycheck) goes into my general checking account that I use for everything else; basically food and fun. That checking account gives 1% cashback on all debit card purchases. I don't have a car as I live in a city and don't plan on getting one in the foreseeable future.

personalfinance,"I paid off $850 ""in house"" tuition in Nov '17 to a trade school I attended in '13. Can I put/Where would that go on my taxes?","I started and finished massage school in 2013. From that school, I have about 12k in federal student loans and get the 1098E interest form. My loans weren't enough to cover the program, so I had to pay about 2k out of pocket. I paid about 1k over the course of the program and , admittedly, was kind of a scumbag about the balance when I finished. I would get a letter twice a year about the balance with the school, but into the trash it went, my federal loans were happy. In Oct, I got a letter basically saying you graduated 4 years ago, pay the remaining $850 or we're sending it to collections. I work in student loan debt collection and we have a department just for small schools with this in-house tuition loan thing. If I have a student loan that goes into collections, I get fired. I paid the remaining $850 next payday. 

Because this was a tuition expense, am I able to put it somewhere on my taxes? Granted, I paid $850 in 2017 for school I attended in 2013.

It's not the end of the world if I can't, but it would certainly help.

financialindependence,529 as Tax-Deferred Investment Account,"TL;DR: For investors in a high tax bracket who have exhausted their other tax-advantaged accounts, a 529 plan could be used as a tax-deferred investment account even if they don't expect to use it for education.

In order to have a tax-efficient asset allocation, so far, I have kept all of my bonds in my traditional 401k while putting stocks in my taxable account, Roth IRA, and remaining space in my 401k. However, I am about to run out of room in my 401k to continue doing this while keeping my asset allocation (my taxable accounts are growing faster than my tax-advantaged accounts since there are no contribution limits).

While I could hold bonds in my taxable account, this isn’t enticing as my marginal tax rate is quite high (53.1% between 37% federal income tax, 12.3% state income tax, and 3.8% NIIT).

I have realized that a 529 would be a better option to hold the bonds even taking into account the 10% penalty for withdrawals that are not used for education. While the money is in the account, it grows tax-deferred on both a federal and state level and I can then withdraw it in the future when I am in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

Consider the following example. Suppose I put $10,000 in bonds in a taxable account. It earns 3% on a pre-tax basis (1.407% after-tax) for each of the next 10 years. At the end of the ten years (including re-investment of the interest), I will have 10000*(1.01407)^10 or $11,499.51. 

Now suppose instead I put $10,000 into a 529 plan and invest it in bonds. I’ll assume it earns less because the expense ratios are higher within Vanguard’s 529 plans than normal Admiral fund shares. Specifically, I will use 2.84% as the expense ratio on the Vanguard total bond market option is 0.16% higher for 529 plans. Then, after 10 years, the balance of the 529 plan will be 10000*(1.0284)^10 or $13,231.85. Now, suppose I withdraw the full balance then. Now, the original principal of $10,000 is untaxed, but I must pay tax on the $3,231.85 of earnings. Now, I expect at this time to be in a lower bracket since I will be retired. Let’s suppose I am in the 24% federal income tax bracket (income up to $157,500), 5% state income tax bracket (not sure what state I will be in so this is a rough number, but don’t plan to be in California still), and pay 10% penalty for a total of 39% marginal rate. Consequently, I would pay $1,260.42 in taxes and be left with $11971.43. Better than achieved if I just used a normal taxable account.

Obviously, this is not applicable to everyone, but this is a tax planning option that I haven’t heard here or on other FI forums/blogs so I wanted to put the idea out there. If anyone sees any flaws in this reasoning/provisions of the tax code that this violates, please let me know.",finance
personalfinance,Save for Retirement Accounts or House Down Payment?,"I am 20 years old currently working for the Federal Government. This year I should bring in around $40,000.

personalfinance,"In paying debt via stacking, whats more important — interest rate or interest?","I am trying to determine the best way to pay off my student loans.  I have 14 different loans with different balances and interest rates ranging from 3.4% to 6.8%.  According to the stacking method, it is best to pay off the highest interest loans first and then move to the next once that is fully paid off.

What do you do when your highest interest loan accumulates less interest than your smaller rates because of the balance?  I am accumulating around $578 of interest annually for one loan at 5.41% compared to $180 interest on my 6.8% loan.  Would that make it a higher priority to pay off the higher balance that creates more interest first?  

Before I learned about stacking method of debt payments, I calculated a worksheet that'll allocate my student loan payment between all accounts based on the total interest it accrues annually.  I type in the total amount I want to pay for the month, and it distributes it between the loans based on interest.  Would this method be ineffective because it is essentially paying off all loans equally?

I am not one for emotional payoffs by paying down my student loans, so I am not concerned with knocking off one loan at a time, ala the Snowball Method.  I do, however, want to pay the least amount possible over the next 10ish years.  Would that be accomplished by paying down loans like I am doing now — by weighting it through total interest — or by knocking off the smaller balance, higher interest loans?",finance
personalfinance,"Looks like we owe almost $10,000 in federal taxes, help!","My wife and I are filling out our taxes for this year (tried CreditKarma first, then TurboTax).  After entering my W2 information, we were set to get a refund of almost $5k.  Woo hoo!  I entered my wife's W2, and suddenly it made a $15k swing in the other direction - it looks like we owe almost $10k in federal income taxes.  We've never owed anything in the past.  Can this be right?!  How did this happen?


Some pertinent information:

- Between the two of us, it looks like we fall into the higher side of the 28% bracket (married, filing jointly).

- My wife started her job in late 2016, so we likely fell into the lower tax bracket in 2016..

- We bought a house in September of 2017, and had our first child in October 2016.


The only thing I can think of is that our employers are withholding federal taxes for a lower tax bracket.  Does your employer even know what tax bracket you're in?!  How do they know how much to withhold?


My big concern is, being young, having loads of student debt, paying for childcare, and just having bought a house, we absolutely do not have anywhere close to that amount saved.  I have no idea, if this were correct, how we'd be able to afford that unless we can split it up into long-term payments.

The questions that I have are:

I worked 2 jobs in 2017, 1 has been from September on, the second, where I have questions, is that it was a staffing agency, and I did 1 gig for them, I got 2 checks from them; 1 for $13/hr x 4 hours and the other for gas, which was $112. So I only made $165 from that job. 

Will I get a W-2 for that job? Do I have to report this income on my taxes?

My next question is, I closed a 401k with about $1100 in it, I received about $830 when it was closed. Will I get any tax related paper work in regards to closing this 401k?

personalfinance,Best options for my 88k debts,"I have 88k in debt. 21k on two credit cards and the rest in student on two separate services (navient and a school based perkins loan). The two student loans are in deferment, so $0 required payment right now.  10k of one card is at 17%, and 3k at 22%, 7k on other card is at 15.5%. 

I make 950/two weeks net after insurance/taxes/child support at one job, and right now $4/week net at a second job. Working on getting the insurance off of the second job, so that would go up to $60 extra each week after child support.

Spending $925 on rent, 90 on car insurance, 35 on phone, 60 on internet, $150 on gas/electric (depending on season), $100 on water and trash, minimum payments on credit card are $400 a month. I spend about $3 on food per day, up to $10 when I have my child. Gas for the car is $15 per week. $16 per month gym membership that I plan to cancel.

Mainly my question is what are my best options for the credit card debt? My credit score is mid 600s, I'm not sure that a balance transfer is feasible with that. Prosper wouldn't give me any offers on a consolidation loan. My girlfriend will help me out from time to time with food and gas, but that just keeps me barely breaking even, without any real way to get the debts down. I've tried to get the highest interest rate down, but I don't seem to get receptive customer service help on the phone. Is there a better way to go about consolidating/paying down the debt the debt? I'm planning on trying to increase my hours at the second job, though they don't guarantee hours, my hope is to add 5-8 hours a week average for another $50-75. I only recently started at my full time job (first job after graduating) so jumping ship for a raise doesn't seem likely. Is bankruptcy reasonable here? I don't like the idea but I feel like this might be beyond what I can manage at this point. Obviously the student loans can't be discharged, but eliminating 9 years of minimum payments (based on unbury.us calculations) would be put towards those instead.

(Note: The conditions given in this post are time sensitive. These conditions, I believe, will hold true for at least 4 more quarters, but not forever)

Cryptocurrency can be a difficult concept to master when first encountered. However, the fiat system is actually much more complicated and arbitrary than the algorithms behind cryptocurrencies (coins), and increasingly, crypto-assets (tokens). It isn’t necessary to understand the entire world banking system before using your credit card. The complexity of utilizing cryptocurrencies is only slightly higher than having your banker set up an online account for you. A friend can set up your first Bitcoin wallet on your iPhone.

Feeling entrepreneurial? Let’s say you want to open a business. Let’s say you’d like to take care of people’s money. To incorporate as a bank, you MUST have approval from the federal government, who exercises full control over the national currency supply. However, if you simply wanted to take care of people’s cryptocurrencies, you can go ahead and do that, as long as you can afford a float.

It is a valid concern, that the powers-that-be will eventually encompass cryptocurrencies within their sphere of control. However, it is safe, for now, to assume that they cannot. In order to control a set of assets that are super-liquid amongst each other thanks to the already established global network of cryptocurrency exchanges, and that adds up to a rather high market capitalization, financial centers of power, such as Wall Street, needs to organize their efforts. Unfortunately for Wall St. in particular, NY state laws prevent such efforts. The CME Group’s Bitcoin Future’s may or may not have stabilized the price of Bitcoin. Unfortunately for fans of stable crypto-assets, the market is evolving towards using ETH (Etherem blockchain’s base coin, Ether) as the base currency, and ETH’s price is creeping up ever higher.

The governments cannot yet control the cryptocurrency market with their army of hackers. They can break disparate computational devices and paralyze local networks, but they cannot quarantine the World Wide Web without a large international coalition. This may not be possible in the near future because the newly rising Asian powers (Russia, China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Etc.) had enough of the USD dominance and the USA having the final say on most international credit rating policies. Russia has a government project, where a hydro-electric dam will be financed with a national ICO. (As a method of crowdfunding) The dam's power will be used solely to mine Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency in order to 1)Secure Russia’s mining power, and 2)Enrich the state and those who participated in the ICO by rewarding them a portion of the block rewards. China is conducting preliminary studies on ""coinising"" their currency. In Japan, and soon in Korea, Bitcoin MUST be accepted as legal tender and declared as a separate national currency.

So far, I stated my reasons for believing why cryptocurrencies will not fail in 2018. But, what makes me bullish?
Cryptocurrency is starting to make headlines in local news publications. However, the people's understanding of it, even those who are covering the news, is still extremely naive. Because of Bitcoin's meteoric rise in the past decade, it is extremely easy for uninformed people to go shrug* ""I'll toss in a few bucks into something cheap"" This would not make much of a difference for most financial assets because the friction of opening a trader's account stops most people from investing small amounts of money. However, in the case of cryptocurrencies, even those who are not very financially-savvy can purchase crypto-assets with cash, requiring only a smartphone.

The popularity of cash deals is not to be underestimated, especially in Asian countries, who's people distrust their governments’ magnitudes more than the western countries. And everyone, I mean everyone, in the developed world, and most people in the developing world, has a smartphone. And Internet lines &amp; cellphone towers are becoming as ubiquitous as plumbing.
Most people (90%) are only hearing about “crypto” for the first time. When people’s attentions are first called upon this matter, the first thing they do, is to search it up in their smartphone.

Long before the investor has a chance to learn how, and why, the technology works in the first place, the search will have returned a dismal clutter of misinformation, and the investor will struggle to orient themselves in this market. At this stage, the new investor is extremely vulnerable to manipulative content online. Here lies a noble opportunity to provide trust by establishing a properly invested fund, or even simply providing live-time price alerts and spread-adjustments on the clients’ behalf.

Indeed, this will mean that most of the growth will be due to speculation. Yet, the market should have a more stable foundation than the American housing market of the pre-2008 crash, since most of the value in that housing market came from debt. A 5% down payment was the only requirement to become a home-owner. Regular people started playing the housing market, owning several homes, and moving repeatedly to “flip houses.”

No bank will lend you money to buy Bitcoins (because no government will guarantee those loans). Hence the cryptocurrency market is currency made up of 1:1 capital. One may argue that a Bitcoin is not equal to a piece of land. True. However, one may also argue that, it is equally difficult to force a man to part with his Bitcoins as it is to make him part with his land of equal market value.

Cryptocurrency, I believe, is slipping into a major speculative growth phase in 2018. This market is super-liquid. Even regular people started to speculate on the housing market (ending in 2008) and the stock market (ending in 1937), even though, trading on those platforms (a realtor, a pre-internet era stock exchange) were time consuming and tedious. Just imagine who hot things can get when everyone can watch a YouTube video that has a link to buy LOLCatCoinz with their ApplePAY…",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Filling in moving expenses on my tax returns and am a little confused,"Hey there PF, I actually posted this first in r/tax but got no responses in a day so figured I'd ask here:

So last year I switched jobs and moved from NC to UT. As part of the offer, they covered some of my moving expenses. Of the $6200 I submitted (flight, hotel, shipping car and furniture), $5600 was reimbursed to me, in 2 payments. I had $525 added to one of my paychecks listed as ""Taxed Reimbursement"" which was what they covered of my hotel stay. and then the remaining was direct deposited into my account.

When I got my W2, I found that they had listed $4600 under tax code P for moving reimbursement. At first I didn't realize this meant I also needed to actually deduct all my moving expenses, and my summary said I would need to owe $1100 to federal, and another $200 to UT. Once I actually put in the $6200 I actually spent, that changed to me getting a federal refund of almost $450 and UT refund of $80 (after i listed the $1600 from my federal one also in my state one). So now I have a few questions to make sure I understand this:

1) Any reason why my company listed $4600 on my W2 as what I was reimbursed instead of the actual $5600 I got? (the numbers are actually rounded, it wasn't a simple $1000 difference) Do I need to worry about changing that?

2) Should I still put in that total of $6200 in moving costs I spent, even though that makes it seem like I spent an extra $1k out of pocket?

3) If the above two are correct, does that really make that big of a difference in my taxes? It went from me owing $1300 without the deductions, to now getting over $500 refund.",finance

I'm an E7 in the military, 35 with a wife and 3 kids, and I can't stand my job. I work in a demanding field of long days and long periods away from family. My next duty station, though not away from family, would be a lot of time at work. I'm within 10 months of getting out and will have 13 years in if I do decide to separate. My career fulfillment and happiness are at an all time low. I have my bachelor's degree can easily take on a new job in a similar field or something slightly different starting around $80-110k. 

Finances: I can reenlist for about $80,000 for another 4 years, which would pretty much seal the deal as far as a full career goes. For that money, I would intend on maximizing my Roth TSP and IRA contributions. I have about $40,000 in savings, $4,000 in checking. Now here's where I'm retarded and I'm kicking myself: I only have about $8,000 in a Roth TSP 'C' Fund. I should have kept putting money in there, but when the first 2 kids were born I cut out and only recently started putting back in. I also have about $2,500 in a brokerage account in Vanguard.

Debt: I have about $10,000 in credit card debt, which I have been making large payments on to get it down lower. The interest rate is 5%. 

The question: Is it worth it to stay in the military for the next 8 years in order to retire and then work elsewhere or should I give up now and start my new career early? Thanks again for your help.

Edit: To clarify, I'm in the Navy as a nuclear trained operator. I've looked at government jobs and I think I could easily transfer my time I've been in the military, however I would take a pay cut to start out, but after a couple years I would likely work my way up to what I'm making now.",finance
personalfinance,Please help me understand my tax bill (possible w4 issue),"I just began filing my taxes (with Free Tax USA) and I am seeing that I will be hit with a relatively significant tax bill and I would like to know why. 

I made about $35k last year, am single, no kids, no complicated or unusual income or expenses/deductions. Its's looking like my federal tax bill will be upwards of $900 (plus more because I incorrectly calculated my health insurance subsidy, but I've already fixed that). State tax bill (MA) is negligible. The only complicating factor I can see is that I work two jobs. 

Income from one job is about $23k and the other about $12k. They are both normal hourly wage jobs for which I received w2s. Federal tax withheld from $23k job was $1985 and federal withheld from $12k job was $280 (this seems low?). It's possible that one of my w4s is filled out with 2 allowances instead of 1 because I started one job first and would have put an allowance for only having one job (I started both jobs a couple years ago, but made significantly less money previously). I will resubmit both of my w4s for this year to be safe, but want to make sure I do it correctly. 

**Would that extra allowance have accounted for the taxes owed? And would filling out both w4s with 1 allowance each be the best course?**

I have gone through the multiple jobs worksheet on the w4, but because I only made about 12k from my lower paying job, the worksheet didn't have me change anything (unless I misunderstood the directions). 

I sincerely appreciate any input. I know a lot of folks on here advocate for owing some taxes at the end of the year to avoid the ""interest-free loan"" but at my income, this is much more than I am comfortable with. Luckily, I have a healthy emergency fund (thanks to this sub!), so I can absorb the hit, but I would very much like to avoid this is in the future.",finance
investing,Bill Miller's letter to shareholders March 2009,"Just to keep some perspective.  The stock market doesn't always go up.  Miller's Legg Mason Opportunity Trust fund fell 85% peak to trough in the crisis, from $22.51 to $3.37.  He did, however, go on to have a market-beating track record even with this decline.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1096338/000119312509046308/dncsr.htm

Most major stock indices were down significantly in 2008. The S&amp;P 500 Index was down 37.0%, its worst year since 1937. Other U.S. indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (“DJIA”) and NASDAQ Composite IndexF fell 31.9% and 40.0%, respectively. Globally, stocks fared just as poorly. Major indices were down 65% in China, 46% in Hong Kong, 41% in Japan, 28% in the UK, 73% in Russia and 53% in India. Both growth and value strategies suffered as the Russell 1000 Growth IndexG dropped 38.4% and the Russell 1000 Value IndexH was down 36.9%. Financials, at the heart of many of the system’s problems underperformed other sectors. The S&amp;P 500 Financials IndexI dropped 55.3% for the year. Sectors associated with relative stability outperformed, with the S&amp;P 500 Index’s Consumer Staples and Health Care sectors losing 15.4% and 22.8%, respectively.

While the last quarter was the worst, credit problems plagued the markets all year long causing stocks to fall in every quarter. The U.S. financial system was at the center of the storm. Continuing trends started in 2007, credit spreads widened, home prices declined, credit issues expanded and financial companies suffered large write-downs. By mid-year, the S&amp;P was down 12% for the year, Case-Shiller home prices had fallen 19% from the 2006 peak and unemployment had risen to 5.5%. Crude oil prices peaked in July at $147 per barrel as many believed the supply of oil would have trouble keeping up with growing demand in China, India and other emerging markets. Conditions deteriorated in the fourth quarter. In September, the government nation- alized Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae by placing them into a conservatorship. A crisis of confidence followed, and the government was forced to supply AIG with financial assistance, while Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. The credit system stopped functioning as investors rushed to safety, liquidity dried up and panic ensued. The day of Lehman’s bankruptcy, 3-month Treasury yields fell 66 basis pointsN (“bps”) to 0.88% and TED spreadsO jumped from 135 bps to 201 bps. One of the largest and oldest U.S. money market funds “broke the buck” dropping below a $1 net asset value (“NAV”)P and investors rushed to pull their money. The stock market suffered two consecutive crashes, in October and November, dropping over 22% month-to-date at each respective monthly low. The result of the trauma was massive losses throughout the system resulting in one of the worst declines on record. Through the November low, the S&amp;P 500 Index had experienced a 53% correction from the October 2007 high, comparable in size to the 2000 Tech Bubble, 1973 Oil Crisis or the initial 1929 Crash (through the 1929 low). A 20% rally off the November bottom wasn’t enough to stop this from being the third worst quarter and the worst year in the post-Great Depression era. A flight to quality assets continued through year end, as evidenced by negative one- month Treasury yields.

The market made its bottom around the time the government supported Citigroup for the second time, injecting more capital into the bank and guaranteeing some of its assets against losses. Throughout the year, the government responded to the unfolding crisis with a number of measures. The Federal Reserve Board (“Fed”)Q lowered its target federal funds rateR to between 0% and 0.25% from 4.25% at the beginning of the year, and announced a variety of programs to provide liquidity to the system, including increasing lending to banks and buying mortgage-backed securities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced a guarantee program for money market funds in September and injected capital into banks. Congress passed a $150 billion stimulus bill in February, followed by a $700 billion bailout plan in October (the initial failure to pass this plan caused the market much angst). By the end of the year, the economy was suffering from all the harm done to the system. December’s unemployment rate reached 7.2%, crude had fallen over $100 to a low of $31.41 and deflation, rather than inflation, was the concern. Also, the National Bureau of Economic Research (“NBER”) officially declared that a recession had begun a year earlier.

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2008, Primary Class shares of Legg Mason Opportunity Trust returned -65.49%. The Fund’s unmanaged benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, returned -37.00% for the same period. The Lipper Multi-Cap Growth Funds Category Average returned -41.87% over the same time frame.
Underperformance of the Fund was driven mostly by overweight positions in areas of the market most hurt by the credit crisis, namely the Financials and Housing sectors. Also, the Fund pursued a valuation-based strategy, which proved unsuccessful in a year where valuation strategies underperformed as valuation spreads reached an all-time wide of 4.5 standard deviations. Investors’ risk aversion wreaked havoc on any names with debt or deteriorating business conditions. Individual names in the Fund that most hurt performance tended to be the most levered companies, including Level 3 Communications and Domus Co-Investment Holdings (Realogy), as market fears increased about credit availability. Other top detractors included NII Holdings, Amazon.com and Eastman Kodak.

10% - s&amp;p 500 large cap index fund

30% - company stock (no fees, large corporation)

60% - 2060 fidelity target date fund 

On this subreddit, I’ve read advice stating that it’s a good strategy to contribute to my 401k up until company match, then max out a Roth IRA if you believe you’ll be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, then max out 401k.

I’ve recently finished paying off ~80k of private student loans over the last 3 years. I still have 24k left in federal, but that’s another story. With the private loan gone, I’ve wanted to increase my retirement contribution by 5% (was only doing 6% company match beforehand) to get above Fidelity’s recommended 15% (6+4.5+5==15.5%).

I use fidelity NetBenefits provided by my company. We have an option for Roth 401k contributions. There’s not too much info on Roth 401ks, but I’m curious what people might think I should do in regard to my current status and goals.

Does anyone know if I could change my entire contribution to 11% Roth 401k? I understand the company match is pre tax. 

So the benefit of Roth is paying tax now in hopes that I will have higher tax rate at the time of withdrawal, correct? So I’d essentially be saving money on taxes in the future.

Edit: Paragraph below is false.

The benefits of pretax is reducing my taxable income which generally means the government will give me a slightly larger refund because I’ve paid more taxes than I am required based on new lower taxable income.


Would anyone recommend me changing my current contribution status, perhaps changing to a more flexible Roth IRA with better investment options? Did I provide enough information? 

My goal is every 5 years to increase my contribution 2-5%. I typically receive an annual raise of 3-8%. Moving jobs would garner a much larger raise, but I am currently in a program where my company is paying for my masters degree. Not sure if this info matters.

Thanks all. You’ve been great to me. I recently hit a huge student loan payoff milestone, so I’m back for some more good stuff.

personalfinance,Underpayment of estimated tax penalties,"I am a graduate student who was a W-2 employee for half of 2017 and paid on stipend (with no taxes withheld) for the other half of 2017. I did not make estimated tax payments this year. 

My university included my spring 2018 stipend on my 1098-T for 2017 (even though they did not send this money to me until January 2018), which brings my taxable income way up. This means that my total federal tax owed will be over $3000, while federal taxes withheld were only $1600 (which is less than total federal taxes owed for 2016). In addition, New York state taxes owed are over $1600, and $500 were withheld. So it looks like I will be subject to penalties for underpayment of estimated tax.

I am wondering how much I can expect this penalty to be (both federal and for New York State). Also, is there any way to contest this penalty since I did not *expect* to receive my Spring 2018 stipend in 2017 (and in fact I did not receive it until 2018)? And my final question is, do I have to initiate paperwork to pay these penalties, or will the IRS notify me first?

Edit: I re-read the paperwork for my fellowship, and it does not give any details as to when stipends are paid, but I suppose I could have contacted someone at my university to try to obtain a disbursement schedule.",finance
personalfinance,"In order to get the lowest lease price possible, you must learn how to calculate a lease. Here's a long and in-depth guide to how leasing works, plus real world examples from my most recent lease.","I have seen a lot of posts recently about best practices with car buying, but I haven't seen anything on _how to_ lease a car. So I figured I'd write this up! 

Ok, let's get this out of the way right away: Leasing isn't for everyone. In fact, it's probably a bad idea for most people. But if you are going to lease, you need to know how leases work and where they get the numbers in order to get the best deal. And knowing the numbers may actually make you realize it's a terrible deal and to stay away. 

But for this post, I'm not debating the merits of leasing, just explaining HOW the math works, what your costs actually are and how to realistically minimize those costs. 

This post will include the following info:

- The math behind the calculation
- What kind of car to look for
- Where to find the info you need
- How to negotiate the best lease

***The Math***    

Let's start with how the lease monthly payment is calculated. 

The formula is: Payment = Depreciation + Finance charge.    
Your depreciation is: ((Capitalized Cost - Residual Value) / Number of Months)   
Your Finance charge is: ((Capitalized Cost + Residual Value) * Money Factor   
So your total formula is: Payment = ((Capitalized Cost - Residual Value) / Number of Months) + ((Capitalized Cost + Residual Value) * Money Factor)

Pretty simple right? So what do those things mean?

Capitalized cost: This is the amount financed. Did you know in a lease, you are actually financing the depreciation? This can be higher or lower than the price of the car, depending on whether or not you are putting money down, rolling over negative equity, or tacking on fees into your payment. The lower the better!

Residual value: This is what the manufacturer (or the bank, if using a separate lease provider) thinks the car will be worth at the end. It's expressed as a percentage. 50% or 0.50 means they think it will be worth half as much in the end. The more miles you want, the lower the residual will be. Residual can also vary by trim package (i.e., the ""Limited"" has a higher residual than the ""Sport""). The higher the better!

Money factor: This is the interest rate. For some reason, it's always actual interest rate / 2400. So 4% = 0.0016 and 0.9% = 0.000375. The lower (more zeroes) the better!

Number of months: How long you want to lease for. Sometimes manufacturers juice the leases depending on months. For example, VW wanted to move Jetta GLIs off their lots a few years ago, and had insanely inflated residuals and ridiculously low money factors on 2 year leases, making them about $100/mo less than a 3 year lease.

Refundable security deposits: This is expert level leasing. Almost no one knows about it, even dealerships. But some banks allow you to put down a refundable security deposit in order to lower your money factor. This is usually for people with low credit to secure the rates of someone with higher credit, but some let people with top tier credit put down money to get an even lower rate. I was told by the finance manager and the sales manager at one Toyota dealership that I was wrong. I asked them to call Toyota, and they came back and said ""well, you learn something new everyday"". If you are doing a refundable security deposit, simply calculate if the reduced payment on your lease will be higher than the guaranteed return on your money. In other words, if you put down $3000 and get $20/mo off, at the end of 3 years you'll have $3000+20x36 = $3,720. That's a 7.44% guaranteed return!

***Type of car to look for***   

To get the cheapest lease possible, you want to find a car that the manufacturer is discounting (this will reduce your 'cap cost'), which has a naturally high resale value (think Honda or Toyota), and a low money factor (triple zero!). 

You can monitor for specials, search online for deals, or call around when you are looking for a car. If manufacturers are advertising cheap lease deals, it probably means they are either discounting the car or offering a really cheap money factor. Just realize that if it's being advertised, you can do better by negotiating. 

As with anything, google is your friend as well: I got my parents a great lease deal by googling ""current lease deals"" and finding out that Mazda was basically doing interest free leases - they're driving a $30k car for $315 a month, with zero money out of pocket.

***Where to get the info***   

So now you know you want to lease a car. You need to start filling in the blanks. What are the sources of this information:

- Dealerships. They won't tell you easily, but if you make it clear you are a serious buyer, they'll share the real info with you. I've found that sales managers and internet departments are the most likely ones to share the info.
- Edmunds TMV. This a great source to find out how much cars are actually selling for in your area. You can option the car and price it out and see if it's realistic to get a car below invoice or at msrp or somewhere in between.
- CarGurus. I've found this site/app super helpful for knowing what specific cars are available in an area, what the average price is, and how long the car has sat for.
- Edmunds vehicle specific forums. This is the best source I've found for up to date residuals and money factors. The mods of the forums answer specific questions on current vehicle offers.
- Google. If you google ""money factor + residual + [make/model]"" you might find another source that will break it down for you. 

I like to find all of the numbers, plug them in, figure out what the monthly payment would be, and then start calling dealerships to confirm my numbers are right. This makes negotiation easy - figure out what you want to pay, figure out a reasonable price, and then find someone who will sell it to you for that. Speaking of...

***The negotiation***   

Here's where it can get tricky. Even if you know the numbers and know what you're trying to do, they'll still try and add stuff on. There are curveballs everywhere. 

Also, it's going to be rare that you'll find a sales person who will dive into calculating at this level. They will ask you about monthly payment, your trade-in, what you want to pay. You need to be firm and stick to your plan. The last time I leased this led to me walking out of one dealership after they wouldn't play ball. Their loss, I walked into one the next weekend and leased the same car for LESS than I was willing to pay at the first one. 

The key strategy is this: _focus on the sale price of the car_. You already know the money factor and residual. Those are driven by the bank and the dealer can't budge (unless they find you another bank). You want to negotiate the lowest sale price possible. This is where the Edmunds TMV and Cargurus info is so helpful.

Do not talk about down payments. Do not talk about monthly payments. Do not talk about trade-ins. Do not talk about _anything_ except the sale price of the car.

Why is this so important? Because the residual is always calculated based on the MSRP of the car. But the closer the residual is to the sales price, the less depreciation you are financing. So the lower ""sale price"" you can base the lease on, the cheaper your payment!

Some other tips to think about when negotiating: 

- Never put money down. All a downpayment does is reduce your cap cost. But if you drive off the lot that day and get slammed by an 18 wheeler and have the car totaled, you'll never see that money again. NEVER PUT MONEY DOWN.
- If you can, sell your car privately. Don't trade it in on a lease. Why? See above. It's money, and it may disappear. There are obviously exceptions to everything, but in general, don't trade a car in.
- Watch for additional fees. Dealers charge for document fees ($100-$500, may or may not be negotiable) and a host of other factors. Ask for these to be separated out, then decide if you want to lease them. When your money factor is near 0, you may be ok with ""financing"" these costs. But you may just also want to pay them up front (note: this isn't a down payment).
- Taxes: these vary by state, but in my state they're based on a prorated lease rate. So it's a monthly payment of (6.5% x calculated monthly payment) is added on to your total payment.

So what are some real world examples:

I currently lease a 2017 Toyota 4Runner Off Road Premium. The MSRP of my car is $40,500. Toyota was running a lease special of $399/mo with $2,999 down, plus taxes and fees for a base SR5 that goes for about $37k. Seems like a great deal, right? And I should be paying more for a more expensive vehicle than their current special, right?

Well, I looked up on edmunds and found out that the car was actually selling for closer to $38k. Cargurus confirmed this, and also showed that several were available near me and had been sitting on lots for a couple weeks. I did some research and found out the residual was high for a 3 year, 36k mile lease (I think 65%) but the money factor was kind of meh (0.00225). Let's see the differences, using the MSRP:

Payment = ((Capitalized Cost - Residual Value) / Number of Months) + ((Capitalized Cost + Residual Value) * Money Factor)

((40,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = ($40,500-$26,325)/36 = $393.75 +     
((40,500+ (40,500 x .65)) x .00225) = $150 = $544/mo .   

Ok, now let's play around with this a little bit. Let's remove $3000 from the ""capitalized cost"" after we learn that the average Edmunds selling price is $2500 below MSRP (and we're going to negotiate a little better than average).   

((37,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = $310 + ((37,500+(40,500 x .65)) x .00225) = $143 = $454/mo

We just dropped almost $90 off the price by knowing what we can actually get the car priced out. How do we lower the price a little more? Turns out, Toyota will drop the MF from 0.00225 to 0.00153 if you put down $3600 in fully refundable security deposits, returned in full at the end of lease completion. Let's run the math again.

((37,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = $310 + ((37,500+(40,500*.65)) x .00153) = $98 = $408/mo

Another $50 off. We dropped our interest rate from 5.4 to 3.67 and the price came down accordingly. 

Now, let's plug the same numbers in and push for a dream price: $36,500. That gets my payment down to $379. With a tax of 6.25%, my final payment will be ($379*.0625)+$379 = $402. Since my goal is $400, it's now to time to call some dealerships and see if they'll play ball.

I took out my CarGurus app, found what was on their lots, did the exact math based on exactly how they were optioned (typed the same exact cars into Edmunds), and then made specific offers and was transparent about the info I knew:

""Hello dealer, I see you have a 2017 4runner on your lot with XYZ options. I believe the residual is 65%. My research tells me the money factor is 0.00153 with a $3600 refundable security deposit. If you'd be willing to base a lease off of a cap cost of $36,500 with no money down, then I will come in today to sign paperwork"".

Notice a few things: I share numbers that show I'm serious and have done research. I make an offer and tell them I'm ready to close the deal. I don't mention monthly payment. I confirm the numbers. 

The results of this effort: Two dealers were interested. One dealership told me to come in, then wouldn't move off MSRP. When I complained to head of biz dev at the dealer, he told me I obviously worked for Toyota - ""why don't you just use your own discount to order it from the factory?"". He was serious too, and said that no one who wasn't in the car industry would have the knowledge or info I had. I sent him links to CarGurus and Edmunds and never went back. The other dealer told me to come in.

Now here's where it got interesting. The Sales Manager asked if I'd be open to working with another bank besides Toyota. He brought out a sheet from a local credit union and shared their numbers (this is something I've seen that happens when you make it clear you know what you're talking about and are serious about buying: they stop BS'ing you). 

The money factor on this bank's lease was .00165 (3.96%). Higher than Toyota's lowest, but no security deposit. And the residual was 0.68, also higher than Toyota's.

((37,500 - (40,500 x .68))/36 = $276 + ((37,500+(40,500 x .68)) x .00153) = $107 = $384/mo

Another $25! Now this is getting good. Now's when we started the real negotiation. I pushed for $36,500 and said I'd sign on the spot. We ended up settling on $36,900 after some back and forth. 

Final price: $366 for the car, $23 for the tax, $389/mo total, $1500 out of pocket, $40,500 car.
What was Toyota's advertised deal at the time? $399/mo, $3000 down (includes fees), for a ~$37,000 car.

So by knowing how the lease works, I got significantly more car for less money per month, no money down, and the same out of pocket costs!

Now, we still had to finalize a couple other things:

- Gap insurance: You need this on a lease. The bank I was leasing included it, but apparently Toyota does not. So Another $10/mo or so in savings.
- Acquisition fee: Unfortunately, the bank makes you pay an initial fee to take possession of the car. In my instance, it was about $800, which was about $150 more than the Toyota lease. I could have added this to the cap cost and paid about $20/mo more, but I decided to pay this up front.
- First month's payment: Varies by manufacturer, but I chose to pay this up front as well.
- Plates, title, registration, etc: Varies by state. I paid them up front as well
- Document fees: Dealerships often inflate these to make money, since they often don't make money on the car itself. You can push and negotiate on these, but sometimes they'll waive them and sometimes not. And if they do waive them, you'll probably pay for it in the sale price of the car. I'm ok with a business making some money, as long as I know exactly what it is. I paid this up front as well.

If I had rolled all of those fees into the lease, I would have basically been financing $1500 at 4%. Now there's the argument that if I rolled it in and got into an accident, the gap insurance would basically pay for it. Overall, it would have added about $50/mo to the cost of the lease, so I paid it all up front.

So in the end, I took possession of the car for $1500, didn't have a payment for 30 more days, and now owe $389/mo for the next 3 years on a $40k+ truck. If I want to buy it in the end, it's simply the residual cost ($27,540). If I choose to buy it out before then, it's simply a matter of getting a loan or writing a check for the current buyout price that month.

So to summarize, if you are going to lease:

- Know how a lease works
- Use your internet resources to find out the current manufacturer rates for your car, but be open to different banks
- Learn the points to negotiate the lease on
- Don't negotiate monthly payment
- reach out to multiple dealerships, but be straightforward, respectful, and up front.
- Don't put ""money down"", but realize it may make more sense to pay some things up front.



***Bunch of Edits/follow-ups:*** 

- well, I didn't expect the front page and 2 golds (thank you!). I was just trying to do a knowledge dump that I could share if people had questions on their lease. I always assumed my pitbulls or cat would be the thing that got me to the front page.
- the audience was /pf, which is generally against leasing. I wasn't interested in that debate, and there are plenty of sources out there to decide if a lease is for you or not, or when it makes sense and when it doesn't. Leasing isn't necessarily the cheapest way to drive (although it can be), but sometimes there's more to life than spending the least amount of money as possible to make it through your day. But there's no reason to overpay for something that you are getting, especially if understanding how it works can save you money. 
- if you are going to lease, please do more research than this post! I was just sharing what I've learned. I wanted to share the numbers from mine to show how the payment can go up and down, and then shared where I found the numbers and how I approached the process. Not trying to claim it is the *best* way, just that if you are going to lease you should understand the mechanics of it.
- I got a few PMs and messages that I said not to put money down and then I did. This is a valid criticism. The first payment is due at some point and I'd rather use my rewards card than ACH for that, so the only out of pocket money I paid was the acquisition cost, doc fees, and title/reg, which was about $1100 total. In hindsight, I should have just rolled that all in and had a higher monthly payment. At the time my reasoning was that it's not cap cost reduction and I didn't want to ""finance"" the acquisition cost. In hindsight, the same logic applies - if the car got totaled, I'd be out that money. So do as I say, not as I do!
- thank you to everyone who provided feedback on typos and errors. I believe I fixed all of the math format edits and mixups on switching cap cost and msrp. If you see any other errors, feel free to PM me and i'll fix them.
- several people mentioned leasehackr.com. it's an awesome site and has a great calculator. If you aren't comfortable with building your own spreadsheet, just use theirs! They also have great breakdowns on things like the deal of the month if you are just looking at getting cheap leases.
- as someone said in the comments, please be respectful to folks if you're buying a car. I personally think having #s and doing research makes it easy for everyone because it removes the ""is this guy BS'ing me?"" part. Even the dealership that I walked out of in frustration, I thanked the sales guy for his time and told him to call me if his sales manager was willing to budge on price. But the dealer i did buy from, the sales manager said ""you'd be surprised how many people think I'm trying to screw them when I offer leasing through our 3rd party bank"".

And finally, I'll say it again: if you are going to lease, please research beyond this post. Don't make 3 year commitments for thousands of dollars based on one guy's post! Hopefully my post helps you understand a little more how it works and provides a starting  point for research, but it wasn't meant as a be all and end all comprehensive guide!",finance

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation Loan or Avalanche/Snowball Method?,"Last year I accepted a recruitment offer from a restaurant concept that required us to move across state.  A month later the business closed when the owner skipped town, defaulting on millions in loans and not paying employees.  This resulted in a loss of a month’s income plus moving expenses that were never reimbursed (I’m out about $6k).  I was able to secure a new job with a $15k/year pay cut but my wife only recently found employment in November.   As expected our finances took a serious hit between almost 2 months without income plus the pay cut.  We went from almost no debt to substantial credit card debt and having to take our emergency fund down by half.

The BBY and Syncrony debts are appliances and furniture we bought when we first moved and before I lost my job.  The Capital One balance is a combination of unexpected expenses at the worst time (medical bills, car repairs, moving expenses, etc.), and subsidizing our income over the last year.  The Discover debt is an ""oopsie"" on my wife's part, its a storm we weathered and we've worked through it.

If I could do it all again I would have relied more on the emergency fund instead of credit cards.  But I had never been in a situation like this, and I wanted to keep some kind of savings in reserve until our situation stabilized.  Dealing with a bout of depression during all of this definitely did not help with smart financial decisions.
But, we are finally in a position to start tackling this debt.  We just wanted to get some outside advice before biting the bullet and proceeding.  Our current finance are as follows:


Card| Balance | Interest Rate| Min Payment| Current Payment
---|---|----|----|----
Discover| $6,400 | 16% | $100| $100
Capital One | $10,500 | 24%| $320| all extra cashflow
BBY| $1770| 0% until 1/2019| $27| $160
Syncrony| $2,675| 0% until 8/2020| $88| $100
**Total**| **$21,345**| | | 


* Cashflow (Income – Rent/Bills/Food/Gas) with New Budget (see below)  = $928
* Emergency Fund = $7,500

* Loan Offer:  $22,000 @ 13.99% for 36 months, minimum payment $752, no origination fee

We are projecting that we can pay off the loan by August 2019 if we pay a minimum of $800/month plus all extra income (March and August are both extra paycheck months allowing us to put an extra $2250 towards the loan).  Also, my wife’s car is paid off in January 2019, giving us an extra $360/month in cash flow. I will be receiving a promotion and raise next month that will give us additional income as well.

I’ve calculated paying off the debt using snowball or avalanche method.  But we like the idea of one payment to keep us focused, even if the payoff time would be the same it’s more of a psychological thing for me.

personalfinance,I am 18 starting a career and could use some guidance on student loan refinancing and budgeting.,"Hi, I'm 18 I just finished a boot camp for information security which put me back $25,000 in debt. The loan I got had a ridiculous interest rate (12%) and I'm having a difficult time making the payments (around $545/m). I just recently got a job offer from a big company doing software support and integration making about $48,000.00 a year so I am confident in being able to make payments now but I don't think I can afford rent in Denver as well. My take-home pay is about $2900 a month and most places are around $1000-1500/m. I am looking at refinancing my Student Loan but a lot of places won't do it since it's not a Title IV school :(. As a young person starting a career I have no budget and a lot of this financial stuff is incredibly daunting and I could really use some guidance. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,student loan to pay of CC debt now?,"Hi all,
Stupid question, but just wanted some confirmation:

I'm a 5th-year PhD student with about 10K credit card debt. I've used up an 8.5K subsidized student loan as an undergrad but haven't used additional loans thus far in grad school (hoping to finish dissertation by either Dec '18 or May '19). Subsidized loans aren't an option for grad students, so I'm considering an unsubsidized loan. 

I'm guessing I should request enough money to (besides my research trip needs) use the loan money to pay off CC debt now to improve my credit and not have the CC interest rates (deal with loans once I have a job)?

Thanks for any advice! (history PhD.... clearly not finance!)",finance

personalfinance,SCRA refund 15 years later?,"Got a refund check in the mail today from Wells Fargo with a lovely letter about the SCRA benefits and their committment to service members.

personalfinance,Should I sell an apartment in Europe and invest the money in Egypt?,"Hello everyone, 

I wanted to take your opinion on what would you do if you were in my shoes. My family and I are from Egypt and currently live there but we own an apartment in Madrid where we stay when we go to Spain. My parents and I have lived in Spain when I was younger and we have been traveling there at least once a year for the last 20 years. Spain is a special place for us. We bought an apartment there in 2011 back when the middle east was a mess for about 170k but with renovations, the final price was 210k euros. It's a cute little apartment, however, its far (about 45 mins) from the center the city, in a middleclass area and it is pretty small -it's far from being a dream apartment. 



Let's get to the numbers, the apartment was bought in Egyptian pounds (EGP) back when 1 EUR = 7EGP, today because of currency devaluation 1 EUR = 21 EGP. So basically if that money comes back to Egypt it will have tripled in value. Moreover, because of really high inflation, bank interest rates are extremely high, 20%/yr. The Spanish real estate sector has been declining for years, so the best offer we got was around 160k, which is a good offer looking at the status of the country. 



I had this idea consisting of selling the apartment, converting the EURs to EGP and depositing it in the bank to pick up some interest, it could pay up to 3200 Euros (4k USD)/month. The incoming money and principal won't be touched because I don't want the high prices caused by inflation to eat the money away. The money will be saved and maybe if it grows a lot in the next 5 years, depending on the interest, I might convert the money back to euros (hopefully  EGP will be stronger by then) and buy a nicer apartment. 

What would you do if you were in my situation? We are not in need of the extra money, but I feel like that there is a huge opportunity cost associated with an apartment where 1- we only spend a total of 20 days/yr in, 2-My parents have a (weak) sentimental attachment to it 3- losing value.

personalfinance,I moved to another state for a job. How will this affect my state income tax?,"I've been an IL resident, and in December I graduated from University of IL. I got a job in Iowa, which started in Jan 15th. I'm about to sign a lease to rent a place in Iowa soon. Currently I have IL license plate and driver's license. All my mail go to my parent's house in IL.

I need to figure out how to allow my HR withhold state income taxes. Even the HR is not sure. Please advise me so that I wouldn't pay 100% tax to both states. What do I need to do now?

FYI: IL has a flat state income tax of roughly 5%. Iowa has a progressive tax rate, but it allows you to deduct federal income tax. For my case, the effective rate is 5% roughly as well. I just don't want to have 10% of my income taken away.

financialindependence,"Calculators Galore (Early Retirement, Target Number, and Coast Number Calculators)","Hey,

I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for two years, and I’d like to share six FI/RE calculators I created based on my interest in this topic and I hope this subreddit can find utility in them. I just graduated and am about to turn 23 (I am assuming I am younger than average here, but who knows), my favourite calculator by far is the FI/RE Calculator because it showed me the power of compound interest and that the real difference is in your savings rate, not necessarily the interest rate. When I first started reading here, I used the Moneychimp Compound Interest Calculator and the Networthify Calculator. It was fun to see how money could grow, and I feel like these are just an extension of that original interest. I created them all in Numbers (Standard free OSX program) and exported them to Excel. I don’t have access to excel but I think it put related tables on different sheets so just follow the naming. If someone wants to clean up the excel files for me I’ll update the excel link to theirs. **Download links at the bottom.**

**Early Retirement Calculator**
A large spreadsheet showing money saved based on different saving rates. There is a legend at the bottom showing that the colouring differentiates between three Safe Withdraw Rates (4%, 3%, 2%). I use it by inputing my annual after tax income and scrolling right across to my desired monthly budget, then down until it meets my SWR, then left across to see my possible early retirement age. It’s also fun to scroll to the bottom to see how much I could have if I don’t retire early.

**Target Coast Year**
I think some people have requested this one. It shows you when you can start to coast and when you can fully retire based on savings goals you input.

**Target Number**
A basic calculator that shows how much money you need to save in order to retire. It gives you the total amount needed to save, and then breaks that down into annual and monthly saving goals.

**Target Amount**
If you already have a target number in mind this calculator shows you the amount you need to save in annual and monthly goals, as well as showing you how much you will be able to spend in retirement at five different safe withdraw rates (4%, 3.5%, 3%, 2.5%, 2%).

**Target Year by Target Number**
A very simple calculator similar to the target number calculator that shows you when you can retire based on savings goals you input.

**Target Year by Target Amount**
Similar to the Target Year by Target Number calculator but uses a set target amount goal that you input.

**Notes**
I am no spreadsheet expert, and these are completely made up based on what I wanted to calculate in my own life. Best I can tell the calculators are accurate to +/- 1 year, so take it with a grain of salt. There is a lot of hidden table and opacity trickery to hide the unnecessary calculation cells so be careful when making edits, try to just stick to the input tables that are there. I locked the graphic tables in Numbers, but have no idea if this transfers over to excel. In the sheet names I used “Number” to refer to the full amount of retirement saving, and I used “Amount” to refer to what you will be spending in retirement. (So “Amount” = “Number” X SWR%). I also used the term “expenses” similar to the way MMM would use it. Money is either saved or expended. So be aware that maybe not all saved money will be invested, but saved for future expenses.

personalfinance,Acquired some money and want to use it to take a chunk out of student loans.,"I'm 24 and I have $51,000 in private loans and $25,000 in federal loans. I make $60,000 a year and have a $450 car payment, $450 private loan payment, $280 federal loan payment, $100 phone payment, and $300 in other revolving debt.

personalfinance,Federal taxes owed increased by $1000 after adding additional W2 for new job started a few months ago,"Hi all,

I'm trying to file my taxes in NY for the first time. Have been trying out various programs (1040, TurboTax, FreeTaxUSA) and I keep getting the same results and would appreciate it if someone could explain them to me.

Last year I changed jobs. My first job resulted in $48742.22(line1) in wages. In October, I started a new job and have made $9821.58 (line1) in wages. 

When I enter the first W2 for my old job into the software, it tells me I owe around $300 in federal taxes. However, once i entered the second W2 that number jumps up to over $1200. This seems excessive considering I've only made $9821.58 on that second W2 and I've already paid $1520.05 (line2) in federal taxes on it.

Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I am going to have a really hard time paying these taxes if this is what I really owe.",finance
personalfinance,"Question about investing, decent financial position with small windfall","So I creep this thread quite a bit from my normal account. I have learned so much! I’ve read the windfall threads and some of the student loan threads. I’m not in any real financial trouble, but just not sure what to do in my somewhat complex situation. (I’m sure it’s not as complex as it seems to me) posting from a throwaway because, if i have to ask if I should post from a throwaway...I should post from a throwaway. 

I’m will graduate from a post graduate program next spring (2019) and after passing the appropriate exams will be making ~130k per year before taxes, 401k, etc. I have student loans that match the degree, should be right around 100k total.  Husband currently makes ~150 per year before taxes, 401k, and his bonus. He has zero student loans. We both have cars that we’re close to paying off (paying more than the monthly payment and both have interest rates under 2%). We have a conservative mortgage, ~150k. We both have hobbies, and things we spend on but generally we handle money well MOST of the time. Husband 401k is around 150k and he is early 30’s.  I’m in my late 20’s. We also have invested 20k in a local business with two very successful businessmen to try and get our feet wet with small business ownership. We have 10-12k in the bank as our savings/emergency fund. 

My dad passed away recently, and in addition to property and land, I also inherited some money. My step mom is his primary beneficiary, but she thought it important for his children to have some of his life insurance policies. We have received ~50k. 

I know that amount will pay off the better part of my student loans, but I DO NOT want to go this route. We are already capable and prepared to pay those loans. I know it’s not the *right* financial decision but it’s more of a mental thing for me not to use this money for that. 

So we decided right away to sink 11k into Roth IRA funds. (This year and next) I like the flexibility of the Roth IRA. That leaves us quite a bit that I’m not sure what to do with. We tossed around the idea of a CD or even a few different CDs. I suppose we need to see a fee only CFP?!

Need guidance with my budget.  Our family makes respectable income (gross 97K), but it seems like we are getting squeezed from all sides and I can’t figure out how to “fix things”

Been tracking budget closely for the past 6 months with Mint, banking software and spreadsheet, and less seriously for years so pretty confident about this breakdown:

**Income:** Total - $5600/mo ($3400/mo take home spouse &amp; $2200/mo take home me)

 * Spouse: works full time in IT (management).  Gross is about 4.6K, but pre-tax deductions for health insurance (340/month); a dependent care acct. and medical expenses deduction ($460/month) remaining $700 is taxes/ss.  He does not contribute to 401k at this time (no match from employer)

 * Me: working 20 hours/week, healthcare field.  $2900 gross (2 kids- 7 and 2.5, 2.5 is in daycare part time, the 7 yo goes to a school based after school care part time.  Childcare is expensive in our area.

* Gas: 85/month average, higher if visiting family (250 or 75 miles away)
* e- fund: $600 (Pathetic, I realize.  I am trying to build this a little at a time)

It’s really depressing to have to write that as a college -educated, well employed adults making nearly 100k that we have a budget that looks as it does. Inadequate retirement savings, no kids college savings, and only the tiniest of emergency funds. 


**If you want more detail about budget items read on**:

**Housing:** Median rent in our city is $1,100 but there is wide variability in quality.  Our place is in a more residential neighborhood/better school system- quality of schools varies significantly in our area.  our unit is not a luxury unit, chosen for proximity to work and good school.  Smaller than is desirable (3 bd would be more comfortable given the age and gender differences of my kids- but it is what it is) Moving further out-is an option we’ve discussed, however our commute is approx. 5 min for both of us, so our gas expenses currently are minimal, moving out further to reduce rent (realistically for a 2 or 3 bdrm) by $100 as is typical for outlying areas or so doesn’t net us additional income. Most schools further out also do not have the after-school care services needed for my 7yo.   So we’ve set that option aside.

**Childcare:** I have looked high/low and sideways for daycare.  In our area part-time care is hard to find and demand is high.  Safety is paramount, I had looked into, but did not pursue in-home care, or drop off with an area parent as I did not feel comfortable with the safety of these situations.  My 2.5yo is in the lowest cost care I can find (somehow about 30% less than other area centers).  I have not been able to find a nanny or nanny share willing to work the part-time schedule for less than I am paying for the center care). I have no family in the area to assist with care.  Working part-time has improved our financial situation due to daycare costs, Full-time care for my kids would run $1900/month.

**Energy/gas:** gas heating, electric dryer.  We keep the (non-programmable) thermostat at 65 in the winter, but a lot of this is out of our control, our building isn’t superbly insulated and windows are drafty. As I write this, it occurs to me that I can look into things like pipe insulation and water heater blanket.  

**Internet/cable/landline:** these 3 features are bundled for a significant discount.  I didn’t really care about having cable, but with the price reduction from bundling the services it was cheaper than having just internet and landline.  Landline is a recent necessary addition for family safety and communication I want my 7yo to be able to communicate in case of emergency. 

**Student Loans:** spouse went back to school in his late 20’s after unsuccessful attempts earlier in life- didn’t have the discipline or time management to see it through so worked for about 10 years, then went to school fully funded by loans for comp. sci. He started at an expensive for-profit school that unfortunately at the time we thought was the best option schedule-wise and with his poor grades from earlier college attempts that still allowed him to continue full time work, go to school and parent, switched 30k and 1.5 years later to good state school for the remaining 35K +interest.

**Food:** Breakdown of groceries to other food purchases – meals out/coffee- past 6 months $850 towards groceries, remaining $150 for all other food expenses (meal out, occ. Coffee or lunch out at work-90% of the time work lunch brought from home, and also included is small budget for school lunch 2x/week).  We enjoyed eating out, but really try to minimize d/t cost.  I am on this sub a lot and recognize the variability in food spending, and this is a budget category I am trying to stay on top of.  I will mention that with my move to part-time our food budget came down about 30-40%   compared to prior years (eating out more when working full time due to being so tired/stressed/lack of time).  I do meal prep. 

**Shopping expenses:** the catchall for other things like household items (toilet paper, dish soap, cat litter/cat food and entertainment items) use of subscriptions from area big box store has reduced our shopping budget by more than 50% compared with a year ago.  I rarely go to stores now (outside of the grocery store trip).  Rare clothing purchases, bought on clearance when purchased.  One of our cats has diabetes so requires a more expensive food than generic dry food- a compromise of a low carb wet food has keep his condition under control, more expensive than a dry food, though less expensive than the Vet recommended medical food. 

**Entertainment:** cable, as described above, amazon prime (that we forgot about cancelling last summer and will be canceling this summer, but it’s already paid for for the year so may as well watch it), on Netflix acct with friend for no charge.

Now I have a 401k with an account value of ~$20k and just opened a Roth IRA with $1k

I've been ignorant of my finances since I got my first ""real job"" over a year ago, but this year I'm determined to be more conscientious with my money and to start using it as a tool to get ahead.

After skimming through my 401k statement and the sort of gains I hear is possible with both 401k and Roth IRA, it seems to me that these two things combined would make more money than I'd be paying in interest on my student loans.

So...I should just keep making minimum payments and throw the rest into my retirement savings right?..

My question is what are some of the ways you can balance these accounts and the pros/cons and risks of each?

What if I'm planning on quitting or switching jobs in the near future?  Should that affect my decision?

Also I'm not trying to save money for a house or anything significant.

personalfinance,"My fiance and I are receiving an inheritance of $30,000. Our question is: what should we do with it?","My fiance and I are receiving an inheritance of $30,000. Our question is: what should we do with it?

Our current financial situation is as follows:

* We are both 25 years old.
* Our monthly takehome is about $9,000 between the two of us.
* Our housing cost comes in around is $2,000/mo (including 
   mortgage, insurance, utilities)
* Our house has an outstanding balance of $280,000
* Our cost of transportation works out to be about $1,100/mo 
  (including gas, insurance, and payments on a vehicle).
* The vehicle has an outstanding balance of $39,000
* We spend about $400/mo on food and groceries.
* Cell phone plan and internet is around $150/mo.

We have also been actively renovating our older house, and that takes an average of about $2,000/mo. Those should be complete in the next 2-3 months.

My fiance will be leaving her employment to start medical school this July. She will be taking loans out to do this. When this happens our financial situation will become much tighter with my income being $4,000/mo, and we will likely have to 'trim a lot of the fat'.

I have a lot of ideas on how to do this, as well as potentially increase our income by renting our spare bedroom and bathroom for around $700/mo

Originally I had planned on just using the $30,000 inheritance to pay down most of the vehicle and try to get the rest paid off before she starts school. Not having to make the $775/mo payment while she's in school would help a lot.

Another option would be to put that money into something like a mutual fund. If the annual return is greater than the  vehicle's annual interest rate of 1.9%, it might make sense to just continue to make the monthly payments.

Are there other options we're not considering?",finance

Bitcoin,*[business formation]* **Subsidiaries: Creating a Chain of Entities***,"**ABOUT THE AUTHOR:** I am not a lawyer. I am law student. This is not meant to be legal advice. I have been looking into this for my own purposes and the following is my best understanding of the issue, but may be incorrect.


**JURISDICTION:** this concerns entrepreneurs operating in the United States.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** this was written under the assumption that cryptocurrencies are generally (or more likely to be) classified as ""securities"" and not as ""commodities."" It is possible that if they are instead classified as ""commodities"" in the future, they may not be entitled to any long term capital gain treatment no matter the holding period. I will update this article if any firm guidance on this issue becomes known to me in the future. 



**Why Bother With Subsidiaries?**



In some circumstances, it may make sense for a cryptocurrency entrepreneur to form a chain of entities instead of just a single entity when forming a business. While different options exist, the author chose to use a S-Corporation as the parent company with the specific intent to severely limit future outside investment and to secure pass through tax treatments in case of possible future losses. If your client plans to start a large scale operation with many or accredited investors, they should look into using a C-Corporation, although it is possible an LLC could be more advantageous (i.e., for use in a limited partnership). 



The S-Corporation, if used as the holding company, can be used as a holding company for both other business entities (whether or not related to cryptocurrency) and for cryptocurrency coin holdings. The benefit of this model is that the investment income passes through to the shareholders of the S-Corporation as long term capital gains.



You'll want to counsel your clients to be extremely careful of selling any shares in the holding company to outside investors (especially investors who do not qualify as ""accredited investors"" as defined by the 1933 Securities Act) because the holding company (especially while its young) may qualify as an ""investment company"" within the meaning of the 1940 Investment Management Act. 



The holding company (S-Corp. in the current example) can hold business assets as cryptocurrencies and benefit from long term capital gain treatment if they satisfy the one year holding period requirement. This initially seems unimportant, but if your client also plans to start a mining business, it will likely make sense to separate the operations from the pure investment assets.



The main reason to separate the mining business from a business that plans to hold cryptocurrencies for more than a year is because of the term ""inventory."" If cryptocurrency coins are being mined in the ordinary course of one's business (rather than as a personal hobby), cryptocurrency earns resulting from the mining operations are classified as ""inventory."" Under Section 1221(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, inventory holdings are not entitled to capital gains treatment and must be treated as ordinary income!!! See also IRC § 751(a)(2) (applying to partnerships). This means your client's mining gains cannot be held for long term storage AND be entitled to capital gains treatment on the gains between the time the coin was mined and the time the coin is sold (without some fancy accounting tricks which are outside the scope of this article and are certain to cause administrative headaches and future fights about valuation). 



Knowing that coins are classified as inventory and are not entitled to capital gains treatment makes it easy to see how a business owner with the intention to hold the mined coins for a medium-to-long term period want to segregate his/her mining and holding operations. You can do this by forming a C-Corporation subsidiary under the holding corporation. Please note that, at time of writing, when a S-Corporation is the parent corporation to a C-Corporation, the two entities cannot file a consolidated return and instead must file separate corporate tax returns. 



If your client wants to raise funds for his business mining operation, they can do so by selling shares in the subsidiary (mining corp.) without jeopardizing their other crypto holdings placed in the holding corporation. Additionally, the mining corp. can sell the coins to the holding corporation for fair market value shortly after mining the coin (being subject to Section 483 of the IRC which deals with ""transfer pricing"") and effectively convert a ""ordinary income"" asset to a ""capital"" asset while simultaneously allowing the business owner to use cash to pay current expenses without having to liquidate coins generated in the course of business (if this is their goal).



Do remind the client that they will need to be able to come up with capital for the coins bought from the mining operation in order for this to work. You might have them look into the SALT lending platform which allows people to use their current crypto holdings as collateral for loans that operate on a decentralized blockchain smart-contract platform with an easy to use graphic user interface (""GUI""). By using SALT, your client will theoretically be able to hold their cryptos without realizing any taxable event and still benefit leverage (assuming the market doesn't dip too far). 



You might also have your client think about holding (in the holding corporation) the coins the holding corp. buys from the mining corporation until the coins are entitled to long term capital gains treatment. After satisfying the necessary holding period requirement, assuming the market is acceptable, the holding corporation could then sell the coin previously purchased from the subsidiary, loan the net cash amount received on disposition of the coin (after favorable tax rates) to the subsidiary (allowing the subsidiary to use the cash to pay overhead expenses which can then be deducted against annual gross income), charge a reasonable and fair interest rate (subject to Section 483 of the IRC), and diversify the holding company's revenue streams by adding a safer, lower-return investment on current gains to hedge against a future downturn in the market.

personalfinance,Took early Roth IRA distribution less that total contributions - why is that being taxed?,"Hello,

I needed some cash this year and took 3000 dollars from a Roth IRA account. The account was over 5 years old and I am under 59 1/2. My total contributions to the account were around 6k. Since the the distribution amount ($3000) was less than my contribution amount, that means I didn't withdraw any earnings, so it should be a tax and penalty free distribution, right?

I'm using H&amp;R block software to file my federal return, and when I enter the 1099-R form for that distribution, it's showing that I owe $762 for the distribution.

personalfinance,Refinance out of FHA to drop PMI...after salary decrease?,"I took a new job about a year ago that hasn't panned out exactly like I would like it to. I have a base salary of $50k plus commissions and I was told to expect somewhere in the $110-130k range (my prior 7 years averaged around $95k with similar structure at different company). Apparently a large customer of ours was lost.

Anyhow, I would like to cut costs where I can until my employment situation improves. Potentially even considering a cash-out refinance to make home improvements (like $30-45k) to keep up with neighborhood.

- Mortgage Payment Total $1725
- PMI is $148/mo or about the cost of a single payment yearly
- Interest rate 4.25%
- Owned 4 years
- Current Loan Balance $205k (Original Price $225k)
- Current Home Value $375-400k

Credit score is anywhere from 785-810. Only debt I have is about $10k in student loans and about $1500 in credit cards (5). No car payments. Savings has dwindled from $15k down to $2k trying to make adjustments. I have $15k in stocks that I'd prefer not to sell due to performance. Wife has zero debt as well, no car payment.

As you can see, my home value has skyrocketed and homes half my size are selling for much more than I paid 4 years ago. I'm not worried about the equity to loan amount.

I'm worried about getting approved again since my salary has decreased and a good portion is commission based. My wife contributed around $25k in 2017 but operated a loss in 2016 and 2015.

personalfinance,I get a W-2 and my husband is 1099. Despite pre-paying estimated taxes this year we still owe over $8k; what did I do wrong?,"The title is the TL;DR.

Last year, my husband started working as an independent contractor. At the end of the year when we filed our taxes, we owed $3000 and I determined that would NOT happen again this year.

So, every quarter I religiously calculated his self-employment tax (using this calculator: https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/self-employment-tax-calculator) and paid estimated taxes quarterly. All total, we paid $7,300 estimated taxes for 2017. My employer withholds my taxes and I even am filed at the higher singles rate just to forestall any weirdness that may have happened.


Fast forward to now -- I'm doing my taxes and I have checked in two systems (Taxact.com and CreditKarma.com) and both are saying we owe $8000+ in federal taxes. 

For clarity, I put in my W-2 and it says we get a $1000 refund (most likely because of my withholding at the higher rate). I add in our estimated tax payments, and that bumps the estimated refund up to $8300 (the estimated payments + the refund). When I add in my husband's 1099, it says we owe.

WHAT HAPPENED??!! Are the estimated tax payment calculators wrong? How can we get out from under this or at the very least make sure this stops happening? I thought I had done everything right but this year is even worse.",finance

personalfinance,Is there a CD-rates website better than bankrate.com?,"Bankrate.com has errors and omissions.  I'm hoping to find a website with an easily searchable list of all the best CD rates.

But bankrate.com requires the amount to be below $5,000 to get that rate.  And it's not just a list where you can see such errors.  It's a dialog where you have to enter the details such as the amount of the deposit.  So if you enter $5000 or more, they won't even show that bank.  And they have no option for ""all amounts.""

personalfinance,Help me understand how getting married affected my tax situation,"I got married in September 2017, so my husband and I are filing jointly for the year. We are trying to figure out exactly how much getting married helped or hurt our tax situation, but we have messed around with allowances and such much that we have confused ourselves. Here’s what we know;

My taxable income was $69k. I listed myself as “single” to my employer for the entirety of 2017. I claimed 0 allowances.

My husband’s taxable income was $84k. He listed himself as “single” for the entirety of 2017. He claimed 2 allowances.

When we played around with Turbo Tax, it said that if I were to file single, I would get a refund of $2000 federal and $84 state. My husband’s result was a federal refund of $64 and he would owe about $50 to the state.

When we put everything in as married filing jointly, we got a refund of around $2300 federal and $54 state, so when you add it all up, we saved maybe $200 overall? Not really the grand savings in taxes that everyone told us we could expect.

Starting the second paycheck of 2018, I changed my status with my employer to married with one allowance and saw a $200 increase on my paycheck.  My husband changed his to married with one allowance and saw a $600 increase. From what I’ve read, an allowance is equal to about $4500 for the year. My take-home went up by $5200 per year by adding an allowance and his went up by ~$15k by removing an allowance?

My questions are:

Why does everyone say that getting married for taxes is so great when we really didn’t see much of a benefit at all for 2017?

What’s with the drastic difference in what each of us is taking home now that we are married with one allowance?

I am still waiting for him to get access to his pay stub (he can see it the Monday following his Friday paycheck). He may have gotten an automatic raise of 1.9% which would account for a large chunk of the difference but maybe not all of it.

Update: his salary went up by 1.9% plus the additional money he will receive for his 20% retention bonus.",finance

I have a medical bill that is about 300 outstanding that would be paid in full that is definitely getting paid off. The remaining 1200 roughly can go towards one of two cards:

1) a credit card with about $2000 outstanding on it. The card has I think a 20% interest rate on it (Chase slate).
2) a credit card with $500 outstanding on it. This card has a 6.9% rate (credit union). The rest would go to the Chase slate.

I am pretty sure my previous employer started taking out less money as a cost saving measure, but I cannot be sure. Is that even legal?

Edit: I understand that them withholding less wouldn't save them anything. I hate my previous employer and there were some shady things going on that came to light later. They recently settled a lawsuit with a previous partner due to them refusing to payout his shares, which was a breach of contract. They are also in a lawsuit with another previous manager for breach of contract as well, due to them refusing his payout after he was fired, which they tried to justify by saying he was having an affair with one of the employees.

personalfinance,"Explain how the dealership ""refinanced"" this car loan please!","I need help understanding what happened here.  I've searched around and can't figure out what this is called:

Simply put, I have a family member that is overly trusting of salespeople.  They were looking for another vehicle, so I urged them to go to their bank first to try to get financing.  Of course, they didn't listen.  They went straight to a used car lot.  It's important to note that this family member has not-so-great credit.

They had a truck that was financed at a really high interest rate, probably around 22%.  This car lot guy was able to refinance them at 10%.  However, it wasn't handled like a typical refinance.

From what this family member told me, the dealership bought the vehicle for the pay off amount, then resold it to my family member at the same amount (or so they say).  They had to get paper plates and re-register the vehicle.  

We live in Texas, and I don't believe Texas requires you to re-register after refinancing.  I refinanced my car a few years ago, and I only remember filing to change the lien holder.  I definitely didn't get paper plates.

I feel that this is a scam of some sort, but I can't find a name for it.

I think it's a scam because the sales guy said that financing this way would boost their credit.  I don't see how that's the case since they're just taking back on the same amount of debt.  Actually, it makes their average length of account lower, so it could hurt it.

personalfinance,Financing options for vintage Airstream purchase/renovation,"I am in my late 20s and looking to purchase/restore a vintage Airstream.

Here is what my current financial situation looks like:

- Salary:     $100k

- Cash:     $21k

- Credit card debt: $15k

- Rent payment:  $1500/mo

The credit card is a Chase Freedom with 0% interest for 15 months.  So the debt is not currently interest-bearing and will not be until October, at which point I will pay it in full.

My goal is to be in a mobile living situation on an Airstream or other vintage travel trailer.  I am expecting to spend around $40k on this start to finish, which is quite cheap compared to a traditional home &amp; mortgage.  The issue is I just don't quite have the money to get started right now.  

One option is to wait until next year when I have more resources, but with how high my rent payment is I feel like that would be a waste.  My lease is not up until September which amounts to $12k in rent!  I feel like the sooner I get rid of this lease, the better.

So my question is, what kind of financing options would be available for a project like this?  I figure I only need about $20k to get started, at which point I will be able to bootstrap the rest.

I have looked at personal loans on Credit Karma and the interest rates range from 8% to usury.  Even on the lower end of that spectrum would be an expensive loan, but I figure if I plan to just pay what I'm paying for rent now as extra against the loan then I can pay it off early.  And be halfway to owning my own home by this time next year.

Questions/thoughts?",finance
financialindependence,Why does there seem to be so much animosity on most finance subreddits towards those with student loans?,"Posting about needing financial assistance to pay off student loans seems to be a dangerous thing to do here.

You'll have a third of the replies actually providing helpful advice/anecdotes/condolences, but then the rest of the comments will be not-so-gently chiding the person for even taking out student loans to begin with, or scolding them for having moved out of their parents' house before paying off all their loans. Some bring up the idea that everyone should be going to trade school instead of an actual university, or going to a community college/cheap college. People who push back against the idea of moving back in with parents for whatever reason seem to get the worst responses no matter what their reasons are, being told that they ""have to sacrifice some freedom"" and that ""their lives and money are not their own until the loans are paid off"".

For me, personally, I took out loans because no one told me otherwise. College was a must. My parents didn't do much teaching about what exactly came out of taking out loans. There was no talk of ""taking a year off"" to decide what I really wanted to do, so I just went in for English. Now I'm about $80k in debt with a degree I'm not even really using, in an IT job. And because I never knew the difference between federal and private loans, I've got most of the loans with Sallie Mae, who offer next to no decent repayment plans for more than a year.

There's plenty of people who were never given the lowdown on loans and college. Hell, I know for a fact that most of my graduating class were never even given the idea of taking a year off. All of our teachers, parents, guidance counselors - it was always college, college, college. Maybe it's the type of school I went to, I don't know.

I guess I'm just trying to see where the anger is coming from.

Some of us - arguably, most of us - did not just wantonly take out loans with no intention of paying them back. I knew I was going to have to pay back my loans. What I did not know after I graduated was that I would have such a difficult time trying to find jobs that would support the cost of the loan. I did not know that I would be stuck in jobs ranging from $8.50 an hour to $11.00 an hour for over two years. I had been applying to jobs as early as I could before graduation and was getting nothing, even after having my resume reviewed by professionals. I have a Google drive folder just filled with several variations of my resume for various jobs and positions. I wanted to go into journalism, and had gained the experience through college (worked on the newspaper team, but also went on business trips/professional journalism expos) but after two years of applying and applying with not a single peep from employers, I chose to pursue IT instead. Much better results there, by the way.

I definitely see the frustration in seeing a post where someone's like ""how can I get out of paying my loans"" or something. Because yeah, that's stupid. My older brother, who is making twice as much as me or my dad combined as an army pilot, refuses to pay on any of his student loans, and since our parents cosigned on all of our loans, they have to pay. They're retired, but they don't have a choice but to pay since he refuses (and got angry when they asked him to).

But for us, it's kind of just as frustrating to see, ""Well, why didn't you go to trade school? Why didn't you do this, why didn't you do that? Why aren't you living with your parents? Sure, they're overprotective and controlling and treat you like a child, but that's what you signed up for when you chose to go to college. No sympathy here, grin and bear it."" It just feels like on one hand, we're being told, ""Go to college, you'll be worthless otherwise"", and then later, ""You took out loans to go to college?

personalfinance,Bank of America Credit Card APR increased with no notification.,"This morning I got an email from Mint about an increase to my Credit Card's APR. This was a bit of shock because I have been on top of my payments ever since I got it in mid-2016; never late and never maxed out. I called BOA customer service and they told me there was no increase. This was very odd because I pulled up my statement from Dec-2017 and my lastest statement, and the difference in APR was right there in front of me. My co-worker also confirmed they're APR has increased. So maybe its normal to not get notified when your APR increases? Ultimately, I never pay interest because I have always paid down my Credit Cards, but I don't want to be in a bad place someday where I may need to carry a balance over with an APR that has been creeping up over the years.

I just want to know if anyone got a notice from BOA for interest increases. For me, this wouldn't be the first time something changed without me knowing. Both my checking/savings account switched over to whatever they are now, I only found out about my checkings through an /r/personalfinance thread, and then my savings because I wanted to see if that would change as well, and it in fact had changed...2 months prior.

I've already confirmed that my Communication details with BOA are correct, and I've checked all spam etc. So far /r/personalfinance and Mint have been more reliable than BOA.

Any advice/knowledge on interest increases and how(if?) I can stop them from increasing it would be appreciated

personalfinance,"U.S. personal savings rate falls to 2.4%, the lowest level since September 2005","An uptick in consumer spending in December was accompanied by a decline in the savings rate to 2.4%, as reported in this [article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-consumer-spending-rises-savings-134046394.html).

personalfinance,"Raised credit score by 200 points, I have 5 ideas for how to use it and I would like advice","Phoenix, Arizona. I bought a house two years ago and afterwards I tanked my credit score by financing a new car and putting about $40k of new expenses onto credit cards with promotional 0% APR introductory periods. My credit score dipped as low as 580 and has been in the gutter for a very long time because of my high credit utilization even though I never missed any payments. I just finally paid everything off so that I could refinance my house and now I have a good (750+) credit score for the first time in two years and I am wondering what I should do with it. I wrote some of my options below and I have a few questions.

Questions:
1. Assuming I want to pursue multiple of these options, what is the best order to do these in? For example, would it be better to apply for credit limit increases on my existing cards before applying for a new credit card?
2. Are there any good/interesting ideas I haven't thought of?

**Option 1: Apply for credit limit increases on my existing credit cards.**
I currently have 9 cards with a total credit limit of $48,300. A higher limit will allow me to carry more debt while still having a lower utilization ratio, which would help maintain my credit score. Some of the cards will perform hard credit inquiries if I do this, and some won't, but I don't think you can predict which ones will.

**Option 2: Get new auto insurance quotes.**
I am paying $120/month for insurance on a 2016 Ford Explorer that is probably only worth $25k. I haven't had a ticket since September of 2015 and I've never had a single claim of any kind in 10 years with GEICO but for some reason all of the quotes I got from other companies were even higher than this. I think my low credit score has been hurting the quotes but I know that if I apply for new insurance some of the companies will perform hard credit inquiries. 

**Option 3: Refinance Car.**
My Car loan is at a 4% interest rate and I have no idea what the fees would be or if there are significant savings to be had with a refinance but this idea came to mind.

**Option 4: Apply for Restoration Hardware Credit Card.**
I plan to spend 2-8k on furniture from Restoration Hardware in the next few months and their loyalty/credit card comes with a 25% discount on all purchases there.

**Option 5: Apply for a new 0% intro-APR Card.**
I could repeat my tactic from before. In fact, could this possibly increase my credit limit more than applying for increases to my existing cards?",finance
financialindependence,Suggestion for good short article in Spanish about basic investing and maybe FI?,"The article should be in Spanish and written so an absolute ""layman"" could understand. This would be for the U.S. stock market. The type of investing would be basic stuff: basically brokerage investing for index/dividend/growth funds and some bond funds for retirement investing, as well as retirement accounts. These are accounts intended to be held for years (we're 47 now, so depending on when we hit a good number, we might begin withdrawing. Depending on how things go, could be as soon as 5 years).

The primary goal is to explain how this kind of investing--as opposed to speculation--is not appropriately comparable to pure gambling. And how hoarding hundreds of thousands in cash is not necessarily a purely safe bet either, due to inflation risk, etc. 

A secondary goal might be to introduce the idea of FI/ER in Spanish and presented in a reasonable, understandable way.

If there is nothing in Spanish you can think of, I'd take suggestions in English, short articles only.

So my wife and I are going to be teaching abroad (Japan), and we're having trouble figuring out what to do with our money while we're gone.

Our intention was to keep our checking account open with the minimum account required to prevent incurring any maintenance fees with the bank.  We would be taking the remainder with us to get up and running in our new home on the other side of the globe.

Our intention with our savings account was to move it to a different bank altogether, opening a money market account with a higher interest rate.  We wouldn't plan on accessing the money unless there was an emergency of some sort. (edit:  via wire transfer, most likely)

My biggest concern, however, is our mailing address.  Eventually, it will change to a Japanese address, and we will not have a US mailing address.

altcoin,Understanding Trading Pairs and Profits,"Hey all! I'm glad to be part of the cryptocurrency community.

I would like some help in understanding pairs and profits when factors change and affect BTC or ETH, and dollar values of coins.

Here is an example:

Let it be known I am trading in ETH (Ethereum) in this example.

- I buy X amount of ADA (Cardano) at $0.56 (0.00057201 ETH).

- ADA's and ETH's value both increase, valuing my ADA at $0.63 (0.00051000 ETH).

As the value of both coins have appreciated, you can see that while ADA/USD has appreciated, ADA/ETH has depreciated. I've paid 0.00057201 ETH for 1 ADA which now costs 0.00051000 ETH.

I've lost what would be profit if I did not buy ADA and kept the ETH. Fine. But since I can't trade ADA in USD on Binance, what is the best way to go about profiting from this? Is there a formula or particular perspective to view everything in to ensure I reap the appreciations? Do i look at everything in satoshis only, or USD only, or ETH only? Do I trade in and out of certain pairs in certain situations to make sure I make the most I can? Do I trade out into BTC if i wanted to pull out of ADA since I'd be making a loss if I were to trade out into ETH? Do I Buy more ADA with ETH and balance out my investment?

All in all, how do I ensure I'm riding the positive side of the wave.

I understand the importance of doing my own research and educating myself in these areas. I make sure to do so, but It's nice to hear from the community. I appreciate any knowledge, tips, sources. You can provide me links, I don't need to be spoon fed!

litecoin,Would Interest eventually soak up the supply of cryptos?,"I'm going to try and simplify a problem I've been thinking about with Cryptos.

Lets say at some point in the future there is no fiat currency, Only LTC. How would loans and income taxes work? Since there is a limit on the total supply of LTC it can never be inflated. But, If anyone is charging anyone else ""interest"" on a LTC loan they would be creating a debt for which there is no LTC to fulfill. Eventually there would be more LTC owed than even exists. This happens with Fiat, So the Federal Reserve prints up more currency to fill the void. Can anyone think of how this would work with something like crypto that has only a Finite amount? Wouldn't the debtors eventually have their holdings dwindled down to nothing while the loan originators soak up all of the coins AND still be owed more by the debtors?

Feel free to correct my logic of needed.  My current logic goes something like this:

- I create 1000 B$
- I loan 100 B$ to 10 different people w/ 5% interest.
- They each owe me 105 B$
- I am owed 1050 B$, But only 1000 B$ exist.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Student loans, first job out of university, need advice deciding between aggressive or slow payment plan.","Hi! First time posting to this sub, have lurked for a while and really appreciate all of the great advice. I'll try to give as much info as possible for a complete picture.

As the title suggests, I just graduated and am about to start my first job. I am very fortunate to have a starting salary at $62,000, and expect to take home about $43k after taxes, health insurance, etc. I'm moving to Washington, DC, and things are expensive. Here's my budget so far:

Housing: $1100
Utilities: $150
Going out, food, misc: $500 (I will cook probably 85% of my meals)
This leaves me with about $2000. ($3799/month from income, and then minus the above costs.)

I have $41,665 in student loans. $13,874 of this is in a private loan, with an interest rate of 9.65% (still makes me sad to look at.) The rest are federal, with interests rates from 3.7% to 4.8%, totaling $27,791.

My original plan was to dedicate 30% of my income to my loans (around $700/month,) 20% to my personal savings (~$500,) and 10% to my new 401k (about $250, no employer matching.) This leaves me with a few hundred dollars for wiggle room, which I'll attribute to any of these three buckets at my discretion.

I have no other outstanding debt. No car, no credit card debt. My job will be steady and has lots of room for promotions and bonuses.

My question is, should I aggressively pay off these loans? If so, should I focus all of my efforts on the private one? If not, should I use the money I was allotting to my loans for a retirement account or similar investment? Paying them off slowly will force me to pay a lot more, but it'll be easier to live life comfortably and spend on things I'd actually like to (although I really don't live a frivolous life and don't know what I'd spend it on besides travel.) I can also explore refinancing once I've more established myself and my credit (I have good credit, but have only built it over the past year or so.)

I'm also receiving $11,000 annual graduate tuition assistance from my employer, of which everything over $5,250 is taxable. The going rate in my field is closer to $65,000-$75,000 with a graduate degree, so it is definitely worth getting.

I'm currently saving $5,500 per year in a Roth IRA, $3,050 in a HSA (employer matches the last $400), and $4,800 (6% of my income plus 6% match) in a 401k. In total, this makes my taxable income $28,300, and my taxes $3,170:

&gt; - $40,000 income

&gt; \+ ($11,000-$5,250) education assistance

&gt; \- $2,400 401k contribution

I was (un)lucky enough to inherit about $250,000 from my dad last year and want to make sure I'm leveraging the opportunity as well as I can. It's currently in a Vanguard brokerage account invested in a target date fund. It has been invested for just over a year, so it will be taxed as long-term capital gain when I withdraw.

My question is: would it make sense to improve my tax situation by upping my 401k contribution to the $18,500 maximum to lower my taxable income to $12,200 (federal taxes: $1,250), while paying the bills by withdrawing from Vanguard brokerage. This would lower me to the 12% income tax bracket, so the long-term capital gains on withdrawing from brokerage would be null, and I'd save $1,920 ($3,170-$1,250) on taxes to reinvest.

The downside I see is that I can't withdraw the funds until I'm 59.5, which may throw a wrench in FIRE plans, while the upside is an extra almost $2,000 to invest, which is a pretty big chunk of money at my current income. When I withdraw the money, I don't see any extra tax burden, as income from both brokerage and the 401k would be taxed as capital gains.

My other idea, if this is a bad one, is to transition $15,000 from the brokerage account to a 529, which would save $450 on this year's state taxes, and - with a good 30 years to grow before I have any kids going to college - would hopefully be enough to pay for an education.

personalfinance,Payroll company was not withholding federal income taxes,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

Let me just get this out of the way first, because i know I’m going to be reprimanded for this.
I was not doing my due diligence and checking my pay stubs. I should do that, but i wasn’t. I’m only human.


So let’s get down to it.

For a long time i was very irresponsible financially. This was mostly due to a heroin addiction i had in my early 20s and also just because i was just impulsive to begin with. I’m not going to sit around and blame the drugs all day. Years of rehab have taught  me that pointing fingers isn’t going to get me anywhere. 

This led me to accumulate around $10k in credit card debt. However, i always managed to make the minimum payment. So it didn’t impact my credit score in a way that it possibly could have, given the circumstance.

Because of my addiction and general bad financial decisions i also have no savings. 
I have been trying to fix this lately, however, and have managed to pay down all of my credit card debt. 

What i have left is $15k on an auto loan and $32k in student loan debt. 
I did manage to do well in school and graduate with a 3.0 gpa despite having the odds stacked against me.

Currently i work part time in the summer as a photographer, it’s always been my dream to break out and do this full time. And it’s slowly becoming a reality. I made a good bit of money doing it last year. In the off season i work as a analyst at a consulting firm. 
Here’s where my trouble starts..

All said, between the photography gig and the analyst gig i made about 42k last year. 32 of it came from the analyst position.
I wanted to take an extra allowance out of my paycheck to help cover my tax liability from my photography job and i also needed to submit a new w-4 anyway because in the past my taxes were paid by the student tax credit you receive when in  college and i wasn’t withholding any pay from my paychecks.

So i did this in mid July last year, i set my allowances to 2. I submitted and got receipt from the accountant that it was submitted.

So like i said, I’m still not great with finances. I wasn’t checking my pay stubs to make sure taxes were being withheld. Fast forward to when my tax paperwork comes in the mail: no federal taxes were being withheld. I contacted the accountant and she said the payroll company we used made a mistake and ticked the wrong box.

So now I’m in a bad position. I’m about to owe the IRS some money and I’m pretty stressed out about it. What exactly are my options at this point?

I know i fucked up. I should have made sure i was being taxed. I’m trying to get it together but I’m still learning. I just paid off all this credit card debt and now I’m going to owe money to the IRS. I’m a little bummed out.

Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",finance

This leaves me with 783 per month but that's living a completely barebones lifestyle which I know is unrealistic. So here's some random expenses.
-200 fun (Drinks, going out, sports game, gym membership, concert, golf, snowboarding) I wouldn't do all of those in one month but you get the idea.
-150 car (gas and oil changes, maintenance, thank god I don't have a car payment. Sorry Moustachians but I do need a car in my life)
So that brings me down to 433 per month. Assuming I have no emergencies (car accident, injury/hospital bill, speeding ticket, maybe I get laid off) 
So in a perfect year I can save 433 x 12 = 5196 and I got bitten by the travel bug which means I'm likely to at least blow a grand or two on a vacation. I sit here and look at these numbers and I really doubt my self discipline to not spend more than this on random things like entertainment or going out/living life. 

Anyway, saving this much each year and putting it into an index fund really isn't going to get me very far on the journey to early retirement. God forbid I get a job that doesn't even pay this well. Can I get some thoughts/advice? Am I overthinking this and panicking?",finance
personalfinance,What is my tax situation if my only income is scholarships?,"Hi everybody,

This is my first year filing taxes (I’m a freshman in college and I’ve never worked/had any sort of income before). I received a full-ride scholarship to my university, and I am an out-of-state student. I do not have a job and my scholarships count as my only source of income at this time. 

I’ve calculated using my 1098-T that my total scholarships this academic year total ~$24200 and my tuition/fees total ~$9400, meaning that the amount of scholarships that would be taxed federally comes out to ~$14800. 

Since the university doesn’t withhold any taxes from this amount, do i just save up as much money as I can to pay the tax bill when it comes? The state I am a resident of has no state income tax, but the state I go to school in does, so should I pay state income taxes? Since my tuition and fees were paid for by scholarships and not out of pocket, do I qualify for the American Opportunity or Lifetime Learning tax credits?

I tried going to my university treasurer’s office to ask but they just said they couldn’t give out tax advice and that I should hire a professional accountant, which I don’t think I can afford on a Ramen budget, but should I hire one anyway and eat the cost so I don’t get in hot water with the IRS?

personalfinance,Seeking advice about getting out of Debt,"Hey all,

First time posting here. So I am ~168k in debt currently and making 61k a year. I accumulated this debt mainly in the form of loans. I...unfortunately decided to go to a expensive private college that put me ~130k in debt. I had my finances ""stable"" and my car was having issues so I bought a new car(down to ~13k). Lost my job about a year ago and went from 4k in CC debt to 14k. I got another student loan to learn to program computers that added ~12-13k additional debt but increased my salary from 40k to 61k. That's the basic breakdown of my debt. So now that I make more money, I am able to somewhat survive but I am ~$95 in the hole at the end of every month based the expense breakdown I made. This number is realistically more between -$200 and -$400. I am going to get a roommate soon since I live in a 2BR that will cut expenses by ~$550 a month. This would leave ~$300 extra at the end of the month but this will not get me out of debt. I have ~2.5k of my debt on a 0% APR CC but I have ~9 months to pay it off before the interest gets tacked on in full force. My credit score tanked after I lost my job so I lost my ability to refinance my student loans. With how much debt I had and a 720 credit score, I probably could have cut my student loans by ~400-500 a month but unfortunately that's not an option with a 583 credit score. I thought about selling my car but based on current market value and the remainder on the loan, I would not have the cash to buy a junker. I travel ~2.5hrs to a rural town to visit my family so I really cannot afford to lose my car. I thought about getting a job on the weekends but I am required to work on the weekend when it is asked of me, typically does not happen often. Since I am a programmer, I thought about doing side work but I am still too green to do that confidently. Contractors tend to have a bit more demanded of them verse FT employees, from my experience. I cannot file for bankruptcy even if I wanted to due to ~55k of my student loans tied up with the feds and and ~73k having my mother as a cosigner. Another issue, I currently have my federal loans on a income driven plan, which reduces the bill from  ~$450 a month to $0. When this expires later in the year, I would be skrewed again as I would be going into the hole every month, yet again. I make too much money to qualify for that program now. I thought of getting a personal loan to pay off the CC debt so the interest payments would be roughly halved but that requires a credit score above 680 according to the bank I work for. With a roommate, I could start pay off the 0% card before the APR promotion ends but the overall rate of paying off my debt would still be overall, very slow. I would like some advice on what I can do to get myself on the right path out of debt. I am only 26 years old but I do want to have a family, house, etc but at the rate I am going, I will most likily die before my debts are paid off. Programmer salaries do increase pretty dramatically at the 2 year mark if jump ship to a different employer(+10-15k) but I need to get there first... 

Anyway, thank you in advance to anyone and everyone that decides to take time out of their day to help a stranger :)

Essentially, the patent claims that if GPS data is unavailable or is being spoofed, planes can fall back on blockchain data. How is this possible?

After skimming through the patent, it seems like the plane would somehow use the blockchain to compare the position reported by the GPS with the expected position based on the previous position and current velocity. This is possibly, but why is the blockchain needed at all?

Then, if the plane detects that its GPS is being spoofed, it somehow uses the blockchain to navigate for the rest of the flight. I wouldn't be surprised if a plane could navigate without GPS, but how would a blockchain help?

Am I completely misunderstanding this patent? Or is this not meant to be an actual product, but just for patent trolling.",cryptocurrency

Sorry for the length of this post. I'm one of the T-Mobile customers who was gifted with 1 share of stock last year or the year before. This was initially held in a Loyal3 account that I was able to safely ignore because it wasn't charging me anything to have it sit there. At some point, Loyal3 transferred their accounts to FolioFirst, which I was vaguely aware of but largely forgot about because I spent the better part of last year trying to start my own business. Those imminent fees seemed pretty far away in comparison. 

Fast forward several months and, unfortunately, those imminent fees are now upon me. I just stumbled across an email reminding me that I'm about to be charged a $15 ""annual maintenance fee"" unless I start trading, in which case I 'only' incur a $5 monthly fee. The deadline to take action before I'm hit with any fee is 2/1, eep.

Here's the thing. I am a total newbie with little liquid funds to invest, not to mention little to no understanding of how to trade successfully in the stock market to make gains as opposed to losses. I've read that FolioFirst will charge $100 for a full account transfer/closure, which is worth substantially more than the 1 share of T-Mobile stock sitting in my account. They will alternatively charge about half of my stock's worth if I sell my share and wire it to my bank account, though it's unclear to me whether my account would remain open and therefore incur the same ""maintenance fee"" since you aren't required to have a minimum to maintain an account. On the flip side, I doubt I'll be able to trade successfully or frequently enough to make that $5 monthly fee worth it, and paying $15 to keep my share and ""maintain"" my account also seems unprofitable, unless my one share suddenly jumps exponentially to offset the $15/year to not touch my account. 

I don't know anything about stocks, but none of these seem like good options. 

I know I've messed up by forgetting about this until now. Am I missing any other available options that will either let me keep my stock to let it grow (here or elsewhere) in a more reasonably-priced manner, or that will let me cash out/close out my FolioFirst account in a way that won't cost me more than that 1 share is worth?

**TL;DR - Total stock newbie with no knowledge about how to navigate the stock market. Ignored my freebie stock share for like a year, and imminent account fees are now upon me. Willing to close account, transfer account, or whatever else will hurt my bank account the least, and must do so by 2/1. Is there anything I'm missing? Help, I done goofed!**",finance

I had just purchased my first home in October and began taking on a mortgage that i could afford by myself. My fiancee is currently living near her school until she graduates in June. She has already accepted a job offer starting at 96k which will begin in August.

At that time, my debts will be approximately $3,600 for my car which was taken out as a 4yr loan at 2% interest rate in October of 2015 leaving a little over a year left of payments.

Once she graduates, she will be left with roughly 16k in students loans with interest rates around 5.5%-6.5% as well as approximately 6k in a 4yr car loan at a 2.75% interest rate taken out March of 2017.

Finally my mortgage is currently a 30yr mortgage with a 3.875% interest rate paid montly.

We plan on living in this home for about 5-7yrs before purchasing another home.

Now onto my question.

Since we aren't staying in this home forever, would it be wise/beneficial to switch our mortgage payments to biweekly or keep them to once a month?

Also I am currently paying as much extra as I can afford towards the principle every month. Again since this isn't a forever home, would it be more beneficial to add extra toward the principle of the mortgage  every payment or use that extra income to increase the payment amounts towards our cars and student loans.

My main focus is to eliminate the debts on our cars and her student loans first. I would like to add more to our mortgage principle but I'm not sure if would be beneficial since we won't have this mortgage forever.

personalfinance,One of husband's W-2 forms shows ridiculously low withholding for Federal taxes,"Located in NC.

My husband worked 2 different jobs in 2017. He is filing Married but separate so that my defaulted student loans don't affect him. We only got married in May of 2017 and my loans are from over 10 years ago. We are filing with Turbo Tax online, but have not submitted anything yet, because I'm suspicious of this 2nd W-2 that just came today. 

The first job he had was before we got married, and he earned right around $4,500 in wages, and had over $500 in Federal taxes taken out. By my calculations, this is around 12% of his wages going to Federal. 

That job didn't work out and he got another job driving a truck and doing heavy lifting for a thrift store, and he got that around November of 2017. He still works there, but only had it for the last 2 months of 2017 (making $9 an hour). We just got his W-2 for that job today, and I found something super weird on that W-2, especially compared to the other one from earlier that year. On this one, he only made around $1700 in wages, but the Federal taxes paid was only $8!!! That is less than 1% of his wages! In comparison, the state taxes paid was $36 and usually state taxes are lower, not higher! 

Compared to his other W-2 and any that I've seen in the past, something seems super off/weird about only withholding less than 1% of his wages, but I'm no expert. 

Since his paycheck goes into our bank account, we don't get paper stubs, I'm going to call the staffing agency that he is working through tomorrow morning and try to find out how I can view those and try to figure out if it's a typo, or if he's really only been paying that much. 

My real worry is that since he's still working there, whatever this issue is (if it isn't some type of typo), is still happening, and needs to be fixed. I'm fairly ignorant about all this stuff, but I know something is not right and if this continues, next year's taxes will be really screwed up. 

Edit because I forgot to add: He makes around $230 a week, sometimes less. He is not paid bi-weekly, he is paid once a week, (every Thursday). They only let him work 29 hours a week, and we've had occasional snow days when the store closed.  I don't have a job, I stay at home, and will not be filing taxes myself.",finance

Nor is it still listed on the [TaxAct list of ""apps""](https://www.taxact.com/mobile-taxes) (plural -- the ""apps"" page now only has *one*).

CryptoCurrency,NEO breaking records; don't miss out on GAS dividends,"Seeing as that NEO is moving up the ranks to claim it's place in the top echelons of the crypto world, I thought it would be good to post another reminder to new investors that holding NEO gives you GAS dividends.

For a full explanation on the relationship between NEO and GAS, check my previous Reddit post here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7qiyi6/new_neo_investors_hodling_neo_generates_gas/

For now, the thing you need to know if that NEO generates GAS when you hold it in your wallet or on the exchanges Binance and Kucoin. GAS can be sold on exchanges (1 GAS = 70 USD at the time of writing) which basically means that NEO generates a juicy dividend. Unlike other platforms that require staking (Ark, OMG) or platforms that have copied NEO's successful formula, but haven't implemented it yet (VEN), NEO actually already has this up and running right here and now!

The safest way of generating GAS is by holding the NEO in your wallet. You don't have to stake it or anything. Your pc can be off, your wallet closed. You just hold NEO and automatically generate GAS. Please note that if you want to withdraw the NEO from an exchange to a wallet you can only withdraw full integers. So instead of for example 1.6 NEO you can only withdraw 1 NEO. Don't mess this up, as decimals will be lost. Also take withdrawal fees into account when you transfer (Kucoin and Binance have no withdrawal fees for NEO and GAS). Network fees are totally free and transactions speeds are about 25 seconds.

You can also keep your NEO on either Binance or Kucoin. Both exchanges pay out GAS dividends. Kucoin does this daily, Binance monthly (on day 2 of the month). The advantages of holding NEO on the exchange is that you can then easily trade it if you like and you can hold decimals  (so for example 1.6 NEO), which is not possible in your wallet. The big disadvantage is that coins / tokens on exchanges are never truly owned by you, as the exchange could get hacked or close down your account for no apparent reason.

To close off: you may wonder how lucrative the NEOGAS interest is. Let me tell you; quite lucrative and it's getting more lucrative as GAS generation is increased due to lower block times. Currently 6 NEO will give you 1 GAS a year approximately at 20 second block times. That's about an 8% interest rate just for holding NEO (beats having money in the bank) In the near future block times are expected to go down to 15 seconds per block, giving you more GAS. In the end NEO's vision is to have 5 second block times, which would do wonders for your GAS pay outs. To see the actual generation rates, check the site neotogas.com

CryptoCurrency,TAXES - a scenario why crypto-crypto trades should not be taxed,"Let's say on 1 April 2017 I put $100 into awesomecoin and by 1 December 2017 that coin is worth $1,000,000. On 2 December 2017, I sell awesomecoin for shitcoin. I now owe taxes for 2017. The day before I file my taxes in 2018, shitcoin tanks to $1 and I cash out.

So you're telling me I would owe the IRS short-term gains on $999,900 (over $200,000 in taxes) while having $0 extra dollars in my pocket? Yes, I could deduct those losses on my 2018 return, but for my 2017 return I would be f'ed. 

Tell me how this is logical? A logical tax system would only tax your gains when they are traded back to fiat.

Bitcoin,You deposit $1K into the bank.,"You deposit $1K into your bank account. 

The bank, operating under fractional reserve, lends out 9 times that amount... Essentially creating $9K out of thin air. 

Now let’s say Bob and some other people got those $9K in loans. What will they do with the money? They, or the people they pay, deposit it in a bank. Now that same $9K of fake money is looked at as fresh deposits, so the bank can loan out 9 times that $9K. That loop keeps going! Eventually the bank has created approximately $100K from $1K. Great deal for the bank! They’re making interest on money that never actually existed!

(EDIT: The creation of $100K is incorrect. The loop ends up creating around $9K from $1K. Thanks for the correction!)

In the worst case scenario, if 1% of people want their money at the same time (within a few months of each other), there’s a run on the bank and the bank runs out of money. In the best case, if 10% of people go to withdraw within the same time period, the bank runs out of money. 

I hear you! You’re saying “Wait a sec Deepy420! I love the bank. They allow me to live outside my means. There is FDIC insurance for such cases.” Actually, FDIC only has 2% worth of deposits on reserve. They don’t have enough money to compensate more than 2% of the lost money when a bank (eventually) goes bankrupt (ah! This term! It was invented due to leveraged banks and now it is assigned to people and corporations since they are enslaved via debt to banks.) 

I hear you! You’re saying “The US government won’t let that happen. They’ll pay me back!” Shall I remind you that the US government, despite stealing 30% of the fruits of your labor with their monopoly on force (the alternative is being caged), is still $20 trillion in debt since they have no incentive to remain solvent when they can just print as much money as they want!

I hear you! You’re saying “Ah hah! They’ll print more money and pay me back!” Sure, a few bankers in the private corporation, the US Federal Reserve, can decide to print more money. They’ll devaluate everyone’s cash by doing so, so they’ve not actually paid anyone back! They’ve just made everyone poorer. Well, not everyone, because the rich are not stupid enough to hold USD. Keep in mind that they can print this money and take other decisions - like manipulating the level of your enslavement via interest rates - without the ability of any US branch of government to question or prevent them.

personalfinance,Received unexpected W2 after filing this years return.,"Hey PF,

I filed my tax return this year roughly a week ago. I started a new job in early 2017 (March) in a new trade. I knew that I was going to receive two W2's, one for the new job and one for the job I had left. I filed as soon as I had received both.

Yesterday a company that I had left in 2015 sent me another W2 for an amount of ~$2100 in wages. IIRC it was a bonus for achieving an annual milestone which the employees of the 2015 year got paid out for in early 2016.

My question is:
What is my best course of action.. if any? 

I had already received my state return from the filing of this year and I believe federal return is just right around the corner also.

I recall in 2008--before I adopted my ""no news"" stance--I was not surprised by the massive drop in bank interest rates for savers (from about 5% for CDs to basically 0), because the media was talking about it well before it occurred.

Should I look into getting a small loan to pay off the credit cards and escape the high interest there?

CryptoCurrency,Why I Think a Tokenized Crypto Index Fund is an Incredible Long-term Investment,"*Disclaimer: What follows does not aim to be impartial and ultimately just reflects my enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency index fund space, and my personal views on its future potential. So if you don’t feel like getting shilled, you can safely skip this one. This is NOT investment advice, do your own research and don’t hold more Tether than you can afford to lose.* 

**Crypto index funds could be one of the best long-term investments over the coming years. Here’s why:** 

Cryptocurrencies have grown exponentially since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. Currently the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is standing at [~550 billion USD](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/). While growth has been remarkable—particularly in the last year—the market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined is still dwarfed by that of the top 500 publicly listed US companies (the S&amp;P 500 index). The market cap of the S&amp;P 500 (as of January 2018) is [~24 trillion USD](http://siblisresearch.com/data/total-market-cap-sp-500/) (which itself is about 25% of the global economy) while the combined cryptocurrency market cap is only a fraction (approx. 2.3%) of this. All bubble talk notwithstanding, there is still abundant room for growth. 

However, with 1400+ cryptocurrencies to choose from—and more appearing every day—it is nearly impossible to separate the wheat from the chaff. Add to this high risk, extreme volatility and technical complexity that render trading and safely storing a diverse coin portfolio challenging and time-intensive for most crypto investors. 

We are still in the very early stages; and while some of the truly foundational blockchain projects might be here already, some may still be in their infancy or may not even have evolved yet. Despite what this sub wants you to believe at times, predicting the long-term success and failure of cryptocurrencies is extremely difficult—and challenging even for traders in traditional markets with many years of data.

Cue index funds. Index funds are designed to replicate a particular market index, such as the S&amp;P 500, with the goal to match its returns as closely as possible. And they are spectacularly successful. [Only 12 percent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2013/04/04/index-fund-returns-get-better-with-age/#302f0e4a56d5) of actively-managed equity funds have beaten the market since 1970. (In 2017, Warren Buffet famously won a 1 million USD bet that an index fund would outperform a basket of hedge funds over a decade). 

One of the reasons why index funds consistently outperform actively managed funds is due to their low annual fees. These low fees are achieved through a mostly automated trading strategy based on a set of hyper-parameters. 

Given that traditional index funds outperform actively-managed funds by over 90%, I am extremely confident that well-designed crypto indexes will yield substantial returns as the blockchain landscape as a whole continues to evolve. With that out of the way, let’s have a look at the most serious contender in this space. 


**WHO IS THE MAJOR PLAYER?**


[**CRYPTO20**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/c20/) 

CRYPTO20 is a tokenized index fund which autonomously tracks the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It was launched in November 2017 and with a **[return of over 200%](https://medium.crypto20.com/crypto20-recap-audit-update-fd1ddb5f3d04) as of Jan 30, has easily outperformed both the total market cap gains and that of BTC alone**. Currently the fund has **[~105 million USD in assets under management](http://youcan.dance/crypto20)**. So how does it work? From the [Whitepaper](https://static.crypto20.com/pdf/c20-whitepaper.pdf): 

* **Portfolio Selection**:
The fund autonomously maintains a portfolio of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap in the same way that funds such as the Vanguard 500 maintain a portfolio based on the market cap of the S&amp;P 500. Scam coins, ponzis and Tether are excluded. Currently the top 20 coins capture &gt;85% of the overall market. In order to continue to track the market over time, the fund's asset portfolio is adjusted through weekly rebalancing.  

* **Data Science Approach**:
The index hyperparameters for the portfolio and rebalancing methodology were determined via a structured data science approach. Back-tests for portfolio value as well as expenses were carried out for 105 175-day rolling windows, prior to ICO, over the period January 2016 to August 2017. 

* **NAV Liquidation Option Ensures Price Floor**: 
The C20 token is directly tied to the underlying assets with a liquidation option that can be exercised via the smart contract. This function practically **ensures that the token never trades below the value of the underlying assets (NAV)**. Even during the recent market correction, the token price held up well, outperforming the majority of the market. 

* **Revenue Sources**:
While the fund's growth is driven primarily by the underlying assets, it has access to **3 additional sources of revenue that are reinvested into the fund**: 

1. **any forked coins** selected for divestment (after a stabilizing period of ~1 month); 

2. **any staking revenues**, e.g. NEO GAS, DASH Masternodes, etc. (in next rebalance); and 

3. **any profit from onselling in exchange** from the CRYPTO20 Portal (in next rebalance). 


* **Fee Structure**: 
There is a **0.5% annual management fee**. There are no exit or other hidden fees. 


**The Team** 
Led by brothers Daniel and Luke Schwartzkopff, the team consists of 8 members with backgrounds in computer and data science, statistics, engineering and maths. In nearly the same formation, they have previously launched and scaled up data science firm [DataProphet](https://dataprophet.com/). The firm provides consulting and product development services to a wide range of industries using a machine learning approach to data. Some of the team members have been [working together since 2013](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/data-prophet-pty-ltd-). 

The team is committed to extreme levels of transparency: [a third party audit](https://github.com/cryptotwenty/smartcontracts/blob/master/Hosho%20Crypto20%20Token%20Contract%20Audit.pdf) of the smart contract was conducted as well as a [full audit](https://static.crypto20.com/crypto20_kpmg_aup.pdf) (including verification of the vault storage facility and fund holdings across all wallets) by KPMG, one of the ‘Big Four’ accounting firms, investor reports are published on a quarterly basis and rebalancing stats are sent out every week. The team is racing down its roadmap often overdelivering on milestones (weekly rebalancing started well ahead of schedule and new fund types will be introduced already in February instead of in Q3 2018). The team is highly active and listens to investor needs (team members are reachable almost 24/7). Further, all team tokens are vesting over 2 years via a smart contract 'vault' to align team incentives with investors.

Currently the token can be traded at [**Bibox**](https://www.bibox.com/exchange?coinPair=C20_ETH), [**IDEX**](https://idex.market/eth/c20), [**HitBTC**](https://hitbtc.com) and [**ED**](https://etherdelta.com/#0x26e75307fc0c021472feb8f727839531f112f317-ETH).


**SUMMING IT UP**

Among the currently performing index funds, CRYPTO20 offers a unique and, I believe, the most promising investment opportunity. It is the only fund that combines no broker fees, no exit fees, full transparency and control over assets with the lowest annual management fees and a lower price bound. It is well worth keeping an eye out for additional fund types that will be announced  in February. Finally, here is a useful table created by the CRYPTO20 community showing C20's unique offering [compared to other funds](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7v27aPYsOD2CWM2X_C8jGQ.png). 

**TL;DR**: With cryptocurrencies having seen exponential returns in 2017, 2018 is poised for further (though perhaps a bit more measured) growth as the market matures and the truly foundational blockchain projects emerge. In this still volatile and high-risk environment, the value proposition of a crypto index fund is to offer investors exposure to stable returns while maintaining a broad, limited risk profile. Among the currently existing funds, CRYPTO20 is slated to be the overall best-performing. It is the only fund that combines no broker fees, no exit fees, full transparency and control over assets with the lowest annual management fees as well as a lower price bound. The team is racing down its roadmap and is in constant touch with community and investors. Therefore, I believe holding C20 will be one of the best long-term crypto investments.

personalfinance,Goofed on tax planning and baby on the way,"Throwaway as I don't want this on my main account.

I am looking for any advice on opportunities and things to consider to help solve a financial situation. I normally am extremely meticulous for financial planning and have pretty well managed to handle any emergency situations without any crisis. However we are currently facing a $3000 tax bill and have a baby due in June with a possible heart condition that will require surgery and care (no mental or other complications requiring any other similar care situations though) and wanted any good advice on how to approach this. I will attempt to make this as clean and straightforward as possible.

---------------------------------------------------------

**Income**

* **My Work:** I work Full Time making $17/hr + Benefits. Net Income is $760 biweekly (~$20k per year NET) after taxes and insurance. 1 year review is February 2018, potential for raise. 
* **Her Work:** Wife works 2 1099 Jobs from home, untaxed. Brings home $500 weekly total ($17.6k this year, expected to be $25k next year). Was saving 10% for taxes, but kept dipping and ended up with no savings (this will come in later)

**Total Income:** from all sources is roughly $45k, $17,500 of which is the untaxed straight income.

--------------------------

**Expenses**

* **Mandatory** Rent, Utilities, Cell Phone, Car Loan, Student Loans, Insurances, Food and all mandatory bills equate to ~$2300 a month total for all or ~$27,600 a year
* **Advanced Planning** Emergency Savings, Extra Savings, Car Repair Emergency Savings and all contingency planning is $100/week or ~$5000 a year (some flex randomly thru the year)
* **Other Budgeting** including clothes, pet food, trips to visit in-laws once per year, and non-essentials are planned at ~$200 a month or ~$2500 a year (some flex randomly thru the year)
* **Extras** - $50 a month for one nice date night (relationship maintenance) = ~$600 a year - flexible category

**Totals** - Overall my plan is to budget to a 0 so that all income is planned out ahead of time including potential emergencies and surprises. I know the expenses listed here in this short version may not match the income number exactly, but on my complete sheet it is close to a 0 overall so everything is planned.

--------------------------------------

**Current Debts** (Only 3)

* **Car Loan** - $2496.34 Remaining. Monthly min payment is $200.90/month. Expected pay off date at min payment is Feb 2019.
* **Student Loan 1** - $1,146.81 Remaining. Monthly min payment is $50/month. Expected pay off date at min payment is Dec 2020 
* **Student Loan 2** - $5,869.07 reamining. Monthly min payment is $111.11/month. Expected pay off date at min payment is June 2022.

-----------------------------------

**Taxes:**

* **2017** - Married Filing Jointly
* **2018 (Next Year)** + 1 Child Dependant (June Due Date)
* **Location:** New York State (Upstate, NOT NYC)

----------------------

**Current Snapshot**

* **2017 Tax Bill** - ~$3000 owed for 2017
* **Current Savings/Emergency/Car Repairs** - Currently $356.28. Recently had a $650 car repair which was entirely funded by emergency and car repair savings, no crisis, just now rebuilding those accounts thru normal budgeting. No worries here.
* **Copay Savings** - $25. Savings $25 every week for eventual $250 copay for delivery hospital copay in June. No other major expenses expected since everything else will be covered under our insurance. Fully budgeted for, no worries here.
* **Expected other income** - $200 towards the end of the year from matured bonds. Possible other $100 from minor investments. Also many gifts/cash from baby shower (but will be planned towards baby. 

Essentially we have this big hairy $3000 tax bill and with a kid on the way it makes it difficult to do any extreme maneuvering financially. Our budgeting otherwise has served us very well where even a huge $500 car repair or other expense is not a crisis situation for us and we have no other major debts to worry about and 2 will be resolved within 2 years even at min rate, which will bring our monthly expenses down (but likely just move over to childcare). 

**Corrections already made**

* **Her Income:** Increased tax savings from 10% to 18% and strictly adhering with no dipping. So for 2018 we should have any taxes set aside to avoid this going forward.
* **Reduced outlying expenses** - misc trips and spending dramatically to increase savings for expected baby expenses, including possible copays for surgeries and other visits

**Current list of options**

* **Reducing tax expense** - Working with accountant friend to see if its possible to reduce tax burden at all thru filing method
* **Tax payment plan** - could do payments on taxes but would be less than ideal because of fees/interest and also budget is tight as it is. 
* **Second job to pay off debts/taxes**
* **Sell Wife's Car** - worth $5500. Would cancel remaining $2500 owed (thus giving us back $200 monthly as well from payments temporarily), leaving $3000 to pay off taxes. *Less than ideal* and would have to purchase another car again once wife resumes 2nd of her 2 1099 jobs, so that $200 monthly would get readded most likely later. **last resort option**
* **Needing other suggestions...**",finance
personalfinance,Couple tax questions,"Been doing my own taxes for awhile but my first time with these situations.

First, my health insurance is based off hours worked per month. I missed a month in August for personal reasons and my 1095-c reflects that. Had cobra option but didnt take it, just missed the month. I don't know exactly what the the fines are for a month gap like that, but what's the pro/cons of fudging the health insurance portion of tax form vs being truthful? I can't imagine they'd lay the hammer down on a month of missed insurance, but if the fine is small, it might be worth the peace of mind.

Secondly, I lived in Texas the first part of the year,  and Florida the rest. Both no income tax states. I've started traveling for work,  and as such, have w-2s from Georgia, Minnesota, and Ohio. I think I've got the state tax stuff filled out correctly, and I'm getting those taxes refunded, but having never worked out of state like that, how do i go about submitting them? Is it all part of federal or do I need to submit to each individual state, and in Ohio's case, each municipality?",finance
personalfinance,Late payment on leased car loan dropped credit 150 points,"In October 2017 I decided to lease a car from Ford and made my first payment at the dealership. A month later I made a second payment online and enrolled for direct deposit payments-- Or at least I thought I did. 

Fast forward an additional two months, to 1/20ish, I get a call from Ford saying I am 30 days overdue for my car loan and when I told them I was enrolled for direct deposit, they said it doesn't show that I set it up. Of course, this may be my fault, although I am almost completely sure I did everything correctly signing up online on my end (I do direct deposit for most bills).

The next day I paid off the overdue balance but it was too late and the issue got sent to the credit bureaus which I then notice caused my credit to drop from 780 to 630!! I want to buy a house soon and for years I was very particular about my credit score/history and this is clearly a very bad thing to happen. 

The most frustrating thing about this is that Ford didn't email me anything. The first time I was notified, was by phone 2 months later about how I was so late.

personalfinance,New Card or Credit Limit Increase?,"This is probably a rather typical post but I am curious as to what the best course of action is for my credit situation.

I graduated college and started my career about six months ago, with an annual gross of $35,750. At the moment, my only credit card is Discover It Chrome card I got while an undergraduate, with a measly $1000 limit.

Credit details: ~740 credit score, zero revolving credit, no marks, avg age 2 yr 8 months, 9 accounts, and 4 hard pulls. I have 7 student loan accounts totalling $28k and a car note totalling $11k.

I think ideally I would like to have around $3500 - $4000 in credit available. However, for whatever reason Discover will only approve an increase up to $2500 which I consider to be a joke. Not sure if that's just the limit of that specific card or what.

So what course of action do I take? I already have an auto financed and recently had a hard pull for an apartment lease I move into in a few days, so I shouldn't really need my credit to get new financing for the next 3 -  5 years.

Do I ask for a limit increase and then apply for a new card? Or just wean myself off that card for the most part (consider it a relic of college) and look to get a 2nd card with a $2500 - 3000 limit? My thought is, my age of accounts isn't very good, but if I can get a 2nd account now then it will improve my credit long term rather than applying for it later. Especially a card that can grow with me as I get through grad school and take a higher paying job in the next decade.

What cards should I look at? Ideally, I'm looking for $2.5 - 3k in credit, with decent cash back. No interest period or interest rate isn't that big of a deal to me since I have no debt but is obviously a nice perk. I don't care for miles at all, and some convoluted point system is not desired unless it is really worth it.

On a side note, what is a typical available credit line compared to income? I'm fine with ~10% gross but I've heard of people having credit lines well past their gross income.

personalfinance,Student Loan Issue - Help Needed,"Hi all, I come to you in need of help as I have a concerning issue regarding my student loans. In addition to seeking advice on how to best refinance the 2 loans, I would like to get feedback on a potential legal issue with the payments I have been making thus far. Long story short, I take full responsibility for not addressing this sooner as I have just been auto-paying the minimum amounts for the last 7 years since graduating college and have not done my due diligence in taking on the responsibility of understanding and owning my payback strategy until now. With that said, I will list out the potential legal issue first, and then my refinancing question. I truly appreciate any advice that can be shared, thank you in advance. 

**Potential Legal Issue:**  
My main concern is that after 7 years of on-time monthly payments of ~$500 for the combined loans (I have never missed a payment), the one loan balance has only decreased by $1,500 and the other balance has actually INCREASED by $1,000 ..  how can this be possible? I have paid out ~$40,000 over the years and have not made a dent. This is very discouraging, but as I said, it's my fault for not owning up to this earlier.  
My question to you is, is there a potential fraud issue I should be looking into here with a lawyer or something? Or is it as simple as I screwed up and because I did not look into this sooner I got taken for high interest payments? I still don't understand how the 1 loan balance could go up (I listed the last payment for each loan below and they are both hitting the principle and interest). It definitely hurts to realize I am out $40K but at this point I am just looking to just get this on track and continue on with my life. 

**Refinancing Question:**  
I have been looking into various companies to refinance my 2 loans, and have received online offers for significantly lower interest rates from all the big refinance companies out there. However, before proceeding with what will most likely be Earnest, I wanted to confirm if it is best to refinance as 2 separate loans, selecting the lowest rate for each, or combining them and select the lowest interest rate on the entire $60K (most offers I got on the combined loan were not lower than doing them individually), so is there any other advantage to combining them other than having 1 payment as oppose to 2?  
I just turned 30 years old, make $80K per year before taxes and contribute to my company's 401K (who match up to 6%) and just this year have started contributing my Roth IRA, I also have great credit. I have 15K sitting in my savings account, so should any of this go directly to paying down one of the loans? Please let me know if you need additional information in order to provide appropriate guidance. Thanks again.

personalfinance,"Discouraged. This hole keeps getting deeper, how do I get out?","Hi, 

New here, and I apologize if this post is a bit rambly as I'm pretty tired and now, stressed. I've been trying to get myself financially stable for a couple years now and every time I make progress, something else happens and I am so tired of it and don't know the best way to get out of it. Please note that I'm rounding my monthly bills up slightly for simplicity.

The Good: I've already completely paid off $6500 in student loans, so that's gone and out of my life forever. I have a kind of high-paying job (for Utah anyway, pay here is crap) at $16/hr, full benefits, and I work full time. I also get 5% commission on every project I do for this job, which can vary but is most often $25 per project. 

The Bad: Everything else! I was starting to pull myself out of the pit I was in last year; in April 2016 I left my awful call center job and moved to a new one that officially paid less but also gave frequent $100 bonuses for every new person we had sign up to work with us. Since my job was getting all the paperwork taken care of for the new contract employees we had working for us, this was usually 300-400 a month and sometimes up to 1000. I paid off a credit card completely, caught up on my rent, started a savings account. 

Then the business more or less went under. Most of the people we found for contract jobs wanted to work in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and it got a double hit from the hurricanes in the fall. The company we found employees for already owed us a ton of money, like 1 million, and then it had to shut down due to all the damage to the building and I was let go along with everyone else but the HR/Accounting lady. 

I was unemployed for a relatively short time, and did get unemployment, but it wasn't enough to cover my rent, auto insurance, car payment, and food. So used the savings. Racked up the credit card again. Got a new job and was very hopeful because I was told in the interview that with the added project bonus I could realistically see an additional 800-1200 a month. That was in November. 

Now that I've been here and gotten two of my monthly payouts, this seems to not be the case. First one I got was $75 with taxes taken out, I figured that made sense because it was for my first month and I'd only done a few cases. I just got another one - $411 total, but after taxes, I only got $251. I was really hopeful that getting a nice chunk of money every month would get me back on track again, but it seems like for the amount of work we have, that's roughly the best I can hope for until they start charging our clients more (which is in the works, but isn't here yet). 

While all this is happening I've had to repair a car. I've gotten really ill and needed a doctor. I've had to keep paying a bit extra in already too-high rent to catch up from when I was unemployed. I know I'm going to need a new set of tires in spring or summer. I just started doing my tax paperwork and I owe $600 federal and $125 for state (wasn't surprised by the state tax, but the federal was an enormous disappointment). I have a sister doing an internship in England this summer - my parents said they would provide hotel, food, etc if I could just pay my airfare and I've been trying to save for that since April of last year. And I now have three credit cards to take care of. 

The amount I owe isn't bad compared to a lot of people, I guess, but to some extent that doesn't matter to me - I still can't pay it. 

Financial breakdown (rounded up):  
Visa - 850
Chase - 600 (I paid off a good chunk of this, then my car needed repair) 
Paypal Credit - 700 
Taxes Owed - 700 
Doctor Bill - 100 
Still Behind in Rent: 230
Total Debt - 3180

My take-home pay after tax, health insurance, 401K, and HSA is taken out is about 950 per paycheck. So I'm working with 1900 per month. 

Rent: 700 (including utilities) 
Gas: 100-120 (I commute, about 40 minutes with traffic and I have a 2004 Rav4 that eats gas. But it was the cheapest car on the lot after my first car got totaled a few years ago) 
Car Payment: 75 per month. I'm down to like 2800 left to pay off.
Auto Insurance: 135 per month, split into two payments of about 65 
Medication costs: 125 every ninety days 
Amazon Prime: 13 
Netflix: 12 
Planet Fitness: 12 
Vasa: 22 (my work reimburses for this gym though, so I get it back eventually) 
Groceries: About $150 every two weeks (300/mo); when I need things like paper towels or toilet paper it can climb higher because I stock up, or it can go down when I'm just getting ingredients for specific meals. But on the average that's a good estimate. 
Misc: about 70 bucks? I have a pet hedgehog and betta that need to be taken care of, and I'll pick up random stuff like notebooks or cleaning supplies that add up. 

Doing the math I should have 1000 extra every month but it never feels like that. If I got my 1900 all in one chunk it would be great, but working with 950 at once i'm struggling. I have to split rent payment into two chunks because if I pay 700 down then I have 250 left and then once they take out car and car insurance I'm down to 0. 

I'm really just frustrated and tired of dealing with this. I've been looking around for other people who want a roommate (I'm living with one now) in hopes of finding somewhere more affordable, but the cheap housing here is about 45 minutes north of me in Salt Lake proper. These neighborhoods are not safe and they would add an additional 45+ minutes to a commute that's already pretty long. I'm still looking, just for the sake of providing information, so far that hasn't seemed to be a viable option. 

Any advice would be very appreciated. Is it possible to start paying off this debt AND save for airfare to the UK (it's kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity, I'd love to go), AND save for the new tires I need? 

I have some nice jewelry and collectibles I could try to sell. I'm a certified pearl expert with the CPA and have some nice earrings and access to a community that would probably have some interest, depending on what I decide to part with I could probably get about $700 from this. Maybe another couple hundred for some dolls and figurines I've had for years. 

I'm just so tired of this. Help, please!",finance

We made a ton of financial mistakes to help our business survive, naively thinking we would eventually be making enough money to cover the debt. Ha.

We no longer have any employees, we got rid of our office and all other unnecessary business expenses so we could reduce overhead as much as possible. The business is finally starting to make some money, but I don't know where to even start in clearing out this debt.

Student loan debt ~120k combined, currently behind on many of them. Husband has private loans, mine are federal.

Credit card debt ~30k (most of which is in collections) 

Tax debt ~85k, all of which have installment payment agreements which total nearly $2000/mo in payments

We've also had 2 cars repossessed in the last 4 years, totaling nearly $12k in debt reported on our credit.

We've been consistently bringing home around $7k per month, but we don't get paychecks on a consistent basis. We may get it all at the first of the month, or in small chunks throughout the month...it just depends on when our invoices get paid by our customers.

Rent: 775
Utilities: 250

personalfinance,Help Calculating Total Compensation,"I work for a state government and am really unhappy with my job. I’ve been doing it for years but it’s just not something that I’m really interested in. I won’t even get into the headaches of work for state government especially in my state.

I’ve got two problems in finding a new job:

1. Actually finding something that I’m qualified for. I’ve spent 10+ years doing what is supposed to be quality improvement in a lab but it’s really me doing any miscellaneous project that I get stuck with in no organized manner with no focus or guidance.

2. Being able to switch into a different job where my salary (and ideally total compensation) does  not drop more than I can handle.

Here’s some info on my situation. I’m sure more is needed.

Age: 40
Salary: $73,000
Take home: $42,000
Time with state: 12 years 
My pension contributions: $90,000*
Additional deferred compensation: $18,000
Max salary for my job: $95,000**
Pension after 35 years: $66,500**
Pension after 40 years: $95,000**
Medical insurance - PPO, great!
Dental insurance - $1000/year
Vision insurance - exam &amp; glasses every 2 years
Life insurance - equal to salary

* this is what I get if I leave now and choose not to begin taking “retirement” payments. The payments would be tiny now due to my limited years of employment. I can leave the money in the pension fund and withdraw retirement payments later and they will be better but still low because they will be based on my salary now but that will be nothing after years of inflation. What sucks with this pension is there’s no employer match like with a 401k so if I leave early I get little.

** these numbers will all go up with inflation - or should... rather than calculate what those values would be when I retired I listed what they would be if I was retiring now and was age 63 or 70. Assuming I live a good while after retirement (hoping family history extends to me!) that guaranteed income plus medical care (there is a cost) looks pretty good. Does not include social security. The extra I have been saving (deferred compensation) would be drawn on to keep up with inflation in retirement.

I’d like some help figuring out what I need to be looking for in other jobs other than just salary and how to quantify it.

personalfinance,$100k plus in student loans and personal debt. Need help budgeting,"I'm just going to lay it all out there. Im a 26m who finally after 2 bachelor degrees, is making middle class type of money working in nursing. I graduated from 2 well know colleges in the midwest (first degree was a BS in exercise science, and my second is BS in Nursing). Obtaining these degrees came with a hefty price tag and now that I am almost out of grace, I come to the subs of Reddit to help me with my finances and budgeting with the hope to have a plan to knock out my loans aggressively over the next few years if possible. 

The debt: Fedloan debt is: $55,592.27 (IR between 3.4-6% fixed) and my private loan, which is through Greatlakes is $54,202 (IR 9% fixed). I also have a car in which I owe about $11k on ($301/month which is above my actual payment of 294/month), and 2 credit cards that are currently being used as interest free balance transfer cards with values of $1600 and $5,900. I've been trying to aggressively pay off my credit card bills by putting more money into them each check but with my students loans and other expenses I feel like i'll be paying my debt forever. Ideally I'd like to pay off the credit cards first hand while also making my monthly payments towards my student loans.

Income: My income is roughly 1500/bi-weekly after tax and my expenses excluding credit card payments is roughly $1,244 (rent, gas and lights, insurance, etc) leaving me with roughly $1,756 before putting money into savings and paying my credit cards.

My current system is every check I place $150-200 in my savings, pay my bills, and pay whatever is excess to my cards while saving around 200 to get gas for my car and groceries.

My reason for coming here would be to gain a bit of insight as to what I can change what could I do to better position myself towards financial freedom. I've thought about selling my car but realized that I would lose money on it and I've also considered picking up a second job at a different hospital so I won't have to pay as much in taxes for OT. 

Any and all advice is accepted as well as suggestions for helping me to better manage my money. I will also cross post this in /r/financialindependence as i deem that it is relevant for that sub as well,

personalfinance,TaxAct keeping an extra $200 of my return? Am I getting scammed?,"Thanks in advance to anyone who may have some insight to my current predicament.  


This year, along with past years, I filed my taxes through TaxAct using their federal/state return filing site. Pretty straight forward, input your info, they calculate expected return, and they submit paperwork to the IRS.  All was well, TaxAct stated my federal return would be $1700.00, they charged their standard (albeit high) fee of $95 to for a total of $1605.00 to be sent to me. The IRS confirmed receipt of the information a few days later.  


This morning, I received a deposit from the IRS to my checking account in the order of $1435.00... well below the expected return. Called up TaxAct with a 5-hour wait to speak to someone. Had to bail (since I don't have that time to wait) and called up the IRS to learn more. They stated they received the info from TaxAct again and stated the value of the return is definitely $1700.00. However, they informed me that they have only just begun sending out returns and mine has *not* been sent out yet. Now very confused, I called the bank TaxAct cooperates with (Republic Bank) and was told by them that some filers request an 'anticipation loan', which is supplied to the filer soon and then the IRS simply sends the return to TaxAct when it's ready. In speaking with the bank, they stated an anticipation loan was not sent to me, as this is not something I requested. 


So, what am I missing here? 

* My own bank states the IRS sent me $1435.00. I can see it in my checking account. 

* The IRS said they didn't send me anything. My return is still with them.

* The bank TaxAct works with said they didn't send me an anticipation loan.  



Is this a straight up scam? Someone masquerading as the IRS sent me a random amount of money? If so, what do I from here?

**EDIT: Kindly disregard folks.

personalfinance,"Need help figuring out debt, credit cards, and general personal finance management","Hi r/personalfinance,

Just as a heads up this will most likely end up being a pretty lengthy post, so I apologize ahead of time and I will do my best to make it brief or include a TL;DR.

Me:
I am a 22 year-old, semi-recent college graduate. Up until April of last year I was pretty solid financially, but from May until January or so I was a pretty bad downward spiral with my finances.
I know a lot of the areas where I have fucked up, so this post is mostly looking at where I can begin to fix things and trying to get a realistic look at how fucked I may actually be.

Income:
I started working full-time after graduating college 13 months ago. Before taxes I get paid 47,500 a year or ~4,000/month.

Retirement:
* Until recently I was putting 6% into my 401k with my employer matching an additional 3% on top of that (total 9%). I currently have ~$4500 in my 401k.
* As of right now, my investments in my 401k are at 20% growth (not sure if this is the right phrasing but I think y'all understand what I am saying).
* Additionally, I have a Roth IRA which has ~$10,300 in it. More on this later.

Student Loan:
*1 Direct Loan - Unsubsidized $6,635.82 remaining at 4.29%
* 1 Direct Loan - Unsubsidized $3,682.62 remaining at 3.76%
I pay both of these are their minimum payment with a plan to finish after ~10 years.

Car Loan(s):
* I purchased a car back in January which was totaled 3 months later by a drunk driver. This has ~$400 remaining (made advanced payments on the difference between my loan and what I received from my insurance, so this does not need to be paid off for a few more months).
* I purchased a (new) used luxury German car in May. This has ~$31,700 remaining at ~4%, my monthly payments are +/- $560.

Car Insurance:
I pay ~$260 in car (and rental/home) insurance.

Rent:
I rent a 2 bedroom 1.5 bathroom apartment/townhouse by myself. This costs ~$1500 in total after utilities and so on.

Credit Card:
I have a credit score of 755 or so and once credit card with a $10,000 limit. I owe ~$8,600 at 18% on this with my monthly payment plan set to pay $250 every month.

Ok, so now that everyone should have a pretty thorough idea of where I am at with all spending time to give some back story.

I graduated last year and immediately started at a new job. I was commuting an hour to and from work with plans to move into a cheaper apartment in that area and continue that commute for a year or two. Things changed, life went to shit due to some personal stuff that happened, and I come up in May and decide to move within a block or two of my job.

This is when I started to spend a ton of money and ultimately got to the point where I was drinking almost every night and just blowing through anywhere from $200-400 a week. My expenses at this time were not very much, rent was cheaper, utilities were cheaper, etc. (I lived somewhere different at the time). This continued until about November, when my friend and roommate was fired from his job. Due to the uncertainty of if he was going to be able to find another one/pay rent/etc. we both decided to move out and find our own places.

I ended up getting a 2 bedroom as mentioned before under the assumption that though it is more pricey I now have the option to rent out the second bedroom which would cut my rent (which I could afford initially). I move in and start buying furniture, etc. and ultimately this leads to me beginning to put a ton of  money on my credit card - my first credit card I might add. As a way to combat this, since I was unaware (and still kind of are) how Roth IRAs penalize early distributions I began to remove money from my IRA. On that note, I had ~$25,000 at the time I began removing money, and in total have removed ~$15,000 since June of 2017.

Anyways, so here is my current breakdown for finances:
* Credit Card: $250/month
* Car Loan: $560/month
* Student Loan: $111/month
* Car Insurance: $260/month
* Rent/Utilities/Cable: $1,600 (or so)
Total Expenditure: $2,781/month.

After taxes, with 4% pre-tax month going into my 401k, I make $2,834/month.

On top of the fact that I have +/- only $50/month for food, dog food, or anything else, I am at the point where I feel like all the debt and finances is really taking a toll on my stress, mental health, and actual health. Additionally, I am not sure entirely how early distributions from Roth IRAs work, but I have a feeling when I do my taxes (again, first time doing these) that I will be owing the government a good chunk of change most likely as well.

The more I have been thinking about the more two or three scenarios have come to mind for me:

Scenario 1: I sell my car for a KBB trade-in cash value sale, which is around $23,400. So I lose about $8,000 to ""depreciation"" and the ease of getting the cash right away. I then take out a personal unsecured loan for the car depreciation and an additional amount to cover the purchase of a car worth $3,000-$5,000. This would drop my monthly payments for the car from $560/month to about $250/month. And would most likely bring my car insurance to under $100/month.

Issues w/ Scenario 1: My new car would not be secured by my gap insurance (i.e. since I am not taking a loan on the car specifically, if the car gets wrecked and is worth much lower than I bought it for, my insurance won't cover the difference). Then I am stuck potentially without a car but still paying the $250/month.

Scenario 2: I rent out the second bedroom of my apartment for about $500 + utilities. This would be the largest benefit in terms of money, but would not necessarily be immediate.

Issues w/ Scenario 2: I own a dog, so I have to find people that aren't allergic/are ok with the possibility of their shit getting chewed up/etc.

Scenario 3: Some combination of the two above.

Issues w/ Scenario 3: Unsure.

Some notes of after thoughts: since the beginning of January I have cut my drinking habits from ~$500-700/month to only spending $40 on alcohol in January. I have also been taking note/tracking everything I spend money on to try to lower my costs/spending where I can.

My long term goals financially just as a note:
* After all short-term or high interest rate debts are clear, I want to bring my 401k savings to 8% with 3% employer match (that is what I used to have it at).
* Put the remaining 9% of retirement savings into my Roth IRA to rebuild it back to what it was.
* Lower my Debt-Income ratio to .5.
* Have 6 months worth of expenses * 130% saved.

personalfinance,Dissolving a non-operational C-Corp - do I need a corporate lawyer or a CPA?,"Kind of a stupid situation: 


Mid-2016 I used an online service to incorporate a Delaware C-corp. The company never commenced operations and I never completed any of the post-incorporation tasks (allocating shares, adopting bylaws, or obtaining an EIN). I also never conducted business or made profit of any sort. 

I have paid the yearly Delaware franchise fees since incorporation. I have not paid any federal taxes as I thought I had no tax liability since the company was not operational and did not complete any of the post-incorporation tasks I mentioned above. This is what I'm not sure about. If there is any tax liability, I'd like to correct it and dissolve the company. As far as dissolving goes, I think I just need to file a short form certificate of dissolution.

personalfinance,What to do if state didn't complete medicaid application during unemployment.,"When we were living in another state for school, myself and the kids were on Medicaid, and my husband had coverage through the school.

Husband had a 2 month gap between graduating and starting his new job. We knew that was the going to be the case, and we were told to apply through Illinois' ABE program for health insurance. I was told the agency would contact me after I had submitted everything through healthcare.gov. 

Never got any mail, never got any direct information from them whatsoever. I called, I left messages, never got a human on the phone or a call back. I go online through Illinois' site and it has no record for me now (it DID over the summer and unfortunately I can't find what I did with the print out after I put the application in directly on their site.) When I go through the healthcare.gov site, it has my application ID and the results from that at least. I have some proof from the federal site. Illinois seems to have lost me in the frey? 

Now, I made an effort to get coverage. I put in my application, I did my part. 

I'm going to be doing my taxes this weekend, and I've received the form with our coverage which has us down through August. We've all had coverage through husband's employer since October 1st. I'm unsure if our medicaid coverage ended mine and the kid's coverage at the end of July, or if they counted August as coverage. (The boxes are all ticked.) 

Is there anything I can do to contest things if I'm told I have a penalty? I'm just unsure of how to proceed, and getting anyone on the phone is near impossible. Wanting to be prepared if I need to call. 

If this is the wrong place to be asking this, can one point me in the right direction?

Hoping someone can help me out with some suggestions here. My husband was recently the victim of identity theft. We know his information was compromised in the Equifax leak and figure this is probably how his information was stolen, but that’s neither here nor there at this point.

Here’s the background info: Basically in December he started having bills for fraudulent accounts sent to him at his parents address, as we had previously lived there a couple months while we were buying our house. We discovered accounts with the major jewelry chains (zales, jared, Kay, etc.), Goodyear, at&amp;t and a few others had been opened and charges had been made to the accounts. My husband immediately filed a police report, froze his credit and notified all 3 major credit bureaus, contacted the federal trade commission, and started going through the list or accounts to report the identity fraud. We believe that all these have either been resolved or are in the process of being resolved. 

The real problem came at the beginning of January when we started receiving letters (still to his parents address) from a collections company for fake checks being written to Walmart. The checks were from Chase Bank (which he is not nor has ever been a customer of), and were determined to be from a fake account. There have been 3 fake checks so far, and my husband has been completely unsuccessful in contacting them to report the fraud. The company is TRS recovery services and they don’t seem to have a real person on the other end of their phone system. He’s submitted forms and received no kind of confirmation or anything. A quick google search shows mixed reviews on the legitimacy of this company and their practices. At this point my husband has no idea what to do, either to actually submit a fraud report and get these bad checks off his credit or even stop whoever is doing this from continuing to write the fake checks. 

Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions? This whole thing has been a nightmare and I really have no idea where to turn. Thanks for taking the time to read this wall of text.",finance

personalfinance,"24 years old, 16k in credit card debt. 13k in student loans. How can I consolidate by debt?","Hello everyone! 

This was difficult for me to post but years of depression, alcohol and drug addiction had taken control of my life and I can honestly say that I am in the best state of mind that I have ever been. And it's time to do something about my debt. 




Card | APR | Outstanding Balance | 
---|---|----|----
Chase Sapphire Reserve | 24.24% | 10,034.56
Chase Freedom | 20.24% | 4,069.71
Paypal Credit | 19.99% | 667.33

MyFedLoan | 4.66% | 11,871.07





Credit Cards: $16,694.79

Student Loans: $13,366.73



I sure am in a pickle. I just started making a real effort to pay off my debts recently and made an excel sheet using avalanche method with a 5 year plan to get rid of all this debt. 


Currently, the minimum for all of these debts is $675 a month. I mainly want to target my credit card debt since they have the highest APRs and total debt, but thought I should include my loans for the sake of transparency. Currently have two part time jobs (currently training for the second) so unsure what my hours and income will be like just yet but rough estimations $800-$1000 biweekly. 

Other monthly expenses:

* Gym - $39

* Phone - $73

* Media - $22

I'm feeling pretty good about all this but I was wondering what more I could do. I've heard about people consolidating their debt onto other credit cards or with a bank loan. 

Other info: Living with my parents, I don't own a car, and my credit score is 647. Working on a budget so not sure how much I need to spend aside from the expenses above. 
        

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you for taking the time to help a broke ass college graduate out!",finance

personalfinance,"Bought a used car from a non profit dealership, in the 15 days I've had it, the thermostat housing has broken, the clutch gave out, the ABS light gave out, and the traction control warning light came on. Had it fixed under warranty two times and there are still major issues. What can I do?","I am going to talk to them about letting me return the car, they said it had a 3 day trial period. It also comes with a 30 day power-train warranty that went into effect on January 15th. The car is a 2012 Chevy Cruze Eco (Manual) with about 62-65k miles (I forget the exact amount).

I know that lemon laws (at least to my knowledge) don't apply to used cars older than 24 months or something. Are there any protections I have in case they don't let me return the car? I feel severely mislead, the car has had non-stop issues and they knew about some of them beforehand and did not tell me. One of the interns that I was driving with to show the clutch issue said that he knew this car had some coolant leak when it came on the lot and they sold it to me anyway. Below is the timeline of issues and repairs I've had.

Issue 1:

Car started to smoke under hood, took it into the dealership mechanic and they said it needed a new thermostat housing. They ordered the part, got the wrong one, waited for the correct part, fixed it, and I picked it up a few days later.

Issue 2:

The day after I picked it up, the clutch gave out. Took it into the mechanic, test drove it with one of the interns to show the issue, they said it needed a new clutch. The intern also talked about how he knew there was some sort of coolant leak when it came on the lot from being donated to them (the car was a donation that they were reselling). They took out my clutch, saw it needed a clutch slave cylinder (or something like that, I'm not sure) and ordered the part. They got the wrong part, again, and then replaced the clutch and I picked it up earlier today.

Issue 3:

The lead mechanic said the ABS sensor was faulty but was safe to drive before I picked it up. I said okay, he said they are waiting on the part and I can take it in whenever they get it to have it replaced.

Issue 4:

When I picked the car up, the stability control light was on and the dash shows that I need to have it checked out and won't let me use my main HUD below the steering wheel (MPH, MPG, etc). This happened today and they are closed so I haven't talked to them about it yet.

I'm really not sure what to do besides ask for my money back. It's getting ridiculous at this point. I spent about $7500 on this thing and feel really severely mislead and I feel like this shouldn't be legal. They keep messing up the repairs and have done this with my other car before this too, their workers are new and/or relatively untrained and mess things up a lot. My girlfriend mentioned something about a federal law that explains cars sold not ""as is"" have an expectation of usability and that I have some protections, although I could not find this and am unsure how it would apply to me.

Does anyone know what I can do? This has been affecting my new job (just graduated college and started my first job) and personal life, not to mention adding on a huge amount of stress and anxiety.

Thank you very much PF, I really appreciated any advice I can get. Please let me know if you need any other information.",finance

personalfinance,"Tax deduction: Student loan interest is separate from the standard deduction, so why is my federal refund increasing so little after entering my paid student loan interest?","Hi everyone, this is my first time filing taxes on my own using TurboTax. 

Background info: My total withheld federal tax this year was ~$1800.

As I was inputting data into my TurboTax, PRIOR to inputting the amount of student loan interest paid, my federal refund was calculated to be $903. 
However, AFTER entering the amount of student loan interest that I had paid this year ($743), my federal refund only went up $75 for a total refund of $978. 

Per TurboTax, ""The student loan interest deduction is separate from the standard deduction - you claim student loan interest regardless of whether you use the standard deduction or itemize""
The maximum deductible amount for student loan interest per year is $2500.

If this is the case, wouldn't it mean that I should be receiving $743 on top of the $903? 


I just want to make sure TurboTax's estimate of the federal refund is accurate before I submit. Please let me know what you think.

CryptoCurrency,My Thoughts on Tether,"I think we have all suspected that the feds would get wise on Tether and that time has come. So what could potentially happen next? Here are my thoughts. I think that Tether is propping up many exchanges. Without Tether, traders will have to ride the wave down on sharp market declines and it will be more difficult to avoid losses. Why? Because nearly all crypto in exchanges is not liquid - or cannot be easily exchanged for cash. I think that if Tether goes down, nearly all alts will see a decrease as traders run for the hills. Exchanges will become less lucrative and many could close. The more liquid ""gatekeeper"" coins (BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, Coinbase types) that can more easily be exchanged for cash will become the new coins to hold during market declines. Thus, if Tether goes, the value of the gatekeeper coins will jump.

I think that another problem could be that Tether allowed for coins to become artificially inflated, as traders were able to buy higher volumes of coins during the dips due to limiting their losses by swapping for Tether during those dips. In other words, without Tether, total crypto market cap would likely be much lower than it is today. Just my 2 cents.

personalfinance,Looking at the pros/cons of using a credit card for an expense.,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I have recently run into car trouble that may be something larger than I expected, and I am unsure what action I should pursue.

I make $12.50 an hour and work 160 hours a month, and my bills minus food expense and tax give me around $300 to work with.

Just the other day, my car, a 2004 Nissan Altima for reference, began acting very strange. Long story short, the car had to be towed back to my place, because it refused to run, or when it ran it was extremely rough. To get to the point, I have a credit card with a $9000 limit on it, and this vehicle needs a few things done to it because of the recent situation. I estimated the total of the repairs to be around $800-$1000. My question is, would it be wise to use the credit card, which has a low interest rate, to pay for the repairs, and therefore enable me to continue going to work? I have no money saved, and refuse to touch my retirement accounts. My budget would allow me to pay $150-$300 a month off of the card given I take this route.

Thank you for any advice you can give me.",finance

**This is not directed at any specific company or exchange and is intended for educational purposes only.  This is not legal advice and as such I cannot be held liable accordingly.  Always consult with a licensed attorney or legal representative concerning your local laws regarding what may or may not be applicable in your jurisdiction.**

&amp;nbsp;

The U.S. regulatory agency, S.E.C., regularly works with foreign countries governments and regulatory agencies when enforcing laws on foreign companies.  There is more than ample case law and literature that will verify this.  That does not apply to all, or even most U.S. or other countries laws.  Most laws do not give jurisdiction to one country over another.  We will use the example of KimDotCom.

&amp;nbsp;

As a New Zealand citizen, the U.S.'s Department of Justice does not have the jurisdiction to send their agents to New Zealand to arrest him.  They must legally have New Zealand extradite him.  This is obvious, or should be to most people.  Which is exactly why he is still in New Zealand and not in the U.S. either in court or jail.  He has been able to fight extradition for the last 6 years, and hopefully that's how it stays.  However, there are certain things which does fall under the jurisdiction of foreign countries.  I'm not even going to try to list them here as that isn't important.

&amp;nbsp;

The most important thing however is how the U.S. extends it's jurisdiction when they should have absolutely no legal grounds. Specifically this falls under the Dodd-Frank Act.  **""Under the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. courts have jurisdiction over claims of securities violations brought by the SEC or DOJ that involve:**
**1)** **Significant steps in furtherance of a violation that occurred in the United States even if the transaction took place outside the United States; or**
**2)** **Conduct outside the United States that has a “foreseeable substantial effect” within the United [States.""](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2011/08/05/the-dodd-frank-extraterritorial-jurisdiction-provision)**

&amp;nbsp;

Currently the U.S. has on more than occasion claimed jurisdiction over a foreign cryptocurrency exchange.  Once for a civil claim against **/*Mt. Gox*/(Japan)** from 2014, in U.S. Federal court.  I haven't fully looked in to all the details of this particular case in the State of Illinois.  More details can be found [here.](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-ilnd-1_14-cv-01437/pdf/USCOURTS-ilnd-1_14-cv-01437-0.pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

This was used more specifically last year when the U.S. SEC and DOJ sought charges against BTC-e, a Russian Exchange, and it's owner Alexander Vinnik.  Accordingly BTC-e's assests including domain, etc. was seized by the U.S. and charged with operating an unlicensed money service business, money laundering, and related crimes.  Details of this case can be found [here.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/russian-national-and-bitcoin-exchange-charged-21-count-indictment-operating-alleged)

&amp;nbsp;

To make sure that I'm not wrong and offer evidence showing that it is being taken that seriously, all you have to do is look at *Tether* and *Bitfinex*.  NOTE: all information regarding the following companies is not my opinion but are the facts that have been released in accordance with the leaked Paradise Papers and other information.  Whatever the financial status of any and all parties involved does not imply any guilt and should not be taken as such.  For the purpose of this article, it is used only as an educational tool.

&amp;nbsp;

Most exchanges pair the *USDT* and not **USD**.  This is done so foreign exchanges don't have to worry about reporting and banking laws that any company dealing with **USD** is legally obligated to do but they are still able to pair things against the US dollar which we all see it listed as **USDT/BTC**.  A vast majority of people will never notice nor even give this a second thought.  Exchanges do this specifically because using the **USD** would subject them to U.S. banking laws but since Tether *""USDT""* is a coin and not money, exchanges don't have to follow U.S. banking laws. This creates an extra layer of protection for exchanges and they are able to operate much easier without accidentally breaking those or other U.S. money-laundering, know your customer, etc. laws.

&amp;nbsp;

Many in the community remember last year when *Bitfinex* announced they announced they were stopping all user activity for U.S. citizen  accounts.  This was done for a very specific reason, and if you research what Bitfinex did after the last hack of $70 million **USD**, you will understand why.  I'm sure a lot of people that weren't around when the hack occurred wouldn't believe what the exchange did to their customers.  Long story short, *Tether* lost U.S. banking relations which caused people to question what was really going on.  That's why we have the information we do now.  

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway back to subject on hand.  Including using the aforementioned way that exchanges protect themselves by pairing with USDT and not **USD**; *Tether* further protects itself by separating itself into multiple entities; *Tether Limited (“TLTD“)* for U.S. citizens, *Tether International Limited (“TIL“)* for all Non U.S. citizens for the purpose of issuing, use, etc. of the *Tether coin*.  *Tether ""TIL""*, *Tether ""TLTD""* and *Bitfinex* (owned by *iFinex Inc.*) are incorporated in Hong Kong.  Last but not least, and most important. *""Tether Holdings""* founded in 2014, and *iFinex Inc*. are both based in British Virgin Islands.  These are the only parts of *Tether* and *Bitfinex* that receive real money, actual US dollars, Euro's, Yen, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Any exchange, wallet, etc. that accepts actual money payments dealing with cryptocurrency knows that by accepting real money they must follow [AML/CTF](https://www.state.gov/j/inl/c/crime/c44634.htm) laws of whichever jurisdiction that would apply.  Hence why most all exchanges pair with USDT and not USD.  Furthermore, most people are also aware that the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, etc. are considered tax havens and the U.S. can't do a damn thing.  No government can.  There is much more about Tether if anyone wants to look further, it should be easy for anyone following along to see the possible implications.  For our purpose, all we need is know how the companies are structured.  

&amp;nbsp;

Now this part is not asking anyone to make any loose connections, or even try to connect all the dots together.  We are going to look at this from a dumbed down point of view.  If you didn't know what company it was that  was structured in the exact same way with multiple sister corps, parent corps, locations, etc. most people would be baffled as to why any company would go through all that trouble.  What practical reason could a cryptocurrency company, in a unregulated world, have to do that in the first place?

&amp;nbsp;

Fraud is rampant and no one seems to ever go to jail.  Even if doing the same thing in any other business would likely result in criminal charges.  So why would any company go through all that trouble if they had nothing to worry about.  Even if their entire goal is to defraud people such as Bitconnect, why would any foreign company dealing with crypto go through that much trouble in such an unregulated market?  Number one that is substantially more expensive financially and also much more work that would have to be done.  **Not including the additional time and cost to hide that stuff** 

&amp;nbsp;

So putting aside any thought of Tether committing fraud or whatever else is alleged. Let's just look at the basic facts:  If foreign exchanges, etc. aren't subject to outside laws because they are located in a different country.  Why would any of them use a coin in place of real money for pairings?  Wouldn't it be easier no matter what to just pair listing against the dollar.  **USD/BTC**  **USD/ETH** **NZD/BTC** **NZD/ETH** or whatever fiat currency paired against crypto.  That would just create more accounting and unnecessary additional steps to convert crypto to fiat?  No business would adopt a model like that if there was not a fundamental need for the extra work/cost/etc.  Everyone should have no problems understanding why exchages list pairings in USDT and NZDT and not USD and NZD.

&amp;nbsp;

Alright that was very easy and was not meant to insult anyone's intelligence.  We first had to ask that question before we can even ask the next one.  So if exchanges are protected from foreign country laws just by using USDT.  Why would Tether, Bitfinex, Bitconnect International for that matter, stop doing business with U.S. citizens if they use USDT and are not based in the U.S.?  Why would it matter then if they do business with them?  Maybe the reason they ensure that no U.S. citizen can do business with them is because U.S. law does still apply to them if they transact with them.  By now everyone knows Bitconnect was a ponzy scheme, and if you have paid any attention, the U.S. is going after them tooth and nail.  Yes Bitconnect did have U.S. locations however Bitconnect International which is the holding company of the new BitconnectX is already up and running and is unable to be shut down since US citizens are not permitted to use that service now.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, to wrap this up, even if you still think I have no clue as to what I'm saying.  You only need to explain why a known fraudulent company and another giant clusterfuck, which worst case scenario is possibly the largest theft in human history best case is wonderful for the community.  
Why would they go through that much work?  Why would any of the multitude of fraudsters, scammers, criminals, and anyone else looking to take advantage of other people even bother doing extra work or spending more. 

&amp;nbsp;

I hope everyone was able to learn something because this took a while to put together.  If anyone wants I can post more information about the Tether issue.  I'm sure you'll have no trouble finding plenty on that though or if you need more documentation on anything I covered.

personalfinance,Paying of CC debt with personal loan. Need slight guidance,"First post in PF. Lurk quite some time now 
Hi all.   Ill get striaght to it.  

Got a personal loan offer from my credit union for 10.99% interest 
Up to 25k. 60mo.       

Did calculation and came up with 9.4k in credit card debt between 6 cards.  
I loand out 11k at 10.99% 48mo and plan to pay off all the cc debt i have with it 

The 4 cards that i paid off had interest rate from 16% to 21%  so obviously those were the first to go.  

Now the 2 cc left   and also my main question. 
1 is a best buy card with 900 balance  (17months interest free promo)      do i pay this off ? Even it being interest free for 17mo ? 
I can litteraly pay 55 a month and get it done right at the mature mark 

2 is CC i opened for balance transfer almost the same as the first one but with a 2k balance and interest free for 15mo.  
Original plan is to pay 100 a month for 14 month and just slam it at the end.  Is that a good plan ? 

Thanks.",finance
CryptoCurrency,I just did my taxes and it turns out I lost almost everything,"I bought 2 BTC in early 2017. I did a few trades between BTC and dollars but in the end effectively I sold it late in the year for about $40k and changed my mind and bought them back a few hours later. I got weak hands, what can I say.

Anyway, I still got that 2 BTC (and no cash). My accountant said because of my trades, I have to pay like 35% income taxes (short term gains) on it with state and federal, so like $15000. If I sell it now for $10k each I'm only gonna end up with $5k left over. He says I owe $15k by April no matter what happens this year to my bitcoins even though it crashed by 50%.

datascience,My boss is letting me pick my new title. What should it be?,"Hey Reddit, trying to work though this and figured I would see what others thought.

I work at a Federally Qualified Health Center as a Data Analyst coming up on 3 years now and my boss has asked me to suggest a new title. This is part of a restructure of the team that currently only has 2 of 4 positions staffed and difficulty hiring due to low salaries, as a small-medium sized non-profit.

The difficulty in coming up with a new job title is in the variety of the work I do (warehouse architecture/development, requirements gathering, data analysis, report writing, quality council work, infrastructure setup and maintenance, etc).

A little bit about me and my contributions. I had no experience in data when I started but have had several big 'wins'. I built a data warehouse from a single T-SQL script with SELECT INTO statements to a concurrently extracting, high performance dimensional data warehouse. I performed 85/95% of the work and vision on two projects that were recognized by our federal auditors as FQHC best practices. I also have discovered security vulnerabilities in operational systems that triggered projects to replace them with more secured systems. Education wise I have a BS in Computer Science and I completed the Stanford AI-Class.com course in the top 99% of students.

My long term goals are driving towards data science but I still lack the practical machine learning and predictive analytics skills and practice. While I feel like I could suggest almost any title within reason and have it considered, I'm hesitant to go with something that might set me up for failure so soon. I was pretty partial to going with a Data Engineer title, but a consultant I highly respect suggested something like Senior Data Analyst since it would be more in line with Data Scientist in the future and the idea is growing on me.

The biggest requirement that was handed down to me is that it has to be market review-able, so nothing too out of the mainstream. Any thoughts/advice?",technology

personalfinance,How to best use refund to pay off debts?,"So I'm currently working on getting out of debt. I won't claim it's not largely my fault for not being particularly careful about my spending, but I'm currently in around $20k of credit card debt, have 2 car payments (around $300/month each) and $30k of student loan debt in addition to my mortgage. Both cars will be paid off later this year, September/October.

My tax refund this year will be enough to do one of 2 things: A) Pay off one of the cars early, freeing up $300ish a month to put towards another debt. or B)Pay off one of my smaller balance credit cards completely, saving me from a higher interest rate but freeing up less extra money each month to put toward another debt.

We are also having a baby in June, so I had planned to keep some money from the refund in savings to give us a cushion during the two months my wife will not be getting a full paycheck while off work. Paying off the car will give me less extra as a cushion, but also reduce my monthly payments significantly so it shouldn't be needed.

dogecoin,"My experience with Eobot, free\paid cloud mining with faucet. Active and paying since 2013","Hi all, 
I thought I would quickly and briefly share my experience with  [Eobot]( https://www.eobot.com/new.aspx?referid=1628277)  so far. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have a GTX 1080ti in my gaming PC and always wondered if it would be worthwhile putting it to work mining whilst I was at work, so I started experimenting with different coins to see if it would be profitable. 

&amp;nbsp;

As the prices and difficulty of mining coins change so rapidly, you never quite get the £ you expect to at setup. After electricity I reckon I was making about £5 a day. That may seem not too bad considering, but I was always worried my GPU would pack in after hearing some horror stories, so gave it up rather quickly. 

&amp;nbsp;

At this point I started looking at cloud mining, there were the obvious big players like Genesis and Hashflare, but  [Eobot]( https://www.eobot.com/new.aspx?referid=1628277)  for some reason appealed to me more. You can literally start mining for free using their faucet to get drip fed a small amount of coin or GHS per day. The trick is not to mine coin straight away, but to reinvest your current GHS for more 5 year GHS, this causes exponential growth over time. You have the option to deposit coin and convert them to more GHS as well as using your own hardware to mine their pools, which adds to your hashing power. I added my GTX 1080ti and wasn’t getting great figures so stopped after 3 hours, didn’t spend much time on it so could have possibly improved with some effort.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve invested around £55 and currently have 60 GHS this equates to £10.80 a year in terms of what I can gain from the miner. At first glance that seems rubbish, but as I’m currently mining my GHS and not coin, the £10.80 increases daily. As it’s a 5 year contract, I have 5 years of exponential growth, that excites me. 

&amp;nbsp;

Another thing I liked was the “Get out quick” option in the way of a 24 hour SHA-256 4.0 contract, this basically involves using your current SHA-256 5 Year GHS contract and converting it all in to a 24 hour contract. Just pump it all on to doge, wait 24 hours and leave with your coins. At the time of writing this, there are currently 20 coins to choose from, including the biggies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple &amp; Doge 😊

&amp;nbsp;

**TIP1**: it took me a day to realise that [Eobot]( https://www.eobot.com/new.aspx?referid=1628277)  mines bitcoin by default. You need to select the dropdown at the top left of your account screen to select the currency to mine. But as mentioned you really want to choose GHS 4.0 to bump up your hashing power to start with.

**TIP2**: Use free faucets from other providers to maximise your GHS. I use 2 on a daily basis, these are
[MoonDoge]( http://moondoge.co.in/?ref=4c45e5dc6578) ,
[FreeDoge]( http://freedoge.co.in/?r=1950940) 


**TIP3**: If you decide to put cash in to it, keep your eye on the GHS rate, it fluctuates so buy when low. 

**TIP4**: Use referrals to gain small bonuses every so often, every little helps 😊 

I’m only scratching the surface and haven’t covered everything, but if you have any questions, I’m glad to help where I can.

Cheers, Kelv. 

Note: Eobot wrote - December 19, 2017 -Unfortunately, we have had to remove new sales of GHS cloud mining for USA based customers. This is a result of outside circumstances and there is no plan to add it back in the near future. Your existing GHS will continue functioning like normal.",cryptocurrency

They are essentially a tool for giving broad market access to the masses. They also help you get exposure to sectors or asset classes that you may be unable to otherwise. 

The popularity of indexing, though, has fed on itself and instead of thought, momentum has ruled the decade. I believe momentum and herd mentality are synonymous.

financialindependence,Seeking advice on purchasing a second house,"Hey r/fi, I don't have older/wiser financial mentors I can pose this question to, so I'm hoping that some of you property moguls can recommend the best way to forge ahead.

I currently own (mortgage) a townhouse (TH) that I live in and rent out the extra bedrooms. 

I'd like to buy another property, live in that one, and rent my current TH. When I move, I would rent my current TH to a single entity/family for enough to cover the mortgage. I also plan to rent out the basement or an extra room in the new TH.

Is this the best way to go forward? I've also heard about leveraging equity. Should I be looking at leveraging the value in my current TH so I don't have to put as much cash into the new TH?

I was also considering forming an LLC to transfer my current TH over to and that way I would have some protection if a renter tried to sue me for some reason.

personalfinance,ROTH 401k vs Traditional. Is there a big difference?,"I’m hoping for somebody to poke a hole in my thinking. I’ve historically only contributed to a traditional 401k and now I’m considering doing half in  ROTH 401k. Right now my traditional 401k contributions of 18,500/year are saving me $4070in taxes. Once my wife starts working I’ll save $4440in taxes(24% top bracket) for me and $4440 for her when she maxes her 401k out too. 

Assuming I’m going to contribute the same effective value to either 401k option, it looks like this: 
My 401k will yield: 18,500, 5% interest rate, 35 years=$1,758,773
If I take the $4440 saving in taxes and invest that in a brokerage account, it will yield $422,105.

ROTH 401k will yield $1,758,773. 

Now once I’m retired and let’s say I want $100k/year. For Roth, it’s simple, I don’t pay taxes and $100k/year will last me 17.59years. 

For traditional, the 401k will be taxed as income, and using today’s tax tables, that will put the rate at 17.3%. The brokerage will be taxed as capital gains at 20%. Using a weighted average with the different balances, I get a tax rate of 17.8%. That means I need to withdraw $121,700 to get $100,000/year. This will last 17.92years. 

If I use a 32% current top tax bracket(income between $315,000-$400,000), then the traditional+ brokerage will get me $100k/year for  19.08 years. 

If you do this same exercise with the 24% bracket and assume you only need $77k/year in retirement, then the traditional 401k makes more sense as it will last you 24% longer than the Roth. 

The above calculations assume that we have the same tax bracket setup in 35 years. It seems like there is a slim chance that we have the same setup and with the traditional barely edging out the Roth, I feel like I’d rather have my money in the Roth. Unless they impose a tax on Roth accounts, I’d feel better about a bucket of money that isn’t subject to a change in tax policy like the traditional and the brokerage would be. 

I also like the idea of being in retirement and having two different buckets of money to withdraw from where one bucket is subject to taxes and one isn’t. I think I want half of our money in traditional and half in Roth. 


Also, I know I’m only looking at one retirement account when in reality my wife and I have 4 but I think the logic applies to her 401k as well.

stocks,Renaissance Hedge Fund Sees ‘Significant’ Risk of Correction,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/renaissance-hedge-fund-sees-significant-180206140.html

Renaissance Technologies, the world’s most profitable hedge fund, said there’s a “significant"" risk of a correction in prices and is preparing for possible market turbulence.

While accelerating global growth, corporate tax reform and a business-friendly administration in the U.S. have contributed to market gains, it’s not clear these factors justify current valuations, especially in light of sovereign debt levels,  Ed Hubner, the quant firm’s head of risk control, wrote in a December letter sent to clients this month.

The best global economic growth in seven years has helped stoke a multi-year rally in stocks. The current S&amp;P 500 Index’s price-to-earnings ratio of about 18.6, compared with about 11 in 2011, may be justified if volatility remains low and 30-year bonds hold below 3 percent, Hubner wrote in the letter seen by Bloomberg.

“However, with higher rates and more volatility a distinct possibility, there is a significant risk that asset prices will correct,” he said.

In addition, the downward technical pressure on the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, due to the growth of strategies that bet against market volatility, and lower correlations within the S&amp;P 500, shouldn’t be confused with unshakable economic calm, Hubner said.

‘False Sense’

“While the fear of missing out may not be a concern for equity investors, increasing euphoria mixed with a bit of complacency certainly is,” he said. ""Historically low levels of volatility may well have given investors a false sense of security in the nearly two years since the last market correction.""

Hubner also cited the flattening of the yield curve as a cause for concern and said there are technical pressures on Treasuries that may further weigh on bond prices.

“Who is going to buy the paper the Federal Reserve accumulated during the years of quantitative easing? If the Chinese reassess their appetite for U.S. debt, rates will have to move up to finance the projected $700 billion U.S. deficit this year,” he said.

The firm’s Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund, known as RIEF, returned 15 percent last year, according to the letter, as the S&amp;P 500 Index gained 19 percent. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for East Setauket, New York-based Renaissance, declined to comment.

Former military code-breaker Jim Simons founded Renaissance in the 1980s and ceded control of the firm to Peter Brown and Robert Mercer eight years ago. Mercer stepped down from his role as co-chief executive officer as of Jan. 1 on Simons’s suggestion, after concern that Mercer’s backing of  Stephen Bannon and Breitbart News had hurt morale at the firm.

Hubner also wrote in the letter that while equity prices have moved upward for many years, and technical and quantitative analysts say ""trend is your friend,"" at some point trends reverse.

“While we cannot know when that will happen with the current markets, we are doing our best to prepare for what may be turbulence ahead,” he wrote.",finance

However, the amount getting pulled from my paycheck is such that $711 ($18.5k / 26) is getting deposited into just the voluntary account itself every pay period, in addition to the contributions to the mandatory account. I am aware that matching does not count toward 401k/403b contribution limits, but surely the mandatory 5.5% payroll reduction does (which for me is about $2600 a year, putting my total annual contributions at $21.1k).

I asked HR about this and they confirmed that the max for the voluntary account is $18.5k by itself, but I've never heard of anything like this. Are they just confused, and am I going to get $2600 removed from my 403b by the IRS at the end of the year?",finance
personalfinance,Should I keep or cancel my Whole Life Insurance?...also seeking general advice.,"In my quest for financial independence, I'm stuck on something..and could really use some of the wisdom from this subreddit regarding the decision to keep or cancel my whole life insurance.

When my husband was born, his mother signed him up for a whole life ins plan through State Farm. He is now 31 years old. Here are the details of that plan and the current cash value:

* Insurance amount: $10K

* Monthly premium: $6.40

* Cash value: $887.10

* Accumulated dividends: $1393.83

Then about 2.5yrs ago we purchased a much larger whole-life plan thru State Farm and I'm beginning to feel remorse and skepticism over it:

* Insurance amount: $100K for each of us

* Total premium per month: $259.95

I'm not sure of the current cash value or dividends on the larger plan but last I checked it pretty small, which is to be expected as it's only about 2.5yrs old. With the premium being so high I'm starting to feel skeptical if this was really a good idea. The agent taught us that your cash value and premiums break even after 30yrs, then becomes profitable. She described this as being good for people in my situation with little assets because it is a safe long term investment. But the breaking even/profitability doesn't seem to be the case in my husbands 30yr old plan unless you add cash value + dividends. Is that supposed to be how it works? Has anyone had experience with whole life ins returning a profit?

I'm not sure what to do because each year that passes, we are getting older and premium options are going to be higher if we decide to change. But I'm frozen with indecision and I feel ignorant. I want to be locked into something good while we are still young and healthy (aside from being overweight.)

Here is my current financial overview:

* Gross income: ~$120K/yr (husband stay at home parent)
* Student Debt: ~$90K (10K private 7% variable, 80K fixed 6.55%)
* Purchased house 2yrs ago ~$180K 4.25% FHA loan
* 401(k): contributing 5%, employer matches 4% (current bal $55k)
* Employee stock purchase plan: Contributing 1% salary into walgreens boots alliance stock (current bal $5K)
* Savings account: 10% deductions to an online savings account with 1.45% interest rate (current bal $7K)
* Misc debt: ~$5600 on a water softening system 18% variable rate (horrible decision)

Even though I gross $10K per month income, I still feel like we are living paycheck to paycheck. And that $260/month would help a lot. Would it be a smart idea to keep this whole life insurance? I also welcome any general financial advice and wisdom. We have a lot to learn.

personalfinance,How to maximize the benefits of my credit card reward system?,"Hey! So my situation is kinda weird right now; I'm 23 years old, in college (living off campus and paying super inflated rent prices) and have a credit card with a $13k limit for which I am the authorized user. My parents are not co-signed on the card. 

My car is paid off, my main expenses are my rent, groceries and putting back money for savings. I want to know how I can make this credit card work for me...it does have a crazy in interest rate (17.99% I believe) but the reward system is pretty nice. I have just been using it for online shopping and paying it off every month but I'm graduating this May and would like to do some traveling before I start applying for grad school. I know that you can get flights discounts when you have a lot of points (I only have about 6000 right now).

This company no longer ""officially"" exists, and apparently the CEO did a terrible job of closing off our accounts, which included our Intuit account, so no W-2's were sent out. 

I stopped working there sometime in April 2017 and traveled for a few months before starting a new job in late August 2017. I have a W-2 from my current company but not from my previous employer.

Card 2: 26.99% APR $744.31 of $800


Getting both under 30% utilization would cost about the same as paying off Card 1 in full.

Asking for a friend who's got about $50K in student debt. He's been paying more than required for months now and really just wants to get this out of the way before saving up for a house and applying for loans.

I know he doesn't have amazing credit and I'm wondering if he's missing a chance to boost his credit score by paying the payments on time, regularly, and for a longer duration (ie: NOT paying nearly 2x each month).

personalfinance,"I think I'm right...if so, the 2018 Tax Reform hurts my family pretty bad next year on our tax returns.","Something in my head told me to project my family's 2018 taxes to see what we'll get refunded/owe in 2019.  I found an Excel spreadsheet online (https://sites.google.com/site/excel1040/home/2018-tax-planner-new-tax-law) that mimics how the current 2018 1040 will look and act like, so I am using that.  After entering our numbers and projecting how much we'll get taken out in taxes each paycheck, etc...I came up with an alarming number: we would owe $3,400.

Without getting into too much details, here's our breakdown of incomes and our deductions/credits.  Both employers are using the 2018 tax witholding methods as of our most recent paychecks:

* Married Joint
* 1 child

Me

* Taxable Income: 102000
* 0 exemptions
* Paid bi-monthly
* $25 extra per paycheck

Her

* Taxable income: 57000
* 0 exemptions
* Paid bi-weekly


2018 Tax Return Details

* Taxable Refund: 1334 (2017's State Refund, No federal refund)

Deductions

* Mortgage: 11000
* State and local Income taxes: capped at 10000
* Real Estate Tax: 2700

Am I missing anything from the Deductions?

Credits

* Child: 2000


Based on my Deductions assumptions above, we will need to take the Standard Deduction.

* Total Income: 158334
* Std Deductiion: 24000
* Taxable Income: 138334
* Calculated Tax: 21432
* Income Tax Witheld: 16000 (estimated based on recent witholding on paystubs. Both employers are using the 2018 tax witholding methods.)
* Child Tax Credit: 2000
* Total Payments: 18000

Total Payments - Calculated Tax = refund (owe)

18000-21432=(3432)

Does this look about right?

If so, this 2018 Tax Reform is a very big letdown for my wife and I.  What we get extra in our paychecks needs to go right back to the Federal Government to prevent owing that much in 2019.",finance

personalfinance,Wife's student loans are causing us to have a revolving monthly negative balance. (US),"Back in 2013, my wife and I both a house before we got married, at the age of 25. Shortly after we got married. That year I also bought a new car, my old car was not reliable.

We have been filing joint since then, as we got the best tax return. Our 2013 return was almost $8000. Since then its been between 3-5k.

In 2015 we had to buy her a new car. She buys a car and drives it till it dies. This was the second car she has ever bought.

In 2015 her Federal loans came out of whatever they were in, that she didn't have to pay while still in school - and we got stuck with a $450 a month loan payment.

All was fine and dandy until you add that. 

Here's our, at minimum monthly expenses:
Mortgage: $2147 (this has increased from $1798 a month due to tax increases due to the property increasing $100,000 in worth since we purchased)
Utilities: $400 (this is a rough estimate for gas, electric, water)
Car 1: $320
Car 2: $390
Car Inusrance: $188
Federal Student Loan: $544
Wells Fargo S.Loans: $187
Navient Student Loans: $139

That putting us around $4400 a month in base line bills.
I make around (minimum) $1400 bi-weekly, and she is around $1000 bi-weekly - both after tax. So that puts us right around $4800 a month.

Every month we run that line of Net0 or a negative balance. Negative is the more common of the two.

Is there anything we can do with the loans? Primarily the Federal loan. The Wells Fargo and Navient are already several loans consolidated.

Edit: Mortgage was listed at $1998 and not $1798

Edit2: It should be noted that when we bought our house, our household income was close to $160k. My wife lost her job (due to health insurance reasons - her employer wanted her to pay $630 a month on their insurance) for about 9 months which we started acruing debt. Since then we have been working our way back. 2016 our household income was close to 105k. I know last year I made 107k myself, so im hoping we are back on our way to our original.",finance

personalfinance,I defaulted on my student loan,"It is important to begin, I feel, that this all came down on me for my own stupid, stupid choices. I willfully ignored my mounting loan debt until far too late.

A day or so ago, I finally opened rather than ignored one of the ominous envelopes in my mail, and a good thing too - it was the first notice (I believe) that my student loan (~$40,000) was sent to Coast Professional Inc. for collections on the due ~$8,000. I have, to my name, around $10,000 in the bank - perhaps ironically, I was considering posting on here to ask about how to invest my paltry wealth. No credit cards, no other outstanding debts, I live fairly frugally for just above minimum wage (though pennies from the federal government's hands are not the type I should have been pinching.)

I have been told I'm being offered a loan rehabilitation program; something on the order of $5 monthly payments for 9 months, at which point my debt will be returned to a normal collection agency and, supposedly, the DoE will request the default status be removed from my credit rating - not that it will do me MUCH good, after all of the missed payments, but still. I believe they also said it would knock off the company's collection fee as well, since Coast Professional would no longer be collecting on it.

To the crux of the post, then: Is Coast Professional Inc. acting in good faith? I've seen only sporadic details about them in my searches, including an article implying they were losing the federal contract, and a class action against them (mostly about aggressive collection tactics, but also making false promises in some cases).

A more dumb question: Is the loan rehabilitation program my best option? They certainly make a convincing case, and it does feel like my choices are limited to making this appeal or paying CPI for the rest of my days.

A slightly less dumb question: That's 9 months I have of basically change to reestablish my loan. I still have that $10,000; is it secure enough that I could invest with it in the meantime, or should I abandon any dreams of making that money work for me?",finance

Bitcoin,A Diversity of Tactics,"There was another decentralized movement that was based on consensus. It was a time of hope. It was a time of the future.


That movement was Occupy Wall Street, and it buckled under the pressure of infighting, indecision, and ignorance.


Segregated Witness and Lightning Network, you say. Schorr’s Signatures, you say. HODL, you say.


Let’s be real here.


Bitcoin is a public ledger, and secondary protocol is being placed over it to give people the anonymity and speed they require. But what if I told you that one of Bitcoin’s main strengths comes from its public ledger?


The very nature of corruption is boiled down to the clandestine world of political finance, and a machine oiled by the transparency of bitcoin would bring hope back to the planet.


We already have the consensus mechanisms that OWS lacked, and God knows we also have the longevity.


We can game the political process by incentivizing participation and turning donations into a investment opportunity. Why donate to a traditional political campaign when you can stake your coins on a candidate and use the proceeds to fund their success? 

Citizens of countries can be incentivized to vote, call their representatives, go door to door, or any other political duties that would help the movement.


We finally have the technology to achieve what many Americans experienced when Obama was voted into office, but now, we have the tools to tailor the flow of funding wherever the community desires. We don't have to be at the whim of party over country, or country over citizen.


You tell me there is no use case. Well, I say the true use case hasn't been appreciated yet.


In every nation on earth, there is a battle to be fought. The wolves of the world fill our bags with money so we feel comfortable enough to take out a mortgage. This is then followed by shady financial practices which crashes the world economy. Rinse and repeat.


Last night, Trump called on the members of Congress for a federal spending bill leveraged by private sector investments.


This sounds awfully familiar.


Andreas Antonopoulos warned us that the same entities who crashed the world economy with shady default swaps are doing the same thing again, and Trump’s speech last night was a validation for things to come.


So let us come together and understand why we are here in the first place.


The power for financial revolution is here, so let us be a little more optimistic and open-minded on application and use-case. Let us utilize a diversity of tactics to reach a destination where digital consensus mechanisms have an effect on an analog world. 


Let us free society from the clutches of power and corruption.

TL;DR Lets think about using the power of decentralized consensus and public ledgers to reapproach the way traditional politics are carried out.",cryptocurrency

investing,"The roll out of 5G, the IOT and rapid international growth is driving American Tower’s stock price higher","American Tower (AMT), the real estate investment trust that leases space on communications sites and towers is now the biggest REIT in the world with 150,000 sites in its portfolio.  

Its stock price has risen 43% over the past year and now has a yield of just 1.9% - but with the rapid growth in the number of connected devices it doesn’t look like either the business growth or stock price and going to end any time soon.  Orbis Research forecast demand for data will increase by 21% CAGR until 2021.

The demand will be driven primarily by;

- tower companies look set to benefit as networks compete to be first to deliver a 5G network

- the collapse of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger means Sprint will need to invest in its network.  Sprint, which was already being placed last in network quality rankings, has said it will will up its network capex in a big way with reports that it will triple its spend to $5 billion

- this month AT&amp;T announced that all 50 U.S. states had decided to opt into FirstNet, a Federal government-backed communications network that will be built and operated by AT&amp;T to provide connectivity for first responders across the country

- Internationally, American Towers revenues are growing by double digits in every region.  Don’t be fooled by the name, over 70% of AMTs towers and 45% of revenues are generated internationally with a strong focus on India and Brazil.


The stock has seen some great gains recently but with huge prospects, domestic and international, and with AMT's clever targeting of growth markets and fast growing multinational wireless companies -- the outlook for long term growth and for AMT's stock price look bright.

personalfinance,Tax returns rejected bc of birthday please help,"Hey all, sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit (if it is please direct me to where I should post this). 

So last year I tried to file my taxes online using TurboTax and hrblock. It always got rejected bc it said my birthday was wrong, so I mailed them in and never got a response or refund or anything. 

This year, i tried again and got the same result, so I called the SSA and yep they had my birthday wrong. 

Two days ago I went in and fixed it, and tried to refile. It’s still getting rejected because it says my birthday is wrong. Called up the SSA, waited on the phone for an hour, and they now say they have the correct birthday on file.

Wtf do I do? I’m still missing out on my refund from last year and now I’m worried I’m gonna lose my refund this year too.

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt for my soon-to-be wife and I,"This may seem like a really basic question, and if so I apologize. I’ve been enjoying reading through this subreddit and can’t wait to put some things I’ve learned to use. 

I’m getting married in about a week and a half! My fiancé has about $27,000 in student loans, with interest rates ranging from 3.5-6.5%. I have one student loan that stands at $5000 and the interest rate is 3.76%. This is our only debt, and we have made it a mission to eradicate it as quickly as possible. 

My salary is $52,000 and when my fiancé moves here with me she’ll be making around $30,000. I’ve saved $8,000 (outside of a $1,500 emergency fund) since graduation in May. I’ve been reluctant to pay off my loan completely (it just got out of grace period) until after the wedding/honeymoon just in case there are unexpected expenses. Assuming we don’t need to spend the money, should I completely pay off my loan and some of hers, or should I apply the money to the highest interest loan? I know it probably won’t make a huge difference because we plan to have all the loans paid off by the end of 2018. But we want to plan for the worst and hope for the best while also learning how to best manage our finances so that we will be well prepared for retirement. Any recommendations for what to do after we become debt free, finance wise, would also be hugely appreciated. 

If it makes a difference: I am 22 and she is 23, I put 5% in my 401K and my company matches at 4%, expenses each month add up roughly $2,300 (though I expect that to increase slightly after the wedding).

TL:DR: Is it preferable to pay off larger, higher interest loans first or smaller, lower interest loans first?

personalfinance,Should I just pay off my Student Loans?,"23 years old, have $40k in savings and $27k in student loans with interest rates ranging from 3%-6.5%.  Still living at home so other expenses are minimal.  However I do plan to move out within the next 6 months.

Would it be stupid to just pay off these loans in one lump sum? Is it worth wiping them away taking into consideration building my credit score, taking advantage of tax deductions, anything else etc, or are those things just insignificant in the grand scheme of paying off your student loans anyway.  

Worked hard for it but for the most part the money is just sitting in my bank account anyway and I would still have a nice cushion afterwards.",finance
personalfinance,Tax Return and Bonus Came In. Debt to Pay. Need a Little Advice.,"Thanks in advance for any advice on this! 

I just got my 2017 Tax Refund and my Quarterly Bonus from my job (Restaurant Manager.) I  just paid off my car in December so I've been using that money to catch up / get ahead on bills and start paying down Credit Cards. I am down to just 5 CC's and I'm not sure what is the wisest way to go about them. First time attempting formatting so hopefully this isnt too ugly.

Here's where I'm at:

Tax Return 2100
Bonus 2362.5
Total 4462.5

I have a little extra I can throw at it to make it an even 5k.

Credit Card  - Current Owed - APR - Typical Payments

Amazon       - 468 - 26.99% - 50

Gamestop    - 336 - 27.99% - 50

Capital 1 Big - 3018 - 21.45% - 100

Capital 1 Small - 1498 - 21.45% - 75

Credit One - 1811 - 25.15% - 100

Total - 7131

So I basically have two thoughts. 

* Pay my biggest 2 off.
* Pay my smallest 4 off.

Either way I would use the ""saved"" payments each month to ""snowball"" into the other credit cards to pay them off faster. Doing quick math I believe, assuming no major life issues, I can have them all paid off with in the year.

With the interest rates, I would *assume* paying off the 4 smallest would be the best bet as my biggest credit card has the lowest actual interest rate. But on the other hand ~21% on 3k is a bigger absolute amount than ~27% on 500. 

So yeah. Scratching my head. Any advice would be glorious!

personalfinance,Student Loan consolidation (Private) - Advice!,"I am trying to refinance four private loans from AES that total up to 39K and have variable interest rates of 5.5%, 6.3%, 8.3% and a whopping 9.5% with repayment terms of twenty years.

I recently started my first career job making $55k gross pay in the greater LA area (which I feel blessed with honestly)I have ~27k-30k in federal loans for school, car fully paid off, and I live rent-free at my parents until June, and I'm getting married in July thus I need to get an apartment to support my future-wife and I. 

With that said, I have the option of investing into 401k, and choosing medical and dental benefits. The company will match 100% of 3%, and 50% of the next 2%. Should I just put forth the 3% and not the extra 2%?

Regarding medical, they offer the Gold PPO and Silver-Bronze-Safety Net HSAs. I am in great medical health, but haven't had medical insurance in probably 2 years. Is the Safety Net HSA all I need? I desperately need to enroll in the dental, as I have bad teeth and never even had braces... I'm just hoping orthodonists will take whatever dental insurance I'm given. 

I guess what I need help with... is if it is worth to start my 401k as early as possible, while working on loan payments, while enrolled in medical + dental, *while* saving up to support my future wife and I?

personalfinance,Credit Score Dropped after Balance Transfer?,"Hi, I'm currently in school with a part-time job. 

I have about ~32k of federal student loans that need to be paid off. I decided to do a 0% balance transfer offer until 7/2019 of $6500 to prevent paying interest on those loans that were initially disbursed between 2012 and 2014. I calculated I could have it all paid off by 4/19 easily by making minimum payments of $250 biweekly. The only issue is that my credit score has been tanking from 780 to 715 within the few weeks I did this. I transferred the balance of 6500 to a card that only had a limit of 7200. But across all my accounts all my credit lines add up to 31% utilization. Should I request a higher credit limit, pay some of it off now so its ~20% utilization (defeats point of the balance transfer to pay off loans slowly without accumulating interest) or does it not matter in the short term since I'm not going to make any large purchases anyway? I'm just worried I'll keep going down until I'm at 500 or something and won't be able to finance anything in the next year that I graduate?.",finance
