technology,My local Indiana representative actually responded to an email I sent about Res 34,"&gt; Thank you for contacting me regarding S.J. Res. 34.  I appreciate the time you have taken to inform me of your thoughts on this issue.
&gt; 
&gt; The internet has been a source of tremendous economic growth and an invaluable communications tool since it was widely deployed across America. Like you, I believe that all Americans deserve a fair understanding of their privacy expectations when engaging in online activity. 
&gt; 
&gt; As you may know, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been the federal agency responsible for consumer protection, including enforcing Internet privacy standards for the last two decades.  The FTC has successfully created a regulatory system that maintains robust consumer privacy protections while encouraging continued online innovation.  The FTC‚Äôs regulatory framework for Internet privacy applies consistent security standards across multiple business sectors, which provides consumers with stable privacy expectations across all aspects of online activity.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCC‚Äôs broadband privacy rule circumvents the FTC‚Äôs jurisdictional expertise in online privacy protections by issuing new privacy regulations only for Internet Service Providers (ISPs).  This unprecedented move diminishes FTC‚Äôs authority and imposes an uneven patchwork of regulations across the Internet community.  The complete consumer online experience consists of multiple components in addition to ISPs, including: websites; apps; browsers; and operating systems.  Subjecting only one of these players to overly-prescriptive privacy regulations creates inaccurate security expectations for consumers, while creating a duplicative and unnecessary regulatory burden that stifles innovation. 
&gt; 
&gt; Senator Flake introduced S.J. Res. 34, a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).  The CRA is an oversight tool that allows Congress to pass resolutions, such as S.J. Res 34, to overturn last minute federal regulations issued by a previous Administration.  S.J. Res. 34 passed the House on March 28, 2017 with my support.  If signed into law, this resolution would overturn the FCC‚Äôs ISPs privacy requirements rule, ensuring continued comprehensive consumer privacy protections, while providing transparency and certainty for consumers online.    
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you again for contacting me.  Your thoughts and opinions are of critical importance to me as I work to represent Indiana‚Äôs 5th District in Congress.  Although we may not agree on this matter, I sincerely appreciate your comments and look forward to hearing from you in the future.

personalfinance,Advice on buying a house?,"My family has decided to help my husband and I buy a cheap house and fix it up (stepdad is a contractor). They don't want to spend more than 100,000 and preferably closer to 50,000. The idea is to get a real estate contract that we would pay and the down payment would be from my family. If my parents wanted to they could get a mortgage under their name and we would in turn make all the payments. If that were the case the interest rate would certainly be lower, and thus we would have lower monthly payments. 

My question is, should we stick with a real estate contract if we can find one? The interest rates are usually much higher... Would that benefit my credit score? Or should I convince my parents to take out a mortgage for us? The other option is I look into getting my own mortgage - the problem here is I don't think my credit score is good enough to be approved for reasonable rates (it's 650). 

Should we rent while I continue to build my credit? It's gone up 25 points in the last month (I have a small loan and a couple of credit cards) and my credit union  is fairly flexible. Not sure what to do üòê

personalfinance,Hate my job. Offered voluntary layoff. Considering it.,"TLDR: Well paid but hate my job.  Think I have enough cash to last a while if I quit.  Undecided and a bit afraid of the what-ifs and unknowns.  You only live once.  What do?

First line engineering manager at very large company.  We are in major cost cutting mode, IMO we aren't innovative anymore, we are handcuffed by bureaucracy and politics, we are bloated, and I hate it.  Despite this, they've been very good to me over the years.  They paid for my MBA and they paid for a bachelors in Computer Science that I'll finish in June (I did it for kicks/as a hobby in my spare time and I'm finishing with a 4.0).  I also have another Engineering degree which is directly related to what my company does (not software).  I left this company once before and was hired back when I asked to come back.  I understand ""grass is greener syndrome"" as I've been there and done that.   We are downsizing quite a bit this year and I'm being offered the ""opportunity"" to take a voluntary layoff.  To be clear, damn near everyone is being offered this opportunity so it's not a reflection of my performance.  I'm trying to decide whether or not to take it and this decision is about more than money.

Current base is in the low $140k range.  Bonus is nominally 10% (based on company performance) with slight upper/lower based on personal performance.  No equity compensation.  401k match is very good, plus they put in a fixed percentage whether I contribute or not.  Near zero insurance premiums for a high deductible policy.  I have 17 days of vacation, 10 days of sick leave, and many paid holidays.

I have probably $2500 in an HSA, $10k in a ROTH IRA, and about $177k in my 401(k).  One car paid off.  Another car with a payment.  I owe about $355k on a house I could sell for about $570k based on recent comps.  I have $35k in cash.  Zero credit card debt.  My monthly expenses are in the $4500 range.  I've verified that I'll be coded as ""layoff"" for unemployment reasons and I can collect the max of $2500 per month unemployment in my state for up to 6 months.  

I have a wife (she doesn't work but she could if she needed to) and a family.  I'm 40 years old.

The severance isn't great.  1 week of salary for every year of service.  Add in the payoff of unused vacation and I'll gross about $35k (I realize it will be subject to 25% lump sump withholding).  My last day on the job would be the end of June.  By then I'll be finished with my Computer Science degree.  My company will pay for my COBRA through the end of September.

I live in an expensive city with a red hot real estate market and red hot tech industry.  My county is one of the fastest growing in the nation.

By my math I could probably last about a year before I really started hurting for money.  More if my wife took a job.  I feel like in my city with 2 technical degrees (engineering and computer science) plus my MBA I should be able to find work pretty quickly.  Could probably get a software engineer job pretty quick especially if I had full time at home to prepare for interviews.  I'd be willing to take a project manager type job.  But I don't really want to be in management anymore.

Not that I want to go back to work quickly.  I'd love to have July and August off with my kids and go back to work when they go back to school (after Labor Day).  Of course I realize I'll go back whenever I find something.  I'm not concerned with making the same amount of money.  I'm more concerned with being happy.  I'm getting older and if I don't jump now I'm a bit worried about age discrimination 10 years from now.

I realize I've been rambling a bit but I'm looking for the ""what am I not considering"" type items.  Thanks for reading.",finance
personalfinance,How to calculate minimum student loan payment,"Hello PF!

I have reached out to my loan provider twice but my questions have been unanswered and I'm at wits end. My student loans are with Great Lakes and I am attempting to figure out my minimum loan payment. In my account I have a total minimum payment of $454 with six ""loan types."" Each loan type in the account has a current balance and an interest rate, all of which are below. What I want to know is what the minimum payment is for each loan type which totals the $454. According to Great Lakes they do not have this information however if they have the current balances and interest rates, it has to be able to be calculated. Does anybody have any suggestions or is there really no way of getting the info I am looking for?

Loan info:
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford - $8,109.76 @ 6.8%   
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford - $8,865.83 @ 6.8%     
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford - $8,301.82 @ 6.8%

personalfinance,About to graduate with $250K+ in student loans...is debt slave my only option?,"So here's my reality: I'm about to graduate with about $250K in student loans and I'm afraid this means years of being a debt slave with no life. All of my loans are federal, so no shady private loans and the issues those come with those. A portion of my debt (less than half) is in the form of ParentPLUS loans, but I will be responsible for those. I know that legally I am not responsible, but morally I simply cannot saddle my parents with that debt.

I am not without hope: I am graduating law school next year, and barring some major fuck ups on my part, am looking at $180K starting salary at a law firm (I'll be working with them this summer, and commonly summer jobs = post-grad jobs) in my expensive but still mostly reasonable city. So here's my question for the fine people of reddit: do I need to put my life/goals on hold and buckle down on debt?

By that I mean this: within the next five years or so, the plan is to marry my SO and start a family (I'm a female, so maternity leave and the career hinderance that comes with it is another consideration). My SO is highly unlikely to make a salary like mine (probably about $65K) and will be in school for the next 3 years regardless. This summer, I will make some good money (~$30K): should I just lump sum pay that into my old undergrad debts? Should I save it and avoid taking out loans for my last year of law school? Or should I save/invest it as a nest egg for marriage/kids? 

My plan is to work myself to almost death in the beginning and pay off my loans in 3-4 years. This means no savings, no luxuries, no car, etc. That way, I can be as close to debt free as possible before potentially starting a family. Keeping in mind that my SO has significant debt as well, but far less than mine. Probable less than $100K.

My chosen field has a very high burnout rate, and I will have minimal job security (we can't all make partner). I'd hate to leave my 6 figure job with nothing to show for it (except no debt) after 5 years, but I'm not sure if stretching out payments to also put aside savings is a good idea. This debt looms over me and keeps me up at night if I spend more than 5 minutes at a time thinking about it.

Any tips/advice would be great, especially on short-term what I should do with my summer income this year.",finance
personalfinance,need some advice on a home refinance please,"I am currently 5yrs 2 months into my home loan (30 yr fixed @ 3.75%).  I bought at 196k. I currently owe 171k.  I've been paying PMI ($165.00/mo) and want to have it removed.  I contacted the bank (mortgage co.) and they replied that I would need to pay down my principal to 155k and then PMI would be removed. 

I shopped around and found a no fee refi.  They even pay for the home assessment.  On a 20yr fixed.. my interest rate would go from 3.75% to 4..00% (1/4 point rise which I was told equates to $35.63/mo).  PMI would be removed. Obviously I would also be resetting my amortization table, but losing 5 years of payments.  I pay $534/mo in interest so if I'm looking at it correctly I'd save approx 30k from not having to make those 5 yrs of payments.  I would also have to bring approx 6k to closing to fund my tax escrow (unless I take the taxes out of the mortgage payment)

The other option is to take a loan against my 457 (b) account. It would be a 5yr loan for 16k (enough to drop my principal down enough to drop pin without having to refi) at approx 4.0% interest.  However it is my understanding that I would be essentially paying myself back 100% of the loan including the interest. The only downside I see to this is that the 16k I would withdrawal from 457(b) would no longer be in the market making me any money.. for 5 yrs. (I'm estimating this amount to be approx 7k)

personalfinance,Tax Return Problem?,"Hi everyone, 

Myself, my dad, my sister, and 2 cousins went all together on same day to a tax preparer we've done taxes with for the past few years and did all of our taxes on the same day and he claims he mailed it in. This was Feb 17, 2017.

None of us received any federal or state (MI) tax refund yet. Everyone we know received theirs in 2 weeks, and in past years we all received it within 2 years. 

The tax preparer says you may be under review, but how can all 5 of us be under review? I tried to check the status on IRS website and it won't show me anything, it tells me that it cannot provide any information. I also can't get a hold of a live person over the phone. 

Someone recommended that we should just mail the tax papers in again? Should I do that? How do I know there is no mistake or that the IRS actually received our papers? 

I just don't know what would happen if there's a problem and April 18th passes.

personalfinance,Should I cash out whole life insurance policy?,"Recently found out that I have a whole life Insurance Policy started by my grandparents.

stocks,"Index funds have driven valuations to record highs, and the bubble will pop someday","I have been doing some reading on this subject matter over the past few days cause I've gotten uncomfortable with how every Tom, Dick and Harry is into indexing (be it by way of ETFs or mutual funds that specifically track an index and are super low cost). 

And having read what the real experts have said (those of the school of Graham-and-Doddsville) it's clear that we are in bubble territory. 

You can't short bad stocks effectively anymore cause the S&amp;P500 keeps rising. That's an issue. Those guys that are selling are being countered by the index funds which keep buying. 

Already overvalued stocks keep getting all the more overvalued. Bad stocks that deserve the prices to fall are not falling - rising rather - since index funds now own approximately 30% of the market. 

Too much of a good thing is a bad thing. We are there. The question is, what pops the bubble? It doesn't look like we're going to have a full-on economic crisis in the next couple of years. So what could instead be the catalyst is as the Fed raises rates, the average Joe starts putting his money in the bank. It won't pop immediately, that much is certain, but it won't be long now and we should be prepared.

Every single time in history, when things got absurdly overvalued and when the talking heads were saying ""this is the new normal""...BAM it comes crashing down. It took tech stocks 4-5 years to crash, it could well be the same now. It was same in the 40's, 60's and 80's. At the end of the day, when valuations no longer reflect reality - things will come to an end. 

Another thing is that the prevalence of indexing has made correlations at an all time high. What's the purpose of diversification anymore? In this bull market almost everything has risen. Likewise when the eventual crash comes I can bet my last dollar that near every S&amp;P500 stock will crash with it. 

For now, let's ride the wave of optimism. But be on the lookout for imminent warning signs. This could be the most painful of crashes of all time. And let us discerning investors be ready for it.",finance

Well, with the help of [DappHub‚Äôs](http://dapphub.com) modular contract suite [DappSys](http://dappsys.info) (this way we didnt have to think about your security), we have constructed MetaMark! A token with an exponentially successful monetary policy managed by an advanced communal governance process.
We leverage the wisdom of the crowds by allowing any member of the Ethereum community to issue new MetaMarks. Why store your value in a limited-issuance token? Your store of value should take advantage of all that `uint256` has to offer!

You‚Äôre probably wondering what will MetaMark do? 
The possibilities are endless and we really cant be bothered to think of any right now.

How do I create my own MetaMarks you ask? Just bonk them into existence. Visit our elegant and sophisticated [frontend](http://metamask.github.io/metamark/). If you want to do something fancy like transfer or pump/dump your MetaMarks, we recommend [MEW](https://myetherwallet.com/) (which actually has native token support), but if you‚Äôre stuck with MetaMask you can go to https://wallet.ethereum.org/  &gt; Contracts &gt; Custom Tokens and track your token with this address:
`0x617b3f8050a0bd94b6b1da02b4384ee5b4df13f4`

MetaMark is so advanced that the rest of the token details should fill in automatically. If you _really_ want to know how this fool's token works, I guess you can view the source code on [github](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamark). We welcome post-launch security audits!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Collections by medical providers: What I've learned,"I am the power of attorney for several elderly people and manage all their finances.  This includes medical bills.  Here are some of the things I've learned in dealing with medical collections:  

**1. Mistakes are common and you should read your bills carefully.  You may receive bills for the same services that are formatted differently, include other charges, or otherwise don't look identical.**  

It's very difficult to keep track of medical bills.  If extensive services are provided, there will be tons of bills and often bills will be duplicated.  I keep logs with service dates, and underneath each date I write a brief description, including what was provided and when I paid and the insurance breakdown.  Hospitalizations after surgery are the most tricky to keep track of, because bills may come from many different practices.  The anesthesiologist usually bills separately.  

**2. Coding errors are common and may result in non-payment by the insurance carrier.**  

For each procedure, the provider must submit a code to the insurance company.  These codes often will determine whether or not insurance will pay.  

In general, if you know you are going in for a test, call your insurance company in advance and ask under what circumstances your test is covered.  Then make sure to ask your provider to use the specific coding.  For example, tests are often covered if they are preventative but NOT if they are diagnostic.  

If your provider has incorrectly submitted the code and the insurance company tells you this is why they have not paid out, don't pay the provider and then attempt to get the money back.  This lessens the provider's motivation to resubmit the bill with the correct coding.  

**3. Out-of-network providers may not be covered at the same rate or may not be covered at all.**  

This may be negotiable with the insurance company, especially if you had no choice in the matter (e.g., an anesthesiologist at the hospital who you never got to choose).  Always ask.  Document your phone calls with brief written notes.  

**4. Writing letters and documenting requests for bill errors to be corrected is good.  However, the bill payment address is not the best place to send letters.  You may wish to send certified mail to the practice address.**    

It is very frustrating, but if you find an error and write to the address listed on your bill (usually a P.O. box), most likely nobody will ever answer.  The address on the bill is usually just a payment processing center.  It would seem logical that correspondence would be forwarded, but it doesn't seem to be.  Even when the bill has two addresses listed, and one address has a note that reads ""do not send correspondence to this address,"" the other address probably isn't any good for correspondence either.  

I sent several letters requesting that billing errors be corrected but received no response other than having the account turned over to collections.  One bill hadn't been submitted to insurance despite the fact that I'd sent copies of the insurance cards AND filled out the back of the bill where it requests insurance information.  The billing office later told me that they don't know if letters to that address are ever answered.  WTF? 

**5. Calling the billing office is sometimes helpful, but leaves you without documentation.  Follow up by writing a brief summary and send it to the medical practice address.**  

Calling the billing office is even better if it's actually staffed by somebody at your doctor's practice.  If you make calls, ask for names and make notes for your own records.  

**6. If the bill is turned over to collections erroneously, make sure to respond to the collection agency as well as the provider.**  

I did this by phone and by certified mail.  I included copies of all the letters I'd previously sent.  

**7. If all else fails, try the public relations office or escalate elsewhere.**  

The PR office got somebody from billing who had some authority to call me back.  Previously I'd talked to three people in the billing department without any effect and the bill was sent to collections shortly after being assured the bill would be corrected.  

**8. If you legitimately owe a bill and it's a large amount, most providers will allow you to work out a payment plan that is comfortable for you.**

They mostly want to see that you're paying regularly.  It is easier to set up a payment plan before the bill goes to collections.  

**TLDR:  Read bills carefully, make reasonable requests, document everything.**

personalfinance,Damn those student loans straight to hell.,"I have no interesting story, just shifting priorities around. 

I've paid off my car and my credit cards are all paid down to $0. Since 2009 I've just been paying the minimum on my $40,000 student loan. This is the last bit of debt I have outstanding. I was on the whole ""If I just largely ignore it and pay the minimum every month, it'll eventually go away."" method of debt repayment.

It's a sobering realization when you start adding trendlines to all this and realize that I'd be paying my student loan until **2035**. 

http://i.imgur.com/5D3J9IL.png

The current plan was getting on direct deposit payments which dropped the interest rate something small like 0.25%. This gets paid once a month at $265. Then an immediate $500 payment. Then I've been doubling payments every month - basically the $265 payment on the 1st, and then another $300 on the 15th. 

Any money I'd usually put towards savings or fun stuff goes towards the loan now. I dropped my savings to a level I find comfortable and put the rest ($8000) towards the loan. A $2000 payment once. I know it's not great advice: ""Yeah, to pay off your loan just start dropping thousands of dollars towards it."" I suppose the idea is priorities (which is something I read here). There's no point in paying minimum payments and then inflating your savings when you have all these debts racking up interest.

Long story short, I'll be done with loans by the end of the year, but probably more like 2018 since I can't maintain things like that $8000 payment. I suppose my motivation is not wanting to pay loans out until 2035 and wanting to shave 17 years off the payment time.",finance

personalfinance,What amount do I pay to avoid decreasing my 0% balance transfer while paying the rest of my balance on my credit card(USA),"I'm always a bit confused on how much to pay. Over the past few months I've been accidentally decreasing my balance transfer. Reading my statement now it looks like I should pay the new balance minus my balance subject to interest rate? I tried calling Chase and the representative only confused me.

My current statement says this:

New Balance $3,828.37

Payment Due Date 04/17/17

Minimum Payment Due $52.00

Previous Balance $4,020.86

Payment, Credits -$500.00

Purchases +$293.65

Cash Advances $0.00

Balance Transfers $0.00

Fees Charged $0.00

Interest Charged +$13.86

New Balance $3,828.37

Opening/Closing Date 02/21/17 - 03/20/17

Credit Access Line $6,000

Available Credit $2,171

Cash Access Line $1,200

Available for Cash $1,200

Past Due Amount $0.00

Balance over the Credit Access Line $0.00


Type| APR|Expiration Date|Balance subject to interest rate| interest charged
---| ---|---|---|---
Purchases|19.49%(v)(d) | -| $926.89 |$13.86
Cash Advances| 25.49%(v)(d)| - |-0-| -0-
Balance Transfer| 19.49%(v)(d)| -| -0- |-0-
Balance Transfer Promotion| 0.00% (d) |10/20/17 |$2,972.92 |-0- 


So for this statement I should probably pay $3,828.37 (new balance) - $2,972.92 (my Balance Transfer)

Should I also subtract my minimum payment?

personalfinance,Why would my federal taxes be more than Line 78 on IRS Form 1040,"I decided to do my own taxes this year, instead of hiring an accountant like I did last year. I am (was for 2016) a 1099 contractor. I am looking at my 1040 filed for last year, and I see:  
*Line 63 (Total Tax) - $6,458  
*Line 78 (Amount Owed) - $6,574  
  
So far, it makes sense to me, as I had a $116 estimated tax penalty. However, in the email that my accountant sent me wrapping up my taxes, he told me that I owed $7,004 federal taxes, which is what I paid to the IRS.

personalfinance,Question about mortgage and interest,"Sorry in advance if this is not the right place to ask about mortgages.

I was trying to get pre-approved for a mortgage loan from my bank. I told them I'd be planning on putting 20% down on a 600,000 dollar home, so I'd be aiming to get pre-approved for 480,000 dollars.

He put the numbers in some calculator, which generated a chart of different mortgage plans with their interest rates and the approximate monthly payments I'd be making. He showed me, for example, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 4.0% interest and it said that I'd be paying roughly 2,900 per month after fees, taxes, and interests.

But then I realized that 2,900 per month over 360 months (30 years) is 1.05 million dollars!! On a 480,000 principal loan amount.

Based on the interest rate and the way that mortgages are amortized, does this sound right? Is it normal to end up paying back more than 2x the principal? And if so, is it a good financial investment to borrow such a large sum of money in the first place?

Thanks for any help everyone.",finance
personalfinance,I want a ten year mortgage as opposed to a twenty or thirty year one.

I've started saving now, and I'm looking at houses in the range of 100,000 (with upgrades needed) to 165,000. I used a mortgage calculator and saw that with a ten year loan, for a 165,000 dollar home at a 3% interest rate, I would pay about 1600-1700 per month. This will be about half of my monthly pay, along with my s/o, who will likely make around twice as much as me. 

To me, I want financial freedom. I've gone to community college to acquire my degree and license in my career and will come out debt free from it. We aren't certain, but my s/o who needs a 4 year degree will likely come out with 10-15,000 dollars worth of debt. 

I see my mother saddled with a 30 year mortgage for a home she couldn't afford when she bought it, and it makes me worried for the future.

I looked at several options in case I move back to Canada after NAFTA getting repealed etc. If I'm understanding [this article](http://www.canadianexpatnetwork.com/public/1237.cfm) correctly, I need to move the money from 401k to IRA, and then to RRSP.

personalfinance,I need help planning my education costs after transferring from CC,"I'm 19 years old in California, currently enrolled in a local community college. I plan to transfer in Fall 2018.

I have been taking the max amount of federal student loans out to pay for my CC, as my parents did set up a college fund for me. Fortunately I am able to still live at home for free.

I'm also very lucky that a close friend's family is willing to pay for the rest of my CC tuition. 

However, I need help figuring out how much I'm going to need to make before transferring. My plan is to get to SDSU or Cal Poly SLO, SDSU preferred as it is cheaper. 

I will be able to put all of my money towards saving for school, as my parents pay for food, housing, and luckily my gas since I'm not the only driver of the car. 

I work at a summer day camp as a manager every summer, my pay will be ~$13/hr @ 36-37 hours a week for 8 weeks. Pay goes up every summer as well. My last year I made about $3200, but I foolishly spent a lot of that. I plan on getting a part time job (safeway or some other grocery store near me) during next school year. 

SDSU cost of living + tuition is about $21k, with tuition being around $7k-$8k, and rent probably around $700/mo. + my car's gas will be about $100/mo for that. 

How realistic is it that I will be able to pay for tuition + a down payment for renting an apartment + the first months rent? I plan on continuing taking out the maximum amount of federal loans to help pay for living as well, as I am unsure how much a part time job makes in SD. I did not qualify for financial aid at my CC as my parent's expected contribution was too high. 

They're unable to help pay because we recently moved from a really crappy apartment to a brand new town home one city over, so they're stuck paying mortgage for a while now and for new furniture since our old stuff got mold all over it from the apartment and we didn't want to bring that to the new place. But it's closer to my CC so it's nice.

I will be making an excel sheet to plan everything out and update this post with it. I'd also appreciate scholarship resources and advice as I am totally lost on that as well.

personalfinance,"1 year ago my credit score was 515, today it is 740. Had 6K in medical debt and about 40K in student loans.","Hey Reddit--

Just wanted to share how I repaired my credit!
I am in my mid 20s with a background in accounting, and am in my last 6 hours of required coursework for graduation. In June will finally have my BBA. 

I am from a lower socioeconomic family and will be the first in my family to hold a degree of higher education. 
This is relevant to because my lack of financial education negatively contributed to my adult decision making. 
One of which included me totaling my first car (my first financed car with 16.8% interest, when I had no idea how fucking shady used car salesman could be) after defaulting on my full coverage auto insurance. I was 18 &amp; clearly not being responsible with my money. The bank sold my car at auction, and made me responsible for the remaining balance of $6700.  Which I completely ignored and did not pay. And I lived without a car for a couple years and went off to college. 

The one good thing I can say about financing my education is the fact that I took my basics at community college. When I transferred to a 4 year university from community college, I had &gt;7K in unsubsidized loans. It would take me a couple years to work and save up for a car which I then purchases outright. 

Flash forward another 3-4 years. 

As of a year ago, my student debt included both subsidized and Unsubsidized loans totaling 42K with interest rates ranging from 3.25-6.5%. 
At the time, I held a job at $18 an hour (~30-36 hours a week) and had purchased my car outright so my only expenses included rent, utilities, insurance and basic living totaling ~$800 a month. After taxes I was safely taking home $1750.

I also had 6K of medical debt from unexpected hospital visits my first year of college when I had no health insurance.

Last March I was in a car accident that totaled my car. While the market value of my car was about $4500, it was reliable and fuel efficient and I was proud to not have a car payment. My mistake was going from full coverage to liability in January the same year. It sucked so hard. 

At the time of my accident, I had (for the very first time in my life) a 6 month savings/safety net and was practicing more responsible spending habits. (I fell victim to the creep a couple years earlier, because spending money felt good and I had never felt that coming from a poor family.)
Although my savings were replenished, and my debt was manageable, my credit was still shit. Legit 515, 519, 521. 

I was forced into a situation where buying a more reliable car was a must. I was living in a small southern town with little/poor public transit. And was also attending school full time and working. 

I had also never owned a credit card at that point. 
I accrued the cost of a rental while in search of a good deal for a car (which totally fucking sucked.) 
I purchase membership with all three credit bureaus and got to work. 

The 6K medical debt included 4 accounts all sent to collections. 

I researched collections agencies and inquired about two of them to ask general questions about their collecting processes and they tried to trick me into giving them my personal information, which I knew better than to share with them. As a result, they were not very helpful. 
So the first thing I did was file disputes against all accounts to question their validity. 
*from a business perspective, I am aware that acquisitions and medical mergers create admin nightmares that subsequently benefit people like me because documentation can be lost in the shuffle.*

It happened to be that December 2015 was the 7th year of the $6700 defaulted car loan mark on my credit. It stayed on my credit simply because I wasn't paying attention. 
I disputed that first, it was promptly removed and that alone raised my credit score to 630. 

I may have been incredibly lucky, but 3 of the 4 medical accounts totaling about $5.8K could not verify my debt (they were no longer owned by the same company or had been written off/sold off) and were removed from my credit report. 
I paid the remaining account in full and just settled to have that on my credit report.
At that time my credit score increased to 680. 

I knew that I had no real credit history other than my student debt-- which I have never defaulted on-- and made the scary decision to apply for a credit card. I was certain I would have to settle with a prepaid credit card.  
I applied for a credit card with CapitalOne and was approved for a cash back card with $500 limit and 9 month 0%. I cried.
Maxed out the card and paid it in full every month. 
By April 2016 my credit was hovering between 650-680. 

I then applied for a car loan with my credit union and was pre-approved for a 16K loan at 6.9%. I also learned from a family friend that my pre-approval could be used to leverage better financing. 
I took that to Honda and purchased my first brand new car totaling around $22,500 when all said and done. I believe my credit was inferior and insisted on putting down $4500 (almost all my savings) to ensure my approval. I locked in a 3.25% rate with Honda. 

By August 2016 CapitalOne increased my credit limit to $2000 without me having to request it. 
I have never missed any payments and went on to take a better/higher paying job.

In January of 2017 my credit score peaked at 740 and have hovered there since. 
Last month I was approved for my first American Express cash back rewards card at 0% for 18 months. 
While the limit is only $1000, I am committed to building a positive relationship with AMEX and will treat this card the same as I have by first credit card.  

I have lurked here for a couple years and was finally brave enough to share my story. It was rough at times but ultimately I am so happy I finally faced the music and took action to repair my credit!

personalfinance,Next Steps,"Recent lurker, first time poster here, hey everyone! 

So I got my annual credit report but I'm unsure what to do next. Also, I'm fundamentally lacking my understanding of credit reports. Any and all help would be appreciated. I started with my credit report because for years I'm denied credit cards across the board. The only one I can get is a secured card from Discover. Recently they made it unsecured but they won't raise my credit limit. I've always paid off my card in full. Usually once or twice a month because I'm using it to pay my bills. I came here to get myself back on track because in the upcoming year or two, I plan on buying a house and don't want a bad credit report to hinder me or be a reason for high interest rates. Currently, per Discover my credit score hovers between 620 - 624. I pay all my bills in full and ahead of time.

Per my Trans Union report, under the Adverse Accounts tab, I have --

1) Bank of America... However it shows pay status is ""current; paid or paying as agreed."" But my balance is $0.

2) Utility company... Status ""paid in full; was a charge off.""

3) Student loans... Status ""current.""

4) Ability Recovery... Status ""in collection."" This one is legitimate and I will call them to get it paid and fulfilled.

5) Progressive... Status ""in collection."" Got screwed over by Progressive here. But I have to call and get this one paid too.

So my questions are --
A) should my items #1 and #2 even be on there? I know I paid them both in full last year. There are contact numbers on the report. When I call them to get it off my report, who do I speak with? Is there a specific department that deals with these things? 

B) my student loans are current, shouldn't they be in the satisfactory tab?

I have a few other items in my satisfactory tab but do these positively or negatively affect my score? For instance, I have a car loan that I'm on track to paying ahead of time in September this year, instead of 2020.

- 30 years old. Single with no dependents. British citizen

- Savings: 25k USD in a tax-free UK savings account. 70k USD in a Singapore savings account

- Debts: 25k USD student loans in the UK (interest rate approximately inflation and I repay annually 9% of my salary above some threshold)

I am reading the usual recommended US centric personal finance books. But I wander what additional things I need to consider given that I may not be in the US indefinitely (even if I wanted to stay, I could lose my visa).

- Do I need to guess what country might I settle in? (US is the best place for me to earn money right now, but ultimately I may return to Europe via some other country. I don‚Äôt have particularly strong ties to Singapore). I guess it makes sense to have most of your investments tied to the country you see your long term future? Should I move money from Singapore to my UK tax-free accounts etc?

I‚Äôm mainly looking for some advice on what things I need to think about, and what I need to read up on in order to get started. I don‚Äôt want to learn the tax systems of three countries needlessly!

personalfinance,"Credit Cards, Intrest Rates, and APR?","I would like some help clarifying something for me that I have never understood very well. I have always paid in cash for most things, or a debit card when online. However, I have a credit card that I keep through my bank for emergencies, such as the other day when my Debit card broke in half and was unable to be used in the ATM. I only keep a 500 dollar limit on this card as its only for temporary use and it keeps the danger of damage due to a theft low. 

So I have a 500 dollar credit limit, and the over the past week I have spent 200 dollars. I have my debit card back so I will no longer be making and purchases with my credit card. My APR is 12% (its actually 14.99 but Im going to say 12 for easy numbers). 

If I had a zero balance (that means I owed nothing right?) on the 27th of March and spent 200 dollars before the 31st am I required to pay the balance before the 31st?

If I pay my balance before it is due do I pay ANY interest? Or is there an ""you pay an extra .05 cents on the dollar for borrowing money""? 

If I do not pay my entire balance (lets say I pay 100$ of the 200 at the end of the month) how much interest do I actually pay? Annual means yearly right? So an APR of 12% means 1% interest per month? 

Now then, I also would like to know about loans such as a mortgage, I don't have one, I would just like to know more about this. Again, lets say I have a home mortgage of 100,000 with an interest rate of 10%. That means at the end of the loan period my payment back is 110,000 correct? However it looks like loans ALSO have APR on top of interest rates. If its a 10 year loan and my APR is 5% that means 5% for each year on the total remaining unpaid or 5% on the total loan? I.E. Do I end up paying back 150,000 or less than that because I've been making payments and APR is from remaining balance? This would be an incentive to pay back the loan in less than 10 years correct?

personalfinance,26 years old. Need help deciding if withdrawing my 401k to help cover medical expenses is worth it.,"I need some medical work done that will cost to the tune of $38,000 and insurance won't cover hardly any of it. Its not life threatening or anything but it does need to be done sooner than later. 

I have about $20,000 in savings specifically earmarked for this work and $8200 in a 401k. If I withdraw, I get $6500 after fees. That would mean I would still need a $11,500 loan from SoFi to cover the remainder. 

SoFi quoted me a $20,000 loan at a whopping 14% interest rate for 7 years. I didn't accept the loan because that rate was a little higher than what I was expecting. A $11,500 loan is much more doable and much less scary haha. I also have about $21k in student loans I'm still paying off too so I'd really like to minimize any additional debt I take on. 

I really hate the idea of using my small 401k for anything other than retirement but given the interest rates I'm looking at for loans, it seems like I'm ""saving"" money in the short term. Its only been 2 years since I started contributing to my retirement and saving so it really hasn't taken me that long to build my savings.

personalfinance,24 year old: Can I get advice on our personal finance plan? All advice appreciated.,"**Context:**

Realized we could be planning for our future better, so recently told my GF I'd take charge of our finances. I created a monthly budget that tracks all our expenses. Now, I'm trying to plan for *big life events and retirement*, so I have questions related to best areas to park money. I have poured through the FAQ but would like more detailed advice. 

Here is the budget template I created that I've been giving to friends as well. Would love advice on making it better or if anyone wants to use it: [Monthly Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BA3CdGKSZZS5Xny-WnwodNTJGs4swdxD5gUYnJ4R0R4/edit?usp=sharing)


     1. Income

* Me (24): 67k/ yr
* GF (24): 50k/ yr
* Total: 117k/ yr

     2. Debt

* 13k student loans w/ 3.16% interest rate

     3. Savings/ Investments:

* 11k 6-Mth. Screw You Fund (Emergency Fund) in case one of us loses our job/ medical emergencies 
* 5k corporate bonds w/ 8% annual return
* 1k corporate bonds w/ 10% annual return
* 1k in stocks
* 1.5k in private stock from gf's past start-up employers (may IPO in near future or never IPO)  

**Our Goals:**

* **2017**: Pay off 13k student loans
* **2018**: Buy 5k wedding ring/ engagement rings
* **2019**: Marry with budget of 9k (Have talked and agreed upon a 7k budget with 2k buffer, thinking it may even be less than 7k due to very small-scale wedding)
* **2022**: Buy house ~ 300k
* **Other**: Create passion project budget, potential restaurant in 10 years, and smaller projects in the mean-time.
 
**Questions:**
Here are my questions, but if you have advice on anything else, I'd highly appreciate it! Thanks in advance personal finance community!

1. **Retirement**: My gf's employer provides no matching for 401k, so according to the FAQ, it'd be better for us to open her a Roth IRA with the thought that our tax bracket should be higher in the future, right?
2. **HSA**: I haven't seen anyone talk about HSA's. Since they have a tax advantage and my employer matches up to $500 with no roll-over limit, I should just contribute $500 to get free money right? I may not need it now, but if I just put it in and let it vest wouldn't that be smart for my older self?
3. **Savings Accounts**: Does anyone have suggestions on best interest rate savings accounts? I read Ally online banking, because I would like to set-up different accounts for different savings (an account for emergency fund, an account for wedding ring, an account for wedding, etc.) 
4. **Savings/ ST Investing**: I've also read to put only first two months of an emergency fund into a savings account, with the rest (3-6 mths.) in money markets. Where do I even begin with money markets or other investment vehicles?
5. **Investing**: Last, I have not set up a Vanguard account yet for index fund investing. Is there a guide here that I haven't found?
6. **Investing**: Also, I would like to put a little more in our stock portfolio to continue value investing, does anyone have the best low-cost platform (I've read many mixed opinions on this)? Currently, our stock is set up with Capital One because my gf's brother in law works there as a business banker.",finance

personalfinance,"Hot housing market, how should we take advantage?","TL;DR we may be selling our house and not sure if we should leave as is or renovate first. 

SO and I bought a small bungalow in Toronto for 460k 3 years ago. We are hopefully going to be moving out of the city to a less expensive market some time in the near future.  We have a few options. 1. We can sell our house as is for approx 650 to 700k  the market here for single family detached homes under a million is insane. It would sell in a few days after listing. 
2. We can keep the house after we move and rent it out. We wouldn't make a ton, but the house may gain value. 
3. We could renovate the house ~250-300k would give us a second floor and a better main floor layout. This would put us closer to a house value of 950 to 1 million. 
4. We could put in 50k for a smaller ""lipstick and mascara"" reno, that may get us a return of 80k.

House was built in the 1960s, has solid newly water proofed foundation. The footprint is maybe 30ft by 30ft so no matter what a pretty small house.

personalfinance,Financial advisors giving me opposite advice. Please lend your opinion,"Hi PF Team,

First of I would love to thank you all for the advice you have given to other redditors. ITS HELPED ME SO MUCH, and I am so glad there is a community that dives deep into these issues, because some of us (like myself) have been given 0 guidance from our parents (well, maybe what NOT to do lol). 

So, here is my situation. Please feel free to be brutally honest and tell me if Im wrong. This is my money and I want do to what's best for myself. 

I am 23 years old. I graduated college with $42k debt (In May 2016). Before reddit I focused on paying off all my debt, instead of investing not realizing how awesomely low of an interest rate I had on my loans. I've now moved to focus on investing. (I am down to about $36k currently)

I've met with 2 financial advisors &amp; gave them the same information (+ or  - a few details of course) that I am now going to share with you: 
 -  I currently live with my parents. I need to move out in 5 years. Preferably a townhouse or condo so I get some sort of investment, but without the upkeep of a house (Im a 23 year old female... lawn mowing is NOT my forte :) ) so I need a down payment. 

  - I make $48k a year - of that I can put away $200 a month currently, and will move to $500 a month with my raise at the end of May (and some other loans ending that will free up some money) 

 - Also at my job I can plan on a $15k - $30k Christmas bonus per year

 - I currently invest in a Roth-IRA at Edward Jones where it buys A shares of 1 low risk, 1 middle risk, and 1 high risk mutual fund (That is where my $200 - $500 is going monthly currently) 

Here are the opinions I was given from the two financial planners.

**Planner A** - Send monthly $200-$500 a month to 1 middle risk mutual fund, where you're buying B shares, along with sending most of your bonus to that same mutual fund to save up for a down payment. Some of that bonus will also be sent to max out my Roth-IRA.

**Planner B** - The market is too volatile for such a short term investment. We will send your monthly $200-$500 payment to a savings account, and other than maxing out your Roth-IRA with your bonus we will send the rest into that same savings account. 

Obviously these are two VERY different opinions...to invest or to not invest... Im mostly afraid of bias as these people work for investment companies. 

Other things that might be important: 
* My company does not match 401k contributions. They automatically put in 3% of my salary + some profit sharing annually

* I live at home for free and am extremely happy to stay here for 5 years 

* I will not live with other people... I went to boarding school since I was in 8th grade, and I am SO OVER roommates. So I will be taking on the financial burden on my own. My SO is also not expected to pay for anything when I move out as I want it to be all mine :) 

* Im happy to leave my current financial planner and have no one and do this on my own... but I will need lots of advice. So not sure thats the BEST scenario. 

I am obviously an open book and will share any information you need to form an opinion. I really respect and trust people's opinions here, so please be brutal if you need to be. 

Cheers,

personalfinance,Paying too much tax? TurboTax says I owe $2800 on $7500 earnings?,"Hey Everyone.

I'm admittedly not as knowledgeable about taxes, but helping someone use TurboTax. This person has earned $25k on W2 (see it [here](http://imgur.com/a/ymMtU)), and another $7500 on 1099-MISC. When entering this information I noticed two scenarios:

1) Just W2 entered (no 1099-MISC get a massive of Federal Tax Refund $1462 and
California Tax Refund $426.

2) W2 + 1099-MISC entered, I get Federal **Due** $640 and
California Tax Refund $172.

That suggest in 2) above that he is paying over $2000 on $7500 earnings on Federal Taxes alone, let alone the $250 on CA.

Is that right? That is around 30% taxes.

personalfinance,"Low cost tax prep software battle: Credit Karma, OLT.com, FreeTaxUSA","Gone a quarter century without ever paying for tax preparation, but it's getting tougher. This year we're self-employed, I have an IRA contribution, Marketplace health insurance...so TaxAct (~$80) is out. Based on online reviews and Reddit posts, this is what I've narrowed it down to, in order of least likely to most likely to use:

**Credit Karma**. Pros: free federal and state for everyone, now and forever. Cons: so new and I'm reading many reported bugs and spotty response to them, some which seem scary (like not getting the return actually accepted). Also, need to sign up for their credit monitoring service, which is an unknown for me.

**Online Taxes / OLT.com**. Pros: free federal and state for our income. Cons: Reviews suggest its topic help is limited. One review said ""stay away!"", although that seemed to mostly be due to his not finding the one form he particularly needed. Really don't know enough about it yet.

**FreeTaxUSA**. Pros: Free federal, about $10 with coupon for state (I can do state for free through my state's site, but I'd love to just do it once and auto-populate), seems to have solid reviews and at least 5-7 years track record. Can auto-fill 1040 based on pdf from last year. Cons: $10 (even I'm not that cheap, though if olt.com is fine, hey, why break my streak?).

I'm going to also have to do this somewhat complex thing called an ""iterative calculation"" for my Self Employed Health Insurance deduction, and wondering if any/all of these will do that right or let me put in my own computed number instead of their auto-computing it (since even H&amp;R Block's and TurboTax's software gets this one wrong).

I'm leaning toward FreeTaxUSA and want to get started on my taxes asap to allow any room for mistakes well before 4/18. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,A 401(k) calculator is suggesting I can max out my contribution while spending very little. I'm not convinced this is accurate.,"Hi,

Got a new job where I'll be making 125k. I've never made enough before to contribute to a 401(k) so I basically have zero retirement savings. I went online and found [this 401(k) calculator](http://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/401k/) which I wanted to use to try to determine the optimum contribution to my 401(k). It tells you things like how much you contribute and the tax benefit for doing so.  So I entered that my witholding state was Illinois, my pay is 125k annually which is paid monthly, 1 federal allowance, and ignored state withholding for now. My employer doesn't provide a match, either. So I went through and just changed my employee withholding percentage from 0, 1, 2 all the way to 15% and recorded the results in a spreadsheet.

I was really surprised by what I found. 

First, as you might except as I contribute more to my 401(k) each month my net pay decreases and my annual contribution increases pretty linearly. [This plot is here.](http://imgur.com/a/k38vq)

But what really interested me was the tax savings I'd be getting. I made a plot of my annual out-of-pocket contribution vs. total 401(k) contribution and what I found was completely counter-intuitive and very surprising. [The plot increases linearly up to 14% then suddenly drops at 15%.](http://imgur.com/a/OYHO3).  Is this effect real?!

If this is right it suggests that I can contribute $18,000 to my 401(k) but only spend ~$1,000 to do it. It seems too good to be true, especially since the plot of net pay vs. contribution behaves exactly as I'd expect. So the only thing I can think of is that by contributing so much my tax bracket drops and I end up owing about $17,000 less than if I only contributed 14%. And if that's true, why does my net pay continue to decrease? Do I pay more in federal taxes throughout the year and get it back at the end in the form of a refund? 

I hope this is true but I'm skeptical it's just too unrealistic.",finance
personalfinance,Looking to set myself up for future/retirement. (24 yo; $120k salary; $125k in bank),"I am looking for some advice about how to navigate my financial future properly so that I will be setup for life.  I know that I am at a good salary right now, but I want to make sure that I don't leave any money behind anywhere.

**My Overview**

* $120k salary
* $125k in bank
* Zero loans
* Finishing my PhD right now (workplace is paying for it)
* I freelance building apps/websites which I do about $2k a year for that.  Can do more or less if I need to.
* Live at home with parents to keep expenses low.  I estimate about $400-500 a month max in expenses.  I can lower it if I really needed to.
* My car is 2 years old
* Own two townhouses that are rented out.  The rent money is put directly towards paying cash back to parents that lent me some as well as towards a small loan that was taken out for one of them.  The houses are in separate LLCs.
* I have 2 credit cards and one debit/check card.  One credit card is with Discover with a $2k limit, second is with my local credit union for a $500 limit.  I primarily use the check card for my purchases, and for stuff that my parents choose to still voluntarily help me with I use the Discover.  (They state that they want to pay for my gas and basic things until I move out so that I can build my future.)  I don't touch the $500 limit card at all.
* Discover statements show my credit score is 811.

**Future Goals**

* I am not planning on buying a house or any big purchases for several years.  I plan on living at home as long as I can.
* I won an entreprenuer competition last year, started a C-Corp, and attempting to pursue that.  I have already put about $2k to $3k to that and if things start to work out, I would want to put more into it.
* I just want to setup my future now so that I can live a life of not having to worry, especially since my parents have helped me to avoid loans and obtain investment properties...I want to take full advantage of all of this.
* I don't go on any vacations, but use my one to two times a year that I travel for work as my vacations by staying in the location for extra time, so no big trips planned either.


**Recent Advice/Questions**

I recently met with a financial advisor to try and get information about everything and while I think that he gave me good advice, I am still questioning what is the best for me.  These are the points he made to me:

* At my current expenses, I should always have $20k to be able to last 2-3 years without any problems.
* I should get disability and umbrella insurances just in case anything would happen.
* I currently am putting $6k a year towards 401k and he told me to max out the full $18k a year.  Employer only matches 1.5% of my salary no matter what.
* I should open an investment or taxable account with him (not sure what the difference is, if any).
* I should make sure that I have a will, medical directive, power of attorney, and all of my bank and money-centered accounts have a pay on death on them.

This financial advisor is with a big company (can give name if needed but leaving out for now) and charges 2% of assets.  He stated that since he is with a big company they don't buy the normal index funds/stocks, but instead they are able to negotiate and buy as a large broker and get very low rates (not sure if this is all the right wording).

Also, he is not on NAPFA so I now question if he makes any commission anywhere that I haven't asked or know about.

**My Thoughts**

I have done a lot of reading of this subreddit in the past week and these are some of the things I am leaning towards, but still seriously need advice on to make sure I am doing the right thing.

* My bank currently is a credit union that has 0.2% interest in my savings account.  I want to open an account with Ally bank to take advantage of the 1% interest for the savings account as I am leaving money on the table.
* I want to close my $500 credit card and instead open a credit card with Ally bank and use that as my primary over my check card.  Using the check card gives me no benefit while I could be earning that small amount of credit card rewards.
* I want to start an investment account and put in some amount of money.  I have been considering anywhere from $5k to $20k or even $50k.  I am just not sure with where or how much money to put in.  From my reading, this financial advisor's 2% rate is very expensive.  I like the idea of having somebody to help take care of this for me as I do not have too much knowledge on where to invest in, but at 2% I think that is too steep.  I have been looking at companies near me using NAPFA and I am thinking of just contacting each of them, finding out their price, and asking why I should go to them.
* For an investment account, I have also read a lot about Vanguard in this subreddit.  I am intrigued about this, but am not sure about how their fees exactly work and if it is the best option for me or not.

**Questions**

This is what I am looking to get answered, if possible:

1. Should I switch to Ally bank for that increased interest rate?
2. Is taking the small (and temporary) hit to my credit score by closing a credit card and opening a new one a good idea?
3. Is maxing my 401k at $18k a year a good idea?
4. Should I look into opening a CD with a bank?
5. Should I open an investment account?  If so, how much should I put in?
6. Where should I open the investment account?  This financial advisor, a company from NAPFA, or something like Vanguard?
7. What is a reasonable rate for a financial service company to charge (since 2% is high)?
8. For somebody that doesn't have much investing knowledge, is Vanguard even a good idea?
9. If I was to go the Vanguard route, I don't have much knowledge into all of this so how could I make sure that everything is done right?  Is the personal advisor service they have a good idea at 0.3% rate?
10. I am struggling to understand where Vanguard charges fees.  Do you get charged for when you purchase index funds?  I see a lot of people talking about them being very low cost, but I don't understand where they are charging for their service?

personalfinance,Turned down for pre-approval on a home loan (is my credit union picky?),"Several weeks ago, my wife and I met with a real estate loan officer at our local credit union.  During our first meeting, we discussed our income, credit, and asset history.  I personally have a pretty nice credit score (&gt;800), but at the moment only have one line of credit.

My wife never started building credit until recently, which concerned the officer, until we discussed that my wife has inherited enough money to very comfortably pay the cash value of the modest home prices we're interested in.

After the initial meeting, our loan officer told us we could expect a very nice interest rate ~3.5% and had us fill out a mountain of paperwork.  This weekend, we brought all of our relevant paperwork back, only to be told immediately after the credit check that we lacked enough lines of credit and the only way to be approved would be for me to open a second line of credit and try again in 12 months.

If this is all true, I can accept that I'm new to this world and take the appropriate steps to move forward.  What bothers me is that we were initially told we'd be fine, only to have our dreams sort of crushed.

crypto,Regulations of Tempest protections of buildings,"A. Stanoyevitch in his book Discrete Structures with Contemporary Applications, CRC Press, 2011,  p.301 writes:
""Buildings can be fitted using a special insulation procedure that protects against tempest devices, but any company or individual in the US who has this insulation must first obtain a license from the federal Government.""
Could this be true?

[Added on edit:] In another forum in one answer there is: ""The only applicable law for the US would seem to be FCC regulations against interfering with ""any radio communications of any station licensed or authorized"". Marriott Hotels was fined substantially for blocking people's hotspots within the hotel. ......The main enforcement interest of FCC is with devices that actively jam signals (by transmitting interference). But the law, 47 USC 333, states that ""No person shall willfully or maliciously interfere with or cause interference to any radio communications of any station licensed or authorized by or under this chapter or operated by the United States Government"".""

In my personal view, the motivation of that law would include preventing cases in which persons enter rooms acting as Faraday cages where they couldn't get eventual catastrophe warnings etc. from the official radio stations via adequate receivers, e.g. smart phones, if they care to carry such with them (e.g. customers of a company are in its insulated conference room). This appears IMHO to well support the correctness of what Stanoyevitch writes at least in one interpretation. Another possible interpretation of what he writes could be that requiring licences for TEMPEST-shielded rooms stems also from a motivation to widen the range of effectivity of the TEMPEST devices. This ""conspiracy theory"" could by its nature not be checked but appears to be to some extent supported by the fact that comapanies manufacturing TEMPEST-secure communication devices sale their products only to the government or its contractors.",cryptocurrency

My questions are:
1) Is anyone familiar with paying off student loans while still in school, am I going about this in the correct way?

So I am 21 years old going into my last year of college (5 years double major) and I really goofed up bad

I no longer have the 'job' that I had before, my girl convinced me to quit (i.e. said she'd leave me if I didn't quit)

- Have a 24-month lease on my house ($895 a month + $1295 annual HOA fee) - my deadbeat roommate pays all the utilities and landscaping stuff but doesn't pay rent.

I paid 18-months of it upfront so I wont owe more rent until February of 2018

- Drive a $15,000 car, paid off, got like 80k miles on it though but I got the extended warranty so I got another like 3000 miles on the warranty before I start feeling the burn from that 

- Own about 9 firearms worth about $7-8k that I am willing to sell off most of

- Got a boat worth $3.5k (its listed for sale and hopefully selling it off soon)

#Where did the money go you ask! 

- Paid for my mother to go to rehab back in February $18k, probably an investment tbh

- Paid for my brother to get some lawyers for a BS charge $6k (he is paying me back $500 a month)

- Went on vacation to hella places ($10k)

Paid off all of my student loans from my first 3 years so that was about $32k (Bumped my Credit Score up to 723)

I have no money, got a lot of debt but not like a crushing amount and I am making like $400-500 net a week now being the asst. manager at a bar....

personalfinance,Vanguard Prime Money Market vs Federal Money Market (settlement fund) for Roth IRA...slightly confused.,"Hi there,

&amp;nbsp;

Is the Federal Money Market (settlement fund) something new? I don't recall using that as the settlement fund previously when contributing to my IRA. Previously I believe it was called Prime Money Market. Any idea why this has changed?

Am I correct in thinking that I should now be contributing to the Federal Money Market (settlement fund) when contributing new money to my IRA?

I really want to avoid the consolidation and get dinged with the collection fees. The interest rate are at 2.65% and 3.45% but they are going to reset in a few months a little higher.

personalfinance,Paying off Defaulted Private loans through grad school,"So last year I defaulted on two of my private student loans. I will avoid the drawn out sob story, and would like some advice on how to go forward. I am going to round a little to keep this simple.

I have $25,000 in federal loans that are not in default. I was able to get on an income based repayment last year and am currently paying while I wait to get back on it again. I pay a little over $250 a month now until I can get back onto a IBR plan again.

I have $12,900 on a Sallie mae loan that I pay $188 a month on. The interest is 9.6%. This is also not in default.

I have 2 loans with Discover that are in default. One is originally with Citi that Discover bought before the default. It is $14,000. The second is $7000. Both of these loans are with Discover still because I was able to start making payments with them before they sold them to a collections office. I have been making payments for 6 months on time now, with the totals for each being $145 and $131. 

I now have an opportunity to go to Grad school for almost free in Spring 2018. A large part of the problems that led me to default were to help out family, and my dad was recently granted 100% disability, which brings with it Hazelwood (Pays for tution and fees) and Title 35 (Dependents education assistance) that will pay me a monthly stipend of $1024 for every month I am in school full time. I am not taking this lightly and am trying to decide how to approach these defaulted loans while back in school. There will be other costs with grad school of course and I will be able to transfer my job to the town I will be going to school at, and will make about a $1000 a month there working part time. 

So my questions are: 
Is it legal and if yes, should I utilize my schools guaranteed 20k in grad loans available to me, to pay off defaulted private loans, and gain benefits of Federal loans?
If yes to the above question, should I use the rest to pay off my Sallie mae loan to reduce my interest by half?

* Car Loan:
 * Currently owe $9300
 * Payment is $450/month
 * Interest rate 2.99%
 * ~20 months left to pay off
* Student Loan
  * Currently owe $8400
  * Normal payment is $250/month
  * Interest rate is 8.5%!
  * Been paying on this fucking thing for 10 years from ~25K
* $17K in savings
* $15K in Roth IRA (could withdraw my contributions to pay these loans)

I am well aware that most people will say to pay off the high interest rate student loan first and do it ASAP! The the thing is, If I pay off the car loan, that frees up an extra $450/month that I can throw at the student loan.

At this point, I can pay at least $1000/month on the student loan, and can continue to pay the $450/month car loan payment. However, I want *both* of these monkeys off my back, but I can only pay one off right now in full. If I pay off the car, I can throw $1450/month (or potentially more, like $1700) at the student loan and be done with it sooner which means I can build my savings back up quicker.

I also have the option of paying off the student loan by putting it on a 0% APR credit card for 15 months, which I would be able to pay off much faster than that.

- Low fees for transferring money in and out of the account;
- The bank should be stable without a risk of going bankrupt (naturally);
- Good online banking;
- Ability to create 2 cards in both of our names tied to a single account (that's how we're used to dealing with shared money);
- Good deposit interest rates are a plus (should we bother with depositing the 50k, at all? or is it better to invest?)

I've made the biggest mistake i could ever done in 2015. I brought a car with a loan. Now obviously it isn't always bad but it put me into a debt of ‚Ç¨14,000 with 8% interest rate.

I also had a credit card which i maxed out after a holiday and that was a total of ‚Ç¨3,200. Now recently i have combined the two debts into a single loan of 14,000 against a APR of 7.9%.

So currently i pay less interest monthly and it will be easier to pay off but i do pay more eventually. Now my goal is to pay this off within 2 years. I have a steady goverment job and most likely soon i will be changing to another job with maybe more pay.

My main question is: Do i focus on paying off my loan first and afterwards ill look to invest or do i split the money i have left over every month to invest and pay off my debt?

And of course how exactly do i start investing? I know there are a few companies that give advice and invest for you but are those really good or is it better to get a better understanding of investing first and invest yourself?

personalfinance,Newly single parent - Help me get my finances in order please!,"Current situation: 
I'm about to move out of my family home to rent another, smaller, more affordable property. We currently live in an expensive suburb and my son attends and is settled in a public school there. I am moving a couple of suburbs away where houses are less expensive. The cheapest I can find is $400pw. Moving schools for him is not an option plus we have agreed to stay close to my kids dad (husband / ex-husband) so he can see them when he can. 

I am currently a SAHM to my 2 year old daughter and my husband was the sole income earner. I am eligible for benefits of around $1000pf plus child support of $1100pm. I will have the kids 80% of the time as the nature of his job won't allow flexibility with school hours etc. 

In October last year I resigned from my job after 2 years on maternity leave (and 9 years employed here) as we decided that I would be a SAHM indefinitely. Further to that, I was actually offered a part time job earlier this year but I had to turn it down as I can't get day care in our area or any area close by as there is a wait list 20+ people long in almost every centre. We had a bad experience with my son at family day care so that is not an option either unfortunately. I am more than happy to return to work but at this stage I would need to take my daughter with me or somehow work from home. 

We currently have $25k in joint debt to pay down (for our family car which I am taking). Interest rate is 9%. Minimum payment is $850pm. I have previously owned a home so I am ineligible for a lot of benefits from the government because of this (bond loans, FHOG etc). 

We have a joint phone and internet bill that we cant cancel as it will cost too much. This is $300 a month. I have said I will pay $200 a month for my phone and to take the internet with me. I'm sure there will be a fee for this but I have no idea what it will be. 

Husband currently pays for swimming lessons for my daughter (2y/o) at $85pm, he pays the toll bill for my car which is around $50pm as well as groceries ($150pw) and fuel ($200pm). My car registration is due next month and it is $500 for 6 months. As I'll be moving into a new place, I'll have to pay a bond of up to $2500 upfront, as well as around $500 for moving costs and I don't know what electricity or gas will cost at this stage. Maybe $400 per quarter? I have no family to help me and my husband is saving all his income to replace all the furniture I'm taking with me so that's also not an option. 

I have no access to my husbands income and I will be relying solely on government and his child support payments on an ongoing basis. 

I don't even know where to start with budgeting, what I'm supposed to do or how I'm supposed to survive and keep two children alive by myself! 

My goal has always been to own a home my kids can grow up in, feel safe at and know there is always a place for them to call home. I know as a single parent this is likely to be unachievable but it is still at the top of my list for financial goals. Of course I want to provide for them as well as possible but we aren't a materialistic family so having the latest and greatest of things isn't a priority. Just good health, clothes and a roof over their head is important to me for now. 

So I need all the help I can get. I used to be so financially independent and I'm ashamed that I am now in the position where I don't even know what my finances look like! I need a plan on how to live semi comfortably with (hopefully) a way to save some $ for a house deposit in the future.

personalfinance,Buy a home on a lower income -- bad idea?,"It's me again. I'm still obsessing over my potential future, though I swear I've made no decisions about my marriage yet.  I don't want to rush into divorce, but I want to be prepared/know my options if it comes.  Fear of being on a single income has definitely been used against me and I'm trying to educate myself.

I currently make about $33k/year gross and in December will be getting a raise to bring it to $36k. By December 2018 I should be making $38k and will get incremental raises every year or two for a bit after that if I keep my current position.  I'm actively working on my Bachelor's degree and am hoping that can help me move to something a bit better paying.  I work for the Federal govt and plan to stay here for the job security and benefits.

I live in an area that overall, is crap.  There are two areas near to me I'd be willing to send my kids to school to.  There is a third I would settle on until they hit high school (they are 8 and 10 right now) but I would need to get back into one of the other two by the time HS started.

Here's the problem: rent!  Area #1 where I currently live has fantastic schools but a military base nearby, so landlords know what the military pays and bases rent on that.  IMO, it's inflated, but on two incomes we can make it work.  On a single income...it gets harder but not impossible.  Area #2 is amazing, I love it, but definitely a higher income area and has a large university there, so rents are higher.  Rent or buy, short of getting lucky, I'm priced out. Area #3 is where my parents live.  If I stayed with them the kids would have decent elementary/middle schools.  The high school is ""ok"" but the other two areas are much better. Even if I rented, it should doable.

Ideally, I'd like to buy a home.  Not right away, of course, but maybe a year post divorce (? does that even seem reasonable).  I plan to stay in this area for the long haul (both sets of grandparents live here).  Rents are a bit inflated but buying a home is possible.  I've seen modest homes in Area #1 for $100-125k that would give me and the kids enough.  $140-150k would get a lovely little home, but that doesn't seem plausible on my single income.  The mortgage and taxes would be far less than rent on a similar property, though taxes here are almost double the national average.  I think even considering maintenance costs, I'd come out ahead.

By the end of this year I'll have zero consumer debt and student loans only.  If I get divorced, I'd qualify for the IBR plan and PLSF through my job.  I currently have about $28k in student loans and it could go up to about $32k if I can't get decent aid for my final semester. (FML)  If I calculate a payment using our married income and no PLSF it spits out a payment of $180-300/mth. That drops a bit if I use PLSF.  If I use my single income payments drop considerably, at least in the short term.

Now that I've written a book...I guess my biggest questions would be (assuming divorce) what is the quickest path to a house?  How much cash will I need saved up?  A lot of sites are saying 20% and I'm wondering if it's possible on less?  My credit is good and I'm actively working to clean up a few small things and expect my scores to be better by next year.

Or am I being unrealistic and need to just rent forever?  The idea of paying out so much to a landlord makes me cringe and I really do want something that's ""mine"" even if it's modest. I could finally let my kids have pets (current LL is averse) and feel like I can actually move in and have a home. Maybe that sounds stupid.

IF it came to it I think the most I could stay with my parents is a year to help save up money.  Much beyond that would be too much for everyone, I think. :)  If a year isn't enough to 'get ready' I'd have to use that time to be really aggressive, move out to rent and still keep chipping away.

I really appreciate the help here from PF.  I'm just trying to figure out my options.  Once again, I hope this is all just morbid fantasy and I stay married.  I'm willing to give that all time, though, before I make any decisions.  But who knows, maybe he'll pull the plug first, so I want to be prepared.

**TLDR**  My life is a mess, wondering if buying a home on a $36-38k salary is doable/responsible.  How do I make it happen?

I will also need an extra 22000 and will take that through graduate PLUS loan. I am allowed to take out up to 36000 through the PLUS loan and I currently estimate that I would need 22000 but what are the disadvantages of taking the full 36000 just in case and then when I graduate I just pay whatever I had left over from 36000 ? I will be moving to a new state and city and I have a son so I just wanted to have it as an emergency fund in case I don't find a job for a while when I move while I go to school.,finance
personalfinance,I am a lawyer with about $300k in loans and making about $200k a year. Looking for advice on how to refinance my loans,"Like I said in the title, I have about $300k in loans from law school and undergraduate. I'm working at a big law firm making good money.

I have the opportunity to refinance my loans on a 5, 7, 10 or 15 year plan with interest rates of 2.35%, 2.95%, 3.85% and 4.20%. Any of these plans would cut my current interest rates drastically.

It seems to me that, on the one hand I should just pick the lowest interest rate and just put my head down and knock this out. On the other hand, if I do the 15 year plan, I free up a lot of cash flow that I can invest and probably earn better than 4.2% on in the long run. In any case, my wife and I live pretty simply so the extra cash flow will not get spent on consumption.

Love to hear what y'all think.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for all your comments and advice! Too many people have weighed in for me to respond to everyone.

EDIT 2:  Some info people have asked for in the comments: I have a $30k emergency fund set aside. I'm currently paying my loans on a 25-year plan with interest rates between 8.5 and 2.8% (the 2.8% loans I'll keep in the federal loans and pay off over 25-years unless I refi on a 5-year plan). I currently put $5k toward my loans using the snowball method. We're in NYC which means COL is relatively high but we don't have a problem since we're pretty frugal and don't splurge that often. I contribute about $10k a year to my 401k. My wife has no loans and makes about $60k. We're both in our early 30s and would like to have kids in the next few years. Thanks again everyone! I appreciate your help!!!",finance
personalfinance,[Credit] Asking for a lower interest rate on a card I just applied for.,"Hi,
I recently applied for a Chase Sapphire with a score of 690 Transunion and a 691 Equifax. I got approved for a $5000 limit and 20.74% APR. The reason why my score was so low was because I have another credit card which has a $600 limit and my utilization was high. I had paid this card off for over a month already but the payment did not reflect my credit score. Now a few days after I have been approved (have yet to receive the card yet and, the only reason why I know what my limit/apr is because I bank with Chase and the credit card is showing up on my online banking). My new score is 739 Transunion and 738 Equifax would it be possible to contact chase to review the APR and have them lower it right away? or, should I use the card for a couple months and then have ask them to lower it then?
Thanks,",finance

personalfinance,"~30k in IRS/credit card debt, working part-time/ part-time entrepreneur","I will start by saying that, yes, I made some pretty big financial mistakes in my life. Now it's time to try to fix them. 

I am living in a pretty rural area and have a job that I love and some opportunities/big ideas that I am not willing to give up on at the moment. I am giving myself until 2018 to get moving on things and if I am not on the right financial path by then, I will move back in with my parents and/or suck it up and move somewhere else and get a tech job. 

I have free credit counseling from my bank and have basically been told that there is no reasonable way to reduce my expenses and that I need to make more money (duh!). I am working on this -- via app ideas, business ideas, selling photography, finding a second job with flexible house (not so easy where I live), etc. at the moment. 

**Debt**:

* $50/month to the IRS -- approx $13k for back taxes (eventually I would like to pay and will eventually file an offer in compromise but it's not time for that yet -- I am firm on this)
* ~$130/month to a credit card w/a major bank -- $6000 with 15.49% interest and a $7500 credit limit (they are unwilling to lower the interest rate)
* ~$240/month to a credit union credit card -- $7800 with 7.5% interest

**Income**:

*I am doing what I can to increase this but there's not much to do about it in the next month or so -- I will likely be getting more hours at work in May*

* ~$1100/month after taxes
* Currently looking for ways to supplement my income and will hopefully be getting more hours soon

**Expenses (approx)**:

*I don't think there's much I can cut out here*

* $400 -- rent, electric/gas, internet
* $45 -- auto/renters insurance
* $420 -- debt payments
* $100 -- groceries and meals (I work on a farm so this varies with the seasons and I eat out more when I'm busy but only when I can't make it home to cook b/c I am running errands, having meetings related to business, etc. -- I eat at home on work days) 
* $100 -- other expenses (I ride my bike to work and around town so I pay about $40 every month or two for a tank of gas)

Due to my high debt to income ratio, I am unable to get a credit card with a high enough limit to transfer my higher interest balance. I was thinking of transferring some of my higher interest cc balance to the lower interest but my parents are willing to cosign on a loan or transfer some of my debt to them and I make the payments so I want to see what happens with that. I would prefer to do it on my own though. 

Right now my first priority is to lower my payments -- since all of my payments and rent are due on my first paycheck (and they are unwilling to change the due date), I am having to use my credit card a little bit most months. I can try to be better about paying the minimum balance + what I spend but I am barely scraping by so it's not always possible.

I am willing to consider options that will raise my overall debt a bit if they reduce the payments. I understand that this may not seem like a good idea but, honestly, what's another $1k when I owe almost $30k? As I mentioned above, in 2018 I am either going to be making more money or throwing in the towel and working a job I may not care about and/or live in a place I don't really want to live so that I can get out of debt. I am not willing to do this yet though -- there's too much at stake right now.

Unfortunately getting a higher-paying job would require moving since I live in a rural area with a fairly weak economy and  high-paying jobs are few and far between. Full-time jobs are also somewhat rare and I can't seem to find a second job that will work with my schedule and give me time to work on other opportunities. Entrepreneurship is likely the only option for me to make more money here and I am working hard on making that happen. In the meantime, I need to reduce my payments. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Tax guy made an error last year. Told me this year that we have to refile last year. How to handle with him?,"My CPA tax guy, in the process of doing this year's returns, found that he had inadvertently made an error on last year's returns that did not impact the amount owed/refunded to the Federal, but on the state level, the error meant I should have had a bigger refund (by more than $1k).

So, we will refile last year's returns, (and this years) and get the money and (hopefully) the dust will settle with little fall out.

But, I mean, the guy charges $400 to do what amounts to relatively simple returns (we're W2 employees with standard investments, with no businesses) and this error is bugging me.  He's been our tax guy since 2002, and I like him, but you know, I don't like these kinds of mistakes.

I am trying to see what's a reasonable reaction from me, and I see a range:
1. Mistakes happen, just refile, pay his fee and move forward.
2. Same as #1, but ask for a concession on his fee for the error.
3. Same as #1, but find another tax guy next year.
4. Have another tax guy re-evaluate the tax returns, refuse to pay the fee from our tax guy.

personalfinance,"[Debt] Husband might have the opportunity to refinance, but it would rope me into his student loans. Should we or no?","Long story short, my husband has over 200k in student loans that he obtained for a two degrees at a private, for-profit university. He got them long before we met, and one is a parent-plus loan. I am, right now, in no way financially responsible for these loans (except that we are married and our finances are ""one"", but legally I have no obligation to them). The primary issue is that the interest rates are KILLING us. The lowest interest rate is ~6.5%, the highest being ~8.5%. We have been trying to pay them but barely even pay down the interest each month, let alone make progress on the principal balance. Well, my husband has been doing some research and found out that there is a possibility that he can do a private loan refinance and get the interest down to 6% at the very highest, but likely closer to 4-5% given an estimate of our credit. The only problem is that I would very likely have to co-sign, and even if I don't, would now become equally responsible for the loan because we are now married.

I have no problem helping my husband pay his loans. After all, marriage is about sharing everything. However, I am very concerned about what this could do to our financial future. Right now, I have good to very good credit. I am largely the reason why we get approved for car leases, car purchases, and our upcoming mortgage loan. I am deathly afraid that if we refinance 200k into a PRIVATE loan, that it will kill our credit and any possibility of making purchases in the future. Student loans don't affect DTI ratios the way private loans do, so we'd be removing the one ""saving grace"" related to these loans.


I'm just not sure what to do. I don't know how to balance the pros and cons. Is reducing the interest rate and being able to make more progress on 200k worth of student loans worth being legally bound to this debt when I wasn't before, tanking both our credit, and potentially putting a major stop on all of our financial plans for the future? We want to turn our current home purchase into a rental property in 5 years, but will we get approved for a mortgage? Will I get approved for another lease in 2 years? I just don't know.

is this good? should i call wells fargo and say it wasn't me, but my parents?
is a bankruptcy gonna show up on my credit report now? can i dispute it?
what else should i be prepared for?

so is my account going to be ""frozen"" for 3 years? 5 years?

but i do have a question: worst case scenario, say its too late and its already included and extended, etc. what will my credit report say? how badly will it affect my score, and how hard will it be to get another credit card/loan/mortgage? will lenders see me as a bankrupt person, or will they understand once i explain?

**EDIT 3**: i called wells fargo. they said they shut off  account access because of the reasons many of you have stated, but it is still due. if i miss a payment, my account ill be delinquent. so i have to call or send a check. i asked if i could remove the co-signers and they said they aren't allowed to modify the loan during the period of the bankrupty. she said they are not reporting this as bankrupt on my credit report and will not affect my credit report. should i believe them? wells fargo has done some shady stuff in the past.

My current idea is maybe just skip the investing. Don't touch my investment account at all, and pay of the top 4 loans in the list to the amount of 8400. That would leave me with 1600 leftover to do what I want with.

In three months I have made 4% in the market. My bank account's interest rate is 0.45%. Obviously I'd rather have 4% than 0.45%.

I think the biggest reason people are scared of investing is the fear of losing money. But in the long run, it'll be much, much more lucrative. For example:

Let's say you invest in the latter half of 2007 and lose 37% in 2008. In 2009 you'd make 26.46%. In 2010 you'd make 15.06%. In just these two years you would've made your money back + more. If you keep it in until 2013 you would've doubled your money.

I am graduating in a month with a BS in my field and starting salaries of about $45,000 annually. I've supported myself since I was 16 (loving parents but not financially capable to support my schooling). I currently have 2 jobs until August 2017 (one is public service). Minimal monthly expenses of travel and auto insurance as I am gracious enough to have a parent to live with for a few years to help take the financial load off my shoulders.

This is where it gets absolutely terrifying, I have $92,000 in student loans. About half is private and the other half is federal. I'm having a panic attack realizing this and typing it out right now and don't want to make financial mistakes that will wreck my life.

Federal Loans-

I am currently doing my exit counseling for the federal loans and have to decide which payment plan is best (yes I will consult my loan servicer as well). I have determined a IBR plan would work best, given that I owe so much, but there are two different options that I qualify for to choose from.

IBR for new Borrowers-
I am currently working with the State in public service and MIGHT get the option to stay on full time. If I do, I can see myself being here for the long haul career. With this plan, my payments are cheaper, more interest accrued, with $30,000 to be forgiven on this plan should I get the option to stay in public service. But those are uncertainties I don't like to play with.

Regular IBR-
This is the option I am leaning towards, as the monthly payments are higher (still affordable), less interest accrued, with the option for $10,000 to be forgiven if I get the chance to stay in public service. 

Private Loans-
This has to be dealt with when I go in to talk to my bank officer to determine the best repayment option. (highest interest loan first)

The real question is what IBR payment plan should I choose?",finance

I want to try to leverage a lower interest rate on my Chase card because A.) it's my oldest card and I don't want to lose that credit history, and B.) it's got a higher credit limit should I need it. 



Here are my questions; is it possible to negotiate like this with credit companies? How much information about my other accounts is available to a credit card company? I.e. If I bluff and tell them that I have a lower rate on my Citibank account than I actually do, will they know I'm bluffing?


P.S. I tried to search the sub before submitting, but I didn't find anything that really seemed to fit my situation.

personalfinance,"Backdoor ROTH IRA and 5,500 catch-up -- why is my financial institution saying its taxable?","Background:  I make too much to contribute to a traditional IRA so I have been using this so called backdoor roth IRA for a number of years and never really paid close attention to my taxes till this year as I made the assumption with all the forms any tax guy could figure things out.  I have no other IRA accounts, and never have previously --therefore I should qualify for this 5500$ a year loophole as far as I can tell.  In 2015 I forgot to use the backdoor ROTH thing, so I just did a 5500$ catch up in March of 2016 for the '15 year.  I did the same for my 'in year' 2016 contribution of 5500$ in December of 2016.  

Fast forward to today, and when I look at my federal income tax form that was prepared, in box 15a for IRS distributions I see nothing, in box 15b under taxable amount I see 11000$.  Taxable amount 11,000$ raises a red flag -- if I am reading this right, at the bottom were adding up all these boxes so effectively my total income reported to the IRS is 11k more than it should be, right?

So I email my tax guy to take a second look and also take a look at my IRA tax forms myself (I dont have a roth one available, just the traditional ira that was used to 'convert' this that was immediately closed -- roth account says there are no forms available).  When I look at it it clearly states my 'taxable amount' is 11k. 

See the 2 forms here:  http://imgur.com/a/IarZF

Am I missing something?  Do I just ignore this and not report it as income even though my financial institution looks (and probably reports to the IRS) like it is?  In other years I see a 5498 form along with this 1099, but not for 2016 for some reason and this is the only year I mistakenly had to 'catch-up.'  

Complicating matters I see 5,500$ in 15a in my 2015 taxes as if I contributed when I actually forgot (hence the catch-up in March of 2016), but since its not taxable I am wondering if that even matters that a mistake might have been made there?",finance
personalfinance,"Student Loan Debt ($231K), Income ($125K). Advice please!","Hi Reddit!  It took awhile to post this as most of you with student loans know, it is gut wrenching to look at how much you pay.  Anyways, to the point.  I have $231K in student loans and earn $125K a year (about $6K a month after taxes and contributions to 401K).  I am in a highly stable job but raises each year will be about 3% at the most, I will generally get around $8K to 10K in a bonus each year.   Here is how my loans are broke out the 4 different lenders (I have never refinanced).  I am 32 years old, getting married in May, having my first baby in October, and live in Chicago.  Feeling the pressure so any help is CERTAINLY appreciated.

First Company.  $51K total (5 different loans combined).  Between 5% to 8% variable interest rate.  Expected payoff date of paying minimum payments is 2030.

Second Company. $6K total (2 loans combined).  One is 4.25% ($1k) and the rest is 8.25% interest rate, both variable.  Expected payoff is 2019 and 2026.

Third Company.  $37K total (3 loans combined). Interest is 7.25% for one and 10.25% for the other two, all variable .  Expected payoff is 2026 and 2031 for other two.

Final (the federal loan).  $134K (2 loans combined).  6.35% fixed interest.  Expected payoff is 2036.

I have about $10K in savings.  Her parents are paying for the wedding and she fortunately has no debt.  I have no CC debt.  I am also closing on our 500 square feet apartment on 04/27 and getting about $20K in equity which we will use as a downpayment for our new place.  Expecting to put down 10% for new apartment.  No other debts.

gaming,Why did we get rid of the happy endings?,"I've been playing Mass Effect Andromeda a lot recently and while I have been enjoying it immensely, I keep wishing they would have kept the Paragon/Renegade system.

Really, I do. Or at least I thought I did. But now I am realizing that I really just want the happy ending, the clean cut lines of good and evil, the chance to be a hero back.

In Mass Effect, there have always been hard choices. But, for the most part, I could save everyone. The few people who I couldn't save were due to my lack of preparation or it was an inevitable death completely outside of my control (one major exception)

But Andromeda has made it so that I am constantly having to choose between people. I am.completely incapable of saving everyone. I can't convince the enemy to see the error of their ways, I can't rescue the lost colonists, and I can't save both the scouts and the scientists. 

I understand the desire for gritty, 'real' entertainment. There are definitely times when I can appreciate an entirely grey morality system. It makes things seem more real, more genuine, and that helps increase immersion. I am not saying a darker style is bad. It can be highly entertaining when done right.

But why is it becoming the major trend in RPG's? Skyrim, The Witcher, Andromeda, Fallout 4, Dragon Age, Any Telltale game, etc. We've started getting to the point where we don't really have any actual Good Guys, just the Morally Ambiguous Guy who we don't actually know if he made the right choice or wrong choice!

So many of us players work and become great at the game only for our talent to do nothing because we are handcuffed to ""Hard Choices"" and ""Realism.""

personalfinance,Help determining scam,"Edit: looks like a scam. I'll update in a day or two when he replies back. 

Edit: Yep he sent me to a fake site, and told me to pay through iTunes. Oh well. I've reported it to the Airbnb phishing email.

I'll include text of message below just in case anyone else tries to google search for similar issue.

--------

I am looking for an apartment and found a great one with a low price. It seems a bit too good to be true though.

He is dealing through Airbnb, which I have heard has had people 'leasing' their apartments for extended periods. But I'm a bit suspicious of these things.

Here is the email I received about the process. I haven't received the deposit link yet but I will be quadruple verifying that it goes through the actual Airbnb website. 

&gt;  As I already told you in my first email, Airbnb will handle the renting process in my behalf due to my offshore job. I will have to contact the Airbnb agency and provide them all the necessary information so they can start the rental process. For that I will need your full name, rental period with exact move-in date, if other persons will be living with you, your email, phone number and a copy if your ID or Passport if possible.

&gt; To secure the apartment you will be instructed to pay just the security deposit of $500 to Airbnb to confirm reservation ( which is fully refundable in case you don't like the apartment ). Only once the deposit is paid an agent will be assigned to handle the visit/ inspection so you will not be able to visit the apartment before the reservation. (Aibnb is a 20 billion dollars company but it has to manage more than 1,500,000 locations, so they would need an impossible number of agents to present every location they have without a deposit confirmation)

&gt; Once you confirm the payment you'll have two options, I could send you the keys by FedEx or you can meet the agent that will hand over the keys and rental agreement. Please note they require up to 48 hours to process your payment and rental details before they assign the agent that will handle the walk-through and all. The $500 security deposit will be refunded immediately if you don't like the place or once the contract will end if you decide to rent. ( but only If the apartment is not vandalized or something).

&gt; If you are satisfied with the apartment all you have to do is to provide a valid ID, pay the first month rent and sign the lease agreement. After you move in, the monthly payment will be sent directly to my bank account.  If that is acceptable please provide the requested details and I will submit your application right away. I will send the Airbnb reservation offer to your email and you can take it from there.

&gt; **Very important!!   Please reply only if you fully understand the process as I have been disappointed lately with unserious persons when it comes to reserving. I'll have to pay for the transaction fees and just in case you change your mind I will not receive a refund from them!**

&gt; You will find attached a photo of my passport for more transparency.

Red flags to me:

- Not seeing the apartment before a deposit
- The fact that he has an offshore job
- His passport is listed as him being from Ohio, but this apartment is in New Jersey
- How many reassurances he has. He seems to be over explaining things that seem sketch 
- Does Airbnb actually have agents that do this stuff? I've never seen something like that.
- He attaches passport as proof. I'm not sure what proof a passport gives lol


My plan right now is to determine how he asks for the deposit. If it is through the Airbnb website (I know how to check for phishing scandals where they send a fake site that looks like Airbnb) I think I will go through and see what happens, after contacting a representative to make sure I will actually get a refund if nothing goes through. At the very least I can get more info and hopefully report whatever I find if he is trying to scam.

Any advice? Is this something people have seen before either as a scam or a legitimate thing? It would be so great to have this be a legitimate thing.

**New Email**
--

&gt;  Hello, I just sent the airbnb offer and you are now welcome to reserve the apartment. Did you receive it ? If you have any problems or If you would like any additional information, please don't hesitate to ask or just let me know after you complete the reservation process.

 &gt; PS:  I wanted iTunes as payment method for the reservation because all the transactions completed using iTunes will have a 3% redirect to ""American Cancer Organization ( ACO)"" and I have like personal reasons in choosing this method, Is a very simple process and  I hope is not to much trouble for you.

personalfinance,24.6% APR Car Loan (x-post /r/FinancialAdvice),"Hi, and thanks for reading!

So I'm in a bit of a pickle. I have a 24.6% APR car loan, with a payoff of about $12,500. When purchased, it was $11,995 on the lot and the loan was (is) a 72 month term. I am currently 24 months into the loan and the vehicle is now worth about $4,200. I was approved for a refinance at 6.72%, but the problem is, the most they will give me is $7,700. Every month I am spending around $885 on this car. EVERY MONTH. That includes payments (~$385), insurance (~200), and gas (~50), plus averaging the cost of maintenance for a year ($3,000 for repairs and oil and such every year).

I have had the loan for 2 years (since I was 19) and have tried my utmost to get my credit score up. I have never missed a payment on anything, I pay my bills on time, and I don't slack off at work. 

My current credit score is just below 680, and that's with me breaking a 1 year lease and still paying that debt off.
What I want to know is, should I do a voluntary termination on the vehicle? I make about $1600-1800 a month Net, sometimes more, and my other expenses total under $600 a month altogether including rent (not food). Should I try to move it to a credit card? 

Should I just stick it out? I have a family member who is willing to put $3,000 towards it to help out, but I'd rather they put it to a used car online or craigslist (my father was a mechanic, I can fix most problems myself or know people who can do it right, cheap).

Wouldn't it be better to by a $5k car and then spend my money on getting that safe and repaired and to spend thousands extra on a vehicle that is actually mine and paid off?

personalfinance,Why do I owe $600? I thought I'd get my withholdings returned.,"I am 24yo, new to the workforce, and slowly learning about taxes (as well as other essential personal finance must-knows). 

I was expecting to get some of my withholdings back, but I am shocked to learn that I will actually owe $600. 

I earned $55,719 in 2016 and had $7,514 in federal income tax withheld. Additionally, because I lived with my parents in 2016, I am listed as my father's dependent. Lastly, I had a raise in the middle of the year from $45,000 to $50,000. 

Of the $55,719, $13,709 was a bonus/commission ($8500 and $5209, respectively). When I got my bonus and commission checks, I was shocked to learn that I had $3,427 had been withheld. After some research, I learned about the 25% flat rate and was under the impression that I would get some back, especially since only 9% of my base pay for my regular checks is usually diverted to federal withholdings.

Since 9% of my gross income goes to federal withholdings, I thought that would be the rate my commission and bonus would be taxed, meaning I'd get about $1,2300 in return ([.25*13709] - [.16*13709] = (.09*13709)

personalfinance,Finish paying off car or get something cheaper?,"Hello Personal Finance! I've lurked here for awhile picking up random bits of information but never posted. 


My question for everyone today has to do with the current balance left on my car and whether I should focus on just paying it off or trying to trade in for something cheaper. (Not cheaper just in the sense of cost, but in yearly maintenance costs, gas, insurance, etc.)


A little backstory: When I joined the military I did the smart thing and bought a used 2010 Prius for around $14,000. Car payment was $200 and insurance was around $120. Not too bad. As time went on I wanted to upgrade and had the money to do so, so I traded in the Prius for a 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek. With that car I am now paying $370 a month and $160 in insurance with a 4.8% interest rate. 

This was my dream car and just one of those vehicles that really reflects my interests and personality. I walk up to it everyday with a smile on my face and truly enjoy owning / driving it.


However, while I am in no way hurting for money I would love to lower my expenses. I will ""most likely"" be leaving the military in a little less than 3 years and I want to have 0 debt when that happens. 


I currently owe $19,000 on the Subaru. I have done many upgrades to the car myself that will make it highly desirable for re sale value whether I trade it into a dealership or sell privately. I can estimate to at least break even if not get a little back. 


So to finally get to the question, (sorry) would it be better to just stick with the Subaru and work on getting that 19k balance down to zero in the next few years, or would it be wise to again look for a car like a Prius that could lower my payments, total balance, maintenance, gas, and insurance costs?


I know I sound a little silly for starting with a Prius, then buying a car that is a little bit expensive, and then going back to a Prius (or similar car.) but hey here we are lol. 


As much as I am in love with the car, my financial stability moving forward is much more important. Really appreciate any advice people are able to offer. If I didn't offer enough details or you have any clarification questions feel free to reply and I'll get back ASAP.

I wanted to make this post to inform people so they could read it all, and come to their own informed opinion on the matter. I might be downvoted for this, but my intent is to just inform people.. and let them come to their own decision. 

I found a good ELI5 of this (of stuff I already researched), and was really happy too.. because finally I could make a post, that would allow people to fully understand it, without some big crazy explanation.  I will copy and paste it all here. Please read it all. This is not to change your mind on anything, but just to INFORM. There are sources for everything also. 

Starting (yet again this is someone elses ELI5, that I thought was wrote perfectly out, and wanted to share): 

1st. I just want to say right here and now that after reading into this for over a month, I have done a bit of soul searching. 

2nd. The amount of information required to firmly grasp what I am going to be posting here is significant. Hundreds of pages of legislation, lawsuits, lobbying firms, court rulings, official statements; which some of these can go back to laws established in the 30s, has gone into this, and I am certain there is still more out there to read which will come as time goes on. But I wanted to post this no before people freak out even more when Trump signs this all into law.

So if you are wanting any kind of tl:dr, then the only thing I can say is this;

No ISP is going to have the legal means to target you personally on your internet history, unless you are the only customer of their service. Companies abuse legal definitions to squirm their way out of ****. The Net Neutrality laws currently in place need to be amended for good reason.

There's your tl;dr. if you actually care to gain some context to it all, then continue. Else I would say it's not worth your time and you can carry on with your day. Your ability to browse porn and collect rare Pepes will be unhindered either way.

3rd. I am going to first touch the issue of the Privacy law that everyone has panicked about due to such a grand amount of fear mongering and misinformation, then I will discuss the ""Open Internet Order"" adopted in 2015, which is our current interpretation of Net Neutrality laws at the moment.

4th. This is going to be a long post. The amount of reading is vast, and I will do my best to navigate information when providing my sources.

So everyone has been understandably upset about their internet privacy. It‚Äôs easy to come to the conclusion that we are losing our privacy when so many news groups are reacting to this. Unfortunately, info graphics don‚Äôt give this subject the justice it deserves, and we‚Äôre waist deep in misinformation.

Everyone has been hearing how ""The Republican sold you out. Now ISPs will be able to sell your personal data to the highest bidder.""

Pretty scary sounding right? Sounds like your whole world is going to change?

So scary that people decided to throw some numbers on info graphics and even scare you a little bit more.

Unfortunately, info-graphics like this are wide-spread and thrive off fear mongering. It‚Äôs quite a damning accusation, and ultimately graphics like this are often lacking any sort of source to back them up.

I took the liberty to do some researching, and decided to pick out one of the most ""Evil"" Internet Service Providers I could find and see how politically diverse they are

I know we want to cause as much fear an hatred as possible and say the Republicans are the sellouts, but political contributions have been going everywhere. I'm not saying it's good. I am just saying that unless you have more information, don't be taking info graphics you see online to heart. There are many factors and far better ways to acquire information.

I'm going to continue by easing some of your fears regarding the internet right now. Cause these info graphics and Facebook posts you see online over the years about Net Neutrality and Online Privacy abuse, have really been a huge source of not so much misinformation, but misdirection. Because all they have been doing has been causing you great fear and distress. Which is something many people are hoping for when they want things to go their way.

As we move forward I want you guys to keep something in your mind; Definitions mean almost everything in a court room, Jurisdiction of an organization matters, and legislation can play favorites.


So, about that internet privacy bill that so many people are so scared over and think that they can now go buy their representatives online history. 

It's not happening. I will quote an article from Forbes that sums it up a little easier then I will touch some existing legislation that protects you.

In short, your personal history is not going to be sold and unmask you to the highest bidder. You are used as a statistic, not a target. Not saying that's a good thing, and you can still have issues with that, but I wanted to clarify this for the following issue.

People have been mislead into a sense of indignation; that they have raised nearly $300,000 in hopes of enacting a little Karma against Congress, thinking they will be able to purchase their online history..

(Can't post the GoFundMe Pages) News Source: [1](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39443161) [2](http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15115382/buy-congress-web-history-gop-fake-internet-privacy)

People are under the wrong impression of how this works, and are giving up their money to a lost cause.

&gt; But here's the real problem: you can't buy Congress' internet data. You can't buy my internet data. You can't buy your internet data. That's not how this works. It's a common misconception. We even saw this in Congress four years ago, where Rep. Louis Gohmert went on a smug but totally ignorant rant, asking why Google won't sell the government all the data it has on people. As we explained at the time, that's not how it works*. Advertisers aren't buying your browsing data, and ISPs and other internet companies aren't selling your data in a neat little package. It doesn't help anyone to blatantly misrepresent what's going on.

&gt; When ISPs or online services have your data and ""sell"" it, it doesn't mean that you can go to, say, AT&amp;T and offer to buy ""all of Louis Gohmert's browsing history."" Instead, what happens is that these companies collect that data for themselves and then sell targeting. That is, when Gohmert goes to visit his favorite publication, that website will cast out to various marketplaces for bids on what ads to show. Thanks to information tracking, it may throw up some demographic and interest data to the marketplace. So, it may say that it has a page being viewed by a male from Texas, who was recently visiting webpages about boardgames and cow farming (to randomly choose some items). Then, from that marketplace, some advertisers' computerized algorithms will more or less say ""well, I'm selling boardgames about cows in Texas, and therefore, this person's attention is worth 1/10th of a penny more to me than some other company that's selling boardgames about moose."" And then the webpage will display the ad about cow boardgames. 

&gt; All this happens in a split second, before the page has fully loaded.

&gt; At no point does the ad exchange or any of the advertisers know that this is ""Louis Gohmert, Congressional Rep."" Nor do they get any other info. They just know that if they are willing to spend the required amount to get the ad shown via the marketplace bidding mechanism, it will show up in front of someone who is somewhat more likely to be interested in the content. That's it.

________________

So now this begs the question, if we were already well protected, what exactly was being repealed?

For this I will slightly defer to a recent Verge article, then elaborate.

&gt; This is a trickier question than you might think! Let‚Äôs take a step back: telecom regulation isn‚Äôt like criminal law, where the word of the law draws a clear line between what‚Äôs legal and illegal. Most of what the FCC does is interpreting the same law ‚Äî the Telecom Act of 1934 ‚Äî to apply to modern technologies like wireless internet and broadband.

&gt; The Telecom Act says a lot about what companies can do with customer data in general ‚Äî but because it was written with copper telephone networks in mind, it‚Äôs genuinely unclear how to apply those principles to data like browsing history and IP logs. That‚Äôs where the FCC comes in, interpreting the Telecom Act to say which kinds of data fall under which provisions of the law.

&gt; The privacy rules set by previous FCC chairman Tom Wheeler ‚Äî the ones that just got repealed ‚Äî were our first indication of how that customer data could be treated now that broadband and wireless service were classified under Title II, the big net neutrality decision made back in 2015. In many ways, the rules are less like a law than a promise of enforcement. Basically, this is what the FCC thinks the Telecom Act means, and if they think you‚Äôre violating the Telecom Act, they‚Äôll sue you for millions of dollars. As a result, it‚Äôs very much in companies‚Äô interest to follow the rules.

[Source](http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/31/15138526/isp-privacy-bill-vote-trump-marsha-blackburn-internet-browsing-history)

The order being pushed forward, was a clarification of definitions and Title II reclassification of the original 2015 Net Neutrality Order, also known as the Open Internet Order. As the Open Internet order had reclassified Broadband Internet as a Utility, mobile internet providers as Common carriers, and abstained classification (from what I know at the moment) of other companies.

Here is the Open Internet Order for those who wish to view. It is 400 pages long. Aslo the repealed Order in question.

Sources: [1](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A1_Rcd.pdf) [2](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-02/pdf/2016-28006.pdf#page=1) 

The next question we want to ask, is why? If this document was more so a clarification of definitions, what is the point of repealing it?

The answer is what it was clarifying. The Open Internet Order.

The open internet order faced criticism by 2/5 of the FCC commissioners (including current FCC Chairman Pai) due to that reclassification of different internet providers with increasing regulations, would be an overreach of the FCC. It harmed small businesses from competing and giving different companies different sets of rules, essentially playing favorites. Having harder regulations, would kill off smaller ISP providers and make it far more difficult to compete against companies such as google fiber which are already well set and funded.

Prior to the FCC Open internet order, jurisdiction over privacy and information abuse was held by the Federal Trade Commission since the beginning of the internet. The FTC was highly regarded as the proper authority, and would follow more uniform measure to protect the people from multiple forms of online abuse from multiple forms of Internet Providers. 

Reclassification of Title II changed what was under the jurisdiction of the FTC, and in some instances created a policy vacuum.

As stated by FTC commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen 2016;

&gt; When the FCC adopted its net neutrality rules, it chose to reclassify ‚ÄúBroadband Internet Access Service‚Äù, or ‚ÄúBIAS‚Äù as a Title II common carrier service.This affected the FTC‚Äôs oversight of BIAS providers. Although the FTC has general jurisdiction, there are a few carve outs, including common carriers acting as common carriers. Thus, the FCC‚Äôs reclassification affected the FTC‚Äôs long-standing authority to protect consumers‚Äô privacy in their interactions with their broadband internet service providers.

&gt; This change to the oversight of ISP privacy practices matters because the FTC is the primary privacy and data protection agency in the U.S., and probably the most active enforcer of privacy laws in the world. We have brought more than 150 privacy and data security related enforcement actions, including actions against ISPs and against some of the biggest companies in the Internet ecosystem. We also conduct extensive consumer and business outreach and guidance, coordinate workshops to foster discussions about privacy in emerging areas, coordinate on privacy efforts internationally, and advocate for policies about privacy and data use that improve consumer welfare.

Due to the Title II reclassifications of IPSs under the Open Internet Order, it limited what the FTC could regulate and protect the consumer. The very law established for Net Neutrality, which was to help protect against throttling your network, allowed for specific companies to abuse just that.

Right now, the MSM has been about demonstrating ""Pai's hatred for Net Neutrality"", but the public are not aware of the impact by the reclassification of Title II. Pai has been pushing to decrease regulation and return jurisdiction back to the FTC, where the internet and many businesses affected were more uniformly regulated, and where the laws didn't resemble that of playing favorites.

This was released by chairman Pai, a couple days ago: [Letter](http://memestatic.fjcdn.com/pictures/Let_0220e5_6224921.jpg)

I'm wondering how people might be building their long term portfolios to hedge against this?

I've found some information online (but not much to inform what portfolios changes hedge against rate rises in the long term):

* Stock price growth and yields generally decline.
* REIT prices and yields generally decline due to leveraged debt. 
* Bond prices decline due to lowered demand.
* Gold price growth declines, but not as much as stocks. 
* Bank stock price growth generally increases due to increased profitability.

I have been teaching special education on the a variance for the past two years and am planning on taking graduate-level classes working towards my master's in special education while working on an extended variance for the next couple of years (program ends 2019). I currently have around $35,000 in federal student loan debt along with around $5,000 in personal loan debt in regards to education. In addition, my father has ~$5,000 in Parent Plus loans for my education. The master's program that I am currently looking towards enrolling in will cost me around $14,000 by the end of it. I have been making loan payments based on income based repayment since graduating in December 2014.

I am currently in a slight Panic of trying to figure out loan forgiveness programs that I would qualify for and how to successfully use them. The problem I'm running into is that every organisation that I try to work with seems like it's more of a sales pitch than actually getting my student loans forgiven.

I feel like a complete idiot when it comes to all of these Financial issues, and optimistically would like to just find someone who I could pay a small amount and would take all of my loan information, tax information, etcetera and figure out for me what would be the best program to get me signed up for and get me started on that.

Does anybody here have any kind of experience with these types of programs or companies and would have any recommendations? I feel like at this point I'm drowning in loan debt, and am only sinking myself further by going back to school.

E1: Currently taking home 1,100 every other week on salary. Salary is currently $37,000 pretax and all that. Would be making $47,000 by 2019 (when program concludes).

Fed loan balance currently at 32,000 on good standing. Interest rates range from 3.1 to 6.5.

personalfinance,Going back to school for MBA - What should my financial moves be?,"Hello r/personalfinance - long time lurker, first time poster. I was recently admitted to a top 20 MBA program, and will begin classes in Fall 2017. It is a full-time, two year program. I am looking for guidance as to what source(s) of money to use to finance my MBA given my situation, as well as what other financial moves to make in preparation for two years slumming it as a grad student. Here are the facts of my case:
 
* Grad school costs, inclusive of living expenses, will approximate $200,000 total.
* I am attending an MBA program in my current city, so I am fully aware of the cost of living and will remain in my current apartment. My rent is on the lower end for the area, I live close to school, and I do not own a car. I live with a roommate.
* Barring a market crash, I will have $90,000 in non-retirement accounts and cash available to pay for grad school. I have an additional $7,500 set aside for summer travel; I will leave my job two months before class begins in order to do so. I have accepted that I will forego two months‚Äô salary and 401(k) contributions.
* My parents have graciously offered to loan the remaining $110,000 at the pristine interest rate of 0%, with payments beginning upon employment. This is the same arrangement we had for my undergraduate degree (which I have paid off, albeit a much smaller sum). It is effectively a loan against my inheritance. My parents will obtain the funds via a low interest rate HELOC rather than cashing in investments.
* I can expect to earn over $100,000 in base salary upon graduation, plus signing bonus and annual bonus. Salary will likely end up between $105,000 and $120,000.
* I have excellent credit, stick to my budget, and a background in finance. That said, I am clueless on student debt due to the arrangement with my parents for undergrad. I have no debt and pay my credit cards in full every month.
 
Here are my questions:
 
Given the above, should I accept the offer in full from my parents, or mix in some federal and/or private student loans? Am I crazy if I do not accept their offer in full?
 
Should I cash out my non-retirement accounts to protect against a market crash? Or liquidate my holdings on an as-needed basis?
 
My intention is to obtain a 0% interest credit card prior to leaving my job ‚Äì is this a good idea? Should I wait until year 2 of school for this, as that is when I might run low on my own money? Will a grad student get approved for a credit card?
 
Should I keep contributing to my Roth IRA for both 2017 and 2018? Or should I stop in 2018 and open a traditional IRA since I will likely be in a lower tax bracket that year?
 
Should I obtain health insurance through my university‚Äôs plan or sign up for Obamacare? I am very healthy.
 
Anything else I should consider?

financialindependence,"Hypothesis: a low post-ER budget doesn't necessarily mean you're ""living on so little."" Consider the concept of ""salary equivalence.""","There are frequent questions on the sub in this vein: after FI/ER how do you live on so little? We've got one today, in fact.

Those of us who are post-FI/ER aren't living on as little as you might think. To demonstrate, consider what I call ""salary equivalence,"" by which I mean the amount of money you'd have to earn in salary each year to offset your ER expenses. Which may sound obtuse, so let me give you this example. With the exception of the monthly budget, this is literally my situation.

I have no idea how to set up a table in Reddit. But as a crummy attempt at ease of viewing, [here's a screenshot of the spreadsheet I set up, in imgur.](http://i.imgur.com/ckpoXgm.png)

Bottom line is that a person who's early retired and lives on an annual budget of $36K has a salary equivalent to someone in the workforce who earns $78.3K, all else being equal. Which isn't, to my way of thinking, such a small amount of money to live on.

You folks please check my assumptions, math, etc. since I'm only into my second cup of coffee.

Assumptions:

-Annual budget = $36K. 

-Pre-ER savings percentage = 25%.

-House book value in both post-FI/ER and pre-FI/ER = $330K. Post-FI/ER: house is paid off. Pre-FI/ER: 20% equity at 4.25%. Mortgage deduction ignored to keep things simple. I feel like this is reasonable since paying off the house is a common situation for the post-FI/ER crowd.

-Post-ER: zero federal and state income tax burden (through loss harvesting, etc.--totally possible; this has been my situation since I retired.) Pre-ER: federal effective tax rate of 10%, state effective tax rate of 2%.

-Healthcare: Post-FI/ER Obamacare subsidies = pre-FI/ER employer subsidies (this is probably a big assumption, but individual circumstances vary so much that let's call it a base case.) Let's say in both situations the residual premium is $6K a year, hence a wash. My family builds the premium into our budget, so no net effect for us. Perhaps at $500/month to a $33K budget that's overly generous. Adjust your number-crunching accordingly.

-Post-FI/ER = zero 401K/IRA contributions. Pre-FI/ER = $6K (verifiable national average but a low number for the FI/ER community, which makes this a generous assumption.)

-----

So really, your post-FI/ER people living on a $36K budget aren't ""living"" on any less than people with a gross salary of something like 215% of the post-FI/ER budget.

See where I'm coming from? It's a little counterintuitive, maybe, but I think it's a cool concept.

As I said, I could be completely blathering horseshit wrong about this, but since we're using the scientific method and this is a hypothesis, please pick it apart.

**TL;DR: crunch some numbers and you'll see that the post-FI/ER crowd might not be living on as little as you think when compared to salary earners.**

I guess my question would be:

1) Pay off the cards with the monthly payments over time and keep paying a larger sum toward them every week (which after calculation, it will take until about the end of the year)

2) Utilize Prosper and pay off all the credit cards at once. The APR and interest rate are about the same and somewhat lower than a majority of the cards, but I've never been sure on a personal loan before.

personalfinance,"17k in Bank account, 17k Debt, 4.5k in 401(k)","I want to preface this post by saying I know there is not going to be a definite answer to my question. I'm just looking for a best approach and some advice for some people more seasoned in personal finance.

I am currently 22 and have been working for just over 9 months now. My starting salary was 55k + a 5k signing bonus + OT @ time and a half. Starting last week, I will be making 57k + a 5% premium pay on each check and no OT (not happy with my salary adjustment, but that's a different topic). 

As the title states, I currently have 17k in the bank and approx. 17k in debt, split between a car loan and student loans. My company 401(k) is currently sitting at 4.5k, with a vested balance of 3.5k. I started getting match Jan 1st, started work in July of 2016. 

Breakdown:

* Tax return was just shy of $5k. I got a decent amount of that because my last semester of college, the payments came out of my bank account. 

* I do have a good chunk of change just sitting in my checking account because of my tax return, about 9k right now. 

* I have $7.5k sitting in my savings account. 

* I owe $8.3k on my car @ a 6.9% interest rate. I have been paying, on average, $350/month. 

* Student Loans - I have 4 seperate loans, all paid through the same service with varying interest rate. I am at work now without the password on hand, but the rates on the 4 range from something like 3.2% to 6.9%. The loan with the 6.9% interest rate is currently my lowest, at $1.5k. The others are something like 5.2%, 4.9%, and 3.2% with varying amounts from about 1.5k to 3k. I have been paying approx. $300/month on loans. 


I am wondering what to do with the money I have currently. I hate the fact that I owe money on my car, especially since the current loan exceeds the value I could sell the car for in the private market. I am tempted to just pay it off entirely so I can have the title in hand in case I did just want to dump it. Granted, I would lose close to $5k on it. The car was certainly not my best financial decision, but cars are a huge hobby and passion of mine. I do have a sticker that says ""Financial Mistake"" on my car, which is very fitting. 

I want to start a Roth IRA savings account, but it seems the conventional wisdom is to pay debt off first, then worry about saving for retirement. I would consider the 7.5k in my savings as my current emergency fund. If I had to, I could live off $1.5k/month (rent is $1k, will go down in July, too high now). 

This is the part where I understand there is no cut and dry answer. 

I believe my next steps should be to pay my car loan off ASAP. I think I may use a large portion of my tax return on paying the debt down, maybe like $4k, to half what I owe. Then in a couple months have it completely paid for. I also want to pay off my 6.9% SL debt within the next 3 months. 

Would this be my best course of action or should I put money into a Roth IRA first and continue to tackle my debt at my current rate? What would you guys do in my situation? 

My goal is to be debt free at 23! It has a nice ring to it.

right now i dont want to be taking anything out of vanguard (i dont know why i ever would except maybe to diversify into gold or something) so i'm thinking ill just make the usual payments on my debt for a month and ramp up from there as i get a feel for how much money i'm working with. my plan is to build up to about 3k of savings while making a bit extra on the loan payments maybe 1.5x minimum or something and then once i have confidence in my savings ill jump to 2x and above. my question for all of you is if there is any reason i should do something with my vanguard now considering its decent interest rate and my loan's manageable one and if i should reassess how much i really need rotting away (intest gains are abyssmal) in my chase savings for emergencies.",finance
btc,Analysis of the technical and political merits of scaling solutions.,"The polarization on scaling solutions in the bitcoin community these days is giving me nauseating flashbacks to media coverage of the 2016 US presidential race. With all the demagoguery and posturing it's easy to get intoxicated by the identity politics and not realize that we've all been talking about myopic bullshit for the past 6 months. I'm hear to take you on a journey through a lens of ironically disinterested ideas, and be a total dick about it.
Bitcoin is experiencing growing pains:
     The distributed decentralized hashing network has evolved into a cadre of 6 Holden Caulfield'esq Chinese guys measuring their dicks on twitter. This seems like it might be a systemic risk, it should perhaps be a more discussed.
     Johnny Mnemonic walked in on the party and informed everyone that we're going to have to dump 'earlychildhood.fmv' in order to fit our bloated blockchain on your laptop. This is less than ideal, the party isn't over, but from now on we're just going to have to let the dolphin in a vat verify the public ledger for us. (I sure hope no one shoots that vat)
     The throughput bottleneck has has been reached. Whether it's been reached because a hoard of nerds want to buy coffee with digital gold, or because level 90 black fedora has a nefarious scheme to juggle 10,000 bitcoins 100 times per second and ddos the mempool for some reason - I don't really care, and neither should anyone else. We're interested in scaling solutions, so let's talk about some...
    We could make everything bigger, stronger, heavier. Specifically, 8x bigger, otherwise we get pulled over at the Chinese internet boarder, they wanna search the car - we don't know how to explain that it's nothing, just a gigantic public ledger for outmoding fiat currency and neutering the states power to audit financial transaction... but we can make it 8x bigger, no big deal. This is a 20th century intuition, 8x more isn't a useful multiplier anymore, we're gonna be in the same position 6 months from now, except we can't make it bigger again. (I know , I know, you want to play chicken with Moore's law -*fap fap fap* let us know when your finished masturbating to that Neil Stevenson novel plotline) 
    Let's look at the other popular scaling solution, I love the name Segwit - it's this play on words, see... the witness being segregated is actually nuanced technical jargon having to do with hacking a weakness in old clients that allows you totally undermine the premise that they're validating a public ledger, which is being sold as something really desirable - because no one knows what they're talking about - but greater implications of 'the segwit update' is that it hacks in a bunch of solutions to problems utterly unrelated to each other (which no one is talking about), one of which builds out tools for sidechain ecosystems which are intended to be the actual scaling solution. Here's the funny part, it's not trustless. The blockchain is the 'witness' that we're segregating. Bitcoin gets to be the collateral in visa's vault √° la the gold standard, and they're gonna 'verify' the 'transactions' using 'blockchain technology'! Speculators love this solution ,because it positions itself so well to be deepthroating a regulatory apparatus without excessive neckpain - which would lend an air of professionalism to our viral rebranding campaign.
    So... let's take a step back and think about our goals. We want bitcoin to be worth a lot of government toilet-paper money. We want to be able to buy things on a trustless network with a smooth user experience and without paying excessive fees. We want to eliminate systemic points of failure.
    These solutions are garbage. We'll need to come up with something better, anyway here's my preference: 
Why don't we just store value with bitcoin... buy our coffee with dogecoin/litecoin/metoocoin etc... - and talk about building out programs and businesses that do nothing but facilitate this simple functionality with a seamless user experience? Instead of one heartbeat, the blockchain can have 10,000 all of different magnitudes, different immune systems, and their own personal scaling problems and dramatic failures - and we'll revel in that glorious anarchy like the swarm of locusts that we aspire to be.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Paying off auto loan as fast as possible vs monthly payments,"My wife and I disagree on how to approach our new car loan.

I am a 22 year old recent college graduate (May 2016) with a job I just started at the end of February making 41K a year. 
  
I was very fortunate to only graduate with $7,550 in loans thanks to great low income financial aid program my school had. These loans are 2 different loans. One for $2,500 with an interest rate of 5.0%. The other is $5,050 at 3.87% that can reduced to 3.61% if I link my bank account for monthly payments.  
  
I currently have $5,158 to my name. My only monthly expenses are rent and utilities which is around $1000 a month give or take usage. I contribute 10% to my 401K, leaving me with a take home of $1,184 each paycheck and I get paid twice a month. Groceries usually run me around $150 a month.  
  
I was thinking of paying off the $2,500 loan in one payment from my savings so that I no longer have to worry about it and the higher interest rate. I was then thinking of putting $250 a month to the remaining balance of $5,050 in order to pay it off in a little under 2 years.  
  
However, I have no idea if this is smart or if I am paying too much or too little. I have seen advice about using the snowball and avalanche method but it seems those really help when the debt is much larger. According to some online calculator that I used, there is no difference between which method I use.  
  
TLDR; I have $7550 of student loan debt and need help figuring out how to pay it off relatively quickly and smartly.",finance
personalfinance,"Student Loans, PLSF &amp; Divorce. Help me come up with a payment strategy?","I've posted a few times in PF already. You all are very helping in getting my mind straight.

Husband and I are not doing so great right now.  I've agreed to another chance, counseling is coming, but I'm still educating myself on divorce and trying to deal with our current finances so we have less to deal with if divorce comes. (I really should copy and paste that disclaimer...)

I have a snowball for our consumer debt.  Our remaining two credit cards should be paid by the end of the year, leaving a car loan (both our names), a small personal loan to his parents and my student loan debt.  My student loans are not currently in the snowball because they are deferred.  I'm still in school and will hopefully graduate Sep-Dec of this year. (My school has rolling enrollment)

I currently have ~$28k in loans and it may grow to $30k depending on my financial aid for the final term.  I am eligible for PLSF through my job but am not currently enrolled and the current news on that program has me doubtful it will ever pay off.

So here I am wondering what's my best plan of attack?  Should I start paying on the loans even though they are still in deferment? It wouldn't be a huge sum because I'm trying to get those two credit cards paid off and still have to consider how aggressive I want to get on the auto loan (still owe ~$19k as of today).

The biggest benefit would be if I start paying them down now, my balances could be lower when divorce comes and I'm financially screwed...but that makes me feel shady.  But if we stay together, it'd save us interest, right?  I'm deeply conflicted on how to handle all of this.  My husband pisses away so much money on video games and electronics and has blown through many, many thousands, part of me says I shouldn't feel bad about paying back my education.  Had he been more sensible maybe I wouldn't have the loans in the first place, certainly wouldn't have the credit cards.... (it's frustrating)

personalfinance,"I'm 29, a non-American living in the US, making $80k, but potential immigration complications make me wonder if I'm making the right financial decisions.","I fully understand that this sub is not the right one to answer immigration questions, but since it is so tied to my goals and financial future I wanted to spell it out in case anyone else is/was in a similar situation and has advice.


I‚Äôm 29 and single with no kids. I have no debt or loans. I‚Äôve been working in the US for the last 5 years. I now have approximately $110,000 in the stock market (though it‚Äôs not very diversified at the moment). The reason it‚Äôs not diversified is largely because I‚Äôve taken advantage of my company‚Äôs employee stock purchase program and the company has been doing really well leading to the value of my stocks growing quite a lot over the last several years (think IT and the growth of the cloud). Consequently, I‚Äôve been reluctant to sell it. I‚Äôm aware that I am at the mercy of the market, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure what the best move is on this front. Should I look to diversify even though my stocks continue to perform really well? I know selling them entails paying taxes on them and I‚Äôve never been sure what the wisest way to go about it is.


I have a further $38,000 in my 401k, taking advantage of employee match over the last few years.
I do not own my own house, and spend about $800 in rent a month. I‚Äôve been doing this for about 5 years now, which I acknowledge is not the wisest approach. My immigration fears have always stopped me from purchasing my own home, since I never knew how long I would get to work in the US. My current pre-tax income is $80k. I have an old car that‚Äôs probably worth about $3000 and I have an additional approximately $20,000 in my checking and savings account combined (my bank offers a very low interest rate, so I‚Äôm also wondering if moving it to some other vehicle makes sense.


I'm not sure how common my situation (and mindset) is. But the problem I have stems from the fact that I am on an H1-B visa in the United States which leads to a general feeling of unease about the future because there are simply no guarantees about how long I can stay here legally. I‚Äôm a third culture kid, meaning that going back to India, which is what my passport says is my home country is not really an option for me since I‚Äôve never actually lived in India because even though I was born in India I moved to another country shortly after. Being born in India leaves me a with a really long green card waitlist, it could take another 8-12 years for me to get my green card. For as long as I‚Äôm legally allowed to stay in the country, I‚Äôd like to save as much as I can so that if the worst were to happen at any point and I‚Äôm asked to leave the country I‚Äôd have enough of a financial cushion to consider my options and re-evaluate which country I can apply to live in at that point.


The other side of the coin is, I have friends here and somewhat of a social life here. My dream and goal is to continue living in the US and eventually become a citizen, legally. What often muddles my thinking is not knowing if I‚Äôll get that opportunity or if I should be thinking more about life outside the US if I‚Äôm forced to leave. That uncertainty leaves me often wanting to make emotional financial decisions than rational ones. 


I would appreciate any thoughts or insight into how I can be approaching my finances.",finance
personalfinance,W4 problems with new company,"Hi all,

I was looking for some help with my situation regarding my company messing up my W4 for the entire year. 

Recently, my former company (A) was purchased by a different company (B) and I started getting paid from this new company at the beginning of this year. My federal martial status is single with 0 exemptions. That was correct in my earnings statement with (B).  What I failed to notice was that further down the earnings statement under ""Additional tax withholding information"", I was listed as married in BOTH MD/VA and I was listed as head of household for both states as well.

After speaking to the HR reps, I was told to fill out a new W4 and send it in to correct the filing for the future.  What I'm wondering is whether or not I should be concerned about the past 4 months and how this will affect my taxes for 2017. Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated!

personalfinance,Retirement account advice,"Hey all. Throwaway account here, just because. The TL;DR is that I'd like to know if anyone has any suggestions for helping us get to a better spot with retirement savings.

I'm 36 years old, married, with one child. I make about $59K gross at my job ($57K salary, then $200/month for home office and telecom stipends). Take-home pay is $3408.70/month after healthcare premium, HSA, 401(k) deduction, etc. My wife works a (very) part-time job, and brings home about $300-500 per month. At this point it's not really an option for her to work more, as we place more importance on her being able to volunteer at our son's school and be a stay-at-home mom. She won't ever get this time with him back, after all. He's only in first grade now, so I see her working more once he's out of elementary school. Four more years.

I was a late bloomer in terms of finding a stable career. Prior to getting this job two and a half years ago, I was self-employed. I had an IRA long ago, but in 2010 I had to cash out the $7,000 in there because I left a relationship (and an apartment and the entire state) with absolutely nothing to my name. I hated doing it, but I really had no choice.

My employer matches 33% up to 6% of my income. I've been contributing since I was hired on as a full-time employee (started as a contractor) in July 2015. Started at 3%, and now I have it set at 6%.

I also have a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, through Betterment. I contribute $100 to the traditional and $25 to the Roth every month. I think I have both set up because that was Betterment's suggestion, but all over PF I see people advising a Roth, and rarely see mention of a traditional. So I'm not sure what my best option is.

* 401(k) balance as of today is $5,088.
* Traditional IRA balance is $1400.
* Roth IRA balance is $322.

I also contribute $50 each month to a 529 for my son, which is at about $1900 right now.

Other than mortgage and a car payment, we have no debt. We use a Citi Double Cash card to pay for most everything, then pay it off each month.

Here's a full a breakdown of our monthly budget. We have used YNAB for the last two years (it's a life-changer) and we budget every penny.

* Mortgage - $1300 (including insurance). Payment is actually $1201, but I overpay. We have about $100K equity in the home. Loan balance is $179K. Interest is 4.25%. 

* 529 for our son - $50

* Traditional IRA - $100

* Roth IRA - $50

* Car - $250 (minimum payment is $178). Balance is about $8400. We've owned the car three months, and I've been funneling a lot to it to get the balance down as much as possible (it's used, and I don't want to spend anywhere near five years paying for it). I've paid $1230 to it since we purchased it. For the most part, my wife's checks are going to go to this each month for the rest of the year, as at a minimum my goal is to get the balance under $5,000 by December 31. Interest rate is 3.45%.

* Netflix/Hulu - $19.49

* Car/life insurance -- $161 (this will go down to about $100 once we get rid of our second car -- a lease -- in the next month. Final payment for that lease is already socked away in the budget)

* Internet - $50

* Utilities - $160ish (including water, trash, electricity)

* Groceries - $450

* Spending Money - $100 (this is sort of a catch-all category)

* Household Goods - $100 (toiletries, cleaning supplies, linens, etc.)

* Kid's piano lessons - $50

* Clothing - $50

* Christmas/Birthday/Gifts - $50

* Home Maintenance - $100

* Car - $50 (it's an electric car, so I'm mostly just saving for things like new tires and wiper blades)

* Son's braces - $50 (just started saving for that this month)

* Repaying loan to my grandmother - $100

I use the remaining funds to fill in monthly contributions to yearly payments (like Costco membership, Amazon, Dropbox, etc.). And I throw whatever I can into our emergency fund, which has a balance right now of $1839.29. With my last two checks I've made it a priority to put 10% of take-home pay in that fund, and I'll continue to do that. 

All of that adds up to all of my take-home pay, leaving my wife's pay as a little bit of a cushion. We're not living paycheck to paycheck anymore (all April expenses are already covered), which is nice. But I know we have to be more aggressive with the retirement. I already think I'll be working until I'm 80, if I live that long (I'm a woman, so I have a chance!), but anything to minimize the length of the grind would be great.

Anyone have any thoughts? Should I focus more on one IRA over the other? Should I stop overpaying the mortgage and put that extra $99 elsewhere?",finance

How do I do this responsibly?,"So for the last few years, we've just kind of been comfortably scraping by, if that makes sense. We've got 3 young kids and I've been staying at home with them while working on my graduate degree. My husband's job has held us decently well, but not really enough to do much besides live and contribute to his retirement/401k. I'll be re-entering the workforce this fall, and we'll be able to pay off debts and prepare to move to another city, which we've been wanting to do for some time now. In this new city, my husband will be able to transfer laterally (if not promote onto a unit there), and there are easily 5x as many opportunities for me, so we're not worried about finding employment before we move.  

We haven't really moved since we started this whole adulting thing and now we've got kids to worry about. We were young and clueless the last time we did the home buying thing, and were really only able to thanks to the FHA loan program. I plan to do it right this time and we've got a 2 year head start, so I'm here to ask for some advice.  

* Husband's current salary: $45k  

* Combined salary in our current area, as of this fall: $85k

* In the new area, we'll be making a combined $90-100k, depending on whether my husband transfers laterally or is able to transfer via promotion. COL and home prices of the new area is 4% higher than our current one. 

* We currently own a home .There's $80k left on the mortgage, currently it appraises for $96k. We still need to do some updates and minor repairs before selling, about $10k worth. Once we're done, it should be worth about $130k (based on the current market and other homes in our area).  

* I understand that we'll probably end up paying two mortgages if we move directly from house to house, depending on the market. Will this mean we can't use any profit from the sale of the first house towards the down payment for the second house? Would renting for a few months in the second city be a better option, even if we've got pets?

* We have about $6500 of credit card debt, at 0% for another 12-15 months. We took this out to make home renovations, and we're making good progress on the payments. Obviously that goes first.  

* We've got a $12k auto loan, it's got another 46 months left at 3% interest. How important is it to pay that off vs saving up for a down payment?  

* How will student loans affect our qualification for a mortgage? We've got a combined $60k, all federal direct loans at an average of something like 4.6% interest. When we got our current mortgage 5 years ago, we only had $5k in student loans, so it wasn't a huge factor.  

What am I forgetting to consider? Which of our debts should we be working to pay off, which can we leave off and focus on saving up for a down payment/moving expenses? I'm open to any advice/resources, I'm a huge planner.",finance

I am 19, work around 30 hours. I have a 3.98 GPA. I want to be a doctor.

My parents make over 6 figures combined and basically cut me off financially other than my health, pharmacy, dental, and eye insurance.

Therefore, I still pay 250$ for car insurance (cause I am young. My town is a place where you actually cannot go anywhere withouta car. I tried uber before but paying a gas tank worth for uber is no longer an option).
200$ for car payment
Have been lounging with a friend to not have to worry about rent thus far.
Have to pay for food, doctor copays, anything school, gas, phone... you name it. Anything other than my medical insurances, I have to fight till the death.
I make around 1200$ per month after taxes on my paycheck.


I only have about 4500$ in scholarships annually and around 7500$ in loans for next semester. Therefore, in the year, I will have 12000$ funds that will go to my schooling that has a 9000$ per year tuition. I go to a cheap school because well, no funds to go to Columbia University (a place I was accepted at). There is a 3000$ refund that goes in my bank account per year.

--------

Here is what I am doing:

Because of my financial mess, I have opted to become a nurse first instead then a doctor so will be going to nursing school this August and plan to graduate in 2019 to have my degree and finally have a good paying job till I pay off loans and go back in this hellhole again.

------

However, for the next 2 years, I am absolutely fucking stuck.

During nursing school, it will be hard to work. I was planning on getting like a library job over the weekend so I can study while getting funds. Regardless, many pay like 8 bucks an hour can't pay all my bills all my finances at all.

I will have to move to the nursing school area and cannot leech off my friend anymore for housing. 
Rent costs around 1600-1800$ for a 2bed/2bath for anything within a 20 minute drive from the school. I plan to get a roommate so that will split the costs.

So, we are still looking at around 9600$ extra expenses per year not including utilities where I would guess around 11000$ per year total.

I have called my school's financial aid department and they were actually speechless on what I should do. Couldn't recommend anything for me to do and basically told me I may be out of luck.

I know people will be like ""take out a private loan!""

I have credit history and have had it for over 2 years since my parents kicked me to the curb. I have a 730 credit score however, I have applied for private loans and still apparently am seen as unstable and need a cosigner. 

My parents have told me they will NOT cosign a private student loan so therefore, the 7500$ in loans from federal student loans is all I have for the year. 

I have applied to a shit ton of scholarships this semester and am waiting for responses however, need more guidance than hoping for a scholarship acceptance email.


I do not want to give up my dreams of becoming a doctor just because I cannot pay for it. I am smart enough and determined and am looking for help.

TL;DR:
MONTHLY EXPENSES:
250: car insurance (live in a place where you cannot live without a car)
200: car payment
60: phone bill
NO CABLE, NO NETFLIX, NO NOTHING
800: Rent 
100: Utilities
100: Food (never eat out)
Total: 1510 monthly so $18120 annually.

Schooling costs around 9000$ a year.

So we are looking at around 27000$ a year that I have to pay.
I only get around 12000$ from financial aid and am looking for guidance on how to come up with the other 15000$.
I only have a savings of 4000$.

Any advice on what to do?

No point in coming here saying that college is not the only answer. Sure, people succeed doing that but I want to be a doctor. Also, my scholarships are on a consistent basis meaning i cannot quit school to work for a year or two then come back and expect to still have that 5k annually.

I am seeing offers from chase for cards that have 0% interest for 15 months and 15-26% after that. I could definitely pay off the balance by that time and would save the 12% interest on the amazon card those months.

To add one more hypothetical step, if step one works, after I transfer the amazon rewards card balance to the new chase card, I can transfer my amazon store card balance of $1000 to the amazon rewards card-&gt;chase card and /drumroll.... voila! I consolidated my debt and will pay it off with 0% interest AND as an added bonus retain my amazon points.

Am I as clever as I think I am or am I totally wrong?

Side question: Will this negatively or positively effect my credit rating in the situation where I pay off the 3k in say 12 months? I am in the low 700s updated as of today",finance

personalfinance,I am completely confused by the concept of pre-approved auto loans. Can someone please tell me if I'm mistaken here?,"I'm trying to get a pre-approved auto loan. I want to go to find a cat at a dealership, but I don't want the dealership to find a loan to me. (I had a really bad experience when I tried letting the dealership find an auto loan for me, and I don't want to repeat that.)

I was under the impression that when I'm approved for an auto loan, here is what would happen:

1. Go to the dealership and when they ask about finances, tell them I have a pre-approved loan for *x* amount
2. Find a vehicle to purchase
3. Contact the credit union or bank with all of the details of the car I want to purchase (VIN, year and model, mileage, etc.). Also provide proof of income (if I haven't already), insurance ID, etc.
4. They crunch the numbers and tell me the interest rate, term of the loan, and monthly payments
5. Finalize the loan with the credit union, provide all the loan info to the dealer at this point, sign documents, take car home

Are my assumptions above generally correct? Or am I wrong about the process here?

I currently have a pre-approved auto loan from a credit union, and I sent them an email asking them when I should go to the dealership. I don't want to go on a Sunday, for example, if I can't get in touch with my credit union on that day, because I'm anticipating that I'm going to need to talk to my credit union immediately after I've selected a vehicle.

After I emailed them, they replied back with something like: ""You can go whenever you like. There's no need for you to speak with someone here at the credit union. Just tell the dealer you're approved at this credit union and negotiate your deal. We don't get involved with that. Once you sign a contract, send me the contract and your insurance ID. It's very easy and fast from there.""

I am completely confused. Why wouldn't I speak to someone at the credit union? What was the point of getting pre-approved if the dealership is going to be the one talking to the credit union?

Is this normal and I'm just misunderstanding the concept of pre-approved auto loans? Or is something not right here?",finance

**VIEWPOINT:**

Nuclear regulation is unique: a Canadian perspective

The international nuclear regulatory community is unique among the world's regulatory communities. Through adherence to international conventions and standards, participation in international organisations, peer reviews and benchmarking activities, and continuous lessons learned from best practices, the international nuclear regulatory community is committed to collaboration and transparency in the interests of safety and security, writes Jason Cameron.

A key element in safeguarding the safety and security of the global nuclear industry is the presence in each nuclear country of a regulatory body that is free from undue influence and interference, and is able to make decisions or recommendations based on the best available scientific and technical information. National and international organisations agree that the fundamental objective of all nuclear safety regulatory bodies - the regulator's prime purpose - is to ensure that nuclear licensees conduct their activities and operate their facilities in a safe manner at all times.

In Canada, nuclear regulation is a federal responsibility, in recognition of the national significance of nuclear energy and materials, and is overseen by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), Canada's independent nuclear regulator. Unlike many other energy-related sectors in Canada in which decisions are a provincial or federal government responsibility, the environmental assessment and licensing decision-making authority for all nuclear facilities and activities rests with the CNSC. The CNSC has integrated and streamlined its approach to the environmental assessment and regulatory decision-making process to align with international standards and best practices in nuclear regulation.

Because she has already paid most of the interest off and is now primarily paying principal, is refinancing worth it at this point?

Sorry if there's not enough information.

Thanks.

Edit: If I would venture a guess, I would say she has about $30,000 left on the mortgage. She likely could afford a 15 year.",finance

* Property FMV: $180,000.00
* Mortgage Balance: $87,000.00
* Mortgage Type: 30 YR Fixed Rate
* Interest Rate: 4.25%

I have two accounts with X Student Loan Service for a total student debt amount of $184,000.00 currently. I just processed a principal payment of $8,700 towards knocking out the highest interest loan disbursement which was at 7.65%. I'm sure I will get a lot of comments about why it's so high and asking what I do; I've attended law school and I'm in the licensing process to become an Attorney. That being said, my one accounts of ""Direct Grad Plus"" loans has $84,000.00 of debt and is ranging from 7.65% to 6.59% with interest rates. 

My main reason why I was hesitant on attaching the student debt to the property was the fact that it wouldn't terminate upon my death. I will only attach it to the property if I can get life insurance to cover the payoff amount to safe guard my wife. We currently have around $22,000.00 in our savings account as an emergency fund. I'm a contracted consultant for a law firm on a very prominent case which can, but most likely won't, be discontinued at any time and my wife works two jobs both of which are very secure. We have a very minimal lifestyle, we only have the usual household utilities and our mortgage to pay on monthly; we've paid off our cars. 

We live in a rural mid-western portion of the USA if that matters. We purchased our home in 2014 for $145,000 and put $30,000 down when we purchased; the surrounding area has appreciated significantly. I don't want to make a poor decision with regard to the two biggest investments I've made in my life so far, any help is greatly appreciated. 

My questions are simple:

* Has anyone done this?
* Where would I go for life insurance? What should I consider? (28 years old; non-smoker; very light drinker)
* What would be a good rate for life insurance? 
* Should I consider doing 15 yr vs. 30 yr? 
* Rates are rising, what should I consider a favorable refi rate? 
* Is there anyway I can get away from closing costs?

I make around 70k a year and have approximately 1700 a month in fixed expenses (meaning I have about 1600 a month in discretionary income after a 6% TSP [think 401k] contribution and 125 in student loans). I have 1,300 in credit card debt after helping out my parents with unexpected costs related to a special needs sister, but have let them know that this is the only time I will take on debt for them. 

Thanks to personal finance, I was just able to liquidate my 6k emergency fund for the care of my sister (unexpected costs came up). So I am also entirely without a safety net at the moment.

My agency offers up to 10k a year in student loan repayments and I currently owe about 13k in federally subsidized student dept (average interest rate of 4.5%). The only thing - and this may be entirely a psychological consideration - is that it comes with a 3 year service commitment to take out that repayment option.

I am perfectly okay with my work, however it's not very stimulating and it's highly specialized. If I stay in my current position I should be making around 98k in three years, however I have recieved two offers this year for jobs paying between 80k and 90k. People in my position have left and within two years have been paid around 100k in the private sector. 

If you were in my situation what would you do? I am worried that I could be typecast and not be able to leave this field in 3 years, however my current job is very stable and it would be difficult to replace me. This is a huge benefit given the needs of my family.

The settlement is for ~68k. My lawyer's fee is 1/3 of the settlement so I'll have ~45k after paying him. I have ~10k in medical bills from the accident, currently have ~10k in student loans, ~3.5k of which is subsidized, and $400 in CC debt.

I'm a freshman in college and about to enter my sophomore year. I make a minimum of $400 a month with my tutoring job while I'm at university. 

I was wondering if this amount of money will disqualify me from continuing to get my loans from the government? All of my student loans are through FAFSA; Perkins Loan, Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized. What should I do with this much money? The most I've ever had at once was ~2k. I was planning on joining the military which would give me a scholarship so I shouldn't be taking out any more student loans moving forward and would help with paying off my existing loan.

I was planning on paying off my existing medical bills first in a lump sum leaving me with ~35k. I would really like to be able to make money with this money, but have no idea/experience how.

personalfinance,Refinance student loans twice?,"Hello all. I'm hoping for a little input as to whether I should refinance my student loans again.  

I refinanced/consolidated them with a private lender about a year and 3 months ago.  I just checked that lender's current interest rates, and they've gone down. They told me I can refinance again, if I want, which would reduce my interest rate by 1.3% but would (1) result in a hard inquiry on my credit report and (2) count as a ""new"" loan on my credit report (thus the older one would be closed). 

The average age of my accounts is already quite young, under 2 years, but my refinanced loan is not the oldest account on the report.  

I am paying extra on my loans each month, and if I continue with this same accelerated payment pace, the reduction in interest rate will save me just about $5,000. If I slow down with the payments, I'll pay more interest over the life of the loan (but savings on interest payments vis-a-vis what I pay now would be more substantial).

I'm not planning to buy a house or car anytime soon, so a relatively moderate ding to my credit in the short-term doesn't give me pause; I'm more concerned with any long-term impact, if any.

Any other pros or cons I should consider? Is $5,000 saved worth the hit to my credit report?",finance

personalfinance,College Decision/Student Loan Question,"I am currently a high school senior deciding between a few business schools to attend.  My options are the Moore School at University of South Carolina, the Kelley School at Indiana University, and the Stern School at NYU.  I would really love to attend Stern, as I am a finance major and feel the opportunities at Stern exceed those at my other options.  However, Stern is really expensive at $69,682 of direct expenses (tuition, fees, and room and board) and an estimated $4,772 of indirect expenses (books, transportation, etc).  

I received the following financial aid from Stern: $1,000/year scholarship, $3,000/year in potential federal work study, $3,500/year subsidized loan, $2,000/year unsubsidized loan, and the rest of the cost of attendance over my parent's contribution would be a Federal PLUS loan.  

My parents are willing to contribute around $40k a year, meaning deducting the scholarship and not considering the work study as that is not definite, I would have to take out loans of approximately $30k a year, not considering indirect expenses, which my parents would be willing to cover.  Therefore, I would have about $120k of student loans ($3.5k of which would be subsidized) coming out of college.  Kelley's direct costs are around $48k, meaning I would only have $8,000/year, so about $32,000 in student loans if I attended.  I received a significant scholarship at South Carolina, so the cost of attendance would only be $14,000 a year, which my parents would cover completely.

I'm really conflicted whether $120,000 in student loans is worth the education at Stern.  I know if I want to have any shot at Wall Street, I should go to Stern over Kelley or Moore, but it is a lot of debt to take on before I even start working.

personalfinance,"Paid OC for medical bills sent to collections within 30 days of them sending it last year, but the collections agency reported it on my credit report within the last month. Am I headed in the right direction to get this resolved?","I received a letter in October of 2016 from a collections agency telling me I owe a hospital money for an overdue bill. I immediately sent the agency a debt validation letter via certified mail. I was unaware of the bills, so I contacted the hospital(OC) and asked them why they sent my bill to collections without notice. It ended up with them telling me if I pay it in full right then, they will take the debt back form the collection agency and that will be the end of it. I paid right there and was told they would contact the agency to end the debt collection. I believe I followed up with the hospital as well, but I cannot remember.

I checked my Credit Karma on 4/4/17 and I see two accounts on my report in collections. 

Account #1 is for $81. It was opened on 10/21/16 and last reported on 3/2/17.

Account #2 is for $89. It was opened on 10/21/16 and last reported on 3/2/17.

I just got off the phone with the hospital and they had to do some digging in their purged bills. They came up with the following:

Bills

 1. $81 sent to collections on 10/11 and taken back on 10/18.

 2. $28.19 sent to collections on 10/11 and taken back on 10/18.

 3. $48.52 sent to collections on 10/11 and taken back on 10/18.

 4. $22.59 sent to collections on 10/11 and taken back on 10/18.

 5. $20.34 sent on 9/9 and taken back on 9/27.

 6. $14.44 sent on 10/11 and taken back on 10/18.

Bill 1 makes sense, but I am going to call back to see why the rest does not add up. I was in a hurry.

I read at the side bar and want to make sure what to do next. The hospital is sending me an updated copy of what I owed, paid, and when I paid it showing that the debt should have been removed from the collections agency and never even showed on my credit report. 

I will dispute/appeal the errors on my report through Credit Karma (it takes me to the credit bureau website to dispute) according to the Wiki. 
From the Wiki ""Part of the FCRA is that you have a legal right to dispute incorrect information on your reports, and if the information contained in it is incorrect, you have the right to request it be removed. The FCRA also states that the CRAs are required to fix any incorrect information or face legal action. In many cases, the CRAs are understaffed and move like molasses. Hiring a lawyer may be the best option, plus if you can prove you suffered damages, you can sue."" 

Am I missing anything? Should I send a copy of the bills and receipts to the collections agency showing I paid the hospital before the 30 days? The only contact I have had with the collections agency is the debt letter they sent me and the one certified debt validation letter I sent to them. 

I need to buy a car ASAP since my current one broke down. I was planning on buying a car within the next couple of days since I need to finance a portion of it, but I was not expecting this at all.

personalfinance,401k loan to pay credit card debt (Redux),"Hi everyone,

Here's my situation. I am 41, have a *very* secure job (been there for 13.5 years). I decided this year I'm killing my credit card debt. I've been using the snowball method, and in the first 3 months of the year I've paid down $2,200 on a total credit card debt of $24,500. 

Long story short, my highest balance on a single card is $6,000, and it is also my highest interest rate (23%). I am thinking of taking a 401k loan to pay it, and then repaying the loan over 36 months. It's funny how it works: right now, my minimum payment on that card is ca. $170. If I take out the 401k loan payable over 36 months, it will be ca. $170.

The way I see it is, I'm paying $170 a month on that card anyway, but I'm paying 23% interest. If I take out the loan for 36 months, I'll be paying the same $170, but now I'll be paying *myself* 4.5% interest. So I see this is a net positive cash-flow-wise, not to mention credit-wise. (The other possible upside is that once I pay that card off, they may give me a balance transfer offer, which would allow me to transfer some of my other credit card debt to that card interest-free, saving me even more).

Of course this is all contingent on me not running that credit card up again. Believe me, I've learned that lesson. Given the above, do you folks think it would be a wise decision? I see it basically as a rocket-powered kickstart to my snowball method. Plus, if things go well I can then pay off the 401k loan early.

Anyway, would you guys recommend the 401k loan, or just stick to the debt snowball?

She has $55,000 in debt, but is eligible for PSLF, so we have agreed that aggressively paying down her debt is not necessary (120 payments and the rest of her debt is forgiven. No. Brainer). I have $11,000 in federal subsidized school loans at 4.5%. She started working last year and together we have been able to save $50,000 to date and that amount continues to increase. We are both very good with money, have never carried a balance on any credit cards, and we own both of our vehicles.

I'm looking for advice because we are moving to a new city where we both have jobs lined up and are looking at buying a house. We will have a combined income of $80,000. Because I am a veteran I qualify for a VA loan, which means no down payment is necessary, so we don't HAVE to touch our savings to buy a house (other than up front costs). 

Essentially my question is: Should I pay off my $11,000 debt immediately because I have the money to do it? Should I invest that money (WealthBar, WealthSimple, etc.) and pay off the loan slowly, hoping that investing the $11,000 will give me better returns than paying off the loan long-term at 4.5%? Because of the VA loan and my wife's PSLF, we are in a unique position of not needing to pay off her debt quickly and not needing to put a down payment on a house when we purchase one. 

Also, should I put a down payment down on the house, regardless of the fact that I don't need to? Is there any benefit other than lower monthly mortgage payments?

TL;DR: I have $50,000 in savings, $10,000 in debt at 4.5%, looking to buy a house, but don't need to place a down payment because of VA loan qualification. Should I invest? Pay off the $11,000 immediately? Use the savings as a down payment, regardless of not needing one? Or??

personalfinance,1.5 year safe investment ideas? (US),"So I need a place to store my money for 1.5 years I'll be here working my job. 

Rather than going in with the mindset that I'll be investing, I would prefer to go in with mindset that I'm saving money and trying to earn interest over time, because I'm making a big leap in career / life soon and I'll need that money not go away in a market crash or something. This is why I would rather avoid common stocks in general (although I do like conservative funds)

Now - that being said, I don't like the idea of savings account or CD. The 0.5~1.5% interest rate return seems too low for my tastes, even if they are safe. I was looking into mutual funds and I decided to acquire index funds. But do they require active management / monitoring? Is it suitable for someone like me who will need their money in 1.5~ 2 years? 

Would you guys recommend me a conservative active mutual fund or index funds? 

I'm just looking for a low % return, like 5% but in a fairly safe environment.",finance

personalfinance,"UPDATE 2: $170K in student loan debt. I‚Äôm not a doctor, lawyer, or dentist. Given my situation, how am I doing financially?","Hello r/personalfinance!  
       
TLDR: In the last year, the balance on my highest interest student loan (Chase Student Loan B) went from $36,777 to $9,742. With help from my husband and parents we‚Äôve paid off around $26,835. 

My story is below for those of you interested in reading‚Ä¶  

Dropping in to share the latest update on my quest to be *private* student loan debt free. For detailed background information: 
[Update 1 (2016)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gzsk0/exciting_update_eeek_170k_in_student_loan_debt_im/)  
 
[Original Post (2015)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/301lwy/170k_in_student_loan_debt_im_not_a_doctor_lawyer/)  
 
To give a quick recap of the last two years:  
 
My husband (yes, we got married-- there‚Äôs your first update!) and I collectively make just under $90k have made a decision to substantially pay down my loans. He has zero debt. Last year we decided to move in with his parents (rent free) and use the majority of our combined income to pay off my private loans (roughly $75k) using the avalanche method. I have federal loans too (about $85k), but I am on IBR and PSLF. Providing PSLF continues through the next few presidential administrations (God willing), those loans should be forgiven in 2023, tax free. This post only concerns my private loans.  

My budget has pretty much stayed the same over the last two years since I originally posted. I was, however, diagnosed with an early stage of cancer. So, I do have some outstanding medical bills as a result of surgery and follow-up appointments. Thankfully, I am cancer free today, but nonetheless, cancer is not cheap. My bills amount to about $100/month. I have also added my husband to my insurance plan and updated our plan to minimize our deductible and add money to a Flexible Spending Account (FSA). As such, my take home pay is less. I do have about $600 on a 0% interest credit card that I‚Äôm working to pay off too. 
 
Here‚Äôs where my private loans stand today. **The major update comes from Chase Student Loan B:**  

* Chase Student Loan B: In 2015 it was $36,577.92 at 8.25%. And my monthly payment was $345. Since then, I‚Äôve paid off a different private student loan (Navient) and rolled that payment to this loan payment and have been paying $600 a month. Additionally, my husband pays $1000/month (total $1600/month). My parents gave us a monetary gift in lieu of a wedding (which jump started paying this down). Thus, I applied that gift of $10k to this loan. As a result, today‚Äôs balance is $9,742. **BOOM-SHAKA-LAKA!** 

* Chase Student Loan A): $9,733.32 at 5.73%. Monthly payment of $81
* Aspire Student Loan A): $17,009 at 3.76%. Monthly payment $122
* Aspire Student Loan B): $2882.58 at 5.26%. Monthly payment $24
* Aspire Student Loan C): $8,064.25 at 5.26%. Monthly payment $65  
The interest rate on these guys are slowly increasing--not cool...and not surprising.  

Chase Student Loan B is projected to be paid off by September this year. The plan is to roll that $1600 monthly payment to Chase Student Loan A and have that paid off by Spring 2018. Then, my husband will stop contributing and I'll put the $680 payment from Chase A and B towards the Aspire Loan series. 
  
The last year has been a challenge for sure, but we're doing it! My husband is the shit and I love him dearly for taking on this endeavor.",finance
Forex,Predictions are becoming easier... (post for the newbies),"So as you might see from my history of post I have been struggling with the forex. Whether that be executing a trade, following my strategy to a T, or just making the right market predictions. Well today was the day I was able to show myself I can make the right predictions, execute the trade, and be able to explain to myself and other why I took it. Here is it how it went: 

1. Saw trendline for USD/JPY about to touch again and seemed extremely unlikely to break
2. RSI was still high so all predicted it to crash down. 
3. at about 15-5 mins before the FOMC took place saw a pin bar
4. Executed a sell on the pair and took profits about 40 pips down (could have held but I take what I can no sense in being greedy)

So for all you new peeps out their starting to research the forex and thinking you can easily get rich quick if you just learn it. I have been studying the Forex since September and it is now April... I just predicted and was able to tell what the market was going to do, how the IT could fake it out ( which I was also able to predict :)) and being confident enough to stay in it, and then  only earning 40 pips for 6 months of work. So what should this experience should tell you: 
The market is kinda of like a sport (Football reference). You start out at age 5 and play flag football. Then you go from that to pads. Next comes working out everyday and practicing your skills just to start for the Varsity Team. If you are good and lucky enough you will be put on a College Team and be trained all year long and to the point where you might die. Lastly if you are one of the lucky few who makes it to the NFL and get paid the big bucks you will be working non-stop. You are always studying, practicing, reviewing your mistakes (thank the lord I am done with film on Saturday), making corrections and constantly adapting and learning to your environment. 

This is not something easily learned. Hell I am an idiot compared to the guys who have been doing this for only 2 years. But as long as you stick with it and dedicate your time and energy you will learn it. It is not impossible I know it may feel like it is impossible to be able to predict this thing that anyone in the world can change but it simply is predictable. Have fun with the experience of learning the market. It is like a ride on a rollercoaster but only you determine when you are off of the ride.

personalfinance,Optimal way to help out a friend with high-interest debt,"Long story short ‚Äì me and a group of friends want to help out a mutual friend who has around 3500 ‚Ç¨ of debt in high-interest loans (payday loans? That's what Google Translate gives), with some payments (around 1700 ‚Ç¨ now) going to distraint next.

The debt is due to both bad luck and bad decisions: taking high-interest loans with the idea that he'll pay them off with salary from work, and then his employer not giving him hours and finally letting him go altogether. He's currently on unemployment benefit and living with his parents, so he's not facing total poverty/hunger/the streets (social safety nets in Finland are quite nice), but we'd like to help him out so he doesn't lose his... Credit score? Or whatever the English word is for ""I didn't pay my debts and now I should be considered a liability for the next n years"".

He's talking with a professional therapist (we're gifting the fees to him), so things are going forward, but the debt situation is acute. We mulled over few options, and the best one we reached was to get a bank loan with a regular interest rate, guaranteed by our group of friends, and pay off the high interest rate debts with that.

Any other ideas or things we should note?",finance
personalfinance,Feasibility of purchasing a 30k car,"So I am about to graduate and really want to get a car for adventuring. I am pretty active and outdoorsy so the 2 which I am looking at right now are the Honda CRV and Subaru Forester.  They seem to have gotten pretty high reviews everywhere I have read about them (US News, Consumer reports, KBB). I want something a little bigger in order to drag gear and friends around which is why I am looking at crossovers and small SUVs. I need an automatic and have a strong preference for including advanced safety features (eyesight for Subaru and sensing for the Honda). With these perks both cars come out to about 30k new including taxes. I am planning on buying whichever model I can get a better deal on. From reading car buying info on this sub and elsewhere I think I could possibly negotiate that down 1-2k but I don't think that is a huge factor right now. Insurance on the car is going to be pretty killer (3k a year even though I have never been in an accident) but I figure that it is pretty necessary.

In terms of my financial situation I think I am fairly stable. I signed an offer for ~100k base with ~20k yearly bonuses and have fairly significant (100k+) savings which I think I am going to draw from to buy this car. I will be living in a decently large west coast city so I expect expenses there to be fairly high. I don't really have any credit so my bank offered me a pretty crummy interest rate and my parents have strongly advised that I don't get loans. I can afford to pay cash for the vehicle, but I am very hesitant to pull the trigger because this is the first really big purchase I have ever made. Is this really doable? Am I missing anything major?

personalfinance,How is the proper way to value or look at a bond fund.,"I get how a single bond works.  You buy the bond, hold it to maturity.  The company pays you quarterly\semi-annually interest payments of x% and the entire principal when the bond matures.  Your risks are:

* Credit Risk - The company COULD default but a big reputable company with AAA rated bonds is LIKELY not going anywhere.
* Opportunity Cost - If you hold a bond that pays 4% and rates are at 10% you are ""losing"".  You COULD sell your bond at a loss and buy something else.  You don't have to though and don't lose any real money besides the opportunity.  You still get your 4% + coupon.

Point 2 seems to be mitigated if you simply just hold the bond to maturity.  You get your 4% for 15 years, it's safe, and you are happy with it.  If you don't sell the price doesn't matter.  Is it even in your best interest to sell your current bond and buy another one at the ""new"" 10% rate?

With a bond fund it's just like a stock.  It goes up and it goes down.  As interest rate rise the fund drops.  I assume the price isn't all that's baked into it as the underlying asset is... well bonds.. and these things pay quarterly\semi-annual interest payments that can be reinvested.

With that being said, how do you value these things?  With a single equity you just care about price.  With a single bond you just (for the most part) care about credit risk.  With a bond fund, there's both price and interest.  For example.

Let's say you bought a long term bond fund at $100 that pays an average of 4% per year.  Ten years later you sell it at $80.  The bond fund dropped 20% in value BUT you made 4% per year for 10 years.  Did you win?  Or would the numbers never work like this in reality?

Also I would assume as the bond fund prices drop the interest paymenrs get higher since newer bonds that are brought into the fund do so at a higher interest rate (the fund is buying new bonds at the market rate which pay higher interest and thus raising the ""average interest paid"" over all the bonds).  Does it all ""even out"" as in the drop in price is perfectly offset by the rise in rates so it means nothing.

TLDR: What metric do you look at with a bond fund?  How do you think about them and value them?",finance

Any experience with using a personal loan with a slightly higher interest rate that is not ""interest top-heavy"" to pay for a home?

So, I may not be free from work, but I now have freedom of what I do for work. I could happily live the rest of my life, taking jobs that I find meaningful as long as they cover the expenses of my current lifestyle, and still retire at 65. 

My goal in life isn't super-early retirement after another decade of hard work. Instead, I'm now working to fund a ""mini-retirement"" of a year or two. I'll do what I want for a while, and probably make a little bit of money doing something I enjoy. Then I expect to return to the grind for a few years.

personalfinance,Close to $50k in the hole. What's the best way to deal with my debts? (US),"So I've finally come to my senses (way too late) and realized I need to get out of my debt situation. I've been able to keep everything in balance enough to get by but I just ran my credit and seeing everything all in one place really hit me hard.

I make $100K/year, have about $50K in my company sponsored 401K, and close to $50K in debt. I never really had a substantial savings and since I had my 401K auto contributing I never thought about saving money. I grew up in a poor family and had to go out on my own early. I didn't make 100K my whole life so most of this debt was accrued in the early days of my career. I know it's not a valid excuse but once I started to make decent money I really got out of control.

About 38K is in credit cards - APRs ranging from 12-25% 

Rest is in a student loan @ 4%

I just want some perspectives on how I should manage my financial situation. I am so stupid for getting into this situation and I'm willing to put in the work. The fact that I have $50K in my 401k amazes me and at the same time kills me to see these two figures next to each other.

Some things I've considered based on what I've read here and research in general:

* loan against my 401k - I can get up to 25,000 @ 6% between 12-60 months - full balance come due if I leave the company or I get fired/laid off
* cash out my 401k - I don't even know how to do this or if I can with my plan - also I know there is a huge penalty to do this - I'm in my late 20's so I'm not looking to retire anytime soon
* consolidation loan - I've tried a couple times but my utilization was too high and score too low to qualify
* just pay off everything diligently - After taxes and health insurance I take home around $6,000/month, I can get by on $2500 for all my living expenses. I live in a high cost area so 100K doesn't feel like a lot.
* bankruptcy sounds too drastic especially since I have a steady income

For starters I have canceled all extra curricular expenses and reduced it down to the basics. Haven't gone out to lunch, no fancy dinners, sold as much as I could. I'm also in the process of finding a place with lower rent. I also stopped contributing to the 401K and have put all of that into paying cards off.

I've already laid out all my accounts, balances, and interest rates so I have a schedule of what I want to tackle first. However I feel like there might be a better way. Is paying down the cards directly an efficient and practical way to approach this? It just feels like a huge mountain. Should I be using any financial tool like the 401K loan?

I feel like there is something I can do to leverage my 401K. It feels so wrong that I contributed to it while I allowed myself to get into so much debt. 

I'm just so stressed out about this now that I've slapped myself into reality. I feel like I just need some advice/guidance to calm myself down and focus on a plan. Maybe I just need a pep talk but all I can do is focus on this right now.",finance

I am graduating in May with a double major in Health Sciences and Psychology. I intended to go to grad school for Social Work but so far all the schools that have accepted me are not offering funding so I don't think a masters is in the cards for me this year unless I want to pay ~8k a year for two years. 

I am looking into a variety of healthcare jobs currently but have no specific job offer lined up so I'm unsure what my future income will be. I work an on-campus job now for ~$11, but will no longer be employed after graduation.

My student loans total $41.1k. I have 12 loans and they are all federal. The interests ranging from 3.76%-6.86% (only one is 6.86%, most around around 4.66%). Should I consolidate these?
What plan should I use? The standard plan says my monthly payments (beginning in November of this year) will be $423 a month. 

When I graduate I will have ~5.5k saved in the bank. 

I am fortunate enough to be able to live home rent free for the next few years, but is this a good choice? I don't mind living at home, but it seems whenever someone over age 20 lives at home everyone questions it/belittles it and I'm not sure if I should give in to the social pressure of living alone/with roommates.

I have no car, so I know I will need to budget that in eventually.  My only fixed expenses directly after graduating will be food, which I now allot ~$30 a week to. I would also like to start seeing a therapist, so I'm estimating that will be ~$70 a session, but I guess if I had to cut out this expense I could.

Where do I go from here? What should I do to be in the best financial situation here on out? I feel like I know very little about finances and want to set myself up as best I can for the future.",finance

#Summary:
* I have $60,000 of scary-high-interest-rate (6%-10%) student loan debt. Currently, this is $800 per month in loans.
 * I have used 2 years of forebearance, which increased the interest.
 * I have been paying the loan for 5 years, though even in 7 years, the balance has not gone down. I have paid a total of $35,000  in 7 years, and the balance has not changed.
 * Some of my loans have a graduated plan, so they are likely to get worse over time (even more than $800/mo).
* I have $40,000  of medical debt from a surprise surgery, which at that time, I did not have insurance for.
 * This debt I could not pay for, and it has been in collections for some time.
* I have a car paid off.
* I have about $14,000 to my name in the bank
* I make $22/hr with steady hours
* I am considering re-financing my student loans, though my credit is bad enough where I don't think that will make an improvement.
* I am considering Bankruptcy to either dismiss all the medical debt (Chapter 7), or consolidate my loans with 0% interest (Chapter 13).


#In-depth:
Given the above information, I have no idea what to do. It seems like 35,000 dollars has gone nowhere, as the balance of my student loan has not changed. I know some fraction of those monthly payments go to interest, but I don't know if I'm even making a dent in it.

[This image of a GoogleDoc Sheet](http://imgur.com/a/9vC5v) shows my full transaction history. It seems 35,000 has just vanished. On **line 97**, you can even see I threw $5,000 out of pocket at the loan in an attempt to make progress. But it seems even that wasn't enough.

Here is my total [list of loans](http://imgur.com/a/UzB7I) and their interest rates.

* The first image shows all my loans.
* The second and third image shows more details on two example loans. As you can see, **even after 7 years, the balance is higher than the original disbursment amount**. WTF man.

#Conclusion:

I could scrape by and pay the minimum on these student loans, but I still have my medical debt. And even then, the interest rates and loan amount seems so high, that it would cripple me for decades.

Would student loan refinancing even help me?

Is bankruptcy worth it? My credit is already trash, and a Chapter 7 would instantly relieve the medical debt, and a chapter 13 would consolidate the student loan debt to 0% interest rate.",finance

personalfinance,"Just held my employer hostage, should I worry? Look for new job?","So I'm just looking for advice on what I should do. Or if I should fear my employer now.

Background: I work for a state government agency and have been on the job for about 3 years. I was recently offered a promotion. 

At first, I was moderately happy as the standard raise I could expect would help since I'm closing on a house soon. The same day I was offered the promotion I was emailed a chart of our whole department and what they're paying everyone. (Its public knowledge and is published every year.)

I realized that the new people I've been training in and basically baby sitting are starting out 10-20% higher than my current earnings and would still be making more than me after the standard raise for a promotion. (Were a union it's all fixed, so they say..)). 

I won't lie, I had a knee jerk reaction. I told my boss I no longer accepted the promotion and that if they're willing to pay more, then they should start gathering resumes. Then I called in sick the next day. I checked the email the next day and my supervisor told me they would 'try to get me double the raise' basically. So I was somewhat appeased (still no really happy) and agreed to take on a senior position and pick up crappier work. 

Was this a bad move? Our department is struggling to retain people (because of pay), and I am On the short list of people who actually knows what they're doing and can be relied on. The reason for such a pay discrepancy is one of the newbies passed the CPA and one has an MBA, and they both have prior experience in the field we work in. I just have a bachelors and started fresh out of college. So I understand starting lower, but among other things I told my bosses was that I consider my current and proposed salary a giant slap in the face. Should I be this upset? These new people who make more than me have no clue what they're doing and there's a reason I get sent our more difficult projects that they don't even send their most senior staff on(partly because we're understaffed and lacking experience because everyone keeps leaving. Also because some can't handle it). I actually do enjoy the job and don't really want to leave, but I don't like being cheated and I will leave out of spite if this doesn't change. They will be scrambling without me and other people might  leave too if I do because they won't be able to keep up. Did I overplay my leverage here? My boss tried telling me at first they couldn't do anything about it, but I know that's not true, because they adjusted someone I'm good friends with here who was basically in an identical situation. 

I keep reading the best raise is from swapping employers, should I be looking? Should I be afraid they'll be after me now? Part of the problem is gov funding and budget, but it still doesn't explain why they're unwilling to pay me more than someone I'm training every other day. Did I mention I was one of two people to receive a performance award a couple weeks ago? Apparently this is how they treat their best employees.. and I refuse to be used like that. I'm not the only one being screwed either, it's all public knowledge, but so far I think I'm the only person to say anything... (other people are getting the shaft more than me even)",finance
gaming,Mega Guide - How to Choose the Right Nintendo Switch Accessories,"**INTRO**

So while researching what accessories I wanted for my own Switch I decided to put together a buyers guide. Long story short it turned into a BEAST of an article. I just wanted to share it with you guys so hopefully you could learn something and maybe provide me with a bit of feedback on it as well.

I go over not just what I recommend but what you should look for in each product. I also have a short overview of the Switch system in the introduction for those unfamiliar with it (propably none of you here). Most of the recommendations come from this sub, Amazon reviews, various other testers and through personal experience. I really just did the legwork of crunching all the data. If you want to check out the nicely formatted version with pictures and working links you can find it at the below link, otherwise happy reading!

[The Nicely Formatted Version](http://nintendoswitchaccessory.com/best-nintendo-switch-accessories-buyers-guide/)


**Nintendo Switch Accessories Buyers Guide**

If your looking for a comprehensive buyers guide for all things Nintendo Switch related you‚Äôve come to the right place. From start to finish we‚Äôll cover the in‚Äôs and out‚Äôs of the Nintendo Switch, necessary accessories, reviews, tips, guides, technical specifications and more. We will be continually updating this article as new products are released to ensure it is up-to-date with the latest in Nintendo Switch accessories. So without further ado, lets take a look at the Nintendo Switch

**What is the Nintendo Switch?**

The Nintendo Switch the newest hybrid console on the market designed by Nintendo. It has the unique ability to ‚Äúswitch‚Äù  from displaying on a TV in docked mode, to being fully portable in an instant. When in handheld mode the Nintendo Switch makes use of its incredibly sharp 6.2 inch 1280 x 720 touchscreen to display jaw-dropping graphics for such a compact machine. Even more stunning is when the unit is placed in its docking station, the Switch can output stunning 1080p content which looks amazing on larger screens. This seamless transition is made possible by the included set of wireless Joy-Cons (controllers) which will be discussed in the next section.

These incredible graphics are all thanks to the integrated Nvidia GM20B GPU, which provides a lot of power in a small package. The Nintendo Switch has 4 GB of built in RAM allowing for quick processing and caching of game data. It also comes standard with 32 GB of internal storage space on a blazing fast internal SDcard making for extremely quick load times for digital games. For a machine with console quality graphic you would expect the Nintendo Switch to have terrible battery life but with the internal battery the Switch can have anywhere from 2.5-6 hours of game play out of a single charge. This sort of power goes a long way in affirming our belief that the Switch will be the next generation console leader. If you haven‚Äôt already pick up a Nintendo Switch prior to reading this review, now is a good time to get yours on order as they have been extremely hard to find in both stores and online.

**What are Joy-Cons?**

The Nintendo Switch ships with a set of two Joy-Cons (controllers). These revolutionary little devices are totally wireless and can be used in three distinct modes depending on your preference and game of choice. In their first mode they are attached to the Nintendo Switch itself. They slid down the sides of the device and snap in with a very satisfying *click*. Once in place they are extremely secure and an all metal rail design will help them stand the test of time and the rigors of everyday use. This configuration would be the most typical for handheld gaming on the go. 

The second configuration utilizes the Joy-Con Grip that comes included with the Nintendo Switch. The Joy-Cons slid into the grip just as they do on the Switch itself. Once attached indicator lights on the Joy-Con Grip will turn green showing you the controllers have been connected. With the controllers in this mode the Switch can be propped up using its internal kickstand and played using the Joy-Cons as a typical console controller or the Nintendo Switch can be docked and displayed on the TV. The wireless capabilities and engineering behind the Joy-Cons shine though in moments like this because they just work, no fooling around with wires, or pairing controllers, just press the L and R buttons and the controller syncs up instantly.

The third and final configuration has the controllers used independently of each other. Yes that‚Äôs right, each of the individual Joy-Con can be used as a totally separate controller, meaning you‚Äôll have the ability to play multiplayer games such as Snipperclips, right out of the box. Such versatility is unheard of in any other system to date. The geniuses at Nintendo have certainly come up with a stellar design that is fun to use, ergonomic and built to last.

If your planning on having more than two people play multi-player games on the Switch or just want the added versatility, and extra pair of Joy-Cons would be a great Nintendo Switch accessory to purchase. More experienced gamers or those who just want the best possible traditional controller should consider picking up the Pro Controller instead.

**The benefits of a Pro Controller**

So perhaps your a bit more competitive than your average gamer, or maybe you just like the feel of a more traditional console controller. In either case you should really consider getting a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. We‚Äôve actually written an entire article on the subject but we‚Äôll give a detailed overview here.

Starting with the overall design the Pro Controller is perfectly shaped to reduce joint stress and allow for easy thumb access to the right analog stick. We bring up the analog stick because its position on the Joy-Con is a bit uncomfortable to reach, especially for those with larger hands. The buttons are very responsive and have just the right amount of clickiness you‚Äôd expect from a premium product. Each of the palm grips are coated in an anti-slip rubberized coating which feels great in the hand and hold up well over long gaming sessions. We are also a huge fan of the semi-transparent design, it looks sleek, modern and has a an overall great Nintendo-esque feel.

Technology wise, the Pro Controller is packed to the gills with the latest in Nintendo tech. One of the more awesome features is the integrated HD Rumble technology. At its heart HD Rumble is a series of micro motors capable of imparting sensory information to very percise locations on the controller. A good example would be the feeling of multiple marbles rolling around INSIDE the controller at different speeds. It truly has to be experience in person and in implemented very well in both the Joy-Cons and Pro Controller. The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller also has built-in amiibo functionality so you can scan all your awesome Nintendo creatures and reap the in-game rewards. If you not sure what an amiibo is, we‚Äôll explain it in a later section. Even with all the technology built into this wireless controller, the one thing people really need is battery life, and let me tell you, the Pro Controller has it in abundance. Base on extensive testing you can easily get over 40 hours of playtime on a single charge with this controller. Comparing that to the stock Joy-Cons which max out at 20 hours of game time you can see why the Pro Controller really does live up to its name.

Now as with all great things there has as to be some disadvantage and that is true even with the Pro Controller. Unlike the Joy-Cons the Pro Controller cannot separate into two smaller dedicated controller units. This means if your looking for maximum multi-player compatibility it might be worth while to instead pick up a second pair of Joy-Cons instead.

Overall the Pro Controller is an incredible Nintendo Switch Accessory and one of the best you can currently buy. If your looking to up your game, keep you hands a bit more comfortable or just want give a Switch owner the perfect gift, look no further.

**You need a Screen Protector**

The title of this section says it all, you NEED a screen protector. While the Nintendo Switch‚Äôs screen may be beautiful to look at, on the surface it is only made of durable plastic. The screen was designed to not shatter on impact, which is a handy feature to have. However with added flexibility there is always a trade off for hardness. As such, the Nintendo Switch‚Äôs screen is VERY easy to scratch whether in docked mode, in a carrying case or just laying on the couch where you might accidentally sit on it. Lets take a look at the first accessory you should buy for your Nintendo Switch.

Modern screen protectors use one of two materials, either tempered glass or a plastic film. Here a Nintendo Switch Accessory we 100% recommend that you use the tempered glass option. It is far more scratch resistant than the plastic film variety and much easier to apply. Plus various types of coatings can be applied to it making the tempered glass screen protectors, water, fingerprint and skin oil resistant. New designs even allow for a liquid free installation that doesn‚Äôt require squeegees to apply.

Based on our reviews of the Best Nintendo Switch Screen Protectors if you want a a great choice that is loaded with features we‚Äôd recommend you grab the amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector.

At only .3mm thin it will melt right into your Nintendo Switch‚Äôs screen and provides no touchscreen interference giving you an optimal experience for both docked and portable play. Being made of tempered glass as we explained above gives it a clear advantage with scratch resistance compared to film based protectors. Additionally it is covered with a oleophobic (resistant to oil) coating can easily keep fingerprints at bay. As it is a premium screen protector it comes with a full application kit so you won‚Äôt need to hunt down a credit card and soap. It also includes a spare screen protector in case any wild dust bits get under the screen during the critical installation moments. Overall this is a great screen protector and one of the best Nintendo Switch Accessories you can buy. Currently it is protecting tens of thousands of Nintendo Switch‚Äôs without issue. If you want to check out some other options you can read the [full review and comparisons](http://nintendoswitchaccessory.com/screen-protectors/best-nintendo-switch-screen-protector/) over on our blog.

**Want to increase your Nintendo Switch‚Äôs battery life? Get a Portable Charger**

The Nintendo Switch has a stellar built in battery that can last for hours, even playing intense games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However even the strongest of batteries will eventually run out during long road trips or an extremely boring day at school or office. Based on our testing we‚Äôve found that the Nintendo Switch can last anywhere from 2.5-6 hours depending on how graphically intense of a game your playing. This is right in line with what Nintendo claimed the battery life would be. That‚Äôs why another key Nintendo Switch Accessory  you should pick up is a powerful portable charger that is capable of charging the Nintendo Switch while playing. Let take a look at what makes for the best Nintendo Switch portable charger.

The first and most important factor you should look for when buying a power bank for your Nintendo Switch is the battery capacity. As a reference the Switch itself have a battery capacity of 4,310mAh, which is quite large compared to most phones and smaller portable devices. You‚Äôll want to buy a portable charger that can fully charge your Nintendo Switch multiple times without  needed to be charged itself. We‚Äôd recommend a battery size of at least 20,000mAh as a minimum when looking for the right power bank.

The second item you should keep in mind is the power output of the available USB ports on the portable charger. The ideal power values your looking for at at least 2A (amps) / 5V (volts) output, and that should be per port not for the charger as a whole. Some will tell you 3.5A / 5V output but that power might be split between the two ports leaving you with less than 2A available to charge your Switch.  There is also a new technology out there for USB C cables known as PD, or power distribution. This allows the charger to charge devices and get charged significantly faster than traditional power bank as it uses 15V and upwards of 3A of power. Our recommendation below uses the newest PD USB specification for maximum charge speed. Keep in mind that in order to get the desired output you need a USB cable that is capable of transferring it and the typically the PD specification makes the batter bank a bit more expensive.  We‚Äôd recommend picking up the Anker PowerLine+, it is an very well built USB cable that can handle the required power transfer and will last a lifetime.

A few other items should be taken into consideration as well, the number of available USB ports and the overall size of the unit. You want at least two ports available on the power bank to ensure you can charge multiple devices at the same time. You‚Äôll also want the power bank to be small enough that it is easily carried around. After all it is supposed to be a PORTABLE charger.

**Our portable charger recommendation ‚Äì RavPower 26800MaH Power Bank (PD USB)**

So we just told you everything you need to go out and buy the perfect Nintendo Switch portable charger. If you want you can go ahead and take a look at some of the Best Ninendo Switch Portable Chargers we have reviewed or just read below for our top choice.

If your looking for the best Nintendo Switch portable charger it is by far RAVPower 26,800mAh Power Bank. This 26,8000mAh power bank has significant battery capacity and is very lightweight giving it a great portability factor. As with most chargers the larger the battery size the bigger the physical dimensions of the unit are, coming at at just 6.81‚Ä≥ long and 3.19‚Ä≥ wide this charger has a modest footprint, but should still be able to fit into larger pockets for when your on the go. As with the Anker offering the four indicator lights on the top make it easy to quickly see how much juice your portable charger has left.
In terms of Nintendo Switch performance, we hooked it up while playing The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. During our tests we found it would charge 22% of the Switch‚Äôs battery every  hour while gaming. Not bad for something that only weighs 13.44 oz. When the Nintendo Switch is in sleep mode the RAVPower Portable Charger is able to charge the switch from 0%-100% in a little under two hours. So, you  will even exceed the rapid charging of the Anker PowerCore+ 20100, plus you‚Äôll be able to get a little more playtime overall with the slightly larger battery capacity of the RAVPower unit. Another advantage to this portable charger is that is charges fully in 4.5 hours, meaning you won‚Äôt have to wait the extra 6-7 hours more that most charges of this class required to fully power up.

The RAVPower Portable Charger comes standard with two 2.4A iSmart USB ports and one incredibly powerful USB type C port, meaning you‚Äôll be able to quick charge all you devices at once and not risk getting lost on the streets because your GPS died while you were busy gaming the hours away in the foreign country.  One of the only downsides to this portable charger is the price, being the most expensive of the three units we tested, it is clearly not a budget option. Keep in mind however, that although this is the high end offering it has a clear lead when it come to all the required power to charge the Nintendo Switch during long gaming sessions. Overall this is the Best Nintendo Switch portable charger on the market and will let your Nintendo Switch run for many hours past when its internal battery would have died.

Picking up this portable charger should be an easy choice as it has extremely high power capacity, the newest power distribution technology, and is reliable without a fault. This portable charger is in high demand at the moment so if you need one right away and it‚Äôs not in stock the Anker PowerCore+ 20100 is also a great option.

**The best way to carry and protect your Switch is with a Dedicated Case**

The Nintendo Switch is built as a portable console, but unfortunately that means it was not designed in a heavy armor casing to protect it against scratches, scuffs and drops. Previously we mentioned that you should purchase a screen protector as a basic form protection. However, if your constantly on the go, a dedicated case would be a worthwhile investment to go along with your AmFilm Screen Protector.

When looking for the best Nintendo Switch case there are a few things to be aware of, the first of which is the case design. There are two types to choose from, hard shell and soft shell cases. Just like the name suggested the hard shell cases don‚Äôt flex when placed in a backpack or stuffed into a bag, whereas the soft shell cases are a tad more portable and flex to fit confined spaces. With the Nintendo Switch being such an expensive piece of equipment we‚Äôd recommend you go with the hard shell case as it provides superior protection in every case, no pun intended. While you are sacrificing weight and possibly pack-ability, the peace of mind we get with a hard shell case far outweighs the disadvantages. Our recommendation for a great case is the Butterfox Hard Carrying Case, we go into more detail about it in the next section.

Another key factor for cases is, of course, available and accessible storage space. There is no point in having a lot of space available if you can‚Äôt use it. An ideal portable case for day use would have the following storage features;

- At least 10 storage slots for game cartridges
- Zipper pocket for miscellaneous cables, chargers and SD cards
- Well designed main Nintendo Switch pocket

For the main Nintendo Switch pocket your also looking for substantial padding and a tight fit with no jiggle. You want your case to be able to keep you switch untouched if dropped from three or four feet up.  A padded screen cover is also a notable feature, which is standard on almost any Switch case.

**Our recommendation ‚Äì Butterfox Hard Carrying Case**

So you now know that you need a hard shell case, with various pockets and lots of padding. There are a lot of cases on the market that fit some of those recommendation, but many many have bad reviews or be a poor quality product. We have taken the time to review the top three cases in a previous article. Our top choice if by far and away the Butterfox Hard Carrying case.

Wow‚Ä¶that is the first word that comes to mind when looking at this case. It is an extremely well designed, sleek and stylish hard carry case with ample room for all your accessories. Right out of the package you can see it has 19 game holders! Even the most veteran gamer will be hard pressed to play that many games on a single trip. Not only that, but with two Micro SD card holder you‚Äôll be able to download all the games your heart desires and have room to spare. One of the most useful features is the zip pocket located on the inside of the case. This allows you to carry various chargers, extra Joy-Cons, cables and more. Some of the less well designed cases lack this feature all together.

Another handy addition to this Nintendo Switch case is the two soft central dividers that hold the game cartridges. These double as thick cushions for the Switch‚Äôs screen, making it almost impossible to damage the unit while it is in the case. Finally the addition of a small pull tab lying underneath the Switch makes it a breeze to take the Switch out of the case. Besides the technical features, we were thrilled to find out the case comes in multiple trim colors! So if you just have to have that blue, red or black case, you‚Äôll be able to find exactly what you need with the Butterfox Nintendo Switch Hard Carry Case.

If your looking for a case that will allow you to carry your entire system with you, dock included check out the RDS Travellers Deluxe System Case,  you can read the full review and comparisons in the [Best Nintendo Switch Case article](http://nintendoswitchaccessory.com/cases/best-nintendo-switch-case/).

**Do I need a Stand?**

Of all the Nintendo Switch accessories we‚Äôve taken a look at so far, this is the first one that is truly optional. But let us assure you that when you need it, you need it. One of the few design issues with the Nintendo Switch is it‚Äôs inability to charge while propped up on its kickstand. The charging port is placed on the bottom of the unit, making it inaccessible when the stand is extended and in use. This can be pretty annoying if you like to use the Switch in that orientation and the battery is running low. As it turns out, quite a few manufacturers have already addressed this flaw by designing some absolutely incredible Nintendo Switch Stands.

When we selected the Best Nintendo Switch Stands we choose them based on materials of construction, portability and their ability to hold the Switch securely in place. When it comes to materials there are really only two you need to be concerned with, plastic and aluminum. For the purposes of this guide we have eliminated steel as it is just to heavy for everyday use. We generally recommend you get an aluminum stand as they are more resistant to wear, extremely light and to be honest just look a little better in person. Some of the plastic stands however are great choices if you need maximum portability and don‚Äôt mine a bit less durability in return. A prime example of a good plastic stand is the HORI Compact Playstand which has excellent reviews and works wonderfully, it also helps that it is very competitively priced.

Portability wise the best Nintendo Switch Stands are the ones that fold and are extremely compact. By folding flat onto themselves, they are very easy to carry around and you won‚Äôt risk snapping them in two when running to catch the train to your friends house. As you‚Äôll see in the next section our recommended stand the Nulaxy Foldable Aluminum Stand folds perfectly flat and yet is still very durable.

Another thing to keep in mind is available space for the Nintendo Switch to vent heat when it is on the stand. If your planning to play for extended periods of time you‚Äôll want to be sure the heat can escape. Aluminum stands do a good job of dissipating the heat like a giant heat sink whereas with the plastic stands you‚Äôll want actual cutouts to allow for the hot air to dissipate. Were still keeping an eye out for an all aluminum stand that has heat vents, we‚Äôre sure it‚Äôll come out sooner or later.

**Our Recommendation ‚Äì Nulaxy Foldable Aluminum Stand**

This incredible looking product stands out from the crowd with stunning colors, an extremely compact, flexible design and the durability of an all aluminum build. The Nulaxy is able to have the Switch held up and charging at the same time,  plus it has endless viewing angle adjust-ability for that perfect, glare free gaming session. The entire area where the Nintendo Switch sits is covered in an anti-slip silicone pad to ensure your devices stay in place and protect them from the inevitable scratches and scuffs of everyday use. Even better the stand comes with small felt feet attached to the base so you can put it on all sorts of expensive tables and furniture without worrying about scratching them.

This is in our view the Best Nintendo Switch stand on the market. If you are looking for a few more options to compare you can read the [full review and comparisons](http://nintendoswitchaccessory.com/stands/best-nintendo-switch-stands/) from our blog post.


**How do I choose a microSD Card?**

With many of the Nintendo Switch‚Äôs games being developed and sold as digital only products, getting a microSD card should be one of your top priorities as a new Nintendo Switch owner. When it comes to what to look for it‚Äôs actually pretty easy for the most part. The first and most important thing you want to pay attention to is that your getting a microSD card and not a regular SD card. Sometimes the images in Amazon or in stores can all the look the same. The next technical factor you want to take into consideration the the read and write speed of the card. To explain a bit further, when a game is loading up for the first time or loading a new level it is reading from the microSD card. When you are saving your game the Nintendo Switch is writing to the card. What this means in layman‚Äôs terms is, pay more attention to the read speed than the write speed, as you‚Äôll load a lot more often than you‚Äôll save. Additional save files are quite small and will write quite quickly on even slower cards.

Most high quality modern microSD cards have a write speed of around 80MB/s and a read speed that is significantly lower. A few of the higher end cards have read speeds in excess of 90MB/s. When translated into in game terms this is a variation of 0.1s when loading Zelda. A faster card will load Zelda in around 9.8 seconds while a slower card might load it in 9.9 seconds. Overall as you can see, there is very little difference in the loading times. So long as your getting a brand name card you can be fairly sure that it will function correctly. You do have to watch out for some of the knockoff cards however as they have a tendency to overhead and actually melt themselves, not something you‚Äôd want to happen inside your Switch.

Last but certainly not least you‚Äôll want to pay attention to the size of the card. Many of the current Nintendo Switch AAA games such as Zelda are clocking in at a massive 13.4 GB of size. So if you want to have a sizable digital game collection you‚Äôll need at least 128GB of free space unless you plan to carry more than one microSD card and swap them out like game cartridges. We have chosen that size because the price per gigabyte of storage is not terribly high and it will allow you to future proof your System. The last thing you want is to purchase a digital game and the Nintendo Switch tell you that you don‚Äôt have enough storage space to download it.

**Our Recommendation ‚Äì SanDisk Ultra 200GB Micro SD**

Using the above guidelines and after extensive test and reviews we have found that the overall Best Nintendo Switch SD Card is the SanDisk Ultra 200GB Mirco SD Card. 

At a whooping 90 MB/s read speed this card races by with the fastest load times on the market. From start to finish the SanDisk Ultra can load Zelda in 9.8 seconds flat. That 0.1 seconds difference from other similar cards such as the Samsung EVO Select and Kingston Digital and may be just the performance your looking for. Just like with the Samsung offering this card comes in a variety of sizes ranging from a paltry 8 GB (don‚Äôt buy a size that small) all they way to a beastly 256 GB. Again we recommend a card size of at least 128 GB so your able to have at least 8-9 digital AAA games stored on it at once without having to swap out the micro SD card. If you want some more information on the Samsung and Kingston card you can [Read the full Review and comparisons](http://nintendoswitchaccessory.com/sd-cards/best-nintendo-switch-sd-cards/) over on our blog.


Overall the low price per gigabyte of storage space, blazing fast 90MB/s read time and well know name brand make this microSD card a great choice for a new Nintendo Switch owner or really anyone who wants to have the ability to expand their digital game collection. If your looking for one of the best Nintendo Switch accessories, look no further.

**What do I look for in a Car Charger?**

Long road trips have always been the best time to use handheld gaming devices, whether it was a Game Boy, Nintendo 3DS or now the Nintendo Switch. In the past car chargers weren‚Äôt necessary as you carried a boatload of batteries along with you. However with the latest in Nintendo tech you‚Äôll need something that can power your Nintendo Switch long after your portable charger has dried up on day number 3.

Car chargers are going to be very similar to portable chargers with respect to power output requirements. You‚Äôll want a unit that provides at least 5V / 2.4A to make sure your Switch will charge while gaming. One of the main advantages of car chargers compared to portable chargers are they are significantly less expensive and it is much easier to find a high powered model. While  you might think that a Nintendo Switch car charger wouldn‚Äôt have too many available features, there are actually a startling amount of them.

When we took a look at the [Best Nintendo Switch Car Chargers](http://nintendoswitchaccessory.com/sd-cards/best-nintendo-switch-sd-cards/) one of our main criteria, not counting power output requirements, was that the unit should have a longer cord. We have found that a 6 foot cord is ideal when dealing with car chargers. It‚Äôs not so long that it drags on the floor or gets tangles up in your feet, but also not so short that you have to press your self up against the seat to make sure your Nintendo Switch can remain plugged in.

A few other things to consider are having multiple USB ports on the charger in case you want to charge more than one device at a time and having a flat instead of rounded cord. The flat cords typically tangle a bit less than the rounded ones do, especially if they are stuffed in your center console when not in use.

**Our Recommendation ‚Äì HORI Car Charger**

If your looking for the best Nintendo Switch car charger on the market and money is no concern, look no further.

The Nintendo Switch High Speed Car Charger by HORI is the Lamborghini of car chargers. With a 5 volt and 3 amp output, this thing charges FAST. For reference a regular charges using only 2 amps of power. Translating that into game terms this car charger will allow you to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and not lose a single percent of battery life. You also don‚Äôt have to worry about your Nintendo Switch getting too much power as it has an internal regulator to ensure it only gets as much as it needs.

When you first hold the HORI Car Charger you can tell it is well built with a bit of heft to it, no super cheap materials here. Also with a 6 ft. long cable you won‚Äôt need to be squeezed up close to the dashboard or car charging port, but instead can lounge around in comfort. As this is an officially licensed Nintendo product you can be sure it‚Äôll work with your Nintendo Switch unlike some of the cheap imitations which only claim to quick charge the Switch. So what is the downside of this great car charger then? We‚Äôll as with most premium product its the price, it‚Äôs almost twice as expensive as the other car chargers, it is far an away the most expensive car charger on our list.

Overall this is an excellent product that does exactly what it was designed for and excels at charging the Nintendo Switch. If your looking for the absolute best Nintendo Switch car charger, this is the one for you.

**Whats the Best Grip for me?**

So after a few minutes of holding the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con‚Äôs you‚Äôll either love them or hate them. Some people simply have hands that are just a bit to large to be playing on such small controllers. If that‚Äôs the case, you‚Äôll probably need to pick a a set of Joy-Con grips for increased comfort, to improve your game play and altogether make your Nintendo Switch gaming experience better. When we first started using our Joy-Cons we immediately knew that while awesome for handheld mode, there were better options if you weren‚Äôt‚Äô on the move. Ideally you‚Äôd want a Pro Controller if your having serious hand issues using the Joy-Cons, but if your just looking for an enhanced experience a set of Joy-Con grips will do the trick.

When picking out the best grip you‚Äôll have to keep in mind that they need to fit the controllers. There are a few options on the market that looks super cool, but in the end are just a bit too loose or
a little too tight making them a pain to get off or keep on. You should also pay attention to the material the grips are made of, some have harder plastic like covering, while other have a softer rubber texture. We‚Äôre a big fan of the rubber offerings as they feel wonderful in your hand and provide a superior grip when compared to the plastic ones.

Another key feature to look out for is a release hole on the back of the grip. If you look at our recommended Surge Nintendo Switch Grip Kit,  you can see that the bottom of the grip has a small hole. This is used to easily get the Joy-Con out by pushing it with your finger, simple, yet effective. Some other offerings are missing this key feature and it makes the Joy-Cons incredible hard to get out. We‚Äôve even had to resort to bending, and extreme pressure to get some of the cheaper grips off.

Button accessibility is also extremely important on a Joy-Con Grip. Just like with cell phone cases it‚Äôs very easy to have ‚Äúsquishy‚Äù buttons. We prefer a hard mechanical click or spring operate button mechanism. Most of the higher quality grips will have this as a standard feature, but some of the lower end one will use injection molded single piece designs which make for very soft button presses. This softness makes it very hard to tell when you‚Äôve actually pressed on of the controller‚Äôs back most buttons.
Finally, and to some, most importantly you need to find a case that is present to the eye. We‚Äôre talking color choice, designs, emblems and all that jazz. While we usually prefer a more muted option, we know there are some of you out there who like to show off your latest Nintendo Switch Accessories and we get that. There are a plethora of options available on the market that have different colors, thematic designs or just look plain cool. When it comes to style we can recommend things, but in the end you‚Äôll be the one who needs to like it.

So now that we‚Äôve gone over the key things to look for in a Nintendo Switch Joy-Con grip lets take a look at our number one choice for the Best Nintendo Switch grip that we feel meets all the above criteria and excels in this category.

**Our Recommendation ‚Äì Surge Nintendo Switch Grip Kit**

Right out of the package you will receive two Joy-Con grips and two thumb grips in the standard matte grey of the Nintendo
Switch. You also have the option to order the grips in neon blue, neon red or a combination of the two colors for maximum style points. The product listing says these grips are; ‚ÄúDesigned to provide superior grip and enhanced comfort, perfect for those extended, high-stress gaming sessions.‚ÄùBased on our testing, professional reviews and the general usage from the public, these grips certainly live up to their claims.

With about 50% extra space available for gripping the Joy-Cons these feel wonderful in the hand and the included thumb grips provide additional responsiveness and grip to the somewhat slick stock analog sticks. When placing the controllers in the Surge Nintendo Switch Grips they are nice and snug with a solid in hand feel to them. The extra space allows for your hand to really relax during a gaming session and instead of your finger feeling cramped after a couple of hours you won‚Äôt even notice the time flying by.

Getting the Surge Nintendo Switch grip off is also extremely easy with the cleverly designed hole in the back of the grips. With a quick push you can quickly extract the Joy-Con controller and switch back to handheld mode or use the Nintendo Switch‚Äôs native Joy-Con controller dock. A robust hinged cover plate holds the Joy-Con in place while the unit is in the grip and snaps down to keep the controller from shifting around during gaming sessions.

During our testing we found that all of the buttons are easily accessible on the grip kit and that, as the product listing claimed, they do not restrict game play or movement. Another added benefit is the protection this kit provides for your Joy-Cons. No longer will you have to worry about them being scratched by untrained friends during a Mario Kart 8 race or dropped while playing 1-2 Switch. Overall this is a great grip kit and Surge did an excellent job with the design and manufacturing of this unit and  for a set of two you can‚Äôt really beat the price either.

We here at Nintendo Switch Accessory would 100% recommend the Surge Nintendo Switch Grip Kit as a top choice for Joy-Con grips.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I've been medically retired and through various sources I receive around $3400 monthly.

personalfinance,Should I use a loan from my 401k to pay off my debt? Info provided - Please advise,"I'm 32 years old and got myself into debt with a bit of a problem I used to have. I currently have a loan for $12,503.67 @ 9.79%($296.01/mo with 50 months left started at $14,000/60months), a Discover card with $7600.06 at 15% ($141 min payment) with a $12,600 limit and another card at $5761.21 @ 0% for 15 months (not sure min payment just got it) with a $7000 limit. I opened this card to transfer the complete balance from another card and around $4000 of my Discover onto it since it's 0% interest. All total that gives me $25,864.94 in debt I should have never had as I came out of college debt free. I know if I pay off this debt I will not get myself into the same situation. I can take a loan of $12,106 @ 5% interest that goes back into my 401k and pay it back over a 60 month period and I will have no penalty or any other fees as I have checked. I have $24,213 in my 401k. I could at least pay off the high CC debt of $7600 and either pay down $4506 of the loan (no prepayment penalties), or go ahead and pay off the majority of the credit card with 0% and just continue to pay my monthly loan payment of $296.01. Paying back the 401k loan would only be $52.65 a week, $210.60/mo, for 60 months for a total repayment of $13,687.75 back into my 401k. It may be best to pay off the Discover card, and put $4506 down on the loan since I have over a year to work on the $5761 at 0% interest, which I'd be able to pay off with my bonus and taxes. I will provide you with more info to help. 

I currently make $48,600 + bonus. My bonus is 8%-20% of my salary at the end of each year. This year it was $1584 bc I was hired 9/28 but had I worked all year it would have been $6384, grossing $54,984 but could be as much as $9600 for a gross of $58,200 pending I do not get a raise this year. After taxes and benefits I take home $596.02 per week and $2384.08 on 4 week pay period months and $2980.10 on 5 week pay period months for an avg of $2483.33 a month. And of course get a very large bonus check at the end of the year anywhere from $3840 - $9600. My bills are as follows (including loan and CC payments)

* Rent water/sewer/trash = $954 avg
* Cable/internet = $155
* Car insurance = $98
* Car payment = $50 
* Electric Bill = $95 avg
* Netflix = $10
* Cell phone = $22 (normally $72 work pays $50)
* Discover CC = $141 min
* Loan = $296.01
* Visa CC = haven't had a min payment yet
* Total before Visa CC = $1821 per month 

* $2483.33 (not counting bonus) - $1821 = $662.33

That leaves me with $662.33 per month for food, entertainment (I rarely go out no big deal) gas, and anything else that may arise. When I get my bonus check at the end of the year I plan to put most all of that down on whatever card/loan is left with the highest interest rate. I also usually get around $3200 a year back for taxes 2-3 months after my bonus, so I could use that as well. Should I go ahead and take out the loan on my 401k. Or should I wait and see what my bonus is at the end of this year and pay off as much as I can from my bonus and taxes? I know I will lose compouding interest. But I don't think I will lose as much, or enough to make it that negative to use a 401k loan. I am thinking of getting a roommate because my rent is already high and it will be going up to $967 in June if I do not do anything. I'd also rather not do that or get rid of cable/internet either. Any advice pertaining to the loan, or something other than get a roommate/get rid of cable/internet would be very helpful. Thank you!

Edit: Adding on to this. Instead of taking a loan and having to repay that, I could instead roll part of my 401k into an IRA with the same company and withdrawal $ with a 20% tax that the company keeps and sets aside for me, and a 10% fee. Yes, I know I will lose out on compounding interest, but I also wouldn't have to pay back the loan. I could us up to $23k to pay off all my debt, which I won't do. I just want to pay off the $8k balance on 15% APR card and maybe pay down another $5k on the 9% loan. Would this be a better idea than a loan from my 401k? Especially since after my debt is paid down I can contribute more then 5% to build it back up.",finance

personalfinance,Help me make a decision about my future.,"Hey PF,

I am currently a second-year student at a liberal arts school in the Northeast, and I am currently in a predicament that I was hoping you could help me with. This is a career question, but I feel like the group of people here are better at answering those than other subreddits. So here goes.

I am currently majoring in Business Administration and am on track to graduate a year early (So I will be graduating next spring). I currently have an internship lined up for the summer as a Policy Intern at a state agency in my state, and that's how I had hoped my career would go. I had hoped that I would go into a career in public policy and maybe go back to school for an MPA (Masters in Public Administration) or MPP (Masters in Public Policy) later on. I was always interested in a career in public service and felt this was the right path for the past few years. But, recently I started having second thoughts about this career path. I began to feel like in this career path it is tough to make a good living and with the federal hiring freeze, I've heard from people in the policy realm who work for federal agencies or think tanks that the job opportunities are drying up. While state-level opportunities are still around, they are getting harder and harder to get due to increased competition caused by the federal hiring freeze.

Okay, so here is my predicament. I was recently informed of an opportunity by my advisor at my school that the school offers this 3-2 engineering program. The program allows me to graduate from my school with one degree in 3 years and pursue second bachelor's degree in engineering at a different school for two years. Along with an option to do another extra year for a master in whatever discipline of engineering I choose and my financial aid package would carry over to the new school. I was attracted to this as I am fascinated by building things, and I love science. In fact, my best grades in college are in science and math. I would only need to take a two more classes to meet the requirements for this program, and my schedule is open enough to accommodate the classes next year. If I were to do this, I would likely either major in Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering as my second bachelor's degree.

So r/PersonalFinance could you please help me decide if this is the right thing to do and what sort of considerations I should make before taking this step. Also just so the mods know, there are some financial considerations to take in like salary potential of either career, the missed earning while I'm getting the second degree plus new student loans and 2-3 years of interest. I have 15K in student loans so far, and I am extrapolating that if my financial aid carried over, I would owe 44K with the second bachelor's degree as compared to the 24K if I stop after my first degree.

Thanks for your help guys, I really appreciate it!",finance

The discontinuation of the use of the exchange rate as an additional monetary policy instrument means that the koruna exchange rate will move according to supply and demand on the foreign exchange market.

personalfinance,"24 yo, work in NYC, old car, large student loan debt. Looking for advice","Hello to all you wonderful personal finance wizards. This is really a great community and I've taken a lot away from it in the short time I've been subscribed. First time poster, warning that this may get lengthy but I will try to stick to the details. Apologies in advance if formatting is wack as I am typing this from my phone. 
Anyways, I'm a 24 yo college grad, I work in IT Risk Consulting in NYC making ~$64k a year (before taxes). I've worked at my current company for about a year now. My take home is around ~$3200 a month before expenses. I have a large student loan balance from undergrad between federal and private loans (north of $80k). The huge balance is mainly due to me being foolish as an 18 year old like many and choosing to go to a rather expensive out of state school, losing what little scholarship money I had due to excessive partying, and having to spend an extra semester finishing my degree as a result. Not ideal, but it's reality and I'm doing my best to make the most of the situation. 

I live at home in NJ with my parents currently, great people but unfortunately not the best when it comes to money or personal finance. 

My monthly expenses are as follows: 

* minimum payments to student loans are around $900 a month total, I try to pay more (close to $1200) in an attempt to beat down the accumulating interest while I don't have to pay rent or anything. The loans are refinanced into one payment for private, one for federal, albeit at less than ideal interest rates. ~6.2% for private and 4.5% for federal 
* car insurance ~$150 
* gas: ~$80-100 (older jeep, super thirsty on gas) 
* cell phone $50 
* grocery money I pay my parents: $100 (I try to stay on the healthier, thereby pricier side of things, and my mother and I came to an agreement this was a reasonable amount for food as a result)
* gym membership: $35 
* restaurants/eating out: $100 
* clothing: ~$75 
* ""fun"" money: $200 
* entertainment (e.g. Spotify, netflix etc.): $50 

I am sure there's a couple more I'm missing but thats a close approximation.

I have about $2500 in savings right now, and am actively trying to build on that. I am looking to put about $400 a paycheck ($800 a month) into my savings, with some wiggle room for when unexpected expenses pop up. I currently put no money towards a retirement account or 401k with my company (they match up to 6%, but I have been very anxious about even thinking of saving for retirement when I have such a large student loan debt hanging over me). I realize this is foolish, but I haven't been compelled to change it yet for some reason. Please convince me otherwise if you are able. 

Now for my issue. I drive an 04 Jeep Liberty with over 120k miles on it. It's a gas guzzler, but gets he job done. I don't have to drive all the way to manhattan for work, but just to a train station about ~20 miles from my house round trip. The car runs fine all things considered, but I'm not sure for how much longer that will be the case. I take trips down to the Philadelphia area once in a while to visit friends, but nothing much further than that. My parents insist I need a new car immediately, however I explained to them I would rather build up my savings a bit more first before blowing it all in a down payment on a new car. 

In addition to that, I am aiming to move out of my parents house within the next year and with rent prices in the NYC area being sky high I will need a pretty hefty goose egg in my savings for that to be a reality. If that happens, I also doubt I would need a new car as living and working closer or in New York I would be able to rely solely on public transportation. 

 My question is: what should I do? Are my parents correct in that a new car should be my primary focus? Should I focus more on saving/paying down debt while I can? And is it realistic to save enough to move out within a year or so while still having enough to pay down debt and live at least decently comfortably?

Forex,How Fed Funds Rate Works (and Why Forex Traders Should Care),"The aim of this post is to show how the current federal funds rate operation differs from its pre-crisis model and how it is important to Forex traders.

## Before 2008

When things were simple (before 2008), the Federal Reserve set its target **federal funds rate** (FFR) as a single number and made sure that the [**effective federal funds rate**](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/fed%20funds) (EFFR) is at the target level by performing **open market operations** (OMO). Those OMO normally included **repurchase agreements** (_repo_ or RP) to temporarily increase the reserves supply in the **federal funds market** (FFM) (and thus reduce the demand and the EFFR) and **reverse repurchase agreements** (RRP) to temporarily decrease the supply of reserves and drive the EFFR up. It worked very well because the total size of bank reserves was rather small ($15 billion) in pre-crisis times.

## Our times

Nowadays, when the Fed is holding [$2.27 trillion](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm) in reserve balances (as of March 27, 2017), the old scheme would not fare so well. There is no scarcity of reserve balances at all. To create it, the Fed would need to sell a big share of its securities to shrink the total reserves to manageable size. But that would create some problems ‚Äî it would drive down the prices of those securities and would launch a series of unpredictable market feedback loops. Instead, what the Fed is doing since 2008 is setting a target FFR as a range between two interest rates. For example, it is 0.75%-1.00% as of today while the EFFR, measured as volume-weighted median, was at 0.91% during the last 3 days.

### Ceiling rate

The Fed makes sure that the FFM respects the target bounds by setting the **interest on excess reserves** (IOER) to the top boundary rate. When 95% of the reserve balances are the excess balances (balances exceeding the required level), the IOER rate paid by the Fed to the banks for holding these reserves serves as the ceiling for the rate corridor. It may sound counter-intuitive, because IOER would have been a floor level if only the FFM was composed only of the banks. However, it is not the case. The [**government-sponsored enterprises**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government-sponsored_enterprise) (GSE), such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal Home Loan Banks, [comprise the bulk](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/12/whos-lending-in-the-fed-funds-market.html) of the FFM. GSEs do not earn IOER on reserve balances kept at the Fed. This creates an arbitrage opportunity for banks to borrow from GSEs and allocate the funds with the Fed to earn IOER. Consequently, the interest rate of GSE's loans to banks should be below IOER.

### Floor rate

And how about the floor of the rate range (the _0.75%_ part of today's target range)? It is enforced by the Fed through the OMO called **overnight repurchase agreement** (ON RRP). With it, the Fed can drain some reserves from the system by borrowing cash from market participants, giving them securities as a collateral. Since not only banks can earn interest on their funds with ON RRP (GSEs can also do it), this sets the _de facto_ lower boundary for the EFFR. Who would lend at a lower rate if they can choose to get at least this rate from the risk-less loan to the Fed? One important feature of the current system is that the EFFR does not cling to the upper side of the rate range (IOER) but hovers below it, falling down to near the ON RRP rate during the final day of the month. The reason for the former is that the banks pay [higher FDIC insurance fees](https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fedgfe/2016-79.html) when they borrow more. And the reason for the latter is that the banks need to follow the [Basel requirements](http://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm), which limit their leverage, but are calculated based on the end-of-month balance sheet.

### Efficiency

As a result, we can see the EFFR fluctuating between ON RRP and IOER ‚Äî well within the boundaries of the Fed's target FFR. The short-term interest rates (represented by the 3-month Treasury bills) roughly follow the EFFR, which means that the interest rates get propagated beyond the FFM. Note the EFFR spiking down on each last day of the month: 

[EFFR inside target FFR range with 3-month Treasury Bill rate for comparison](https://www.earnforex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/effr-inside-fftr-with-3mtb.png)

## Relation to Forex

So why should Forex traders care about this? Because effective federal funds rate and the Fed's ability to uphold it are even more important for the US dollar than the target rate set by the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) at its meetings. It is the higher EFFR that would stimulate banks buying more USD to park it either with the Fed or with the GSEs. It is the lower EFFR that would let banks to use the USD as a [carry trade](https://www.earnforex.com/forex-course/carry-trade/) short side. Now you see that any significant news concerning **GSE regulations**, **Basel III requirements**, or **FDIC insurance fee policies** could have tremendous influence on the USD rate based on how such news could affect the EFFR. As a currency trader, you have to be up-to-date with the expectations of the FFM participants regarding those three components. I recommend the following resources to stay up-to-date with those topics:

*   [New York Fed ‚Äî Markets &amp; Policy Implementation](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets) ‚Äî for all important changes in how FFM functions.
*   [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) ‚Äî the Fed board members might hint at the upcoming changes to how they will make sure that EFFR keeps within their target FFR.
*   [Bank for International Settlements](https://www.bis.org/) ‚Äî for its news regarding Basel III development and implementation.
*   [FHLBanks Office of Finance](http://www.fhlb-of.com/) ‚Äî for news on how Federal Home Loan Banks financial regulation changes.
*   [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ‚Äî Financial Institution Letters](https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/) ‚Äî for anything related to changes in how FDIC fees work for depository institutions.

Of course, you can also use some financial news outlet of your choice that would cover all these topics.",finance

personalfinance,What should I be doing with my first credit card?,"So I have had and currently have 3 credit cards. I only use one of them on a regular basis because I get points for groceries. I don't particularly care about the interest rates on any of them because I always pay them on time. 

I was thinking of closing my first credit card. It has the lowest credit limit, so it's inconvenient to use, and it doesn't have any kind of points/rewards system on it. It also doesn't tap. I've used it maybe twice in the last 2 years, it might even be inactive and require me to reset my pin. I was thinking of closing it so I don't have to worry about it anymore, but I was told that I should keep it open to maintain my credit score.

I'd like to look into IBR, but am confused if my income is low enough to qualify.  I'd like to start the IBR right away, but my lender's website says I'm not eligible for any repayment plans (probably because I'm still in school?)

I currently owe about 17k with Salliemae and 18k in government loans. The interest on the government loans is much more reasonable so I have just been making the minimum payment on those. The sallie mae loans I currently have the interest rate on those ranges from 7-8.5 percent. I am calling them today to pay one of the smaller loans(only around 1800) with a high interest rate in full. Since I have good credit(790)  I looked into refinancing them. A lot of the companies will only refinance a minimum amount and I think(?) it only makes sense to refinance the sallie mae ones since they have the high interest rate. Citizens bank gave me a decent rate( I think 5 point something) but I am unsure of how much money I would actually save. I would love if sallie mae would just lower my interest rate but from reading online it doesn't look like they will do that unless I have missed payments? That makes no sense to me. Wouldn't they rather continue to make money off me at a Lower interest rate than me refinance with another company and no longer make any money off me?,finance

I acquired this debt prior to my marriage in 2013 however the first year we filed our taxes  jointly my Husbands tax return was withheld due to this debt. He was able to file an 'Injured Spouse' form and the return was granted however this tells me my student loan was considered a federal loan.

My question is where should I go from here to rebuild. Aside from this falling off my credit report, will they pursue me indefinitely until the full amount is paid? If that's the case who do I get in contact with in terms of repayment if the debt's already been closed/charged-off?

38 years old, live with fiance (she owns home), 42k income, expenses are pretty low (car lease, regular bills, etc... really only totals about half of my income). Did not have any retirement savings, had some debt, then the below happened...

Came into some money, approx $150,000. Did the following:

Paid off all of my debt (57k in student loans, 7k personal loan) as even with low interest rates I feel like the debt had an emotional impact on me so I wanted it gone.

Opened a Vanguard account and deposited 11,000 (this years and last years max) into a Roth IRA and used the funds to purchase a Vanguard Target Date 2045 Fund.

Set up my 401k payroll contribution through my employer for 5% of my income (approx 160 per month) as that's the max to benefit from their match (100% on first 3%, 50% on next 2%).

Put $7000 (6 months of expenses) into an emergency fund (ally online savings).


So that leaves me with approx 68k to decide how to allocate. I know that the 401k max is 18k, so I am considering dumping 18k into that. 

I have an HSA that I currently dont contribute to so I am also considering utilizing that.

solar,Solar CRM,"Hi reddit,

The company I work for wants to integrate a CRM and they asked us for our opinion on several options, however, I have never worked with CRM's and dont know much about them.

In general can someone with experience in implementing and/or working with CRM's give a short explanation on how it works and what does it entail having one?

The company is a US based company with representation in Mexico, Guam and the Philippines, the main reason for installing the CRM is to have a better management of the sales department, because as you can imagine having salesmen in these so apart locations its dificult to manage.

Also is it difficult to maintain? I imagine that lots of information has to go in it in order to work properly (I dont have a clear view on how it works or manages information so this is also a bit shady for me), our tasks are not properly distributed so Im afraid that installing a CRM will put just unwanted burden on everyone and eventually fail if information is not frequently fed into the system.

Thanks in advance! Looking forward to read your comments :D

investing,Can a quality bond index fund lose real money?,"Okay, dumb question: Can a bond index fund lose real money if you hold it for fixed income and never sell? Obviously if you held inidivual bonds the answer would be no (assuming no defaults), but since a bond index mantains a constant maturity duration (i.e. ""long"", ""medium""), I am wondering if that just means there is always some maturing and some new ones being bought and therefore your coupon may fluxuate but will never be negative. Is that right? I guess I am wondering: If you never sell, does a bond fund being ""up"" or ""down"" for the year matter? I can't quite follow this.

And as a second scenario, what if you buy now and hold for 5 years then sell. I know I'll get dividens along the way, but it's possible that an increased interest fed rate will decrease the value of the bond fund and therefore you'd potentially lose money when you sold. Is that right? 

Finally, I've seen people say that an increased fed rate will cause bond prices to fall and returns to rise immediately. That doesn't make sense to me because I know that the yield on a t-note falls in response to fed rate hikes. See the post by OGD at https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=168007 for this, if what I wrote doesn't make sense.

personalfinance,$12k transaction coming. Want to put on CSR card to reap travel reward. Will this ding credit score?,"TLDR: Will $12k transaction on one credit card ($20k limit) ding credit score if total credit limit is $50k over 3 credit cards?

Hi PF! I'm going to be getting married in Hawaii soon and will need to pay off the venue ~$12k. I have the money in hand and could pay off by check if I wanted to.

I have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card with a $20k limit. The $12k will be over the 'rule of thumb' of not spending more than 30% of your credit line. Is the ‚Äòdon‚Äôt spend 30% of your credit‚Äô rule applicable to each individual card, or over my entire line of credit? Besides the CSR, I also have a Chase Freedom Unlimited and a regular Chase Freedom. Between the 3 cards, my total credit limit would be +$50k. Side note; only debt I have is a mortgage in good standing. 

I was planning on paying it off immediately after it shows up on my online credit statement. Since CSR gives back 3% on travel (I've verified that the transaction will count as a travel transaction by paying the venue deposit with the same CSR), is it worth putting this on my card to get a free $360 (12k x 3%)?

The reason I‚Äôm thinking about this is we're looking at buying real estate later this year. If this dings my credit score (800) and decreases my chances of getting a good interest rate on a mortgage loan, I don‚Äôt think $360 in travel rewards is worth it.

I'm currently a college student in Texas.

Last year I got paid $10,000 for doing contract work. Not an employee.

I also had a $3,000 scholarship. I don't know if I pay taxes on this or if it gives me some kind of deduction or something.

Currently I have a credit card with a $2000 limit and a balance of $800. I have 0 dollars in my bank and 0 cash.

I was stupid and didn't think about taxes, so I spent all of my money (mostly on school/rent).

I don't have any money to pay. I have 0 dollars and owe $800 on my credit card. I might be able to borrow money from my mother (who currently has liquid cash from a house sale), but I would prefer to avoid this unless I don't have any other options.

What can I do? This would be my first time paying taxes. What happens if I don't pay? Is there some way to get an extension? Can I pay part of it with my credit card? Or get on some kind of payment plan?

personalfinance,"23 year old, US military, need advice on where to put my money","Hey /r/personalfinance,

I lurk here daily and have read most of the posts on this topic, and just have a few follow up questions and want to see what everyone thinks.

I'm currently an O1 in the military, so you can see a complex breakdown of my income with a basic google search.  TLDR on income is I take home roughly $3500 after taxes.  After expenses, I'm generally left with $1000-$1500 leftover every month, which I have been saving and/or investing.

I have a student loan (.75% interest rate) for $25k that I'm working towards paying off.  I also have an emergency fund of $5k, and I have been investing with Acorns (I know) that has about $8k in it.  I also have maxed out my Roth IRA and contribute $500 monthly to a TSP (401k equivalent for the military).

I would like to move that money from Acorns into a better investing strategy, but I have no clue where to start.  I started with Acorns when I was still in school because it was an easy way to passively invest money, but I have essentially been using it as another savings account until I got my emergency fund built up.  I know everyone generally recommends vanguard but I'm not sure if that would be right for me if I have less than $50k to invest with them.

All advice is welcome. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Which is better: 0% APR for 12 months or a small loan?,"My husband and I have had a bit of a rough patch financially. While we generally pay off all of our bills and credit cards in full each month, the past several months have been tough. I have transferred some balances over to one of my other cards that had a promotion for no interest for 12 months. My husband started working now and I'll definitely be able to pay all of it off in time - I'm not worried about that.

My question is, is this really going to hurt my credit score? Would it be better to get a small loan to pay off everything at once? I can get a 3.5% interest rate at my credit union. Obviously I'd prefer not to pay interest, but I'm worried about my credit score going down too far due to revolving credit.

personalfinance,Finally figured out where to put money in what order,"It probably took longer than it should have, but here are the stats.

Graduated from undergrad 4 years ago making $40k, currently making $78k. I had $30k in student loans, which I've currently now gotten down to just $3700. My savings rate has been about 40% since graduating. The order of where to put your money first took a while for me to figure out but once I did, it was clear that this is the order that's right for most people.

1) Emergency fund of $1k

2) Pay off any CC debt

3) Max out employer match in 401k. (ex: 70% of the first 5% of your salary, take the free money if it vests quickly, mine was 3 years)

4) Emergency Fund of $10k-$15k

5) ESPP (employer stock purchase program, I can contribute up to 20% of my salary and get a 15% discount on stock, which is purchased on the last day of the 6 month period, and can sell immediately for a 15% gain)

6) Max out your Roth IRA ($5500 per year, index funds)

7) Student loans - I prioritized this before 401k, or ESPP, or Roth IRA, which probably hurt my long term compounding of 3 years or so... But I hated that huge student loan debt burden

8) Auto Loan - I bought a 3 year old car, with 28,000 miles on it, that was originally $30,000 brand new but got it for just $15,000 (3-4 years is when the largest depreciation hit has already happened for most cars). I have a 3.96% interest rate, $10k financed over 5 years, $200 per month. The average new car payment is nearly $500, be smart here.

9) Max out 401k at work - $18,0000 pre tax is the max, I would personally rather finish paying off my car before maxing this out, but some people might say otherwise. 



My net worth in 4 years went from -$31,000 to +$25,000 and generally I've saved about $1,000 per month after tax that's gone toward debt repayment, savings, or investing. Just wanted to share my story since I've read so many of yours. Getting rid of student loans is pretty painful but... can't wait to finish it off and focus on wealth building through my 401k roth ira's, real estate, and do more traveling. Just also wanted to share a quote I heard, ""Everything takes longer than you think"" and also, ""it doesn't matter where you start, it just matters that you start"".

He said that he may need capital from time to time and it would probably be like investing some sort of capital short term for a small return. 

Yesterday he calls me and tells me that he has something for me. He is doing a mortgage refi with his client and he is basically acting as the lender and a little short. I would be lending him 75K and he will pay it back in 3 months with 8% interest. We will draft a promissory note and he is going to secure the promissory note with his lending business as well as his condo (the one that he lives in now). He also said we can notarize the promissory note. 

I have no reason to think he will not repay me but this is a large sum of money and I just want to make sure I am protected should things go south. I have no experience in small business transactions and person to person loans. 


Here are the terms:

75K loan with 8% interest, principal paid back in 3 months

Month 1 - Receive $500 in interest (75K*8% divide by 12 months = $500)

Month 2 - Receive $500 in interest

Month 3 - Receive $500 interest and $75K principal back


1. Does the math sound right? I read about compounding interest but I think this is a simple interest rate calculation, right?

2. Is there anything about the promissory note that I am missing? Anything to add? Clarify? I asked him to send me a copy of the promissory note so I can review it with the ""experts"" at work lol. I will try to post a draft of it later today when I receive it. 

3. If he does default and not able to repay, what are the steps I have to take to reclaim the money? Assume it would be a long and tedious process.

I asked how I am supposed to know that and the reply was to contact the issuer's bank.  Does this sound right?  I understand and would agree to a reasonable fee if they CU was just looking to cover their costs for returned check, but I understood that returned check processing is nearly 100% automated now and hence would cost them maybe $2-3 per returned check.

I currently am making payments on my federal student loans through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I work as a Pharmacist in a non profit hospital.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation,"My fiancee and I are getting married in June and she carries a lot of credit card debt (16k). We are able to make extra payments pretty comfortably and are working to pay it down but I see the interest each month piling up and am getting frustrated. I have about 5k in credit card debt for myself. Would it be worth it to take out a short term (3 years max) loan to pay all the credit cards off (and close some of the damn things) and save some interest?

Follow up to that question, since most banks have really tightened up unsecured personal loans would it be worth it to use one of those online loan companies (like Upstart) to take out a loan or are they scams?

I guess my question really boils down to, how effed would we be to take out a personal loan through an online lending company? Has anyone had any experience with companies like that and if so, would you be willing to share your experience with me?",finance
personalfinance,Include copy of 1099-DIV with amended return?,"I'm filing an amended tax return (original return done through turbotax e-filing).

I forgot to include dividends I received through Vanguard (they were automatically reinvested).

So, I got the 1099-DIV hardcopy from Vanguard. I filled out the amended return forms (1040X Federal and 540X California) and printed them out. 

My only question is, do I throw in a hardcopy of the 1099-DIV I received from Vanguard in each envelope that I'm sending out for the amended returns? One for federal and one for state? Or is it unnecessary?",finance

personalfinance,How to grow $100k in the Bay Area?,"Hi PF,

Please don't yell at me, I know what I am doing is wrong, but am looking to change that, I just don't know where to start.

‚Ä¢ Single 32
‚Ä¢ Live in the Bay Area (California)
‚Ä¢ No debt
‚Ä¢ $90k salary
‚Ä¢ Reached $100k in savings account
‚Ä¢ 15% monthly 401(k) contribution
‚Ä¢ Have a Roth IRA and maxing it (~$5k?) yearly
‚Ä¢ No investments
‚Ä¢ Roughly $2k monthly expenses
‚Ä¢ Can probably put away $1500/month to savings

I have always thought of buying a house, but since the average home price here is upwards of $700k, I only have enough for a down payment for a $500k loan at 20%. I've heard paying anything less than 20% comes with fees, higher interest rates, mortgage insurance, etc.

So I am thinking that I should save up another $100k (have no idea how), but more realistically $40k in the next few years to buy a small property. What is the fastest way to do this with the smallest risk, preferably in the next 5 years? I know I should be investing in something, but I don't know what or where to start. I've also heard that there are some brokers that don't invest in your best interest, but rather theirs. So I'm hesitant...

I am wondering if it would be a better idea to buy a rental house somewhere less expensive (near Sacramento) and collect rent. Or buying a house to live in and rent the extra rooms as a source of additional income?

personalfinance,Build a guesthouse or buy an investment apartment?,"I have an opportunity to either build a guest house in my lot, or buy an apartment for the same money.  On both I have the tenants lined up if I go forward with it.

Los Angeles area

Guesthouse on lot: the property values will go up a bit, but enough to cover the building cost.  My property taxes might go up a little if the county assessor takes a look at my property.  I'm seeing guest houses are valued around $100/sf depending on what it is, but I'd be spending $250/sf to build.  However, 100% of what I charge for rent goes to me.  If I spend a bit more on the guesthouse and make it its own address, technically the price per square foot should go up.

Apartments are going up in value here fairly steadily.  If I get a loan to buy an apartment, there's the overhead of interest rate, HOA, property taxes which means I'd need more tenants to cover it and I'd make no money on rent.  More tenants, more trouble, right?  The yield would only be the principal being paid over time (close to zero the first few years), tax deductions and the appreciation.

If both are bad investments, then that's a good answer as well.",finance
personalfinance,Graduating med school with $500k in student loans. Specific question about refinancing.,"Thanks in advance for any advice you all can provide.  As in the title I have roughly 500k USD in student loans (~$180k is private undergrad, remainder federal undergrad/med school) and I'm considering refinancing with DRB in order to take advantage of their program that allows a residents/fellows to pay only $100/mo while in training.  https://student.drbank.com/student-loan-refinancing-for-residents-fellows/#  


  I did look into REPAYE, however I'm getting married this year to a resident who does not have student loan debt.  And my understanding is that REPAYE will take both our incomes into account thus negating that whole interest forgiveness thing.    
https://studentloanhero.com/featured/repaye-revised-pay-as-you-earn-program-guide/  


If it matters, I will be in training for 6 years after which time I will enter a specialty with roughly 480k USD gross income (varies by source) last year.  This June I start my first year of training and will have a gross income of 55k USD, which will increase by a few thousand USD annually for the remainder of my 6 year training.


In all honesty the DRB program seems too good to be true, but I'm sure I'm missing something and hopefully you guys can point it out to me.  

* $100/mo with no penalty for paying more
* Interest accrues but **does not capitalize during the training period (6 years for me)**
* Currently offers a 20 year fixed rate of 6ish-7.2% (about the same as all of my loans currently, but obviously higher than refinancing at another bank)
* No prepayment penalty after the training period ends  


Edit:  I guess I should add that until residency/fellowship is over we plan to rent rather than buy a home.  Also **I do not have any of the following:**

* Savings
* Children or other dependents
* Investments or property
* Consumer debt",finance

personalfinance,NEED HELP! Ripped off by car dealership!,"So this was my first car purchase from a dealership. I found something for $13,100. I had a down payment of $4000, I also had a cosigner with excellent credit (800+) I agreed to the $13,100 with the sales rep, he then has to take it to the finance guy to get everything figured out. I wait nearly two hours to finally be rushed into a room with a man that says great I managed to get you a 5% interest rate and a bumper to bumper warranty! So I'm thinking awesome this is great, by now its closing time and he throws a stack of paperwork at me and makes me sign tons of papers probably 10+ and explains nothing. So in my mind I'm thinking the car was listed at 13,100 plus tax and fees probably 14,500 or something plus my down payment would knock it down to 10,500...well I get home and read the pile of paperwork, turns out I paid $3000 for that warranty plus $500 for GAP insurance plus $600 for wheel and tire protection, and I am now finacing $14,500! with a total cost of $18,500! I immediately called him back and asked him why the hell I paid all this extra no one told me about. He tells me well without it your interest rate would of been much higher I think he said 9% so he says he saved me money lowering my interest rate. He says this is due to banks being more willing to loan knowing their investment is protected. So I do some calculating and it just is not adding up. If I didn't buy all these warranties I should of only financed $10,500 maybe $11,000 at most and even with a 20% interest rate I would still pay way less than what I am paying now. So any advice on how to approach this he tells me he can switch it but it would make my payments go from $239/mo to $280/mo. Which doesn't make sense on a $10,500 loan with 9% interest for 6 years why I would pay $280 a month. Please any advice I am stuck here and don't have a clue what to do! Thanks! 


Okay so it seems I will be able to cancel most if not all the warranties, So I call him back tomorrow and tell him to get rid of all this bullshit, he told me my payments would go up from 239 to 280 how is this possible?! or was he just blowing smoke up my ass trying to get me to not cancel all the warranties?",finance
personalfinance,[24/M] How should I handle my debt/finances/money?,"Hey r/personalfinance,

I am not very educated on this kind of stuff, so naturally I need help. I am very bad at explaining things so bare with me. In my opinion I‚Äôve made some bad financial choices and I need a point in the right direction. 


I am 24 years old, living in my dad‚Äôs house with my girlfriend. 

Our goal: To move out and go to college. I would like to learn more about film making and she would like to learn more about studio arts. 

Income situation: I currently work part-time at a department store at minimum wage. My girlfriend up until now has been unemployed but she is expected to start at this department store with me. I have nothing in savings and we currently have under $100. 

Rent situation: My dad has been letting us live here for almost two years no rent, as long as we help out when needed. Although recently he has asked for $400 a month. 

Car situation: I have been without a car for almost a year and a half. Since I got my license at 18 I‚Äôve had 3 cars, two of which turned into money pits that fell apart constantly. My grandmother has been leasing brand new cars for most of her life so she talked me into doing just that in December of 2014. At the time i worked part-time as a cook at a restaurant at minimum wage. I sat down with my grandmother at the car dealership about to sign off on lease papers for a new car but i hesitated. I told my grandmother there was no way I could do this and she said both her and my mother hated seeing me with used cars that always fell apart and that if i needed help making the payments they would help me. They‚Äôve always helped me in the past so that gave me some piece of mind and signed off. The car was beautiful and I had it for around a year paying it off myself before i started running into some problems. I couldn‚Äôt keep up with the bills and paying for food/gas and insurance with the job I had. I asked my mother and my grandmother to help and they both basically told me it wasn‚Äôt their problem. I went to the dealership and told them very soon i wasn‚Äôt going to be able to make the payments anymore and they told me I could either transfer the lease to someone else (who i had to find) or pay off the lease and turn the car in. I told them if i had the money to pay off the lease i wouldn‚Äôt be here talking to you. They assured me there was nothing else i could do. I stopped making full payments and paid as much as i could but after a few months they repossessed the car and billed me $11k, which is currently in collections. I tried to get another car a few months ago but my credit was so bad my bank rejected an auto loan. 

School situation: Both me and my girlfriend didn‚Äôt do so well in high school. She graduated and I dropped out and got my GED. She hasn‚Äôt applied for college yet. I started going to community college in October 2012 but was forced to withdraw as my car died and i didn‚Äôt have a reliable ride. I was billed $2,500 after withdrawing which later went into collections. In October of 2013 I started attending a for-profit technical school for Computer and Networking. I could write a book off of my horrible experiences there. The whole thing felt like a scam, my teachers would quit to find better jobs and it seemed like every other month they were looking for someone else to teach the class. The main teacher I had was going through a divorce, slept through most of the classes and barely covered what needed to be covered. Midway through the course the entire campus moved over to another town which was chaos. By the time I figured out I made the wrong choice to be there, I tried talking to the financial aid representative i spoke to when I was applying but it turned out she quit 3 representatives ago. I just tried hanging on and making the best of it. I ended up graduating with good grades and a diploma. I tried using my teacher for a reference for a job afterwards but it turns out he quit after the ceremony and when the school contacted him he declined. I paid $200 a month to be there and they still kept charging me after I graduated. I stopped the charges from going through and asked why they were still billing me. Turns out I owed the school $8k after graduating i knew nothing about and after the six month grace period I owed $24k in Federal Student Loan which I also knew nothing about. I tried tracking down exactly when I signed off on student loan papers and I kept getting different answers from everyone I‚Äôve talked to. I‚Äôve tried getting a lawyer involved to see if there was any way out of this and they pretty much told me they couldn‚Äôt do anything if I attended the entire time and accepted the diploma. I would have much rather just gone back to community college and gone to a real school afterward. I‚Äôve paid for a lot of dumb things in the past I probably shouldn‚Äôt have, but I do not justify paying this at all. I consider it unfair, it has been in default status for over a year.  

Other debts: I have numerous hospital/Dentist bills that have gone to collections, totalling over $5k. my credit is very very low. 

My dad is trying to push me into filing for bankruptcy. I knew nothing about bankruptcy until he mentioned it and I started researching it. It does not wipe the Federal Student Loans. Does my situation really call for bankruptcy? It all feels very overwhelming and I don‚Äôt want to wait years and years until i can start finally learning what i want to learn and doing what i want to do.",finance
personalfinance,"23 Years Old, $85,000 In Debt ($25,000 Paid Down!)","I wanted to share my recent financial journey and get some advice from those who have suggestions on where to go from here. In July of 2016, after barely scrounging together enough money to pay my bills I finally decided to tally up my debt and minimum monthly payment totals to see where I stood.

I don't remember the exact values to each account but my total debt came out to be $85,406.99 with 7 maxed out credit cards, 3 personal loans, 1 truck loan, 1 motorcycle loan, 1 student loan, and a few thousand dollars owed to friends and family.

At the time, I was earning a gross income from a full-time job as an engineer of $52,312 with no paid overtime. I also ran a small business which was losing ~$5,000 per year.

Although this was a depressing time that gave me a lot of anxiety realizing I was so far in debt at just 23 years old, it really opened my eyes and made me realize how poorly I managed my money. I'm glad I learned this at 23 and not 53. Throughout the previous 5 years I had both worked and attended college full-time. I had over $100,000 pass through my hands during that time and had less than $10 in my banking account and a few thousand in the company 401k to show for it. I had this perception that since I was getting tuition‚Äã assistance from my employer and paid a lot out of pocket from working my way through college that I could spend my extra money on vacation trips, entertainment, nice vehicles, etc. I was living in a ""luxury"" apartment off campus that was over $1,000/month plus utilities, even though I was never there because I spent 15 hours a day between work and school.

In November 2016 my debt reached it's highest point at $86,422.34 and my credit score was the lowest it has and ever will be at around 530. I decided to take action. Knowing that I barely made enough money to pay my bills, I knew that I obviously needed to earn more money to pay down the debt. I searched for a few weeks and eventually found a part-time manufacturing job paying $15.30/hour that let's me pretty much come and go whenever I want so long as I keep my hours worked between 15-30 hours a week. I think that having a bachelors degree and strong manufacturing and engineering skills that I could've found something with better pay, but the freedom to choose my own hours and call off or come in as I needed to sold me on the position. Also, thanks to my awesome girlfriend I was able to temporarily live with her when my apartment lease ended. The extra income from the part-time job was a net take home of about $1,000/month and temporarily staying with my girlfriend has helped me save about another $1,000/month. This meant that I could take that additional monthly cash flow of $2,000 and apply it to my debt. I did just that and more. I was thankful to receive a decent Christmas bonus in November from my full-time employer and a very nice tax return in January since my business did so poorly the year prior. I also sold a lot of valuable items laying around that did me no good having.

At first I attacked two of the personal loans because they were $200-300/month minimum payments each with very high interest rates. After paying those off, my credit score didn't improve much so I decided to pay off some credit cards. Having paid off the two loans it gave me an additional $500 each month to put towards the credit cards. I attacked the two with the lowest balances first just to have one less account and payment to worry about. When I paid the first one off, the issuer actually closed my account which I assumed was because I was flagged as high risk customer having all my cards been maxed out and a credit score still under 600. I also voluntarily cancelled another card because I didn't want to be tempted to make purchases with the deceiving benefits and rewards points that came along with it. Fast forward a few months and I was able to pay off two more credit cards and my credit score improved to 650. I decided to cut these cards up but leave the accounts open to help keep credit utilization down.

I had put my business on hold from November until March because I was struggling to turn a profit and didn't want to take any risks of investing more money into it without a guaranteed return. I read a book earlier this year called Profit First by Mike Michalowitz that changed my perspective on business and led me to start taking customers again. Thanks to some tips and tools learned from that book, I'm actually about $2,000 in the green this year with my business.

Here is where I stand today.

Credit Card #1 - $1,200 (20.24% APR)
Personal Loan - $2,000 (19.99% APR)
Credit Card #2 - $3,000 (15.24% APR)
Motorcycle Loan - $3,371.31 (8.00% APR)
Family/Friends - $5,000
Credit Card #3 - $7,900 (19.24% APR)
Truck Loan - $15,813.93 (5.64% APR)
Student Loan - $23,759.58 (4.93% APR)

As you can see, I paid off nearly $25,000 in debt from November through April by applying my extra cash flow, bonuses, tax returns, and money from selling stuff around the house. I now have about $10,000 between my 401k and my Roth IRA as well as about $2,500 in a savings account for emergency fund. I've been saving about $100/week to my IRA and my savings account and hope to continue to add about $5,200/year in each account respectively.

I now earn a salary of $54,142 at the same company and still don't get paid overtime. I'm also still at the part-time job making $15.30/hour and working about 20 hours a week. My business earns a gross profit of about $500/month and I expect that to go up as the year progresses. My credit score still isn't as high as is like it to be but it's high enough that I can now go get an affordable apartment or apply for a mortgage.

I've come to Reddit to share my story in hopes of inspiring some of you who've amounted a lot of debt in a short period of time like myself. I've learned the value of investing and the difference between good debt like mortgages or business investments and bad debt like car loans and credit cards. Of course ideally, being completely debt free would be best but there is sometimes a benefit in borrowing money for the investment of a house or growing a business.

I've been working about 80 hours a week between my two jobs and my business and I'm getting close to being comfortable with leaving the part-time job so I can get about 20 hours of work back to focus on my business or personal growth. Before I make such a decision, I wanted some advice or opinions as to what debt I should pay down next. Does anyone recommend that I get a financial advisor or accountant or anything like that? My ultimate goal is to leave the corporate world by 35 and fully retire by 50. I'm very entrepreneurial driven and hope to build successful businesses.

I'm hoping to buy a house this year and plan to contribute the maximum allowable amount to my 401k and IRA. I also hope to go to graduate school within the next few years so I'm hoping to set some cash aside for that expense.

Thanks for reading and I hope to stay in touch and provide updates through the rest of the journey.

Any advice or insight is much appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,How to get PIN for filing tax return online,"I'm trying to file tax return online for the first time. I'm trying to get the self-selected pin, but for that I need my last year's AGI. I'm trying to get that from https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript.

When I filled in my information, it said that it couldn't find my information. Then I realized that I received a letter ""Report of State Income Tax Refund"" this year from my state. I checked my name their and saw that its been mispelled there. I tried my name as it is mentioned in that letter but the website still couldn't retrieve my information.

And then I realized that I didn't receive a similar letter for my federal tax return yet. What does this mean?

What should I do now?

Edit:

1. Even though my name was mispelled in the state tax return report, I did get my money credited in my account

2. I didn't get federal tax return credited to my account",finance
personalfinance,I'm planning on paying for a year of college for each of my nephews and nieces. Is there a tax advantaged way that is best for doing this?,"I have 2 nephews and 2 nieces, and I have committed to myself to paying for a year of college for each, and more if they go to graduate school.  The spread in ages is from 6 to 19, and for the two oldest, who have already graduated high school, I let their parents know at the Christmas of their senior years that they would be receiving this gift.

I've heard of 529 plans, and am wondering if these are the best route to go, or are there other tax advantaged plans that might be utilized.  I live in a state with no state income tax, so state taxes aren't a concern, but are there plans that are tax advantaged at the federal level?",finance

I bring home 900 to 1200 every 2 weeks depending the OT.

My wife brings 300 to 600 every 2 weeks depending on the hours.

We have a loan (don't know the interest rate) but the payoff is 4601.32

We have 1 credit card with a 1400.00 debt on it with no interest until May 2018.

Car insurance is 133.00 a month.

Cell phone is 200.00 a month.

Child support is 180.00 a month.

We currently live in a motel a buddy of mine is not charging us rent. We lost everything in the flood that destroyed Lousiana last August.

We have 800 set back. 

I know we our bringing in money hand over fist but, living in a motel means eating fast food almost evey night. We bought a hotplate, but we dont really have fridge space to keep meat frozen..

Where do I start?? I'm up all hours of the night trying to figure out a way for us to get our debt finished. Build up our money to get an apartment and rebuild our lives.",finance
personalfinance,Trying to get smart with my investments,"Hey all, I just want to say thank you all in advance for all the great advice you have given. I have followed some of it, and gone from spending almost every dime I had every month, barely ever having more than $3K available for anything, to saving a little over $2K per month and becoming a home owner. I owe a lot of that to 
advice I have seen here. Again, thank you from present and future 

Next step is: getting a handle on long-term investments.

I have declined my employer's retirement plan because they do not offer matching, but I do have a few tens of thousands in that account from my 13 years of contributions that will mature for another 6.5 years before I can retire (Federal system, first retirement). That'll roll over to another retirement account. I have time to figure that out.

When I turned off their plan, I started a Roth IRA thinking that was probably the best way to save for retirement, but I recently saw John Oliver's piece on management fees. 

How can I tell how much that is costing me? 

How do I know if the Roth is actually helping or if it will hurt me long-term?

Is there a better way to invest that 5.5K per year? 

Any advice you have would be very appreciated! Thank you all again!",finance
personalfinance,(US) W4 is correct but Federal withholding too low,"Just filled out my 2016 taxes, and I owe the IRS money.  It's a small amount of my total taxes (like 5% of total taxes), and I don't have a penalty this year because my income went up, but I don't want to get hit by a penalty next year.

Checked my W4 and it's correct: 2 exemptions (1 for myself and 1 for being single with 1 job).

One unique thing about my sitatuation is that I had quite a few RSUs.  They're like 25% of my AGI for 2016.  But my employer deducted taxes for the RSUs and reported them on my W2.  So they should have accounted for those when deducting taxes, right?

The other stuff is pretty minor.  Some tiny amount of 1099INT and 1099DIV income, and a small amount of ESPP income that's largely offset by capital losses.

So why is my federal withholding too low?",finance
personalfinance,"Three different student loans, three different interest rates, three different principals. Want to start tackling them early, unsure of best approach.","I have three Federal Unsub Direct student loans:

Loan A: Principal is $5500, Interest Rate is 4.66%, Accrued Interest to Date is $327.67. Distributed ~2014/2015.

Loan B: Principal is $7400, Interest Rate is 4.29%, Accrued Interest to Date is $461.92. Distributed ~2015/2016.

Loan C: Principal is $7500, Interest Rate is 3.76%, Accrued Interest to Date is $122.75. Distributed ~2016/2017.

I will not be taking out any more loans in the future, so I only need to focus on these for now. I am unsure on how to best start paying these off. They are not due yet, as I am still in school until 2018, but I read that starting as early as possible if money is available to do so is best. 

I have ~$1000 that I could use on the loans today, but I have conflicting ideas on how to distribute it. Should I simply start paying off all of the interest that has accrued for all three loans today, continue to pay off additional interest over the next year, and tackle principals after graduation? Should I try to knock out the loan with the highest interest rate first (Loan A)? Or should I work on Loan B, because it has a high interest rate, close to the highest, and a high principal? (In my head this makes sense, because .0429x$7861.92 &gt; .0466x$5827.67, but I sense that I may be relying on some faulty logic because of compounding. According to studentaid.gov, this loan accrues month to month based on a daily interest formula, which is a little confusing to me.)

I tried to use a few payment calculation sites, but it was hard to estimate how much I will actually be able to contribute to them until I'm closer to graduation. 

Any advice would be appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Should my dad cash out his whole life policy?,"He emailed me this morning for advice.  This is his email:

""I have a $100,000 hole life insurance policy I got in 1986. Originally investment interest was to
 to take care of premiums long ago but with low interest rates the company kept moving the goalpost and the monthly premiums still cost $85 a month .(no change).The cash value of the policy is now around $32000 and if I surrender it $30,000 is tax free, so I basically get back all the premiums I ever paid and give up the death benefit of $100,000. The policy ends at age 99.

The cash value maxes out in a few months and then goes down. In a few years there will be almost no cash value but the death benefit is still there. It is possible that the premiums may go up.

I doubt that I will be here at age 99. I also do not really need $30000 right now, but If  I had it I am sure I could find a way to use some of it. Or just save it.

Should I cash it in or keep paying it? There is a short window to decide.""

personalfinance,"So... Ally is safe, right?","I'm currently using a TD Bank savings account (technically ""TD Growth Money Market) with pretty low interest of .15%. I have around $15.5k in it thus far and contribute $155 per week at this point in time.


Ally obviously has the better interest rate by far. I just use TD bank due to me having a checking account with them and the ease of transfers. But I'd like to get more out of my money, especially if it's a decent amount.


So, is Ally safe? I just filled out an application for a joint savings account for my wife and I. It'll be used to save for a house in the coming years.

personalfinance,How can I expect interest rates to affect a 3/2 ARM? How can I determine if the 3/2 ARM is a better deal than the 30 fixed?,"My wife and I are starting to look at buying a house. We live in a high cost of living area and houses aren't cheap. We think we'll find a fixer upper for around $180-$200k based on what we can see on the real estate websites. As long as it's livable at first we plan to do most of the work ourselves over time. 

We're still about a year of saving away from talking to an actual realtor but intend to use this year to do as much research as possible. Our credit union offers a really great rate on a special 3/2 ARM product. The rate is currently 2.75% vs. their 30-year fixed rate if 4.125%. 

Besides the interest rate what else attracts us is that their 3/2 ARM product does not require any PMI or MIP, and we can put down as little as 3%. It is onlyfor borrowers with 720+ credit ascores, but ours are both 800+ so we qualify. We don't want to wait 5-10 years to buy a house to be able to out down 20%. It's just not feasible for us. 

Our financial situation is: $7500 in gross monthly income, only debt is student loans at $770 a month and one car payment at $150/month. We have saved $20k so far, but part of that is our emergency fund. We have another year of savings before we seriously dive in but we hope to use $12k for a down payment and take any closing costs out of the rest and then build it back up. 

On a $200k house we'd only be ""required"" to put down 3%, or $6k but want to out down as much as we can so we'd like to double that to 6% down.

personalfinance,Am I on the right track: Debt Payoff (detailed)?,"Hi PF! Lurker here ready to get group advice on my debt payoff progress. I am fairly new to reddit posting, so I apologize if I format incorrectly. This is difficult for me to admit (in terms of my debt), but here it goes:

Married with 2 young kids

Take home pay: ~$7200/mo

CC Debt: $2300 (0% interest) - I pay $280/mo (hopefully first debt to clear then snowball into next listed)

Car Debt: $11300 (3% interest) - I pay minimum payment of $350/mo

Student Loan (non-fed): $4500 (2.5%) - I pay $50/mo

Student Loan (non-Federal): between myself and wife = $85,000 - we pay $114/mo on $29000 (PAYE plan) and $507/mo on remaining loan (Consolidated private loan at 6.3%).

Student Loan (Fed): $180,000 - we pay about $720 (7.3% interest) on PAYE plan - doesn't even touch the principle, but included in public loan forgiveness program.
 
Mortgage: $1500/mo (includes property tax)

Childcare: ~$2000/mo - daycare (no family able to help)

Emergency fund: 1 month expenses

Utilities: ~$220/mo

Cable: ~$140/mo

Phones: ~$160/mo

Food: ~300/mo

Gas: ~120/mo (working &gt; 20 miles for both spouse and I)

Kids College: $200/mo total (529 account, $100/mo each kid)

Other Budget (detailed personally): ~$500 - includes budgeted car repair, medical bills, kids stuff/clothes/etc, tolls, haircuts, etc.

All said and done: this leaves about $200/mo extra right now to add to debt payments.

Details: I work in healthcare (why our loans were so large, no family help for degree) in a non-profit 503(c) institute, where my federal loans ($180,000) are under the public loan forgiveness plan (if this actually continues - loan potentially waived after 10 years with 8 years to go).  I understand I have made bad financial decisions when paying for college, I am really trying to make up for this.

We have a detailed budget and are strict about it. We've paid about $12,000 already the past 6 months. Hopefully our income increases this year (couple hundred/month if lucky). 

My current strategy is to pay CC debt, then snowball into the $4500 loan, then car loan, then the private student loans.  This might be done if we continue with this intensity in a couple years, but what about that mess of federal loans. Do I hope the PSLF program continues? Do I add this loan to the snowball and try to pay it off? I do not see much light at the end of the tunnel at the moment and see myself in debt for the next 15+ years. Should I start to deliver pizzas?  Any advice or thoughts? I can update my expenses if needed. Again, sorry if too long or generic post. I appreciate it PF.

personalfinance,A Financial Advisor Is Costing Parents A Lot of Money. Is There Anything I Can Do?,"My parents are nearing retirement age (64) and are pretty well off financially. They have a financial advisor with a big firm that likely charges 1% a year in fees. I looked through some of their financial statements recently and the advisor has them invested in many mutual funds with 1.25%+ expense ratios, many of which are in high risk equities with poor long-term performance. There were also a lot of relativity short-term buy and sell transactions of individual stocks (4 months - 3 years), which amounted to a net gain of essentially nothing. This bad financial advisor is costing my parents tens of thousands of dollars a year vs. just buying and holding a handful of low expense index funds.

I really want to help my parents out of this situation, but my dad still works 10+ hours a day and always acts like he has no time (or the professional expertise) to deal with his finances himself. The advisor is clearly just out to make a buck, but my dad seems to like him and won't take my advice that seriously because I am his child and not a financial professional. I'm worried they'll be stuck with this advisor for the next 20-30 years being fed increasingly bad investments, convinced he's a genius while their nest egg dwindles. Any advice as to how I can approach this situation? Are there any financial or legal movies I could make to minimize the damage this guy causes and/or help safeguard my parent's retirement?

personalfinance,US College Loans Starting Fall 2017,"So I'm currently looking into college loans, as I've just been notified that I will not be receiving the full tuition scholarship that I had applied and been in the finalists for. Oh well. It happens. So the following needs to be addressed for me to actually attend my chosen school for computer science, which is not up for debate to bring costs down. 


### (Current Estimated) Cost of Attendance


* Tuition - $23,988.00


* Fees - $800.00


* Room - $7,128.00


* Board - $1,800.00


* Books &amp; Supplies - $1,300.00


* Miscellaneous - $1,800.00


* Transportation - $1,400.00


**Total Budget** - $38,216.00



###FAFSA Awards per Semester


* Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan - $1750


* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan - $1000


* Richard J. Heiman Scholarship - $6000


- There is an available PLUS loan, but my parents' credit is not very good, and they have many, many liabilities already and would highly prefer to not put any more burden on them with that, if at all possible, but it *would* come out to $7,310 per semester


**FAFSA Loans and Scholarships Subtotal** (Without the PLUS loan) $17,500 annually


This now leaves me at around $21,000 short per year. My main questions would be : 


1. Where do I go for student loans? Are there certain banks/credit unions/etc that are better for this than others? I understand that it'd mostly be dependent on their interest rates, but how do I find out what those are without actually applying for loans yet?


2. Can I change my loan amounts each year of college? For example, if the budget for room and board changes, can I tell the company that loaned me money and alter my loan amounts for that year accordingly?


3. Does applying for student loans affect my credit score at all now, or only after graduation? They don't work like federal subsidized loans, where they don't get interest until after I'm finished with college, do they? Or are there other subsidized loans available...?


All help is welcome and appreciated, and I'm open to any and all constructive criticism. If it's any help, my college is located in the area between Baltimore, MD and Washington, DC, and the program I'm in offers a job guarantee at a competitive salary (for my field (computer science) and desired job, that means around $65-75k annually from my brief research). Actual budgeting for my post-college future will probably be a post on here in 4 and a half years, so. I'll worry about that when I get there. As far as I'm concerned, my education is worth investing in, especially with high potential to pay off the necessary loans within a reasonable amount of time post-graduation.

personalfinance,"I've saved enough money throughout college to pay off my $12,000 in Direct Subsidized Loans. Should I pay them off the day I graduate?","I am on a full tuition scholarship through my university. I have applied for financial aid for every academic year and taken out Direct Subsidized Loans (non-interest bearing while enrolled in school). The university has raised the tuition over my 4 year enrollment but has not raised my scholarship, so I have used these loans to cover the difference of what my scholarship no longer covers. I did not need to use the entirety of my loans, so each year I just place the remaining balance in my savings account and let it sit untouched. I acquired full time work during the last 2 years of my degree and have enough saved up to pay off the entirety of my loans outstanding loans the day I graduate in December. I have around 3,000 saved up in addition to the 12,000 saved for the purpose of paying back the loans, and a monthly take home of about 2000 dollars. My expenses are around 1200 a month, and the rest is put towards savings and extracurricular activities. I'm pretty good with money in the sense that I have my bills budgeted out about a month in advance, so having the 12,000 leave my account wouldn't leave me without any money. Obviously, there is an argument for keeping it until I have a bigger emergency fund saved up. I also plan to enter a graduate program in 2018, which will require me to take on more loans (just sharing that info in cases it changes anyone's advice). I am in the application process for graduate school, so the actual tuition cost is unknown. It could vary anywhere between 40-80k, but that doesn't start until August of 2018.  I have a relatively high credit score (~770) and a lot of that has to do with the age of my loans and the ""good standing"" I have with them due to the fact that I haven't needed to make payments on them because they are subsidized. I'm unsure if paying them off would affect that score, or if that is even something worth considering since clearing debt is better than a small hit to my credit score. My question is this: should I pay off the entire loan balance since I have the money just sitting in my account waiting to be paid, or is there a good argument to wait to pay it off for some reason? Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,"29/F Registered Nurse... make 65k/year but ~ 51k in student loan debt. Help! I have one Sallie Mae loan with 9% interest that I owe 16k for, and my federal loan is 35k.","Hi guys -

Accidentally posted this to the ""personal fianc√©"" sub yesterday, whatever that is.

I'm a 29 year old Registered Nurse. I have 1k in savings currently and dump 10% into my 401k (not sure how much is in there). I've been a nurse for a little over two years, and I used student loans to fund my college education while going through a divorce and not really having any financial guidance or realizing what the heck I was doing.

I used my tax money to pay off one of my two Sallie Mae loans (this one was for 3k). I have one remaining Sallie Mae loan - for 16k at 9% interest - that I pay $260/month for. My federal loan is 35k, and I pay $177/month on that. 

My other expenses are a car payment, which is $250/month, car insurance which is $120, rent which is $567, and utilities which are usually around $150. I also have a credit card which I have used about $400 on, I try not to use it. 

How can I get ahead? The Sallie Mae loan is a huge chunk of money each month. Consolidation would mean that my federal loans won't be forgiven (I work at an inner city hospital in Baltimore so my loans can be forgiven after 10 years of repayment). Part of the problem is that I can't even switch my federal loans to the ""income based"" payment which would make me eligible for repayment (it would end up being around $330 a month, not $177). 


My credit score is 620, but increasing. I don't make late payments and have paid off a few medical bills that were affecting my credit. 

I'm just trying to get ahead. I feel pathetic having 1k in my savings and I would like to have much more. My long term boyfriend and I would also like to purchase a house in the next year (he's a veteran with the VA loan, so we don't have to put anything down)... which I would feel better about, because I feel like I am wasting money by renting. 

Any advice is welcome!

personalfinance,Student loan question - My automatic payment to my higher interest loans have been reduced without a change in my payment plan.,"So I just discovered something that appears nefarious, but may be nothing. I am on a payment plan where I pay $420 each month. This payment is distributed between three different loans, two of which have a 3% interest rate and the third which is 6.5%. 

I recently paid off one of my 6.5% loans (yay!) and noticed that my high interest loan balance is not decreasing as much as it should be. When I looked online it shows that my payment each month should be $89 out of the automatic payment of $420 but for some reason the automatic payment is only sending $29 to the high interest loan. 

Prior to my payment of the other loan I was putting the full amount towards the high interest loan. 

Has anyone had any experience with this? I have a call in to the loan processor but they're taking forever to get back to me. 

Thank in advance.",finance

Last year, I ended up owing $27 in federal taxes and state and local were both $0. The way that I'm understanding a traditional IRA is that I could, because of my tax bracket, get 50% of my contributions as a non-refundable credit. Because it's non-refundable, does this mean that it would only apply to the $27 that I owed, or would it apply itself to the full amount that I owed for the year and give me a refund that totals 50% of my contributions-$27?

I have a few thousand dollars saved up, and my savings interest rate with WF is pretty abysmal, and I was thinking that if I have a decent amount of savings sitting around, I might as well invest and get better returns. 

I was looking into apps like Acorns/Stash because I'm not terribly interested in picking stocks (Michael Lewis dashed that interest against the wall), but it seems those apps gets a bad rap from this sub. It does seem that a lot of the criticism is from the high fees, but Acorns waives them for students.

personalfinance,I'm stuck between the lifestyle of the corporate world and that of a profitable restaurant business.,"Hi there everyone on r/PersonalFinance,

I am a bit of a long time lurker on reddit, and I have seen some many people helped out by the great people of this subreddit, and I guess I need a little help myself right now. 

I will give you a little back story on my situation, I am in mid twenties, have my bachelors degree in History (my true passion), I love to travel the world and have been to all sorts of places, I have no student or personal debt, and lastly (which this is kind of personal and a big one) but since almost half a year ago I was diagnosed with non-life threatening cancer (the doctors say I will live a long healthy, and normal life). With this illness, luckily I am getting the chemo pills for free, though I do have to pay the co-pay 3 monthly and regular MRIs and Oncologist check up. Thankfully I still have federal insurance through my mother, but that will run out in the coming years as I will turn 26. So health insurance is a big one for me. 

So I guess right now I am stuck between two different types of life-styles and also careers. Being a history major there wasn‚Äôt much luck for jobs for people that didn‚Äôt want to be a high school teacher or professor, though I may not be looking in the right places. So I decided to pick up the pen and begin writing on either my travels or history in itself and I have done pretty well with that, I‚Äôve gotten published in different areas of the internet and also for some of my states magazines. As well I had been taking up interning positions for historical societies here and there, but they only provide ‚Äúexperience.‚Äù

The first career/ job is something I have been doing since high school working at a smaller seaside and seasonal restaurant as the cook and the manager, which is open from the beginning of April to the end of September. I do pretty well for myself here and quite close with the owners who are like the brothers that I never had (abiet that they are great deal older than me) but regardless they are like family. The summers are tough, hot and long, but after all that work, I get laid off and begin to collect unemployment or pick up a side job until the next April when they open. Which is just not a very good lifestyle, I feel. This has begun to ware on me since I have been there for almost a decade of my life now, which is a long time to stay at one job. So I decided to do the rational thing and move to cooperate world, and pickup a job a nearby city which works in the healthcare data field. 

Which leads me to my second job. As I was looking for a more stable and reliable job I found a marketing and content writer for a healthcare database company, not the perfect fit for a history major I know, but it did describe a lot of writing and graphic design which I really enjoy. I am doing really good work there, my boss tells me on my peer reviews every week so I will most will be hired on full time when the end of my internship to hire is over. Though this job does not come without its imperfections. And yes we do some good work and every once and a while I get the sense of accomplishment, but those times are few and far between.  I have to wake up at 530 every morning, to catch a train that I almost miss almost everyday and get in by 7 or 8, which then I don‚Äôt get home until about 5 or 6 depending on the godforsaken train schedules in this area, so that is about 2 hours of commuting. I also have do a lot of menial jobs, I get it, I am new and I have to put in my time and all that, but for task that the management recognized could be done more efficient for a programmer intern to do rather than someone in the marketing department to do. I also am not used to working in cubicles (ie. sitting around in one spot and staring at a computer screen) and since no one else except my boss is in the marketing department, I don‚Äôt really have much daily interaction with anyone else in the office. I am miserable when I come home from work everyday, and it really wears down on my person and everyone around can sense it. But when I bring this up to other people they say, ‚Äúoh yeah it just takes some getting used to.‚Äù But I‚Äôm not really seeing me getting used to this. Regardless in my contract I have an option to leave or be let of by the office within the first 3 months of being there.

Let‚Äôs get down to the nitty gritty then shall we, after telling my boss at the restaurant I wanted to leave I was met by an offer from them I would:

- Get a pay raise to 16 dollars an hour, but also make bi months tips adding an extra 1.50 - 1.60  to my pay  
Work 40 hours of regular work and another 10 overtime 
And in 2-3 years when one of the owners leaves I would be given the opportunity to partner up with the other owner. Which mind you this business for only being seasonal makes a hefty yearly profit, as one of my bosses owns two houses one in Florida and the other built and paid off his house in a year
Health Insurance which I obviously need for 30% of the monthly bill

But obviously it doesn‚Äôt come without its imperfections either. Long hot summers, sometimes crappy employees, and no work during the winter and the waining months of the year. But it is still 5 months off. 

The other position in marketing offers:

-16 dollars an hour for their interns, and a possible pay raise which I am not sure of yet
-Health insurance 
-And the most valuable part of it all experience

Though again it has its pitfalls as explained above. I also have no idea if the company is a good-in they posted a loss in profit last year so I am not sure.  And also, I you were to calculate the time away from home as 2 extra hours commuting every day thats 80+20=100 on a bi-weekly scale. Which then when divided by my biweekly pay 1280/100=12.80. Which for the time away from home is a pretty crappy way of paying.

So I guess I am just stuck a looking for advice on what to do, either stick with a job that I know I enjoy at times and could have a big payout in the end, and look for more writing and history jobs in my spare time. Or go corporate and hope that I either get used to it, or just stop caring (though given my circumstances of my health is not a great outlook.) I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve waffled on for quite sometime now and I would like to thank you for your time if you are reading this.  I hope I have provided you guys with enough information to get some advice if you have any question feel free to ask, and I would love some advice!!!

personalfinance,How much car can I afford?,"Hi. Sorry this is so long and apologies if this is not formatted correctly, I'm fairly new to reddit and can't figure out the formatting. TLDR; how much car can I afford to buy?


I'm 29 and need to get a car as my old one bit the dust. I currently make 78k/year gross. I don't have any credit card debt but I have huge student loans from my masters degree which I just graduated with - $58k. They're federal loans and the interest rates are between 5.2 and 5.7%. I don't want to refinance because I lose some protections of the federal loan if I do that. The minimum payment is $675 but I pay $1100 every month.  I'm also contributing 11% towards my company's 401(k). They will match 6% starting this summer. I have over a 6 month emergency fund saved and about $6k for a down payment.

Current budget:

Take home pay after taxes, insurance, 401kcontributions - $4100

Rent - $600

Utilities/internet - $100

Grocery - $300

Student Loan - $1100

Entertainment/Restaurant - $100 (I know this is high, I can cut it down if need be but being honest with you what it currently is)

Medical bill - $400 (until my deductible is met in a couple months)

Phone - $50

Transportation - $100 (I've been taking the bus but I'm moving and it won't be an option anymore)

Gifts/donations - $150

Coffee (I know, I know -unnecessary and can be cut--but at least I budget for it?) - $20

everything else I put into savings. I actually have $1k deposited directly into savings from my paycheck so that I at least save that much every month, but usually more



Buying a car I know my $100 transportation will obviously go up with gas and insurance and possibly payment if I get a small loan on a lightly used car.  I hate to take on more debt since my student loans are so high, but I also would like a decent car that is going to last me a really long time. Thoughts on how much I can afford?

personalfinance,Planning for a new car,"Hey guys. Wandering what the smartest way to go about this is. Me and my wife have 2 cars, a 2010 Chevy Malibu with 140k miles that's decently maintained and runs good, this is my point A to B car for work and school. We also have a 2015 Mazda6 that we've had for 2 years, we bought it new (I know, stupid, won't ever do that again), it already has 49k miles on (lots of highway/road trip miles). I got the car 26k, I owe ~15k on it now with 7% APR (ouch) and the car blue books for about that much (I think 16k last I checked). We brought a new baby into the world a year ago, our 2nd kid, and things are getting really cramped. We're hoping to get an SUV pretty soon. I've been contemplating how I want to do this and would like some advice.

We're gonna try and live with the car for another year (we're about to close on a house, kind of want to cool off a little before making another big purchase), should I try throw as much money as I can at the car loan to try and pay it down (realistically probably 500/mo, 1000/mo if I forgo my normal savings, on top of my regular 360/mo payment). Or should I keep making the minimum payment, and set that money aside for a down payment when we're ready to buy the new car? It would work out to the same, right?

I'm also thinking, from a value standpoint, maybe we should just trade in the older car that's paid off, keep the Mazda6 and try to refinance for a lower interest rate, and pick up a 2nd car payment. Guessing this wont be a very popular idea though. 

Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Questions about having W-2 and 1099 job,"Hi everyone,

So, I'm looking at starting a 1099 job doing webcam videos later this summer just for some on-the-side income, and had some questions about how taxes are going to work once I start doing this.

First of all, I'm 22, already have a job as a state university employee, and I made roughly $35,000 last year. Tax returns were about $600 and I don't claim any dependents, but my parents currently claim me. I'm moving out this year at the end of July, and will be starting this 1099 job once that happens (and I'm expecting my return amount to increase since I'll be financially independent).

I've read that 1099 employees should pay taxes quarterly, or adjust their W-4 forms accordingly, so the IRS gets its fair share of wages. I claim 0 dependents on both Federal and State Withholding, so I was wondering, am I covered, as far as paying taxes quarterly goes? If not, would it be easier on me to just pay my taxes in full every time tax season rolls around, letting it be deducted from my returns, so the whole thing gets sorted out all at once?

Thanks so much!",finance

personalfinance,Help! Boyfriend has no idea where to find out about his student debt,"Hey everyone!

My boyfriend has about 20k in student debt, two different loans, one federal and one private. Both have been defaulted on.

He never gets any money back for a tax return, somehow they're just gone. His money just disappears into the ether, it seems, and he's pissed. He has no idea who collects the debt, how much of it is going to interest and principal, and how much he still owes. 

How can they do this? It seems like it should be illegal.

Generally credit cards won't let me pay down my balance using other credit cards, and I don't have enough money in the bank to pay off my credit card and then just use it for my regular spending.

It seems like there should be a way to easily convert the cash advance balance to a credit card balance such as by buying prepaid debit cards with the credit card, and then using them to pay extra on the cash advance balance...but I don't know if this is practical or legal.

* JiangÔºàËíãÔºâ Jie Shi (KMT)

Jiang the Unworthy (losing china to communism through corruption and ignorance and involuntary drafting of farmers into his perpetually losing army despite huge US support) 

* Mao Ze Dong

Mao the Mad or Mao the Terrible (no intro needed)

* Deng Xiao Ping

Deng the Wise (Deng is never officially acknowledged as supreme leader of PRC, just supreme commander of military, but anyone with so much as a superficial understanding of China in 80s would agree he is the real pusher of china's glasnost, of course he also is the culprit of Tian'an Men massacre)

* Hua Guo Feng

Hua the Unexpected (this guy is the real chairman of PRC under Deng. Needless to say he is mostly a puppet, is selected because of his lack of will and will say yes to whatever Deng proposed, especially after Tian'an Men massacre, he is eventually ousted by Deng himself)

* JiangÔºàÊ±üÔºâ Ze Min (remember the guy with huge black-rimmed glass in the 90s? not the same surname as Jiang Jie Shi just the same pronunciation though ËíãÔºçÊ±ü)

Jiang the Magnanimous (Jiang is the most pro-american of the bunch and is the leader to see china's entry into WTO, sanctioned shitloads of economical liberation deal that largely made the china middle class; he expressed condolences pretty much instantly after 911, but he has a mad grip on power. You can still see him on sep 2016 parade)

* Hu Jin Tao

Hu the Meek (Hu is famous in the cadre of CCP high riders for his lack of assertiveness, makes no political allies, and therefore has no real saying in stuff like economical reform and foreign policy. It is also noteworthy that his ""ministers"" are mostly appointed by Jiang Ze Min, to those with a political nose I don't need to explain much)

* Xi Jin Ping (yes the guy you hear everyday)

Still undecided, but probably Xi the Tragic or Xi the Confessor 


 China is facing problems not imaginable to casual observers. **China's bona fide economical growth has virtually stopped since 2008,** now is driven purely by state financed debt Ôºç boy do they love Keynes - unfortunately much of CCP's legitimacy hinges on economical growth. Social unrest intensified - china pays as of now more money to its police to deal with uprising than to military. 'murica elected a maniac. Muslims in Xinjiang is giving him hell. But the biggest issue is the party itself. Xi himself said CCP as it stands now is like KMT in the 1948 - that's a year before communist victory, y'all. 



**on a somewhat unrelated note**

To those unfamiliar with Chinese domestic politics, the biggest issue is not human right or democracy, but people's discontent with the party elite's corruption. **Don't get your hopes up high, though - the middle class may be fed up with CCP, but that in no ways means they want a pro-american elected party.**


Plus, have we asked ourselves the real chilling question: 
What if china turns democratic and becomes even more aggressive and expansionist? After all, an elected government has nothing to worry about, it could totally give its people what they want - war and conquer (not that they can succeed with that ha! Good ole murica still has it). 

**To the faint hearted, I hate to break it to you but CCP is actually making china more docile, not more aggressive.** To be democratic means to be responsible to its people, and its people want china to be the top dog, to reshuffle the deck of cards that is US-dominated world politics. 

**Can we truly accept a world order that is led by another democratic-capitalistic superpower that happens to not have an ounce of similarity to us or western Europeans?** Is our long standing belief that western style government is the inevitable consequence of first-world socio-economic position valid, or it's just halo effect, i.e., hegemony correlates with westness and whiteness on the sample size of one that is us, hence westness and whiteness is the cause or effect of hegemony? (No I don't believe china can last as it stands today forever, but for it to be hegemonic it must turn democratic, it is now in no shape for any kind of fight.) 

TLDR of the above paragraph: **what if china becomes like us in terms of ideology (we the Chinese people, bla bla bla) but hates us?**

the Chinese, from top to bottom, are into the (local) empire business just as much as we are now or past. And history seems to teach them what will happen to them when they're not: **you can bet your pants there'll never be an isolationist, china-first lobby in democratic china. It's all or nothing.** Be careful what you wish for.

I'm not even mentioning they have a chip on their shoulders the size of Nanking against the japs. (**I still couldn't resist the temptation to break it to the faint-hearted: yes, the Taiwanese hate japs too, even more than mainlanders.** So much for the newly-democratic asians' brotherly love, gents. Nintendo and Sony and Lexus isn't how they see Japan)

personalfinance,Possibly taking a job overseas. Trying to determine the best option for my home in the US while overseas,"Hello Reddit,

I may have an excellent opportunity at my job to take an overseas delegation to Europe. My girlfriend and I currently have a home in NJ and are trying to plan ahead when the opportunity comes up, what we should do with our home here.

My company will pay for my housing in Europe which is an amazing perk. The reason they do this, is so that I could afford to pay my mortgage in the US and keep my home if I so chose. The downside is that if I sell the house, and take any loss, the company will not reimburse for those losses (which they do for domestic relocation).

The opportunity would be a 36 month delegation, most likely starting January 1, 2018. 

A little about our house:
We purchased the home June 1, 2016 and only put 5% down. We still owe ~$350,000 on the loan @ 4% interest rate.
Our mortgage payment is approximately $1700/month, mortgage insurance $300/month and property tax $1000/month. So we are paying about $3000/month for our home. In addition we pay about $120/month in homeowners insurance.

Option 1 (Sell the house):
Now, my thought is that if we sell the home before we leave, then we will be saving $3120/month. Over the 3 year span this should amount to ~$112,000.

Option 2 (Rent the house):
If we rent the house, I know a couple who would rent it for $1600/month. I know there are risks associated with renting, but I want to view this purely from a financial standpoint. If they were paying rent to us, over those 36 months, I believe we would generate $58,000 income. In addition, we would be building equity in our home for those 3 years. I've used some excel sheets to evaluate this and we should generate $21,000 in equity in our home by the time we return. Although, we would still only have 13% equity in the house, so we would still be paying mortgage insurance for a few years when we returned, if we were to make the minimum payments.

I would add an option for paying our mortgage as normal, but also applying the $1600 in rent to the principle also to hit the 20% equity faster, however I have $48,000 in student loans @ 7.4% which I believe would be more beneficial to pay off as quickly as possible. And this can be achieved through either option, but would be faster with option 1.

Please let me know your thoughts! I am also assuming that my salary will be adjusted upward to compensate for any loss of income that my girlfriend may face during the delegation.

personalfinance,Need advice on refinancing an auto loan,"Looking for some opinions on if it's worth it to refinance my auto loan in order to save up for a house to escape increasing rent prices in California:

I'm currently 32 months into my 60 month auto loan of $34k, with $18.5k left, currently paying $670/mo @ 6.75% interest rate. My credit score was in the low 600s when I first got the car loan out of college, but its now at 760+ so getting a lower interest rate is quite likely.

Note that in between a raise at work and restructuring my monthly expenses I should be able to save ~$1.2k/month for a house down payment. This refinance would add ~$300 @ to my savings, but another 60 months of payments. Not a huge increase, but every bit will help.

Is it worth it to refinance or should I bite the bullet and stay on track with paying it off in 2.5 years?

I found [this website](http://taxformcalculator.com/state_tax/new_hampshire/15000.html) that estimates how much you have to pay, but I have no idea if that's for w2 or 1099 (the article I found it on said 1099 but I don't see any confirmation on the site).

investing,Macroeconomics- A bubble? A couple points in which a discusison would be good.,"So I'll start off- I believe we're in a bubble. 

FED rates have caused massive gains in the market because well - it was the only game in town.

Trump rally has further pushed prices far past fair values- especially now that retail looks terrible. It is costing thousands of retail jobs. 

If Trump announces his repatriation plans and tax-cuts...we can expect a huge surge as well- adding on to the ""supposed"" bubble. 

Point 2 - Debt- I am skeptical of American companies investing and creating new jobs in the USA. They have been outsourcing jobs since forever and are moving towards automation. Why pay someone either here or in China when a robot can do it 24/7, and not ask for benefits or even a 10 minute break? That being said, American jobs aren't coming back. It's a sham to appease the infinite amount of blue-collared workers for a time. 

Our national debt in that case, will never go away and just keep increasing since the no.1 we make money is through federal income tax revenue. 

What happens? Your thoughts? What is the catalyst that causes the bubble to pop? People were able to see and recognize the disaster in 2009. It started with Bear and really came down with Lehman. 

In this case, what would be the Bear and Lehman of this bubble? When is our national debt too much national debt?

personalfinance,"30 YO single guy, am I stretching myself for taking 1m mortgage?","Hi Reddit,

I am considering purchasing a 2bd in central location in my city (Singapore) for own stay (and future rental after a few years). Expected closing price is 1.35m (seller bought at last cycle at 1.56m so selling loss of 200k, and it is really a steal in the area given the quality). I really like the location and it's 15 mins to walk. 

I need to take 1m loan for this property at 1.28% fixed rate for 2 years (saving interest rate with a 0.7% spread) so Monthly payment + maintenance fee all in is about 4k/month.  Rental income is about 3.5k/month if I decide to rent it out.

General market: it‚Äôs considered a soft market given government regulation to control the market. Interest rate is very low at1.3% ~1.5% (fixed for the first 2-3 years). Property taxes and insurance are negligible. Interest expense is NOT tax deductible. There might be some market headwinds in the next 1-2 years but in the long run most people believe housing market will continue to rise.

Me: just turn 30 in a stable good job (15k a month base salary with bonuses), total income after tax is around 250k/year without any major expense (other than this mortgage payment). If I want I can significant delever my mortgage after 2-3 years, I don‚Äôt have much time to invest my saving in other ways honestly.

So, am I able to afford this mortgage?  I have never taken debt in my life before, the idea of 1m debt sounds scary to me. Or should I get something cheaper (say 400k mortgage) at location outside of central town?

Edit: to add a bit flavour to the context, I am renting right now outside central about 1.7k month. I have been saving for the last year for the down payment so I don't have to pay other people's mortgage. Again property tax and insurance is negligible in my country so makes sense to buy than to rent if can afford. And mortgage is very cheap right now. Alternative housing choice is 800k 2bd in non central location, I can pay off mortgage in 2 - 3 years with that property",finance

personalfinance,"Looking for advice with regards to credit card debt, new medical bills and owed taxes.","Hello! I'll be honest right off the bat -- I'm not very good with personal finance and neither is my wife. For whatever reason, we really suck at it.

So, I have about 23k in credit card debt. Most of these cards are around 16% APR -- some of them are still in the introductory 0% period. About 6-9 months ago, I transferred about 10k to new credit cards that I had applied for to transfer balances. Each transfer costed me about $150 -- it was a percentage like 3% but I don't really remember.

So, there's that. About 2 years ago, I took out a loan to actually pay credit cards. The loan amount was 16k at 14.99% APR and an interest rate of 12.69% (I don't actually understand these two different interest rates to be honest). The balance now is 12k, the monthly payment being $400.

Most recently, I had fell ill and had to go to the hospital several times. I don't have an exact total but I'm most likely looking at $5-$8k in medical bills. On top of that, a quick glimpse at my taxes has me owing $5k in federal and $2k in state taxes. I went exempt for a few months last year during the holidays. That's just from turbotax -- I plan on seeing a professional about this because I have expenses from a small business I was trying to start and I'm hoping to right those off and do whatever else I can to lower that amount. So, to sum everything up:

* Credit Cards: **$23,000**
* Loans: **$12,000**
* Medical Bills: **$5,000 - $8,000**
* Federal Taxes Owed: **$5,000**
* State Taxes Owed: **$2,000**

So that's the big stuff. I'll be moving to a new job shortly, going from ~$80k salary to ~$95k. My wife makes ~$22k per year. For whatever reason, it just never seems to be enough. I've broken down the expenses that must be paid per month:

* Cars: **$550**
* Insurance: **$350**
* Rent w/ all utilities + Internet: **$1,900**
* Food: **$400**
* Misc: **$100**
* Gas: **$150**
* Loan: **$400**
* All CC Payments: **~$700**

My wife and I separated our bank accounts about 6 months ago when we were going through a rough time. She basically transfers over to me $700 every month and she keeps the rest (for her own credit cards, etc., which I haven't included here). Right now I'm paying ~$700/month in credit card payments + the $400 loan. I try to pay as much as I can but what ends up happening, is I pay too much and then we have little money for anything else. For example, this month I'm not sure what happened but we ended up with like no money. I had to dip into the savings to hold us over until next payday.

After my wife's transfers, my take home is about $4600.

personalfinance,How to challenge a defaulted student loan and erase the damage to my credit?,"Hello all,

I'm in need of some advice. As a recent college graduate, I had thought I rolled all my student loans into one monthly payment using the myGreatLakes service. However, there was one type of loan that was not included, a Federal Perkins Loan (FPL). Apparently this loan had to be paid using a different site (MyCampusLoan). This was completely unknown to me, as to the best of my knowledge, ALL my loans to be paid were compiled into myGreatLakes.


Long story short, I was happily paying the myGreatLakes payments every month on time, as I was supposed to. The FPL meanwhile was not getting paid every month, and defaulted. It defaulted without warning; I did not receive any emails from MyCampusLoan every month, or any notification whatsoever that this loan had gone into repayment, and needed monthly payments. It came completely out of left field. My credit dropped 100 points and I was alerted via an email notification from CreditKarma. 

I have since entered into loan rehabilitation for the FPL, but to my current understanding, that giant hit to my credit will still be there. Is there any way to erase it? Should I speak to a lawyer because I received no warning(s) from MyCampusLoan that my loan was about to default?

investing,"Is Charles Schwab (still) seen as generally more self-serving than Vanguard, and is this a problem/cause for concern for retirement accounts?","I recently opened an IRA with Charles Schwab, even though I know that Vanguard is the usual community choice, because its ERs and fees are now comparable to Vanguard (and its minimum initial investment is lower), and, additionally, it is known for having very good customer service and has actual brick-and-mortar locations.

I am planning on investing in a TDF, but [this review](http://www.mymoneyblog.com/schwab-target-date-index-funds-review.html) gave me pause and made me start questioning my decision to go with CS over Vanguard.

In particular (from the article),

&gt; In any case, even with the cap, the Investor Shares still cost more than the expenses from the underlying investments. You are basically paying 0.05% to 0.08% for some simple asset allocation. That means you could build your own portfolio using the same Schwab ETFs at a lower cost. **You could also get rid of the (unnecessary in my opinion) cash component, which currently only yields 0.43% with another temporary fee waiver as of 8/26/2016**. Personally, that‚Äôs what I would rather do, but I will admit that some folks will do better with an automated asset allocation.

and

&gt; This is a long-term play for Schwab, as **they‚Äôve all but admitted that the index ETFs themselves are currently losing money, while hoping to either make up the difference in other fees, services, or products somewhere down the line (like when interest rates rise again)**. Schwab will surely grab much more assets from employer retirement plans as a result of this move.

and

&gt; **However, if given the choice, I‚Äôd recommend my family to buy Vanguard Target Retirement funds first because Vanguard is not a for-profit company and I trust Vanguard more to keep customer interests first over the long run. (I believe that Schwab includes cash where it isn‚Äôt necessary in order to increase their future fees from money market funds, which are an important contributor to profits. This isn‚Äôt as significant here as in their robo-advisor product, but it will matter more as interest rates rise. More importantly, Vanguard doesn‚Äôt play such games.)** However, big-picture-wise they are very similar. I‚Äôd gladly recommend that they buy a Schwab Target Index fund in their 401(k) or 403(b) plan as they are likely the best options if available. This is a positive development overall for individual investors.

are concerning to me.

What is the community's thoughts on whether or not CS is ""playing dirty"" by having cash allocations to make profits off of (at the expense of better investment strategies for the investors)?

He owns his 2 cars, which is what we would for a down payment. He could probably sell one for about 10k. One weird thing is since he doesn't have a bank account (he should get one he just hasn't, we keep putting it off) he puts his checks into my bank account.

I am focusing on the larger loan but have started to wonder if I should refinance my student loans from under my parents name to myself to get a better interest rate. My concern is the impact on my credit score since right now it isn't appearing on my credit report and losing the protections that a federal student loan has. I've been paying $667 on the larger loan and could probably afford paying up to $850. The refinancing option that seems to be the best is at 4.74% fixed with a minimum payment of $788.

personalfinance,21 y/o college student studied abroad. Tax questions related to 1098-T form and eligible tuition expenses.,"In 2016 I studied abroad in Amman, Jordan from August 15th until Dec 1st, with a study abroad program affiliated to (partnered with, but not apart of) my school. The program fee (which includes a variety of things, among them tuition and housing) was $16,990. Currently, my 1098-T form reads that I had 13,000 in tuition related expenses, and 23,000 in scholarships and grants, the difference being treated as income. This is correct for my studies in the U.S last year, however this does not include any of my previously mentioned study abroad tuition expenses. The reason for this per my understanding is that the affiliated program I studied with is not an accredited educational institution from the Department of Education (DOE), which was confirmed to me by the affiliated program. My question is,  if I were able to figure out exactly what % of the $16,990 was for tuition, could I add this to my tuition expenses, or am I prohibited from doing so because of a lack of accreditation? If it helps, I was a registered student at the University of Jordan (which is not on the DOE's accredited institution list as well), I received 25 academic credits for my work completed abroad that transferred to my public 4-year college in Washington State, I have a University of Jordan transcript, and paid for the program with  a mixture of scholarships, state and federal grants, and one small loan, all via the DOE.

personalfinance,A question on interest rates: A larger loan amount would have a higher or lower interest rate?,"Been receiving conflicting observations throughout my life and I'm here to clear it up once and for all. Which would attract a higher interest rate - a bigger or smaller loan?

I've heard lecturer/colleagues arguing for both, with arguments structured around: 

Larger loans are more expensive to compensate the lender for additional risk taken up. I've seen this mainly in commercial term loans where lenders quoted a higher interest when a higher amount is seeked. I assume this is also consistent with longer tenure loans.

OR

Smaller loans are more expensive, since instead of dealing with one counterparty, the lender has to approach more borrowers to give out the equivalent amount of loans, hence increasing transaction costs. Economies of scale, in a way. This is also true for shorter tenures, which I observed from personal loans. Shorter, smaller loans seem to attract higher rates.

personalfinance,What would be the best way for me to start putting away money for a house down payment?,"My girlfriend and I currently own a house together, and I've decided I want to start putting some money away for a down payment on our next, permanent home (we've known since the beginning that our current house is just a starter house for us so we could get used to home ownership). Here's some background on me:

**Age**: 31  
**Yearly Income**: 70k-95k (70k base plus up to 25k in commission/bonus).  
**Debt**: None, other than our monthly mortgage, which we split.  
**Credit score**: mid to high 700s  
**Savings**:

* *Vanguard IRA (rollover from my previous company's 401k)* - ~$97k, contributing monthly and planning to max out each year

* *Fidelity 401k (current company)* - ~$12k, contributing 13% of each paycheck

* *Investment account through my bank* - ~$81k, contributing $200 each month.

* *Money Market savings* - ~$11k (this is my ""emergency fund"" account)

* *Checking* - ~$35k

My checking account has way more in it than I really need. My thought is that I would decide on a threshold for my checking account, and anytime my balance goes above that threshold, I would transfer the difference into my money market account. Considering my spending habits, which are pretty low, I figure this would start to add up nicely over the next couple of years. Then, when we decide to get a new house, I'd have a nice amount to use as a down payment. For our first home, I took money from my bank's investment account, which I'd prefer not to do next time since that earns pretty well on the stock market.

Is this a good plan, or should I consider a better way to put away money? My MM account is basically liquid, and earns a paltry 0.09% interest rate (it could earn 0.60% if I made 5 debit card transactions each month, but I never remember because I always use credit).",finance

personalfinance,(US citizen living in EU) Going on a conference that will be paying me after it is over and I cannot afford the lodging before.,"TLDR at the top for clarity: Attending a conference that will be giving a stipend after the conference. I can't afford the cost of travel AND the housing, but can't get the money early and don't have anybody to borrow from. Hard to get accepted for a credit card, especially when I am living outside of the US. 

Hey PF, I really need help (read: a miracle) about now. Let me explain and please advise if there are gaps or you need elaboration. Short of it is that I am a Masters student and got invited to a conference in Ireland at the end of April. Really excited because it is through a good scientific network, I get to share my research and it is in line with my studies. The conference host even gives out awards to people that complete the training courses (more than enough for a stay). It will be for 5 days at the end of the month, and I purchased the tickets using SkyScanner. I got a very good deal by shifting around flights and already paid for the tickets last month. However, in order to get the best deal it was more prudent to stagger the tickets for a week and I will couchsurf or go to a hostel the day before and the day after.

The conference hosts set us up for a hotel that is right outside of the area we are going to be at and we got a discounted price on the stay. For most people at the conference (professionals), this expense is quite affordable. However, on my student budget, it is a bit of a stretch. I do need to be at the housing just for practicality purposes and all, and I can just afford it if I have nothing else to do. Is this making sense? 

I have additional expenses before the end of the month, and the trip + housing will run me dry and well into the negative. For numbers purposes, the housing will be 435 Euros and the stipend is 1050 Euros. I have some savings, but I don't know if it is enough t manage safely that much wiggle room (spoiler: it isn't). I applied for a couple of credit cards in the US, but I live abroad and it is a bit hard to translate my financial statements over or to get it accepted and the promise of money is not very good collateral. I wouldn't like to get a cash advance/loan, and would like to see other options.

I can't borrow from friends or family; we are all run dry. I can't borrow from my adviser and I cannot borrow that much from work. Basically, I just need 500-600 to cover the housing and some peripheral expenses and then just pay it back once the funds are dispersed. I considered the paypal credit card but it doesn't look very appealing and it has absurd interest rates and is not really tailored to what I need. 

Basically, what I need from you guys (aside from a loan, haha) is advise on what outlets I can look at. The money is guaranteed after the conference; I just don't have enough to cover me now. It is hard to get local banks to support me and US banks are going to be a bit hesitant. What can I do?

Any advice is welcome. 

TLDR again: going to a conference where money is dispersed after but need money now. Can't borrow from anybody and not sure what, if any, CC can accept me. What can I do?",finance

personalfinance,TSP Loan and Construction Loan dilemma,"Ok, this is going to be long.  I apologize in advance and appreciate anyone willing to read and offer their thoughts.

I just bought a piece of vacant land for $83.5k.  I am in discussions with a builder to build a house, attached garage, and detached garage for best guess $420k.  All said and done I figure house plus land is about 500k value (503.5k).

I was going to buy the land with a construction loan and begin building immediately but the builder didn't' provide pricing information in time to lump the purchase with building.  I didn't have enough to close on the land with cash so I made a snap decision and took out a personal loan for 15k at 6.9% interest for a year.  The payment is around $1300.  I am debt free so the monthly payment is well within my budget.  

Here is the rub with the personal loan that I did not think about before applying: now my debt to income is higher because of the $1300 a month payment.  I was already pre-approved for my construction loan but I fear that when I actually apply, underwriting may balk about the debt to income ratio.

The bank has also been a bit of a butt-pain.  I don't know if it is the area (Tampa Bay area) or construction loans in general.  I've spoken to three banks and each one has its own hang-ups with construction loans.  At any rate, the bank I'm looking at will not lock in a 30 year rate for a constriction loan.  Instead I have to lock a 5/1 ARM in and then convert it to whatever the 30 year rate is at final closing.  I would rather do a 20 year loan anyway so I asked about locking it a 20 yr. rate.  My debt to income on a 20 year loan was too high by 2.5% so they wouldn't do it.  The big issue here is I'm living in a house that is paid off.  I am going to sell this house near the end of construction and use the proceeds (approx. 200k after closing fees) to pay down the new loan before it converts to a traditional mortgage.  As soon as I sell my house I no longer have a debt to income ratio.

All that is background information, here is my real decision point:

I could take out a TSP loan and either just pay off the personal loan, or take out a larger amount (capped at 50k), pay off the PL, and use the rest to pay down the construction loan before it converts to traditional financing.  I am leaning towards taking out the max (50k).  Having the leftover $36.5K might even allow me to lock in a 20 year today before rates rise again by lowering my debt to income ratio.

For those of you unfamiliar, the TSP is the federal governments 401k.  For a fee of $50 I can borrow my own money and pay it back with interest (non-tax deductible of course) to myself.  The current interest rate is 2.375%.  I would pay back the $50k over the course of 5 years, being $409 every two weeks via payroll deduction.  I am fairly certain I will be gainfully employed by the federal gov until I retire in 20 plus years (not to start a political discussion but I work for the DoD and Trump is looking to give the DoD more money, not less).  Another plus for a TSP loan is it doesn't show up on a credit report as being a debt.  I borrow 50k and it doesn't affect my debt to income ratio at all, well at least not on paper.

The downside to TSP loans are that if quit or lose my job the loan is due in full...don't see either of those happening.  Another downside is I might potentially lose out on earning of the 50k borrowed.  With the current bull market going almost ten years and the price of the stock market, I see the market deflating in the near future.  

I've ran the numbers and if the market does the following here are the repercussions:

Note these numbers are from a compound interest calculator using 5 year annualized numbers and factor in the $409 I pay would pay myself back every two weeks.

* Market gains 10% a year, I lose $17,500 in earnings
* Market gains 6% a year, I lose $5940 in earnings
* Market gains 3% a year, I lose $379 in earnings
* Market is flat, I GAIN $3170 by paying myself back
* Market loses 3% a year, I gain $5197
* Market loses 6% a year, I gain $6098
* Market loses 10% a year, I gain $7094

What I'm really looking for a sanity check.  Am I missing anything?  The way I see it there is a lot of upside to borrowing from myself.  This is especially true if I borrow from myself at such a low rate, then stock market falters, or stalls, for the next couple of years.  I personally think this is the most likely case given the length of the current bull run and high cost of stocks.  

I also see an upside to borrowing less money mortgage wise; besides lowering my monthly payment, it also saves interest $36.5k borrowed at 2.375 versus borrowed at ~3.9 percent on a mortgage.

Am I wrong?  Am I missing something?

I welcome all criticisms of my assumptions and reasoning.  I want to make sure I take all the information into account before deciding on such a huge issue.",finance

Bottom line is it looks like if you want to invest in Mary Jane's U.S. surge, you're gonna have to take a lot of risks as an individual investor in local businesses and weed-related projects. Not exactly fine-tuned yet for the Average Joe and his retirement funds.

personalfinance,I'm 25 and I have 47 thousand in tax debt and 10 thousand in misc debt. Do I go bankrupt?,So i'm 25 and I make about 40k per year. I owe back taxes for two years 2013-2014. I originally paid taxes those years but was audited in 2015- 2016 where I was told I owe substantially more and hit with interest and penalties. The tax debt amounts to about 38k to the IRS and and 8-9k to the State. I have another 10 thousand in misc debts related to school (no student loans) and some medical. I have made arrangements to make payments to the IRS however it doesn't even put a dent in the principal as the interest rates continue to increase. I cannot afford to make substantial payments to both the state and the IRS. This leaves me wondering if I should go bankrupt. If I am unable to get ahead of the interest and actually pay off the principal within the statute of limitations regarding tax debts (10 years I think) all the while paying out 30-40k before then.  Should I just take the hit for 7 years and file chapter 7 and only spend a few thousand?,finance

personalfinance,Are we cutting it too close?,"Hello,

My fiance and I are purchasing a home. I have this uneasy feeling that we are cutting it too close, so I figured I'd crowd source some opinions.

Currently, the two of us have 65K in savings. Our monthly combined take-home is roughly $7600/month. We are currently living rent-free until July 1st, at which time we'll pay $4050 for 3 months.

We are getting married in July, which will cost us at most $7500.

We're purchasing a 300k home and putting down 10%. Our loan amount is going to be 270K and we'll pay closing costs and prepaids, which are estimated to be between 4-7k.

The estimated interest rate on our loan at closing is suggested to be between 4 and 4.5%. Using 4.5% as worst case scenario, our estimated full monthly payment will be 2,000/month, including insurance and taxes. This amount will be reduced for the first 12-18 months by about $400/month due to local tax laws.

About $80/month will also come off once we hit 78% LTV, which I hope to achieve within 12-18 months.

I estimate by the time we close, we should have about 75k in savings, again being conservative.

This means that after closing and our wedding, we'll reduce our savings to about 25k, which will largely be our emergency fund.

So using conservative estimates and our current incomes, we're looking to be able to save ~$2500/month after paying all living expenses. $1000/month of this will go towards retirement savings.",finance

27 Firms and Individuals Charged With Fraudulent Promotion of Stocks

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2017-79

Washington D.C., April 10, 2017‚Äî

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced enforcement actions against 27 individuals and entities behind various alleged stock promotion schemes that left investors with the impression they were reading independent, unbiased analyses on investing websites while writers were being secretly compensated for touting company stocks.

SEC investigations uncovered scenarios in which public companies hired promoters or communications firms to generate publicity for their stocks, and the firms subsequently hired writers to publish articles that did not publicly disclose the payments from the companies.  The writers allegedly posted bullish articles about the companies on the internet under the guise of impartiality when in reality they were nothing more than paid advertisements.  More than 250 articles specifically included false statements that the writers had not been compensated by the companies they were writing about, the SEC alleges.

‚ÄúIf a company pays someone to publish or publicize articles about its stock, it must be disclosed to the investing public.  These companies, promoters, and writers allegedly misled investors by disguising paid promotions as objective and independent analyses,‚Äù said Stephanie Avakian, Acting Director of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Enforcement.

According to the SEC‚Äôs orders as well as a pair of complaints filed in federal district court, deceptive measures were often used to hide the true sources of the articles from investors.  For example, one writer wrote under his own name as well as at least nine pseudonyms, including a persona he invented who claimed to be ‚Äúan analyst and fund manager with almost 20 years of investment experience.‚Äù  One of the stock promotion firms went so far as to have some writers it hired sign non-disclosure agreements specifically preventing them from disclosing compensation they received.

‚ÄúDeception takes many forms.  Our markets cannot operate fairly when there are deliberate efforts to reach prospective investors with positive articles about a stock while hiding that the companies paid for those articles,‚Äù said Melissa Hodgman, Associate Director of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Enforcement.

The SEC filed fraud charges against three public companies and seven stock promotion or communications firms as well as two company CEOs, six individuals at the firms, and nine writers.  Of those charged, 17 have agreed to settlements that include disgorgement or penalties ranging from approximately $2,200 to nearly $3 million based on frequency and severity of their actions.  The SEC‚Äôs litigation continues against 10 others. 

The SEC also instituted [separate charges against another company](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2017/33-10345.pdf) for its involvement in circulating promotional materials that did not comply with prospectus requirements under the federal securities laws.  The company settled the case.

The SEC today [released an investor alert](https://investor.gov/additional-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alert-beware-stock-recommendations) warning that articles on an investment research website that appear to be an unbiased source of information or provide commentary on multiple stocks may be part of an undisclosed paid stock promotion.  Investors should never make an investment based solely on information published on an investment research website.  When making an investment decision, thoroughly research the company using multiple sources.

‚ÄúStock promotion schemes may be conducted through investment research websites,‚Äù said Lori Schock, Director of the SEC‚Äôs Office of Investor Education and Advocacy.  ‚ÄúInvestors looking for objective investment information should be aware that fraudsters may use these websites to profit at investors‚Äô expense.‚Äù

The SEC‚Äôs investigations were conducted by Beth Groves, Ian Rupell, Shelby Hunt, Jim Blenko, and Jonathan Jacobs with assistance from Michi Harthcock, Jamie Wohlert, Suzanne Romajas, and Frederick Block.  The cases were supervised by Rami Sibay, and the litigation will be led by Ms. Romajas and Patrick Costello.

personalfinance,"Messed up badly buying a car, need advice.","Alright so this was my first time buying a car from a dealership(used car dealership) I've always paid cash for cars before this.

The reasoning was that I have literally nothing on my credit and I wanted to start building it, so I was desperate to just get something, anything, that I could.  I wasn't really thinking at the time but now that I've had it a few months I feel pretty stupid.

First major problem, I agreed to pay $13,999 for a car that is worth at most $9000.

The second VERY major problem is that my interest rate is 24.99%!  This means I'll be paying $22,000 for a $9000 car by the time I'm done.

Like I said, really stupid.  I was desperate to get into something.  Now one positive thing is that there's no pre payment fee, so I'm currently talking with a bank about refinancing at a MUCH lower interest rate.

Is there anything else that I should consider doing to take away as much pain from this as possible?",finance

personalfinance,(EU-FIN) 11k student debt at halfway through university,"Hello, I will go straight to the point.

I am in my early 20's with minimal income and no way to make more without losing the state assistance. I have 2k in my bank account earning 0.25% (most you can get while still having the flexibility to withdraw whenever you want without penalties) and 11k student debt at 0.5% with Euribor 12 months being negative whatever that means.. The loan is part of the state assistance (400 per month) and has to be taken for each semester. If you do not take it, you lose the ability to take it.

My income is 500 state assistance, 150 family, 500 part-time job(new and temporary, only 3 months with 2 months left).
My major expenses are 450 rent, 250 fitness, 25 phone bill, 50 gasoline and rest is mostly food and entertainment for myself and my pet and stuff like clothes. My expenses overall are around 900/month including everything. I spend money to keep myself happy but not too often, so some months are closer to 800 while others are closer to 950 averaging about 900 per month. I have a credit card with a 1k limit that I use for online purchases/big purchases to get the protection things. Car stuff is taken care of by family, I just pay for the gasoline and occasional small repairs.

Upon graduation in 3-4 years I will have 20-25k debt total and will most likely be employed at 20k-25k in the tech field. Finland is a welfare state so no health/retirement/unemployment etc. concerns since all of it is covered by mandatory payments our employers take out of our salaries we have no control over.

personalfinance,Purchasing First Home - need help with HELOC,"Hello. My wife and I are looking to purchase our first home.  Here is a background on our financial situation:

I am currently in school and work part time for a negligible income of about 25k that pays my tuition and car payment, car insurance, etc.  It just covers all my bills.  I graduate in 1 year with a computer science degree.  As far as debt goes, I owe 4K on my car and have about 20k left in student loans from my first degree. 

My wife is bread winner.  She is anesthesiologist and has been working for approximately 16 months now (since January of last year).  Her income last year before taxes was $402,000.  This year she is on track to make $480k and possibly more.  Her debt consists of her car which is approx 25k and her student loans which are approximately 5k (she paid one off completely and it lowered her credit because it dropped the age of her credit, so she is purposely leaving 1 open). 

We both have over 800 credit.  We have 170,000 in the bank. Of that, approx 140k has been saved since my wife started her job 16 months ago.  We would have saved more but we had wedding that was 35k. 

So, we have found a home we like and it looks like our offer will be accepted for 1.45m if we choose to move forward.  We were pre-approved by capital one for a 1.5m loan with 10% down that we used to make the offer, but the loan includes PMI and the monthly payments are high.  We need 1.5 for closing costs and such. We are currently searching for loans from other lenders.  What we have found is lenders wanting to do a 30 year fix or 10:1 with 20% down.  Of that 20%, 150k would be cash we put down and 150k would come a home equity line of credit (HELOC). This way we would avoid PMI and have more reasonable monthly payments.  

We are nervous about doing a HELOC and could use some advice.  We feel like we could pay down the HELOC fairly quickly, by as I understand it's a line of credit, so we are basically making payments to have the line of credit and have to pay down the principal separately.  In addition to that, all the HELOCs we've discussed have adjustable rates.  With the fed increasing interest rates, we don't want to get caught making huge payments.  

I feel like if you need a HELOC, you can't actually afford the house, but in this case, we CAN afford the house, we just haven't had enough time to save at our current income level to build up a full 20%.  In another year we could do it though. 

Should we go with a HELOC or forgo the house and wait till we have the full 20% in cash?  Another thing to note is our apartment is 3k a month, so if we wait another year we are basically throwing away $36,000.  

Thanks for any advice you can offer!",finance

Currently working full time, annual net of around $40k. For the past year or so I've been developing a tech platform, and this past week I began funding negotiations. The initial valuation and projection is very promising, but I am terrified.

I may be the archenemy of /r/personalfiance. Plain and simple, I am terrible with money.

I'm finding out that most of the money is still going on interest, I want to refinance for a lower rate of interest, but is there anything that I should know before applying?

I had a co-signer on all these loans, its likely not probable for me to get another co-signer as my parents have horrible credit, and my co-signer I used, just not going down that road.

Also, would applying for a refinance hurt any chances of a future car loan? I don't plan on getting one, but I don't want to be surprised later if I do.

Also, I was uneducated when I got these loans, my mom talked me into the fixed rate which was obviously higher. What risks do you take with a variable interest rate loan? Like I'm seeing 2.5-6.5%, can it ever go above the 6.5%?

$38,007.47 Fed Loan consolidated in Dec. 2015 @ 5%. 

$6,156.51 with Wells Fargo (technically two loans) @ I believe, also 5%. 

Total is $44,163.98. When I started payments in Jan of 2016 the balances were around $49.5k and almost 7k respectively. During 2016 I was in Florida working as I had just moved from Wisconsin to take a job. I was making decent money and my payments were supposed to be around $240 for the red loans if I recall correctly. The Wells Fargo loans were $100 in total a month. I immediately started at $350 every month to try to get ahead of the fed loans, and paid the Wells Fargo minimum at $100, as it was easily doable given what I was making and could still try to save up an emergency fund after the move. At the end of 2016 I moved back to Wisconsin and now I make a little less, $55k a year, and take a bit less home due to taxes. Due to this I started paying $300 a month on my fed loans in February of this year, while my Wells Fargo loans have remained at about $100 a month from the get go. I also took my entire tax refund and put it towards the fed loan balance this past February. 

I have been considering refinancing, but I've seen a lot of people say to not refinance due to federal loans having more flexibility if you fall under financial hardship and such. Again, I'm months ahead of the schedule on my fed loan balance right now, so if things got bad suddenly I could stop paying, but honestly that isn't ideal. My credit score is 750 as of now, and I was considering adding myself as an authorized user on one of my grandparents credit cards (whom has outstanding credit) and seeing if I could refinance afterwards with a lower interest rate. Right now, every payment I make towards my loans, about half goes to interest. 

*speaking strictly refinancing,* is there any reason not to? What are all the pros and cons? I am simply trying to see if I can reduce some of the interest I'm currently paying.",finance
personalfinance,(CAN) Need advise on using modest inheritance to pay mortgage,"General info  
Currently owe on mortgage = $205,000  
Mortgage Interest rate = 2.6%  
Inheritance = $143,000  
Will amortize in 2020  
Only other debt, car owing $19k and LOC $25k  

So im getting a modest inheritance and want to do the right thing with it all and pay down debt.  First thing to go is the car payment right off the bat.

I want to pay off as much on my mortgage as possible so hopefully in 2020, there's as little left as possible.  

My mortgage banker said to pay off the car and LOC then take the remainder and slap it right on the mortgage and eat the penalty of $3500 saying we'd pay more in interest just maxing payments and lump sums in the 3 years than taking the penalty.

Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT:  Guess I should mention what I had thought about doing.  
1. Pay off car totally  
2. Make yearly max lump sum payment on mortage as allowed penalty free  
3. Have the bank take mortage payments out of inheritance account  
4. Divert my normal payments I would have made to the mortgage to the LOC which would have it paid off in about 2 years.",finance

I'm barely touching the actual bill with this payment. i have an emergency fund about the size of this bill but don't want to drain it to cover up my mom's mistakes, especially when i'm living alone, working and in college and don't really have a lot of disposable income. 

My mom just got past the 7 year mark on her last felony (grand theft auto of my grandma's car) so i REALLY don't want to put another felony on her record and after this amount of time am not really sure what to do as i've been making the payments and haven't reported the charges (but did freeze and replace the card). 

She claims she mailed me money last week but i haven't seen it, and i've repeatedly told her to personally bring the money to my house because she lives like 20 minutes away. i asked her to go to our local credit union and take out a personal loan to pay me back but am not even sure if that's possible, especially given her awful credit.

personalfinance,About to graduate. Need to start thinking about finances.,"So I'm going to graduate soon and I have a job in my field lined up starting on the 1st. While I was in school I hadn't put a whole lot of thought into how exactly I'm going to go about paying off my loans or how I'm going to budget my life from here on.

The job pays ~$40k/year ($35k [$19/hour for 37.5 hours/weekly for 50 weeks] + comission) 

My expenses are: $600/month for rent + $70 phone bill + $107/month gas ~$100/month groceries. That's the bare minimum. I live with my brother who handles the other half of expenses. (Internet, hydro, etc)

So that's the bare minimum.

Assuming (obviously incorrectly) that my gross pay of $35k has no taxes that would leave me with $2091.75 of discretionary income.

It's been a while since I've been in the workforce and I don't remember how much used to be taken off my cheques for EI and stuff like that. I also don't know if the contribution scales up as you earn more like income taxes do.

Speaking OF income taxes. Based on the information already provided, how much money should I be setting aside to pay for taxes? I've never had to pay taxes before. I've always been dirt poor and haven't ever worried about it.

I've kind of done this job in another industry before (working for brighthouse rather than TD) and my sales numbers were the 6th best out of an employee pool of ~400. At brighthouse my sales were able to increase my wage by about 25%. 

What sort of planning should I make around additional income based on commission? Should I set more aside for taxes, etc?

Then come student loans. I have ~$28k in debt. In 2015/16 the debt is split 50/50 between Ontario and Canada where I owe the Ontario government money +1% interest + prime rate (2.7%) and federally I owe 2.5% + prime. I'm writing this from my phone and don't have the exact numbers immediately available but I can pull them up if necessary.

For 2016/17 the debt structure is more obfuscated and I could not find which government I owe how much, only that I owe around $11k at an unknown interest rate. What is the 2016/17 osap interest rate?

With regards to student loans I am unsure of whether or not I should pay them down in full as quickly as I can or should i make minimum payments and invest the additional money elsewhere?

If I substract the effects of inflation then my expected real interest rate on the loans is ~1.7% on the Ontario portion of the debt and ~3.2% on the federal portion. (I use approximately since the prime rate is subject to change and the inflation rate over the last 5 years has been about 1.6% and not the 2% target)

The alternative of course is the market. I'm quite a bit more savvy when it comes to large-scale finance than personal finance and have identified multiple potential sources that would net me a higher financial yeild than paying back my debt. 

For example: I found one bond from the government of quebec that pays an interest rate of about 12%. S&amp;P ascribes about a 0.07% chance of default. (Yes I know this one is absurdly high)

But the prime rate has been much higher in the past and has even been as high as 14% before. At present rates that bond would be a much better investment but that 12% is fixed. It would be a valid point to bring up that market transaction costs are a thing, though by around october I will have the credentials to trade professionally and will incur much more negligible costs.

So the question from all of that is what sort of consequences are out there if I don't pay down my debt in full? 

What sort of debt repayment assistance programs exist for me? Would I qualify for any of them? I haven't spent as much time as I admittedly should have as I'm not quite done school yet.

personalfinance,First Time Home Owner - getting ready for appraisal,"Hi Everyone.

I am getting ready to purchase my first home. It does happen to be a new home in a really nice area. Now I did slightly push the budget since I know this is going to be more than a starter home. Most starter homes in the area were selling quickly with multiple offers so I decided to move a little more into the suburbs to a new sub division. 

For the next 6 months it will be my income - once my SO incomes starts coming in (expected 50-60k in medical field) things will be much better pushing the home budget back to a reasonable and comfortable level (around 30% of income). 

But because of our current situation, we didn't want to miss out on this house, rent was increasing almost $100, and the housing market continuing to climb, we went with the house we did. 

The plan was to put 5% down and once we get both incomes coming in, save the next 24 months, even being generous with some spending since we would want to furnish the place, we would put the whole 20% equity into the house. 

Things started to look better when I had overstated what our monthly payments would be once I started getting much lower than anticipated insurance premium as well as interest rates.

My biggest fear now is appraisals. I had no clue about them and my realtor never brought it up. She was the one to show us the house knowing what our financial situation was. Well once I started looking into appraisals I started to panic because I didn't know that if my appraisal doesnt equate to my house, I am responsible for bringing the rest to closing. Even though I am putting down 5%, I can maybe put an additional 1-3k, but that is literally all the cash I would have. what if the appraisal comes at 4k, or 5k? Am I screwed?",finance

personalfinance,Question about which college education will make the most sense financially.,"Hi all, I am an incoming college freshman and had a few questions about which college choice will be the most financially viable for me and my family.

At the moment, by top three choices are Northeastern University (College of Computer and Information Science ), NYU (Tandon), and Georgia Tech (College of Computing). I will be majoring in computer science for all three schools.

As someone who's looking to earn a master's degree, Georgia Tech would be the best choice due to its better academics and name recognition. 

However, this is where cost plays a factor. 

* At Northeastern, I would be paying 14.5K a year (7K out of pocket, 7.5K in direct student loans / federal loans) 
* At Georgia Tech I would be paying 29.5K per year (18K in parent PLUS loans, 5.5K in direct student loans, and 6K in institutional loans)
* At NYU I would be paying 25K a year (5.5K in direct student loans and 19.3K in parent PLUS loans)

My parents will not be able to contribute much to my education, so those numbers are a general estimate of how much I will be in debt by the time I graduate.

After calculating how much I would have to pay per month to repay the loans based on the interest rates given on the schools' websites, I found the following:

* Georgia Tech: $335.59 per month over 10 years
* Northeastern: $76.27 per month over 10 years
* NYU: $272.71 per month over 10 years

Based on this information, which school would be the best choice financially, especially considering that I am planning on attending grad school as well?

investing,Ultra short term bond funds,"Bear with me my question is at the end.

When rates rise the value of bonds fall, this happens at the ""effective duration"" rate. If a funds average duration is 2 years then a 1% rise in interest rates would lead to an estimated 2% decrease in the share price.

If you look at something like the VBISX with an average duration of 2.8 years and a SEC yield of 1.63%

so if the Federal reserve rate increases by more than .58% y/y you are effectively losing money (i wont mention inflation in any of this but with inflation you are losing more money)

Now with Ultra short term bond funds the Effective duration is much lower. for the SPDR ssga ultra short term bond fund etf (ticker is: ULST) the effective duration is .23 years, and the SEC yield is 1%.

For the Share value of ULST to fall the reserve rate would have to be raised ~4% y/y in order for you to lose money (the stock value might fall but dividends should still outpace it)

**Question time**. for someone who wants an extremely low risk investment would it make sense to invest in a Short term bond fund. As rates rise they will hold even less risk in the future because SEC yeilds will also rise which means a stronger defense against rising rates if you use the profit equation

 (SEC yeild- (rate change*effective duration))=Net income

So I work in a chain cafe store and have since July 14th of 2016. I've always been on time, done efficient work, yadda yadda. I make minimum wage but I need it for college. While school was in, I worked only on Wednesdays from 4 to close. One day, I called in sick because I had the flu. 

After that, the next few weeks I wasn't scheduled whatsoever. So I called at least twice a week asking for Abby, the scheduling manager because she's the only person to talk to about it. She was never there, and upon asking when she'd be back I'd receive the answer ""I don't know"". This went on for a couple months and I got fed up of not making money so I called and asked for any manager and said something like ""I need to be scheduled again and Abby is never there, can you just schedule me?""

At that point, that manager says ""Oh our new scheduling manager is Tom."" So Im like..ok great to know NOW. So i ask to speak to Tom. 

Tom gets on the phone, I tell him my name and everything and he says ""Oh actually I think you were terminated.""

???

Clearly I'm flustered and I say ""what?? when, why how."" All that stuff. Tom says that ABBY terminated me, but she is on MATERNITY LEAVE. So he can't contact her and ask her why. He said he would contact his ""higher ups"" and call me back. He never called me the next day so i called him and he said he hadn't gotten to it yet. 

It's now been a week with no call, no response, just nothing and I apparently don't have a job.

economy,What does QE have to do with the Yield Curve and how does a low (or flat) Yield Curve achieve the goals of a central bank?,"I've just been reading Williamson's ""Current Federal Reserve Policy under the Lens of Economic History: A Review Essay"" from the Journal of Economic Literature (DOI for the interested http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/jel.20151354).

Now, because I don't have a profound knowledge in economy, and because my English has its limits, I did not fully understand the core idea of Quantitative Easing (QE). In the above mentioned text it says on p. 929: 
&gt; ... if the Fed issues short-term liabilities (reserves) in exchange for long-maturity assets, then this should, according to the theory, increase the price of long-maturity assets, and therefore reduce long-term bond yields. With the nominal short-term interest rate fixed at zero, this should flatten the yield curve.

My concrete questions are:

* 1. What does QE have to do with the yield curve? I thought QE was about increasing monetary aggregates and therefore increasing inflation. How wrong am I?
* 2. What is the goal of aiming at a flattened yield curve? How does this help to achieve the Fed's (or any other central bank's) goals?
* 3. Why

personalfinance,Paying off high interest CC with new no interest CC,"Hello,

Sorry if this has been asked before but I can't seem to find exactly what I'm looking for.

I opened a Chase Freedom CC a few years back and like an idiot, I've maxed it out at $9,800. The interest rate is a little over 22% which has me paying around $300 each month (all I can afford) but that of course doesn't pay off any of the principal. 

I've tried negotiating the interest rate and they wont budge. I also read on the FAQ that you can pay off one CC with another with no interest but if you don't pay off the total by the end of the period they'll charge you back interest.

With a debt of this size I believe it will take me more than a year to pay off which is likely longer than any 0% interest period on a new card.

Any advice or guidance on ways to get from underneath the crippling interest to begin paying off the principal debt on my CC?",finance

Members of Congress are in their home districts this week, and many are hosting town hall meetings where constituents can ask questions and speak directly to their Senators and Representatives. 

Speaking up for net neutrality at one of these events is perhaps the single most effective thing you can do right now to fight back against Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T‚Äôs attack on the basic net neutrality protections that keep the Internet awesome.

You can find a crowdsourced list of Congressional town hall meetings happening this week and see if there is one near you [here.](http://www.townhallproject.com)

If you can‚Äôt attend one of these events, you can use [this Fight for the Future page](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/request-a-meeting-with-your-lawmakers-to-defend-net-neutrality) to request a meeting with your lawmaker.

If you‚Äôre able to attend one of these town hall meetings, here are some tips:

1. Do a little research. Each meeting is different, so click the link for more info to find out what time to arrive, and whether you need to register ahead of time in order to ask a question.

2. Dress nice and be polite. Lots of us are angry right now, but we need to convince these representatives that their constituents really care about this issue. Make your point firmly, and with conviction, but carry yourself with respect.

3. Bring a friend. Bring a friend or two, or more, who can show their support by applauding after you ask your question, or holding signs outside. Have one of them take a video of your question and the representatives response, and post it or send it to us.

4. Be prepared. Prepare a short question that‚Äôs backed up by facts, and identify yourself as a constituent. Here‚Äôs an example:

*‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm [NAME]. I‚Äôm a constituent and I work as a teacher here in [CITY]. The Federal Communications Commission has been meeting behind closed doors with lobbyists from big cable companies, and say that they are planning to repeal net neutrality protections that prevent companies like Comcast and Verizon from scamming consumers, and blocking, throttling, or otherwise censoring the websites we visit. Net neutrality is an essential protection for freedom of speech. I‚Äôd like to know what [LAWMAKER NAME] plans to do to defend Title II net neutrality, which protects our right to a free and open Internet.‚Äù*

Bagel paid off the loan last month but received a phone call today from the lender telling him that he owes $140 in interest on the loan. The lender then went on to tell Bagel that if he didn't make the payment by tomorrow the amount owed would increase. When Bagel asked how much the amount would increase the lender said it would increase based on the interest rate of the total amount of the original $1,100 and not on the $140 already somehow owed. 

My questions are:

1) Can the lender collect interest from Bagel even though he paid off the loan in full before the first payment date?

2) If they somehow are able to collect the $140 of interest, if he doesn't pay it by tomorrow, can they collect interest on the original $1,100 or is it supposed to be off of the remaining balance of $140?

personalfinance,"incoming medical student 24F, financing tuition with 100% loans + parents paying CoL. What to do about interest on loans?","Hi there r/personalfinance! I was given my financial aid package for med school today. It includes ~ 42k of unsubsidized stafford loan + 40k of Grad PLUS loan. My school tuition is ~56k and CoL will be covered by my parents (thank you!!! love my parents !!! such a gift.). I plan to use all 42k of the Unsub stafford loan + the difference from the PLUS loan to cover the yearly 56k tuition. Also, I have ~ 10k in personal savings and another 25k in my Roth IRA since I worked for 2 years in between undergraduate and medical school entrance. 

My question: Should I empty out all 10k of my personal savings into paying the interest on my unsub stafford loan and the grad plus loan? According to my calculations, 10k will probably cover most, but not all of the interest x 4 years (I'm assuming Unsub stafford interest rate is 5.31% fixed for graduate students, and PLUS interest rate is 6.31% fixed). It looks like it'll come out to ~10k for the interest on unsub stafford alone so I could empty my savings into paying that interest, and have to defer the interest on the grad PLUS loan. 

However, this makes me a little uneasy because that'll make me 100% financially dependent on my parents since my funds will be totally emptied out to the interest payment on the unsub loan. I mean, what if I want to (god forbid) take a mini vacation in the middle of med school? Frugally, of course. But the mere thought of having to ask/beg/plead my parents for ""fun money"" on top of the fact that they are already generously covering my cost of living, makes me sad/uncomfortable. I would feel guilty to ask them for the extra, but at the same time, I don't want to suffer...I do have a s/o who lives a few states over, and so even having the funds to pay for those flights would do A LOT for my mental/emotional health and sanity. 

But also, I'm unclear about how the interest will accrue and become principal upon my impending 250k+ loan upon graduation. In my mind, I'm thinking if I pay it off now, its better because then when I pay it later, I'm paying more than the original interest due to the deferment. Can someone explain, if that indeed is correct? 

So it comes down to: how does the interest work? Better to pay off the straight amount as I go (and have no personal funds, suck up the pain!), vs. defer but then is the amount waaay more ?? And then, even if the interest amount *is* way more, is it worth it to (potentially) sacrifice some immediate happiness when in the end, I'm still going to paying a butt load of loans anyways, so is interest accrued just a drop in the bucket at that point? 

Please chime in! I think this is a factual question (how does interest work) but also a personal choice/moral decision (short term feels vs. long term?? is interest even a big deal once my loan becomes monstrous??) and I'd really appreciate the spectrum of opinions on this.",finance

European delegation charts progress in Kyrgyzstan

^(4 April 2017)

&gt;A joint delegation from the European Union and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has held talks with the government of Kyrgyzstan on addressing the environmental legacy of uranium mining in Central Asia.

**VIEWPOINT:**

What's in it for the EU?

Article 50 has been triggered and Brexit really does mean Brexit. Now begins the arduous task of negotiating the UK's divorce from the European Union, and there is one simple test the European Commission will be applying to every one of the UK Government's demands, writes Tom Greatrex.

That test is: ""What's in it for us?"" And for many issues, answering this question will be difficult.

Why would the EU want to allow passporting for the City of London? Why would they allow unfettered access to the single market? Why would they want to make it easy for UK citizens to travel to and from the EU?

Fortunately for the nuclear industry, replacing the benefits of the UK's membership of the European Atomic Community (Euratom) - which without an agreed implementation period will cease on 29 March 2019 - is in the interest of both the UK and European nuclear industries.

personalfinance,Unique Student Loan Question. I need your help!,"I just finished medical school and matched into residency. I start in July and I have some questions about loan repayments in a slightly unique situation.

My situation is complicated by two factors beyond normal situations:

1. One of my ""loans"", if it can be called that, is a confession of judgement note from a school. I owe them 57K and they want a payment of $605/month starting the month after I graduate (next month). I can not pay this amount and want to find out options of what can be done with this to lower payments (new lender or consolidate with federal loans?). I don't know if I should consolidate all of my federal loans because I know that makes me ineligible for PAYE or REPAYE or IBR or things like that. I also think it means I can't defer my federal loans through residency after a consolidation. 

2. The other thing is that I will be leaving the country in about 7-10 years from now so any of the loan forgiveness programs (if they will even exist) will not be an option or a consideration.

WHat do I do? My main concern is the big payments from the 57K I owe back to one of my former schools (long story and screwed up situation) and not wanting to choose something that will screw me over. I have a family and money will be tight through residency. I will be working as an attending for a few years after residency where we earn the big bucks and I plan on paying down the loans as quickly as possible before I move. Like I am talking about living on my same resident quality of life making attending money and paying the rest to the loans but that is 6 years away.

I have attached an Imgur link with a spreadsheet of all of my loans. 
Total federal loans is 418K with 65K interest and 57K for the confession of judgement. 

Thank you in advance for any information you can provide.

We bought the house house on my income alone - $33k at the time - and we may look to upgrade before that period is up since our income will now be roughly $100k (a promotion for me + her job as an attorney). The ""waiting"" period is 7 or 9 years I think. I would have to break out the 40 page contract to be sure. 

1 - Is the profit made considered income and subject to state/fed income tax?

2 - Is the penalty simply the tax or is it an actual penalty?

3 - If it is a penalty, how is it calculated?

4 - Who gets this penalty? The state? (it is a state program i believe)

Please, if you have any experience with this let me know!

Edit: I found a state resource page that gave me a lot of info. Also I reached out to my lender for some specifics. The term is 9 years. 

1 - any profit is not taxed via capital gains as long as it is below a limit. The profit is used to calculate the IRS Recapture Tax (name of the penalty)

2/3 - it is a penalty calculated based on the original loan principal, profit gained by the sale, how long you've lived at the home, and your income. I couldn't find any calculators to help me get specifics.

personalfinance,Question about my college choice.,"Hi all, I actually posted this question late last night but was hoping that I'd be able to get some more responses this time around.

--------------------------------

I am an incoming college freshman and had a few questions about which college choice will be the most financially viable for me and my family.

At the moment, by top three choices are Northeastern University (College of Computer and Information Science ), NYU (Tandon), and Georgia Tech (College of Computing). I will be majoring in computer science for all three schools.

As someone who's looking to earn a master's degree, Georgia Tech would be the best choice due to its better academics and name recognition. 

However, this is where cost plays a factor. 

* At Northeastern, I would be paying 14.5K a year (7K out of pocket, 7.5K in direct student loans / federal loans) 
* At Georgia Tech I would be paying 29.5K per year (18K in parent PLUS loans, 5.5K in direct student loans, and 6K in institutional loans)
* At NYU I would be paying 25K a year (5.5K in direct student loans and 19.3K in parent PLUS loans)

My parents will not be able to contribute much to my education, so those numbers are a general estimate of how much I will be in debt by the time I graduate.

After calculating how much I would have to pay per month to repay the loans based on the interest rates given on the schools' websites, I found the following:

* Georgia Tech: $335.59 per month over 10 years
* Northeastern: $76.27 per month over 10 years
* NYU: $272.71 per month over 10 years

Based on this information, which school would be the best choice financially, especially considering that I am planning on attending grad school as well?

personalfinance,Mutual fund question and sharing with my brother?,"Hey Reddit, I'm having some troubles with financial stuff that also rolls into a family issue so I thought I'd ask here before anything else. My grandparents set up a Federated Kaufman Mutual Fund for all of their grandchildren, and mine started at $2,000 and has grown to around $13,800. My brother's fund they accidentally only put $1,000 in and has only grown to about $4,000 now. 

They're asking me to even it out by essentially giving him $4,900, but I know that his may just not have done as well and they most definitely have the money to reimburse him what he's lost from their mistake. At this point, they have no control over the fund so I can say no to their request, but should I? I have grad school to pay for and my brother will use it for community college at best, there's a part of me that's really sad to give him $4,900 that he probably won't use on school (what it was intended for). 

An additional question- when I want to withdraw this money (I'll need at least $6,000 of it in a year) will I have to pay taxes on it, or is there a way I should take it out where it wouldn't be taxed?

personalfinance,"26 years old, zero debt, fairly significant asset base, seeking guidance","Hey there PersonalFinance. As tax day draws near, I've found myself thinking more and more about my financial situation and where I stand with it.  I‚Äôll preface by saying that based on what I‚Äôve read on this sub reddit over the past 1-2 months, my situation isn‚Äôt super abnormal, but its definitely not par for the course.  However, I feel like I could be doing better with what I have, so I'll break right into it.

I'm a 26 year old male working in the IT field who landed a decent paying job right out of school in my discipline of choice.  My current annual salary is sitting around $62,500, which for where I live is a little bit above the median household income range.

I have a 401k with my employer, which appears to be invested in Blackrock Lifepath 2050 with a current balance of $34,338.91.  The company match is the first 3% in full, and next 2% in half.  For the past 4 years I have been contributing 10% of my pre-tax pay to this account in order to take advantage of the company match, as well as add a bit extra.  A couple weeks ago I changed my elections so that I will be maxing out my 401k for 2017.

Very recently I opened a Roth IRA with Fidelity, and contributed $5,500 for 2016, and $5,500 for 2017, and placed the funds in FIPFX 2050.  I regret not having opened an IRA for the past few years, as it was something I always assumed I would ‚Äúget to eventually‚Äù that I never did.  I feel like this is a tax advantaged account that I won‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs full potential since there were at least 4 years that I could have been putting $5,500 into it, but simply did not.

My family was generous enough and had the assets to completely pay for my bachelors degree out of pocket, so I am without any student loans.

I recently moved back home, after my prior roommate and I went our separate ways.  Currently I do not have a monthly living cost, as my parents are pleased to have the ‚Äúon-site technical support.‚Äù

When I was younger, my uncle passed away and left me a sum of money in his will.  I used some of this money to purchase a used car in full, and have kept the rest in a money market account making, admittedly, horrible interest.  I have my paychecks deposited to the same account, which is currently sitting at a value of roughly $125,000.  I keep a separate checking account with the same bank for handling payments and other transactions which I keep around $2,000.

As time goes on, and my other relatives pass away and will money to my parents, they‚Äôve found themselves with more liquid assets than they know what to do with.  Neither of them are very investment savvy, so they tend to just let the assets sit in savings accounts.  They are both nearing their retirement age, and believe that they will never be able to fully use the money they have inherited, so every year they issue me a ‚Äúgift check‚Äù of $14,000 in order to try and take advantage of moving the money around without incurring the federal ‚Äúgift tax‚Äù.

In 2015 I experimented with investing by putting $15,000 into an account with a robo advisor  called WealthFront.  I had set it to a maximum risk category, but I let emotion take over when I watched Brexit go down in 2016, and ultimately pulled out at a $1,000 loss.  Lesson learned there; keep emotions out of investments.

I‚Äôm currently questioning what options I have to try and leverage my assets, since I have zero debt, and a consistent job to live off of.  Being that I‚Äôm set to max my 401k this year, and I‚Äôve already maxed my Roth IRA for 2016/2017, is my only option at this point to begin dipping into taxable accounts?  Being that I have an account with Fidelity now, should I just put a large sum into target date index funds?  I'm aware that I should probably keep a portion of my assets in savings in preparation for a future home, so that will be another factor I'll have to consider.  What would you do?",finance

Fed Ex is offering me $2600 to start with 2 raises a year. I get $50 more a week the bigger the truck I move into (I'll start out in a van). I get one week vacation and 401k after a year, 4 unpaid days a year and medical benefits after 90 for a crazy good rate of $30 a month. They offer holiday bonuses, a 5 day work week getting paid salary and I can work 6 days and get paid for that day. Mandatory over time during the holidays.
This job would obviously be more physically demanding while the other job is more mentally and emotionally because of the kind of people I deal with (Whether selling or current customers).

The small private car lot I work at is currently paying me $2400 a month salary, working 6 days every week. They currently offer no benefits. I like the job because it's pretty laid back.

The car lot owners want to keep me and think I'm a very good worker.

If I stay, they want to task me to get health benefits for the company. I still also get the $50 a car commission. I feel like if I can push for the full 2nd day off it would be almost worth it.

personalfinance,"Not sure if I'll be able to enroll in college, what other options do I have?","So, here's my situation. 

I'm 24 years old, I failed out of college roughly 6 years ago, and now work a dead-end job bringing in around $30k/year. I want to go back to university to complete my engineering degree that I started several years prior, but I don't see any ways in which to do that. 

The first issue is that I unfortunately can't drop my income much lower than that, which means I'd either need a ton of of financial aid, or exorbitant student loans (can't give up my car, as my wife wouldn't be allowed to live on student housing, and I would otherwise have no way to campus, and due to my wife's job having on call shifts requiring a thirty minute response time, there are no cheaper options within range). 

So, I looked into the loan option. Unfortunately, due to failing out years ago, the school will not allow me to get federal aid until I bring my GPA back up above a 2.0. So I looked into the private route, and not an option either, unfortunately. My credit score is only mediocre, and it seems as though every lender required a fairly high income ($35,000/year was the expectation I could find). 

So, I'm at an impasse. I could use my job's tuition reimbursement, retake courses until I brought my GPA above a 2.0, and then work full time to cover bills and use federal aid; but the issue is, I don't think I could handle both working full time and going to school full time. Taking on too many tasks (both work and school) is why I have failed out twice, both university and community college. And I don't want to risk the same happening a third time. 

Unfortunately, though, I'm not really seeing any other options, so I'm open for whatever suggestions reddit has for me.",finance

personalfinance,Miscalculated exemptions and now owe the IRS big,"So I have been reeling from a huge mistake from grad school in which I never made quarterly tax payments on my student stipend - it was never deducted.  I have been on an installment plan with the IRS and still owe $3,500 in back taxes.

Last year, I changed jobs mid-year. My income rose from $50,000 to $130,000. I learned that the federal withholding on my paycheck from my new job was based on the fact that I was going to make $130,000 gross when In fact it was more like $90,000 or so, so I used an online calculator to figure out how many exemptions I should claim on my W4 to increase my take home pay.  

I just finished calculating my taxes this year and it turns out that calculator (or me) was wrong; I owe about $7,000. This really sucks, but it's my fuck up and I take full responsibility.

I think my plan for now is to pay the $3,500 asap for the current installment plan so that I can get an installment plan for the $7,000. I cannot afford paying it all on time. 

Is this a sound plan? Is the IRS likely to give me another installment plan provided I paid the old one off?

My state return for California is OK though - I got a $384 refund, which is nice. But I think that will automatically be applied to the IRS debt.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off student loan in full vs. Income Based Payments for 20 years,"My wife has a student loan for about 52K at a 6.8% interest rate. We are currently living abroad, rent free, tax free, earning about 80k combined income a year after all bonuses. About one year ago, she signed up for an income based repayment plan. Because her ""base salary"" is about 30K, she only has to pay $25 a month under the her current income based repayment plan. After 20 years, whatever is still left on the loan, principal and interest would be forgiven. 

We have about $85K in savings. 

Here are my concerns:

The Income based repayment plan is for 20 years. A lot can change in 20 years. Who's to say that the laws don't change and the IBRP is repealed? 

If that were to occur, we would likely be on the hook for a ton of additional interest.

We could go ahead and pay off the loan in full and still have some savings left over for an emergency fund. 

One other idea I was toying around with was putting about 50K into a down payment for a home and renting it out since we are able to live rent free.

personalfinance,"Churning and a CLOC to jumpstart debt reduction - check my plan, please?","Of course, this is a throwaway AND the first time I've ever posted here. Let's get started. 

Spending got out of control. Period. Our savings weren't sufficient to weather a medical emergency and then there was some spending happening in lieu of therapy. All taken care of now, but there's the debt aftermath. I *think* we have a plan in place. 

So far we've refinanced the only car loan we have to save a bit on interest, we've signed up for auto-pay with Navient to get that reduction on interest there, we've switched to a Calyx hotspot/Ting/Netflix to replace cable/mobile/internet, we've sold things on Craigslist, and we've gotten a realistic budget set. The budget has been working and all extra moola in a paycheck is going to debt. Any extra moola from ANYWHERE is going to the debt, actually - two small tax refunds, a bonus, some earnings from doing online surveys last year, etc. I'm working 60+ hours/week and two or three Saturdays/month on top of that. We've increased our income as much as we can AND we've cut expenses everywhere we can. The mortgage is more than manageable on its own, the car loan is for a paltry $1500, the student loans are less than $10k and on track to be paid off early - everything is getting a larger payment than the minimum. The credit card debt is almost $52k, though. Ouch. 

This leads to...potential extra moola musings. A couple of years ago, we did some light bank account churning. Last month, my wife got a postcard for a local bank offering $100 and between the 6 accounts she opened, she managed to throw $1125 towards our debt. Very nice. She's a SAHM for medical reasons now and has been a bit depressed over not being able to contribute financially and this seemed to perk her up. Now she's been crunching numbers and finding more bonuses to go after. 

There is an untouched CLOC with NFCU that she's eyeing. Her thought is to take $2k and open some accounts with bigger bonuses. Depending on how many she can open (household account or one for each of us) she's found between $1950 and $3100 in bonuses just for this month so far. The CLOC would be paid back as soon as the accounts are opened and she can transfer the money back to NFCU. Her plan is to take half of what she gets in bonuses this month and keep it for further churning and use the rest to pay towards our debt, and then churn as offerings become available. I'm on board, but I worry that excessive account opening might lead to denials in the coming months, meaning that this isn't going to be something she can do month after month. Thoughts?

On top of that, once the CLOC is repaid, our thought is to use that as a personal consolidation loan for some of the credit cards (like an outrageous interest-rate Carecredit that helped our medical bills and a Lowe's card that we used for some emergency house repairs). The consolidation loan would help with the minimum payments and interest rates so I see her math on this.

Has anyone used their NFCU CLOC like this? Thoughts on churning bank bonuses like this?",finance

Min payment is $360.21 but i will be making payments of $1,400, which puts me at September 2018 for completion. I know that it makes the most financial since to put extra money towards the highest interest rate first (avalanche), however when looking at the numbers and where I'm currently at if i pay down the lowest balance my interest savings is just over $100. Now dont get me wrong $100 is still $100, but that 14k balance is just so daunting. It would be a nice mental relief to see ""quicker progress"" of paying off  some of the lower balances. 

Now on the other hand. Since these lower balances are from undergrad and are my longest running debt while the 14k is from grad i am worried that paying them off too soon will damage my over 800 credit score as i am looking to buy a house in the near future.

investing,STMP recent decline a buying opportunity,"Last week a short seller who was famous back in the early 2000s said that he thought Stamps.com (STMP) was a scheme.  Essentially Stamps.com resells discounted rates that the USPS gives to partners. The discounted rates are intended for high volume shippers as a way to gain market share from FedEx and UPS.  

The short thesis is that Stamps is taking advantage of this program by allowing smaller scale shippers to use this program and that Stamps is merely flowing all this postage volume at low rates and that the USPS would wise up and eliminate the program.  That short thesis started last July when stock was 75 and then stock went to 135.  It has come back again leading to the stock to fall back to 105 and I think this is an opportunity.  There is no new information out there to support that the USPS is going to change this program.  If anything, the USPS has come out in further support but issues many new agreements (called NSAs) and last year they extended one resellers agreement for many years.  If the USPS were going to review this, I do not think these events would have occurred.  Also, the work I have done shows that the USPS views STMP as a technology partner by being able to aggregate thousands of small shippers and allowing them to come to the post office under a single manifest, thus saving them time and money.  $6 billion of postage has flowed from STMP to the USPS and STMP makes $200M on that.  So USPS pays 3% for customer acquisition and technology which sounds like a great deal for the post office.

All of that said, there is a legitimate argument that the post office may want to capture all of that revenue since it needs money.  But would they disrupt what is a good thing for the USPS and give other shippers an opening?  Priority mail volumes have been rising fast and since the USPS is a huge fixed costs business, more scale and more packages = better.  

There is a good article on Seeking Alpha which goes into this debate from last year including some comments from the company so take it for what it's worth:

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/4900808-just-bought-stmp

I think STMP offers an opportunity to capitalize on the growth of e-commerce and efforts by the USPS to aggressively take share from UPS and FDX.  As more retail disappears and smaller ships go online, they need technology solution providers such as STMP.  They do more than just offer postage online but help with shipping, logistics and warehouse/inventory management using software.  The short thesis solely revolves around unfounded speculation that the USPS will do something when there is no evidence to that, only evidence pointing in the opposite direction.  While reliance on STMP does mean STMP should trade at a discount (as any company with a large customer does), I think a small long position is warranted now that short interest is back to levels last summer before the stock ran up 90%.

Curious if anyone else has a different view on this company.

Thanks!

EDIT:  I wanted to also mention that this time around, after the 90% run up, insiders have been selling a ton.  So naturally this adds fuel to shorts.  However, STMP has historically granted options every 3 years and stock sales have coincided with these sales.  3 years ago there was a similar sale at lower prices.  In fact, management has not been great sellers of their shares.  That said, cannot be too unexpected given the rapid rise and that much of their comp is stock-based.  This did give me pause when stock was 135 but now 20% lower, I think risk / reward more in line.",finance
personalfinance,Paying down mortgage vs saving for planned expenses,"My wife and I have fully paid off our vehicles, student loans, and credit cards. This leaves us with only our mortgage for debt. We've been making the minimum payment for the 3 years we've been living in it and did some kind of loan (which has initials I cant think of) that didn't require us to do a down payment, so we are still in the PMI range and will be for awhile.

We are a month or so from having our 6-month emergency fund saved up and we can't decide if it would be a better idea to use the money we have been saving monthly to pay down on our mortgage quicker or continue saving separately to pay for a new roof and heating/air unit. We are expecting to need to pay for both of these within the next 5 years or so at the most. 

So, pay down on the mortgage, use the e-fund to pay for the replacements when necessary and then replenish the e-fund, or...
Save up for the expected expenses so we don't have to dip into the e-fund and then start paying down the mortgage more aggressively?

personalfinance,Gut check: I'm about to refinance. Is there anything I'm missing?,"I wanted to get another opinion before pulling the trigger on a refinance.  

Here are the details:

Current mortgage: 7/1 ARM, started in 2014, currently at 3%.  (2/2/6 caps, so worst-case payment goes to $3404 in 2021, $4047 in 2022, and $4720 in 2023).  Original loan of $664,000.  Monthly payments of $2799, but I‚Äôve been paying $3100 every month, so I‚Äôm a few months ahead.  

I have the opportunity to refinance the remaining principle ($620,875) into a 5/5 ARM, at 2.875%  (2/2/5 caps, so worst-case payment goes to $3179 in 2022, $3738 in 2027, and $3975 in 2032).  New monthly payment would drop to $2576.  Refinancing cost is approximately $3300.  

The original vague plan was to stay in the house roughly 10 years, with no solid date for our next home.  We love our current city despite the high housing cost and plan to live in the area forever, but not in the same home.  

I think there are a couple of ways to count the payback period of the refinance:

* Change in required monthly payments:  $233 reduction.  After 15 months, this surpasses the $3300 refinance cost. 
* Change in actual monthly payments:  I‚Äôve been paying $3100, but plan to only pay $2576 and invest the rest in the stock market.  $524 reduction.  After 7 months, this surpasses the $3300 refinance cost.  
* Change in interest paid, not counting principle.  It‚Äôs a reduction of ~$65 per month in interest.  So it will take 50 months for just the interest payments to equal the $3300 refinance cost.  

The main reason I‚Äôm looking to refinance is downside protection:  seems like interest rates are going up.  I do expect to spend another 7-10 years in this house.  I‚Äôve run spreadsheets, and in the worst-case interest rate scenario, I will be saving hundreds to thousands of dollars every month, starting in 2021.  (From now until then, it‚Äôs about a wash).  

Other things I‚Äôve done:

* Current mortgage is with a local credit union that I like (Credit Union A)
* New mortgage is with another local credit union with even more convenient locations (Credit Union B).
* Credit Union A can‚Äôt match Credit Union B‚Äôs rates - I already asked.  

I think I have the income required to cover any case - but I'm trying to optimize this mortgage over a ~10 year time frame.

However, I believe the development of new privacy rules should be fully debated in the legislature in a transparent and accountable way, and in a manner, that avoids tipping the scales between entities that provide internet access, and entities that provide internet content.  Unfortunately, the privacy rules issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) were neither transparent nor fair.

As you may know, in the summer of 2015, the FCC unilaterally usurped regulatory authority from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over broadband internet access in the name of ""net neutrality"". Subsequent to the FCC takeover of broadband internet access, in October of 2016 the FCC finalized new privacy rules for broadband internet service providers (ISPs).

Prior to the FCC's net neutrality regulations, the FTC applied the same robust consumer privacy regulatory framework to all online entities and managed a healthy balance between consumers' private data security and ISPs' freedom to innovate and develop newer, faster, and more secure internet technologies. However, the FCC's new privacy regulations place specific and unfair restrictions on ISPs but not on other internet content providers that collect consumer financial data for payment services, causing a confusing and uncoordinated regulatory environment for online entities that ultimately reduces economic growth and places consumers at risk

In light of the FCC's privacy rule, I have concerns that online entities are being regulated in differing ways based on an arbitrary and unilateral decision made by unelected FCC bureaucrats. Specifically, the FCC rule requires consumers to opt in before ISPs can use or share their data; however, non-ISPs (the clear majority of content providers, like Facebook, Google, or any other website or organization that handles the distribution of online content) can access most of the same data unless consumers opt out. For example, individuals may prevent their ISP from sharing personal data, but they could still receive personalized advertisements created with their personal data from other entities, such as Facebook or Twitter.

On March 28, 2017, the House of Representatives passed S.J.Res. 34 that overturned the FCC privacy rule and prohibited similar rulemakings in the future. I supported this legislation because the federal government should apply the same privacy requirements to all online entities, such as the framework that was administered by the FTC prior to the summer of 2015. This legislation has subsequently been sent to the President for signature.

My most important role is advocating on your behalf as your Representative. I hope that you will continue to keep me informed of the issues that matter most to you and your family.""

personalfinance,Student loan consolidation,"I complete my undergrad at a private college some years ago. Being young and having no real guidance from my parents in regards to student loans (my dads parents paid for his school and my mother didn't attend college) I wracked up quite the bill. I utilized student loans to live (rent, utilities, etc) thinking that I would be able to pay these back easily once I graduated and got a ""good job"". I know now how wrong of an idea this was and continue to beat myself up over it. I did work full time while in school between two jobs for almost my entire undergrad which helped with all other expenses. Fast forward 5 years and I'm sitting on about 110k in student loan debt (and my wife at about 80k). I am a social worker and make about 55k per year and my wife makes about 42k per year. We currently pay about 2k per month in student loans. These loans are paid through several different borrowers (navient, aes, Wells Fargo, etc). We are able to pay the loans every month and all are in good standing, but they are absolutely killing me. My entire paycheck right now pays all of our bills, but there is usually nothing left over. I should also add that I am finishing my masters degree in a few weeks and have accepted a job that should (once I'm up and running) bring in between 90-100k per year. My grad school cost me about 15k in federal student loans. I know that adding more student loans seem crazy, but I felt the cost/benefit was worth it giving the increase in pay that I will receive. So, my question is... is there a benefit in consolidating private student loans? I see online that payments are typically lower, lower interest rates, etc. I should also say that my interest rates are pretty across the board. I apologize if this seems nonsensical, but I am in no way a finance whizz and want to be able to move forward with life not letting student loans drag my family down. Any information would be appreciated. This will be the first time in my life where being a social worker will be financially lucrative and want to make the right choices for my family. I have seen posts like this before, but I'm also fairly new to reddit. Thanks anyone and everyone.",finance

Also, I'm thinking about buying a new honda civic after paying this off cause my current car is falling apart.  I know ""new"" cars aren't the best investments, but for me having a reliable car with good gas mileage and minimal trips to the mechanic has value.

personalfinance,[DEBT] Unpaid Interest Statements of Less Than a Dollar,"Hi R/personalfinance,

I am paying back my student loan each month but I haven't been tremendously aggressive with my payments. I'll pay about $150/month (135 is usual required payment) in one sum for 3 loans that total less than 15k. I have looked in detail to see how that money is allocated to each loan today. The loan with the highest amount of interest (6.8%) is receiving the least amount of money (shocker) per month and paying out more interest than the principal. The lower interest loans are receiving the bulk of the payments at 3.4% interest. The varying sums paid to each loan don't feel random. I don't usually go in and pay a specific amount to each loan so it feels like I'm being taken for a ride. I am paying above what is due per month yet at the end of each month it it is still showing unpaid interest on each loan of about 70 cents. This leaves me with a few questions.

1. If I'm paying above the needed payment per month, why is the system allowed to allocate money on my behalf to maximize their interest rates without my knowledge?

2. Why is there less than a dollar left in unpaid interest each month if I'm paying above what is required?

3. If I don't pay all the interest each month and there is unpaid interest on my balance, how is this messing me up? (I'm making the assumption that this matters a lot)

4. What would you do if you were in my shoes?

personalfinance,Never Do a Cash Advance From a Credit Card,"When I was transitioning into my first big boy job out of college and I was paying for myself, my daughter and my gf who was in nursing school and couldn't work, I got in a bind. My checking account was empty and the hotel I was staying at for training didn't take credit card. So I got online and did a $500 cash advance from my CC to my debit. Here I am a year later and I've just realized that my CC has been getting 2 interest fees per month. Around $100 combined. I called the bank and they advised me that the cash advance gets its own interest rate fee charged at 24%. So now I owe $2,000 on it. When I did the advance online there were NO notifications saying there would be additional/separate interest rate charges for it. It also does not show separately on any of my statements or online billing. I asked her how I was supposed to know. She said it was on my agreement. I went back and sure as hell there is a 3 sentence section somewhere about 3,000 words in that states this. For regular charges I'm being charged 16%. However next month it raises to 22%. I asked her why the increase and she literally told me she didn't know but she'd send me a letter that would arrive in 10-12 business days explaining why. I pay my monthly bill on it (around $210) plus an extra $50-$100 every month now that I have my big boy job. So right now my credit card says I owe around $8,500 on it. $6,500 in charges and $2,000 in the cash advance. Well, it doesn't say that online OR on my statement. You can only find out by calling. And the ONLY way to pay it off is by paying your regular monthly payment and THEN calling and asking for the amount you owe and THEN making that payment directly to your account. No boxes to check or way to confirm you want it to go to your cash advance. You just pay it. Perhaps I'm just not well versed enough in banking or finance. But this all seems like highway robbery and I am very upset about it. I'm not sure if I can go to another bank and switch my debt to them but I'm going to try and take my business elsewhere.

personalfinance,Confused as to which repayment plan to select for student loans,"I graduated December 2016 with about 27k in student loan debt, interest included. This includes a combo of subsidized and unsubsidized loans with the highest interest rate being 4.660%.

I had originally applied for the ""standard"" 10 year program, leaving me with $283 in minimum payments starting this June. Although I am working full time, I do not make near enough to be able to comfortably make these minimum payments now or in the very near future. I am so confused and overwhelmed with the payment options. 

At this point, I am told that my lowest payment option would be ""Income Driven Repayment Plan (revised pay as you earn)"" at $27 a month.

""Income Based Repayment"" would put me at a minimum payment of $40 a month. 

I like the idea of one of these, since it gives me some flexibility on payments, but I would still try to pay as much as I can a month, if that is even a possibility with these plans. I'm just hoping I can gather some pros/cons of these plans, especially if you've been enrolled in them.

Lastly, can my repayment plan be changed once I am out of the grace period?

personalfinance,Question about student loan refinancing,"Hey all,

First time posting here, but I had this idea laying in bed last night.

So next semester I'm taking out more student loans. When I started college, I took out 3 loans at 6.8%. Something changed and the rates changed to 4.2% for my new loans.

Now next semester, I can pay my tuition with grants and one subsidized loan at that rate. Is there anything wrong with taking out an additional unsubsidized loan at 4.2% and paying off the old loans at 6.8% with that money? I figure it's the best way because refinancing will change the interest to a weighted average, so why not refinance this way and just keep the lower interest rate for everything?

personalfinance,Not sure if I'm eligible to submit a 1040EZ instead of a 1040.,"Hello,
I'm currently filing my federal income tax forms, and I'm not sure if I'm eligible to submit the 1040EZ form in place of the 1040. For some context, this is my first time submitting US taxes - I did my first US internship in fall 2016 and I'm a Canadian citizen.
I've looked at the list for 1040EZ eligibility, and it seems like I qualify for everything. The only concern I have for my eligibility to submit the EZ version is the following: my W-2 form box 12 contains an amount for code P (Moving Expense Reimbursements) signifying that I got reimbursed for my flight tickets to my internship destination. As per https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1899457-what-do-all-the-letter-codes-in-box-12-of-my-w-2-mean, it seems that I cannot submit the 1040EZ if I have a code P in my box 12 of the W-2. Instead, I have to put the Code P amount as ""moving expenses"" in the general 1040 form. However, I do not qualify for the moving expenses since I don't meet the time test (https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc455.html) due to my internship being only 4 months long.
Could anyone give me advice as to whether it would be okay to submit the 1040EZ rather than the 1040? I would much prefer to submit the 1040EZ, as it's much simpler to complete.",finance

personalfinance,How should I talk to my financial advisor to remove my mom from my account?,"When I turned 18, some inheritance fell into my hands and I decided to invest it all (through Edward Jones, with an old boss of my mom's), and my mom made sure that she was put on the account as well (to make sure I didn't blow it all). I also got a few scholarships to help me with school and have been creating a decent savings. I'm now 23. I've been loaning her money because a lot of stuff has been happening in the last year but I'm fed up with how she treats me. 

What's been going on:

My mom went through a bad divorce last year in which she got nothing in terms of money, even after her now ex husband abandoned and left her with the bills of a two story house. 

My mom, my sister, and I had also established that we we're moving to arizona, after I graduated college, but they went ahead and moved out last May (I still had one more semester to go, yay I'm done now). Since she had no money, I loaned her money on the basis that she let me back with money she would get from selling the house. And she did pay me back once it sold.

Back in October, she was fired from a job and couldn't/wouldn't make an income. So she started digging into the house money she paid me. 

We also established a deal that I would be moving in and getting two rooms to myself (three bedroom rent house with two living rooms, we have plenty of space) and all bills and chores would be split. Because we're adults now.

I'm now here in Arizona and have been since December, and have been paying $3000 in bills every month, on top of making sure the humans, dogs, and bearded dragon are fed. She managed to make a car payment one month and has even borrowed money from her ex to pay her phone bill. I know she makes money because she's bought new clothes, shoes, and eats out a lot. 

On top of making sure the bills are paid, I've taken it upon myself to keep up with the yardwork (we have four boxer dogs and the weeds. Dear Lord, the weeds). But even with all this, she throws the fact that I don't have a job in my face and thinks that I sit around and I'm either doing nothing all day, messing around with a bunch of guys, or am even doing drugs. 

She also makes me feel so completely worthless that I almost killed myself twice this year... Everyone told me that it was a bad idea to move in with her and I should've listened but I didn't. Now I'm several thousand down and more depressed than ever, when I could've moved in with my sister and actually split the bills and work on my depression and anxiety. 

So I'm cutting her off. I'm moving out and not giving her any more money.

TLDR: I'm tired of my mom treating me like I'm trash when I'm paying all her bills and want to get her off my investment account. I'm afraid she'll try to take even more money from me. How do I talk to my financial advisor when he's also an old friend of hers? Should I ask for another advisor even though he has done a great job?",finance

As stated in the title, I'm a 26-year old male recently married to my husband. I'm graduating from medical school in May and will be starting residency in mid-June. My total debt burden is about $220K, almost all of which are federal/institutional loans; I do have one private bank loan that I am already planning on paying off as quickly as possible. I am aware of the income-driven repayment options on my loans and will certainly be taking advantage of one of those options. My husband also has around $60K in loans that are mostly private. 

As far as personal finance goes, my salary as a first-year resident will be around $53K. My husband will be leaving his current job and moving to the city where I'll be training. His current salary is around $40K, but he is graduating with a Master's degree in a physical science in May and will be using his 10 years worth of work experience in the field to be looking for a job that hopefully pays at least $50K or more. Our savings right now total around $5K, most of which will be going towards relocation costs, so, for all intents and purposes, we'll be starting our new lives in June/July with a relatively small amount of liquid assets and savings. 

My husband has been working for ten years and started a 401(k) early on. I have never had a ""real job"" until now, and my residency will be offering a 403(b). We do not plan on making any large purchases (car/house/etc.) in the near future and are not planning on adopting children. We currently have a joint checking account with an online bank but do not yet have any sort of savings account. 

So, my big questions are:

1) What are the most important things to get started now in terms of savings and retirement? I've read a little of White Coat Investor (http://whitecoatinvestor.com/the-five-big-money-items-you-should-do-as-a-resident/), and it looks like a Roth IRA is something I should be starting early. Anything else to consider?

2) Should we be aiming to save/invest a certain percentage of our income? 

3) How can we reconcile putting money away for savings while also doing due diligence in paying off our student debt? 

4) Any comments on the different IDR options? I know some require you to file taxes jointly, while others give you the option to file separately.

personalfinance,Help choosing new/second credit card (only for rewards),"I am a college student graduating in 2019, I will make decent income when I graduate with great benefits. I only work summers now because of my school load, but try and work odds and ends jobs when I can during the semester. I currently have about 15k in student loans, all either federal or institutional. I estimate I will need about another 30k or so to finish out school. I do get some scholarships but it barely puts a dent in the 12k tuition and fees.

I currently have a Discover It credit card with about a $1,500 credit limit, I almost never use it anymore because of the rotating categories. I have it set to autopay at the end of each bill or however it gets set up. I was wanting to get one with no fees and better rewards so I could actually get something out of it. 

Are there any cards I should look into? I have a decent credit score that is over 700. I recently tried to get an auto loan but was denied for insufficient credit history, which I thought my credit card/rent would be good enough but I guess not. I have since decided against a new truck though.

I am mainly looking for the rewards, and I would prefer something without rotating categories as I am tired of the Discover ones of Home Improvement stores and things like that which I never use.

Restaurants, grocery, gas, things like that obviously take up the most of what I spend money on.",finance
personalfinance,I'm a 25 year old Male living in Wisconsin that seriously needs some help with money and my life. SUPER long life story.,"Throw away because there are a few people in my life that know my other username, and might look me up. Nobody I know really knows reddit, and DEFINITELY nobody knows about PF, so I'm pretty confident this story won't get out. I'm desperate for help while I have a few hours to kill and I've tried to hide this shame about money from myself and other for too long, and I need help. I've seen miracles happen here on PF, so here goes nothing.

I'm sure this will be pretty long. I ramble, I know I'm no english major, but I'll keep it as organized as possible. I'll be keeping a list of debt at the end of this, so I as well as you can keep as track of the amount of money I'm talking about owing.

I'm a 25 year old male living in southern Wisconsin. I have a girlfriend I've been with for 8 years that lives with her mother a city away (About 30 minutes from me) that I have a 4 year old daughter with, that lives with her. I do not pay child support, but I do still owe roughly $1,130.00 for birthing expenses that I have just been letting the state take maybe $10 out of my check once every 2 weeks and they also take my state and federal taxes every year I file them, which isn't much. The girlfriend has been through college and has an Associate's Degree for Animals or something(?), she works at a Vet office/Bed and Biscuit in her town. I've been focusing on myself a lot the last year or so because I'm pretty much falling in a hole more and more lately, and she seems to not really care. She offers money to help pay for stuff in my life, but she doesn't understand that the point I'm at the small amount of money she offers doesn't really help. She claims our daughter on her taxes, even though her Mother takes care of our Daughter way more than either one of us do. The money she gets back FROM claiming her, she spent on a new truck last year, and this year she bought a trailer for her horse, which she will have to start paying room and board once we move out. ANOTHER EXPENSE. This isn't what you're meant to spend tax money from claiming your child on. There are some deep seeded problems she has with parenting that I've tried to tell her she needs to get under control, but she just blocks me out to tells me she doesn't want to listen to or gets upset and shuts down. I don't know how or what to do to get this under control, because her mother doesn't and/or isn't going to do anything about it, because I've discussed it with her, and she hates me already as a person. I pay $80 for daycare a month, her mother pays $160, my parents pay $160 (This ends May 1st, just got the text 20 minutes ago), and it's up to either her mother to MAYBE pull $80 from my girlfriend's bank account (She has access to it) if she has it in there, or I either have to come up with the money or my parents or her mother. She spends all her money from work on make-up or horse supplies, coffee, starbucks, the shit you're not SUPPOSED to buy. She pays a phone bill and insurance on her vehicle, maybe $180 a month, $200 max.

My girlfriend and I are looking at apartments right now in the town she lives in, and a few are in the process of getting approved. I'd have to drive 30 minutes to the town I work in, which I tried to compromise with her on, and she wasn't having it, because her parents 'would help watch our daughter'. I'm fully prepared to go 'no-parent-mode' like I've been doing with my parents for the last 7 years. I'm not exactly sure if I actually want to get an apartment with her, but it's either I get an apartment with her and see my daughter without paying child support (She told me if I am active in our daughter's life, she wouldn't pursue child support) or get my own place and pay out the ass for rent and all the bills on my own, which I already can't handle with a roommate. Like I said in the paragraph above, there are deep seeded parenting and money issues I'm not exactly sure I want to deal with that I've tried to fix over the course of our relationship that just keep coming up. This is really a big issue with me since I am a very independant person, regardless of my money issues, but I've been afloat for 7 years on my own since I was kicked out of my parents at the age of 18 and haven't been evicted or power or water shut off. You get my drift. I feel like I'm jumping into a bigger black hole than I'm already in and she seems to think we're going to work it out once we get there. I know how this works, we're going to struggle while she spends spends spends.

I have a High School Diploma (I got it through a Tech College, it's actually a High School Equivalency Diploma, which technically is the same as a High School Diploma) and worked at least one job at a time since age 18, once in awhile I'll work 2 jobs overlapping so I don't go broke between them (You know, 2-3 week waiting period between checks). I've never been the one to save money, I tend to spend it on past bills or living expenses before I even get the chance to spend it. I don't own a bank account as I'm afraid to, so I own a walmart money card to keep me from getting overdraft fee's or having to deal with bank hours and bullshit that I've had to deal with in the past

I currently live with a friend of mine that I've known since freshman in High School. We split bills pretty equally, $365 a month for rent, he pays internet, water, lawn care. I pay electric/gas. It evens out. I also pay ~$75 cell and $25 credit card bill, which currently has $269 of the $300 limit. I am currently on conditional discharge for a crime in Illinois that I owe a Restitution of roughly $3,000 for that is to be paid by November of this year that I haven't paid anything on, because I've been so broke I'm barely paying my monthly bills. I've been through 2 years of probation and was put on 2 years of conditional discharge to finish paying off restitution, which I'm afraid I'll be thrown in jail for not paying. I know, I'm straight stupid for not taking care of it much much earlier, but fear is the reason why I'm here...

I went to college and dropped out because I kept switching my degree, decided college wasn't for me. In an attempt to not build up MORE debt, I decided to just stop college all together, but school was never my thing in the first place (Hence the HSED and not the official High School Diploma) and quit college. So here I sit 6 years later with a $6,854 U.S. Department Of Education loan I haven't spent a dime on because, again, I'm struggling to keep my head afloat drowning in fear of going back to jail on a crime that I was an accessory to, that I didn't even commit. Whatever, we're not here about that.

I currently work for a company that travels over the midwest. It's crazy hours, nothing 9-5, so a second job is pretty out of the question, but I do want to get a different job. This job is pretty draining, but I do make decent money and I believe this job will help me get ahead of the problem. I started working there in September of 2016. I get paid bi-weekly. Since employment started, I've earned $5,707 while with this business. I've been told that work will pick up more in late May early June into July which will give me more hours meaning more money. My paychecks can be anywhere between $350 to $750, all depending on the work we do. I've had one $750, mostly around $400 - $550. I also go out of town for 3-5 days at a time, which I've been trying to cut down on, simply because I have a fear of bringing home bed bugs, which was the reasoning for my roommate and I leaving our last apartment. The downstairs neighbor brought them home, which we didn't know until after we moved out. We do a lot of local work also, but pay check suffers for that.

I currently own 2 cars, but only drive one. One is a 1998 that's falling apart with 140k miles and the other is 2003 with 114k miles. Neither are insured (Only drive the 1998), because I simply don't have the money to pay for insurance. If I drive it, it's to go to work (1.4 miles away, all back roads) or to go see my daughter 30 minutes away maybe once a week (Again, all back roads). It's a shitty thing to drive without insurance, but I'm riding by the seat of my pants at the moment.

Please let me know if I forgot anything or left anything out. My mind is a mess right now, and I'm so goddamn lost it's unbelievable.

personalfinance,How to pay for trade program?,"Starting in September I'll be starting a dental assisting trade program. It's not apart of a school but rather a practicing dental clinic that devotes Saturdays(a total of 12 weeks each semester) to teaching students. As long as I pay a down payment by July of 300$ and the remaining 3,700$ by October, I'm good.

There is no way I can save up the full amount by then. I have no credit and my boyfriend and I literally live paycheck to paycheck. Partly why I'm going to this program as I can keep my full-time hours.

My question is, what is the best loan option to take? I'm fairly certain I can't get financial aid or a federal student loan as its not an accredited school. Is a bank loan my only bet as I currently bank with the state credit union? The coordinator said nearly 100% of their students graduate each semester and most have jobs waiting for them right after. So I'm cautiously confident I can start paying any loan back fairly quickly.

What loan is my best option and how far in advance should I apply for it?

personalfinance,Need advice on what legal/financial changes come along with marrying my boyfriend in the army,"To preface, I (20/F) don't know much about finances but a friend referred me here.
A while ago, my boyfriend brought up the idea of getting married on paper to receive the financial benefits and then later on in life doing the whole engagement/church wedding thing. As untraditional as this is, we're both comfortable with the idea and just want what's best for our future. We've discussed it more so recently that way I can go to nursing school in Fall 2018 and not have to worry about working, I can live with him, and we'd have our rent paid for by BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) benefit. We'd also find a place on the cheaper side, so we'd have excess BAH to spend/save if needed. To simplify this, no marriage means no BAH money, no BAH money means a lot more stress on us to make ends meet together as a young couple. 

After talking to my parents about it, they brought us points that neither of us know the correct answers to.

I'm currently enrolled in an online college program in my home state, so moving to another state to finish my last year didn't seem like an issue being all my classes are online until graduation. While living in another state with my boyfriend, I'd finish my current degree and hopefully be able to gain residency in that state in order to have in-state tuition during nursing school. 

My main questions are: 

Will my residency change once I marry him or will I have to wait the full year until my residency changes anyways, regardless of the marriage?
-To branch off this, which might be a question for another sub, but can I continue to get in-state tuition in my current program even though I'm technically living in another state ""working toward"" in-state tuition in that state?

I currently file as a dependent of my parents. Will being married affect my student loans/financial aid eligibility (I've never been granted financial aid because my parents income is too high). Thus far, I've paid for school through federal loans (sub/unsub) and parent plus loan (in my Dad's name).

personalfinance,"Update from a year ago: 22 years old making $60k, yet because of loans I'm living paycheck to paycheck. What is my best option here?","One year ago, I wrote this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4lbcin/21m_out_of_college_for_six_months_almost_six/

The advice gave me a lot of clarity at the time. However, recently life kind of imploded- I'm newly single, moved back to the city, and even though things were improving last year, I'm probably worse off than I was before.

Jumping into the numbers. My take-home after taxes and retirement is around $3000- I got a decent raise in January, but now I pay city wage tax, so it's a wash. I contribute 10% into the pre-tax 401k as that's what's matched at my company- it's awesome long-term, but almost $500 a paycheck right now, too.

Student loans are $800 and $200- both 9 years remaining, respectively $62,000 private at 6.2% and $22,000 federal at ~4%. I refinanced the private ones last year, and while my credit improved since then, the offers weren't significantly better when I shopped around recently.  

Rent is $970. For a 1 bedroom in the area, it's a fair price- though I'm not sure if I regret it. It's too small to add a roommate, I think. 

Utilities are 75 for internet, 75 for cell phone, and whatever electric will cost me. I've never paid it before. 

Car expenses are 200 for insurance, maybe 100 for gas, and like 25 for tolls, maybe. Thankfully, I did just pay off the auto loan I had. 

Subscriptions like gym/sports, streaming, etc. are around 100, groceries are 150-200. 

The last time I did all the math, this leaves me with a little more than $200 worth of extra money- that's savings money, 'fun' money for going out, basically whatever I have to live off of that's not a recurring payment. I'm not super splurge-friendly, but still.. 

Much of the advice from last time around probably still sticks. But has anything changed/is there something I'm missing? Is there a benefit to say cutting out my 401k vs trying to re-refinance and get like a 20 year loan or something? Anything else to cut out cleanly? I'd almost rather take a part-time minimum wage job after work than try to jump ship for a higher salary elsewhere- that's how good they are to me here. Is that viable?

A couple hundred extra per month is really all I need in case something goes wrong. I lost a lot of savings paying the deposit for this new place and starting to replace basic furniture that my ex owned, and I'm genuinely on my own in all of this.

I just started working at 50K a year and started consistent savings.  I budget about $2,200 a month and stick to it pretty well and could probably cut back (but maybe don't want to because I still want to enjoy myself).  This leaves me with ~$500 per month savings after all loan payments, 401k contributions, healthcare etc.  I contribute 6% of my salary to my 401k (max employer match) each month.

I currently have 27K in federal student loans over 6 loans at an average interest rate of 4.3% ($2400 is at 6.6%) and I pay about $50 above the minimum each month ($300 a month) towards my loans.

I have $8,000 sitting in the bank between checking and savings and I'm not sure what to do with it, but sitting in the bank isn't ideal.

The 4 main options I'm thinking are to invest $3000 in in a vanguard mutual fund or ETF, open a vanguard IRA with $1000 and start regular contributions, put $1000 towards my highest interest loan, or simply keep it in a high yield savings as an emergency fund and keep saving for a few more months before I think about investing.  

I want to start investing but I understand the importance of an emergency fund and I feel that $8000 in my current situation is a pretty solid E fund so option 1 is probably out

is time for me to come to the retirement they put in consideration (how much you pay for SS) and do their match, a % is for the best 10 years of your last 15 and another % is for how much you pay all your life.
If someone can explain me or direct me to a place that explains how things work here.

&amp;nbsp;

3) 401K, IRA, etc‚Ä¶

What, why and who? What is it, why should I make one and if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsavings account‚Äù, who is managing it?

&amp;nbsp;

4) More than 10K in a non-US bank

Seems like if I have more than 10K in a non-US bank I have to send a special form when I do my IRS. Can someone tell me what is that form and how that will affect my IRS?

Put in consideration that I never did taxes here, can I get a source that has all the information in simple terms about what I need to know and what I need to do related to taxes?

&amp;nbsp;

5) Moving savings to the US

I have my savings in Europe and there I know perfectly well how things work, i.e., I know what I should 
expect my interest rates to be in my savings account, I know how much tax the government takes from my interest rates (27% to be precise). Here I don‚Äôt have a clue how things work. I.e., if I have a job that I 
get 20K a year, but I transfer 100K from Europe to here, will I have any problem with my taxes? Will I have to pay any taxes for that money if I leave it in my checking or savings account? Will my taxes or any other governmental ‚Äúthing‚Äù be affected depending on how much money I have in my name here?",finance

I've paid my CT taxes already.  Very quick and easy online. $168.  MA apparently gave up their handy online method of filing and pawned it off on commercial entities.  Which doesn't help me because I already filled out my federal taxes and all the free sites to help you file your state taxes require you to fill out your federal ones first (but I digress)

My MA taxes are looking to be around $627.  A crazy difference, in my opinion.  Partly it's because they cap your SS deduction at 2000 despite mine being over 9000.

personalfinance,Parents are soon to be foreclosed upon. Sister and I considering taking out a loan to finish paying off their house.,"My parents are in very bad shape financially. They are behind on their taxes, on their house payments, and their credit cards. They have fully burned through their retirement. They are about 5 years away from qualifying for Social Security. They own 2 houses. One payed in full but in disrepair and unlivable. Based on the state it's in I've been told they'd be lucky if they could get $20k to $40k. I think they originally bought it for about $80k around 25 years ago. The other house they live in and have a mortgage. I'm not sure what it's worth to be honest, probably about $100,000 in total based on what similar houses in that town list as on Zillow.

The bank has scheduled a meeting where I've been told they will basically say ""Pay us what you owe (~$35,000) or we will foreclose."" My sister and I would like to prevent this from happening if we can, both because we obviously care about our parents but also because if they get kicked out then they'll probably end up living with one of us or we'll end up paying rent for them to live somewhere. 

I should note that they are in discussion with a bankruptcy lawyer at this time. I haven't been in the discussions so I don't know all of the details, but I did hear them mention something about if they could somehow keep the house in their name for a few more years, they'd be able to qualify for a ""reverse mortgage""? which would let them keep the house until they die, at which point the bank would own it in full.

*The main option we thought of* was to try and pay off the $35,000 somehow, probably us buying the house. We'd be splitting it and I don't have $20k lying around in a savings account so I considered taking out a loan to accomplish this.

***My question***: How does it work when 2 people buy a house together? She has enough money to pay half in cash, while most of my equity is in my 401k which I refuse to touch, so the intent is for the loan payments to be handled by me. If she will be owning half of the house, does she need to be on the loan as well? If she needs to be on the loan then her half would just go in as the down payment which might help get us a better interest rate or something, I don't really know how that works as I've never owned a home before.

Also, would they be allowed to sell us the house for what they owe left? I didn't consider it before, but now I'm worried that the state could get upset and think that they are offloading their assets or something and come after us? Perhaps we could buy the house that's in disrepair instead?

***Edit - our finances:*** Just wanted to add that both my sister and I make decent money but live in expensive areas. Moving isn't an option because our careers are heavily dependent on our area.

personalfinance,Finally open to all US residents: 3.09% - 4.59% APY on this free checking account from Consumers Credit Union,"https://www.myconsumers.org/personal/checking/free-rewards-checking

I have had this checking account for years and it's amazing to be getting more than $25.75 in interest every month ($10k * 3.09% / 12 months), I have never seen another checking or savings account come close.  Yes, there are some minor hoops to jump through (set up direct deposit, 12 check card transactions per month) but they are well worth it.  Personally I use my debit on the first 12 purchases under $10 each month (which includes small monthly bills like Netflix), and then spend the rest on my credit cards to earn rewards.

The amount you earn interest on and the rate of interest depends on if you also use their credit card. Personally for me, based on the amount of cash I have and the rewards I get on other cards, it wasn't worth it to me to go above the 3.09% on the first $10k, but it might be for you.

[EDIT: For clarification, ""the first $10k"" means money you leave in the account, not money you spend. You earn 3.09% / 12 each month on whatever you have sitting in the account. If that's $1 or $10,000, that's what you earn. If you have more than $10k in the account, you still earn 3.09% / 12 on that $10k each month ($25.75 in interest each month) plus a few extra cents from a very low interest rate on whatever you have more than $10k in there.  If you use their card, the rate and the dollar limit are both higher, but may not beat whatever rewards cards you already have.]

Hello everyone,

Long time lurker, first time poster.

I recently got married and am in the process of understanding my wife's financial position. She is completely ""hands off"" and really has no knowledge of the funds she is invested in or anything about them. I cannot complain because she has done well for herself, but I wonder if there are better options for her investments. Her mother considers herself a financial guru, but I question a lot of her strongly-held beliefs. However, I do owe it to her that my wife has been saving/investing from a young age.

Wife has an account with Wells Fargo and we have a financial adviser, with two funds. The first fund is what is called a ""Command"" account. This is not a specific retirement account, and she can write checks off the account - I believe it is a type of Money Market account. I cannot find much information about it at all on Wells Fargo's website. She put money in this account several years ago to help with a downpayment for when she bought a house, but we were able to do so without dipping into this account. There is approximately $20k in the account at the moment and it has made money. I have not dug deep enough to figure out what type of fees they are charging on this one.

The second account is a ROTH IRA. She has an auto-withdrawal from our bank account each month. The fund purchases Class A shares with a 5.75% upfront fee. Our adviser explained to me this high upfront cost is better in the long run due to our time horizon of 30+ years. This fund has also performed decently, but I cannot swallow the 5.75% upfront fee. Is this normal?

The gospel here seems to be Vanguard. I am tempted to transfer this ROTH IRA and auto-withdrawals over to a Vanguard account due to its low fees. I currently hold a Vanguard Target Retirement ROTH and I believe the fees are around 1%, if not less.

We are in a good position and have a solid emergency fund saved up, so I would also like to utilize the $20k in the Command account better. I think using it to max out our ROTH contributions for 2017 and then sticking the rest in a mutual fund is a good option.

Any input would be appreciated! Thank you

Let's say I currently make $37,500 a year and I'm in the position to get a raise soon. Let's say I'll get a $2,500 raise (so I'd be making $40,000).

Filing single, no dependents.

From what I understand, making anything over $37,950 will bump me into a higher tax bracket.

(Source: https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/)

This is where the confusion starts. I'm currently in the 15% bracket, but making over $37,950 would put me in the 25% bracket.

The 15% bracket pays in federal tax: $932.50 plus 15% of the excess over $9325.

The 25% bracket pays in federal tax: $5,226.25 plus 25% of the excess over $37,950.

$5,226.25 (25% bracket) - $932.50 (15% bracket) = $4,293.75.

Does this mean if I get a raise from $37,500 to $40,000 that I would actually be losing $1,793.75?

I have about $5500 in credit card debt, $6000 on a federal student loan @ 6.5%, and another student loan that I used for study abroad with Wells Fargo. $7500 at 11.5%. 

I know that it could be worse and that people have mountains of debt but I feel like throwing up. I can't go out, I can't go do anything, I go to work and I go home right after because I literally can't afford to be outside my house. I'm not sure what to do now. I feel like I can't get ahead paying any of this down. But I haven't put the right effort into doing it. I'm not sure that I know how. 

I've considered moving back in with my parents. But at 27, I'd feel really shitty about that. My rent is as cheap as you can possibly get in my area ($575, NYC suburb) so I don't want to lose that. I leased a car 8 months ago. Been making the payments on time and everything. But I had no business leasing a car for $335 a month (I know guys, I know). Adding up all my expenses, I have very little left for myself, or paying off debts. 

So what do I do? How do I start saving when it literally doesn't seem possible? I work in sales so certainly, I can make more of an effort there. But what else can I do? Should I look into consolidating my loans? Should I start eating ramen every night? I literally don't know where to start because I feel so overwhelmed. Please help me.",finance
personalfinance,Changing Student Loan Repayment Plan and Then Paying off In Excess? (US),"Now, I am sure that there are contingencies in place to prevent this kind of ""loophole"" from being used, but in theory, could I change my student loan repayment to another option such as income-driven, thus lowering my monthly payments/minimum amount due, then use the excess in payments to be applied to the principal balance with the highest interest rate?

I am looking for advice for the best approach, and how much money I should set aside for taxes on this extra income (settlement from a lawsuit) 


Current credit card debt:

* $5,000 on CC1 @ 16.1%
* $9,500 on CC2 @ 14.2%

* $3,800 @ 3.2% (federal loan)
* $5,600 @ 6.6% (federal loan)  


I make about $90,000 per year before taxes and after servicing credit card and loans debts, vehicle/insurance payment, and rent, while trying to put off some money for retirement (I am in my early 50s), I have little wiggle room. I would also like to keep a small emergency fund. I was thinking of taking out the highest interest debt (5k @ 16%, and maybe 9.5k @ 14%) to start off. The student loan debt is depressing me as at the current rate, I am not likely to pay it off until my 60s, so I wanted to apply some of this towards that, however, when looking at the interest rates, that doesn't seem to be a good idea. Another is getting another fixed term consolidation loan for one or more of the cards.  


My goals are to reduce my debt burden as quickly as possible, but also build some sort of emergency fund as I currently have none!

personalfinance,Advice on options for student loans.,"Hello, I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction for if there is anything that I could do about getting my student loans reduced/forgiven or where I could go to get them refinanced or re-consolidated? (Sorry I don't know exactly what I need to do or what things are called.) 

This is a summary of my situation since a few friends think it can help in my options or if it has just been too long since I graduated to get any benefits:

In 2011 I enrolled in IADT Seattle for video game production. At the time I was very enthusiastic about the school coming out of highschool and thought it would be a great way to get into a field I would love. A very big selling point  that they had was how interconnected the school was with the industry and how they had many opportunities to get jobs for students.

What I learned after a few years of going to IADT is that they have had several lawsuits filed against them for misleading and predatory admissions practices. 

As I got closer to my senior year, our school announced that it was acquired by and would be re-branding to Sanford-Brown, which ended up happening all over a single night. 

As I reached my final year of being at the school, they had a new career services employee who, although seemed be able to get some people jobs in the fashion industry of the school, had no apparent connections for  the video game industry and would often send out industry jobs that they had found on craigslist, or other basic level job finders. A lot of the time, they wouldn't be very relevent to students as they would be specialized for a position our school didn't teach, or be senior level positions. 

By the time I graduated, less than half of the students I went to school with had gotten an internship at a company in the industry. I only knew of 2 or 3 people that had actually gotten a job in the industry that was not a game testing position (Since that is a minimum wage job that require no experience)

After I graduated in mid/late 2014, they had gotten a  new career services employee that was able to send out a lot better job postings, but still ended up not being much help. 

Less then a year after I graduated, Sanford Brown also announced that they were no longer accepting enrollment to the school and would be shutting down the campus in 2018. 

The last two bits of info to add is that my student loans got transferred from Sallie Mae to Navient, whom earlier this year was announced to be getting sued by the federal government.  One of the important pieces of information about that is that of the allegations was: (Jan 2010-March 2015) Using uncharacteristically vague email titles like ‚ÄúNew Document Ready to View‚Äù to notify borrowers that they needed to renew their income-based repayment enrollment. During this time, the number of borrowers who did not timely renew their enrollment regularly exceeded 60% of borrowers and resulting, often, in capitalization of interest.

I have about 5 emails from Sallie Mae titled with this as well as 5 others from Navient that was recieved from my student email. Now I have had automatic payments going and from a brief overview, I have not seen any problems in my student loans, whether payments or interest rates but am also not sure what to look for.

Although I have tried many times to get a job in the industry, I have ended up only being able to get a job back in my home town making barely over minimum wage. I haven't had a problem making payments, but it's been more rough for having such a huge debt while not making as much money as if I had gotten a job in the industry.

However, my mom had already claimed the expenditure. Being the mature person I was, I decided to ignore the issue entirely and never filed taxes.

personalfinance,To declare bankruptcy or default on mortgage?,"Hey all, 

23 year old over here with 4 properties passed down from my father (passed away). 

I have one property based in NYC, which is essentially paying for itself (the tenants rents cover the mortgage), and 3 in the Pennsylvania area. 

These homes were purchased on loans about 7 years ago, before the housing bubble popped, and as a result, the loans are almost all fixed rate mortgages.

The New York mortgage ($740K spread amongst two loans) is essentially paying for itself, with the rent, barring any major housework. I managed to get a modification on this loan for a 2% interest rate, so things are pretty smooth here. 

The 3 PA houses are the issues, where tenants are extremely poor.
There are 3 loans here, 66k, 65k, 66k. 
These properties are running at a complete loss, as there are months where there are no tenants (very poor area now). 

I'm looking to get rid of these 3 properties, and their loans, but their property values have sank to lower than half their original value. 

As a result, I don't think these properties can be sold any longer.
Now my question is whether it would be better to declare bankruptcy on these three loans (at the cost of the NY property as  they will seize the property, I believe) or to simply continue paying at a loss. 

My mom is currently running around trying to see if they can be sold by any realtor and I'm very very fearful of declaring bankruptcy.

I made $61,145.83. My company withheld $0 for taxes and I didn't pay anything in (no one told me I was supposed to do this. I won't make the mistake again). I had zero exemptions.

I deducted $1607 from car and sales tax on big purchases, and $12,607 from all other job expenses (equipment, software, home office, business meetings/food).

So with all my deductions, with food and stuff counting 50%, $61k-$11k = $50k/$14,590 = ~29%

is 29% of my income only making ~60 seem right? And also are there more deductions a CPA would be able to help with that would make it worth it because $17k is close to twice what I had put aside for taxes.",finance

Is it viable to use graduated loan payments (smaller amounts at first) and then to pay extra towards the higher rate notes?

I'm looking to go for the 3rd case where I take the 2nd case and then accelerate the higher note which is around 5% with the amount that I wouldn't be paying towards the 3% note (so still paying around $200 a month starting out and hopefully something a bit less towards the latter part of repayment)

personalfinance,"Unsure what to do with my EJ account/Roth IRA, considering fees and future schooling","Hi all, I apologize that this is fairly long!

I have an Edward Jones account, because my parents set me up with one when I was in middle school and stressed the importance of investing. I've been contributing slowly during high school and college. I've realized now that having a financial adviser is not the best option due to the fees, and will probably switch over to vanguard later on. I haven't been investing money lately since I've had a lot of expenses and I don't want to pay the 2% fee (or whatever it is). 

However, I'm in an odd situation. I have about 10k in my EJ account that I already paid the fees on, so keeping it there for now is fine. I also have 2k in a Roth IRA with EJ, which has a $50 annual fee. I also have around 4k in the bank and am slowing saving more from my poorly-paying job. 

I am fortunate to have no debt from my undergrad. I graduated last spring and have been working since. I am planning to go back for my masters starting fall 2018, but it will probably end up costing ~30k. It is a decent field though, and I believe I'll be able to pay off any debt pretty quickly after graduation. I also have almost no growth opportunities with only my BS.

My question is: should I just leave the money in my EJ and take it out to pay for school so I have less loans, then after I empty that account and graduate I can start investing again without an adviser? Or would it be better to leave it invested and take out more loans if they have a low interest rate?

Also, what should I do about the Roth? That one will be taxed if I take it out before retirement, but I'm paying $50/year on it already. It's pretty much stayed at 2k for the last 4 years. Can I transfer that somewhere where there won't be a fee?

After that, every year my rate would change based on the index rate+margin and can't increase/decrease more than 2%.. and overall my rate can't change more than 6% (increase/decrease).

personalfinance,Turbo Tax calculation vs manual calculation is way off for Federal Tax (owing vs refund) - what am I missing?,"I had a friend who is knowledgeable about taxes help me out and do my taxes for me, and I just wanted to run the numbers through Turbo Tax as a double check before I filed anything.

I'm married filing jointly, and we have both W-2 and 1099-Misc income (contractor).  This is the first time we've ever had the 1099 income. When I read over the 1040 though and some of the instructions and do the calculations myself, the figures appear to be correct. Does it matter if the 1099 income gets included on Line 7, 12, or 21 of the 1040? It's currently included on Line 7. I don't see how that affects the calculation of my adjusted gross income though, or my tax, when I go through the instructions. I also confirmed the tax amount from the tax chart for Line 44 (taxable income of $66,540) to be $9,051. I had $11,205 withheld (all from W-2, had extra money deducted), so thought I would be getting a refund.

My ultimate goal is to go to pharmacy school afterwards but I'm mostly worried about undergrad right now. Pitt estimates the total cost for an Out-of-State student as about $43k
   
   Please correct my misunderstandings if I have any. So I believe I can only take out a max of about $16k federal loans, and with the maximum pell grant of about $6k I can get a total of $22k aid from the government. This combined with the schools estimated $7k adds up to $29k a year. 

This still leaves me at a deficit of about $13k a year. Now I still haven't received my complete financial aid letter so it is possible I'd get more or less from the school, but I believe this is the most likely scenario.

personalfinance,I need advice on my student loan please,"Six months ago I decided to take responsibility for my financial life and have followed many of the ideas from this reddit. The last piece to the puzzle is dealing with my student loan - this loan is 30 years old and has been in either forbearance, or in general ignored this whole time. Last June ECMC started garnishing my wages - 15%. I thought this was a good thing and that they were happy about it. I figured it this was not the case when ECMC hijacked my Fed Tax refund. So, I decided to call them and finally straighten it out. So I filled out the form and have some questions for you all.

Facts there are:

5 loans all Subsidized and all at 8% interest, all from 1988 - 1990.

3665.20

392.16

16,507.96

15,490.45

7,798.91

for a total of 43,854.68 - the original loan was for @ 11K (ouch)

ECMC is going to be selling this loan and I rec'd a Letter of Consolidation (which I never asked this loan to be consolidated) today from Federal Loan Servicing. I have to let them know if I want anything changed in 10 days. Any ideas? I will be on the Income Based/Driven repayment plan because I do not make much money, but I want to be responsible and pay monthly. I DO work at a qualifying non profit, so if I stick it out there 10 years, the loan will be forgiven - so that is another piece to be considered. I am 56 (57 in August). Thanks for all your help.

personalfinance,Question regarding student loan,"Hello guys,
I recently graduated in December with about 15k in student loan. Multiple people have told me that I should consider consolidating my loans so that I only have to make one payment instead of multiple ones. Ive also heard on the radio multiple commercials regarding consolidation of loans and how it's helped people but I tend to not trust radio commercials.

My loan provider shows the loans I took out so I don't understand the point of it being one payment since I only have one loan provider. I assume I would pay the loan with the highest interest rate first so I can reduce the overall the total of repayment. 

What I really want to know is if consolidating is an option worth considering and exactly how it could benefit me but also the cons of it.",finance
personalfinance,So my wife wants to go back to school....,"My wife (32) currently holds a BSN and works at hospital making around $45,000 a year. I currently make around $43,000 a year. We have 2 children, a 7 month old and a 9 year old.  Our student loan debt is a cumulative $72,000 with an average interest rate of 5%. Mine being $20,000 and hers $52,000.  We just bought our first home for around $135,000. We have one newer vehicle financed for $28,000.  On top of this, our poor budgeting has gotten us into around $4,000 in credit card debt. 
My wife wants to go back to school get her masters degree and become a nurse practitioner. The school she wants to go to costs around $45,000. Once she graduates starting salary for this position is anywhere from $85,000-120,000. She feels that with this added income, we wouldn't have to worry about the loan payments.
I am personally tired of working just to pay our debts. I feel like we could live very comfortably now if we just budgeted better and got a cheaper vehicle. Am I wrong for not wanting her to go back to school given our current amount of debt? Or would the added income payoff in the long run?",finance
personalfinance,First time getting a CP2000 and questions on penalty/interest,"So my wife and I just got the dreaded letter from the IRS in the form of a CP2000. We had incorrectly forgotten to add three income sources from 2015, all stock sales from my previous job for stock I had vested as part of my compensation package. The total of securities related income came to about $23K resulting in a miss of ~$9K in owed taxes. Combine that $9K with about $500 in interest accrued from 2015 and also a $1900 ""substantial tax understatement penalty"" and we're look about around $12K in a proposed amount due.

I believe we had whiffed on reporting this possibly because we never received the 1099-B forms and I think our (stupid) assumption was that this income must have been rolled up into my W2. I had switched jobs that year which complicated matters as I started to pay social security taxes again at the new job so we anticipated a refund of about $5K in overpayments there. Net-net lots of things culminated to make this just an unusual year for us tax-wise. We've sold stocks plenty of times before and always got the proper forms which aided in our reporting. 

It was definitely our mistake and while I know the IRS doesn't give a damn about whether or not it was our intent (we filed ourselves), I am curious if anyone has any insight into whether or not we can push back on either the interest or the $1800 in ""substantial tax understatement penalty"". 

My reasoning for trying to see if there is an abatement path that we could pursue for the penalty and interest is due to the lack of the 1099-B forms being sent to us. Also I read that pursuant to IRC Section 6664(c)(1) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.6664-4, the accuracy-related penalty does not apply to any portion of an underpayment where the taxpayer acted with ‚Äúreasonable cause and in good faith‚Äù. I'm totally not sure how this intentionally vague legal language could be applied nor whether the IRS would be likely to strike all or a portion of either of these fees. For what it's worth we are and have always been in good standing with the IRS, we also often file rather early and neither of us have ever asked for an extension.

I tried looking in the wiki and searching first to see if there was any previous thread on this particular topic but didn't find one. 

I am aware of the payment options that we have and while it's definitely a solid chunk of cash we have plenty of reasonable options to pay it off in full.

personalfinance,"Multiple student loans, closed credit cards, medical bills and an old car","Hey guys, so I have been considering seeing a credit counselor but I thought I would get your opinion on my massive debt first. Here goes:

3 student loans totaling about 75k
1 student loan that has defaulted at about 9k
2 credit cards at 2500 and 1500 that have both been closed out (in collections)
Medical bills from two hospitals each around 1300 (2600 total)
1 credit card with an 1800 dollar balance that I am making automatic payments on of 64 dollars a month. It is closed out so no interest is accruing. 
The loans I am paying are private. I have federal loans but I qualify for a zero dollar a month income based repayment plan, so I have never paid towards federal loans. 

Currently, I pay the 3 student loans monthly as well as the last mentioned credit card (total: 440). I have 4K saved and want to keep that saved because I have an old car that has been reliable but you never know what could happen. I feel that just the sheer dollar amount of debt is overwhelming and I don't know where to start to rebuild my credit (which is just about as low as can be, around 500 last time I checked). 

*I make about 800/week but I am a server at a restaurant so this is not always consistent. My weekly earnings range from 600-900 a week. 

Other expenses: rent-500/mo, gym-20/mo, health insurance- 50/mo.

What is most important to tackle first? I'm 27 and I want to start rebuilding my credit as I am well out of college now and would like to be able to buy a car or house someday.",finance
personalfinance,"I have an idea of how to handle my finances, but want to make sure I'n solid","Alright folks, so I'm 21 and I'm currently taking some time off of college (read: dropping out until further notice) to pursue a research project and write a book. To fund this, I took a position at a car dealership as a salesperson. I'm going to be making $500/week after my two-week training period, during which I'll make $435. I get paid weekly after my first paycheck, which I won't get until two weeks after I start.
I also have the opportunity to make a small commission per car I sell, and there are various bonus I'll be eligible for throughout the month. 

My rent payment is $550 until August, when I'm moving and it'll go up to $560. This includes everything besides cable and internet, which is roughly $35 each month. 

My other expenses (before my student loan payments) total about $545. This includes groceries and paying $75 a month on my loan interest. 

I used to be super on top of my expenses, but I had an unexpected period of not working right after the New Year, and I ended up relying too much on my credit card, and opening another one. I have the Discover IT card, a TJ Maxx Card, and a JC Penny Card. I opened the last one so I could afford to buy uniforms for work, and want to pay off and close it as soon as possible as it has less than $100 on it. 

I have about $65,000 in student loans, and $2,100 in credit card debt right now. I'm considering applying for a balance transfer card, because right now I'm getting eaten alive by interest charges on the Discover Card. 

I'm also behind on a few bills, and will need to spend my first two weeks of pay (which I will get on 28th of this month) will all be going towards those. I'll be finally caught up, but it's going to wipe me out again. I'm just worried about the hit on my credit (that's already not doing so hot), or getting involved with a balance transfer card that's not good.

The other issue I have is that I'm going to need to purchase a new car in the next few months. I can't take a bus out to where I work, and I also have a lot of driving requirements with my job. I'm currently driving a beater, and I think I can make it last for about another month or two. Luckily, I get a healthy discount on vehicles through work, but I also need to figure out how much car and insurance I can reasonably afford. I also need to decide whether I want to rent or lease.

I'm also planning to getting my real estate license this fall, and need to save up for my class and brokerage fees (roughly $400). 

This is the first job I'm going to have where I'll be making more than minimum wage, and I want to get to a point where I'm not living paycheck to paycheck. I'm going to be working a ridiculous amount, and I want to be able to get on top of my finances and then save up enough money to move out of my current city for a little bit. I also want to enjoy life while I'm working, but I want to avoid my expenses rising with my income and not really seeing my savings rise. 

My current thoughts are to pay off my credit cards as much as possible before my first round of student loan payments kick in in June (I've already used my grace period previously). In my mind, this would free up more of my budget for my student loans when they kick in, and I'd only have my small monthly payment for my credit card. (when it's not maxed, I use it like my debit card and pay it as I go, which is what I want to ideally get back to ASAP. I need to repair my credit)
I also want to pay off my student loans before I put anything into retirement savings. My employer doesn't have a matching 401K (but the real estate agency I'm looking into does---so this is a maybe option for the future), and I know I won't find a savings account with a higher interest rate than my student loans are. If I pay off those as quickly as possible, it'll free up my credit and allow me to go back and finish my degree eventually. Does this make sense? Or is there a better way to go about this that I'm missing?

I started with the PF Wiki, and I already use Mint as a budgeting tool. I also have a personalized spreadsheet, and try to do some freelancing work that brings in ~$50 a month, but I don't want to rely on that for anything. I know I've made some blunders and outright mistakes, and I'm currently watching both of my parents teeter on the brink of bankruptcy--I don't want that to be me. I'm still young, I don't have children, and I want to get my shit together in the next two years before I make the big move across the country.",finance

personalfinance,Need financial and general advice whilst waiting to enlist in the British army (uk),"Hey, im not sure if this is appropriate for this particular sub but here goes. I have a few questions but i‚Äôd also like a second opinion of my plan just for a yay or nay.

Currently im 21, living in Edmonton, Canada. I moved here almost 3 years ago from Sheffield, England. Initially i moved here with my brother and parents hoping to find better work and a better standard of living, following a series of bad advice, no help from CIC or local government, very poor immigration system and general bad luck, i have had to overstay my visa by over 2 years. Im getting tired of this and after not being allowed to work or literally anything im planning on going home where i at least have the option of finding a job to support myself.

The issue is i don‚Äôt have any other family or friends in the uk that i can lean on whilst i get back on my feet, i have zero savings after i purchase a plane ticket and no job to go back to, to start earning enough to support myself. 

My long term plan is to enlist in the army, personally i think 4 years of service in return for a warm bed, food and a roof over my head is the best idea for someone who has nothing but i need to last through the application process that i have already started and am putting together paperwork for i do need to be in the uk however for the later parts of the selection process. 

What i need to know is, what are my options to financially support myself? 

my current plan is to take out a personal loan of 5000 pounds as a crutch to fall back on for rent and bills with my parents covering the monthly repayments until i can take over for them. Im guessing it‚Äôll take me between 2weeks and a month to find a job which at 7pounds/hour i can cover a cheap flat or shared with roommates. 

I‚Äôve worked it out financially if i can get this loan as follows
5000 pounds at a fixed interest rate of 6.9% will cost me 98.28 pounds per month over 5 years.
A job earning 7/Hr at 24 hours a week times 4 weeks i‚Äôll be pulling in around 672/month. 
Without my parents pitching in towards the loan i would have 574/month to spend on a flat and bills which i can live with if i budget correctly with food banks, friends help etc. 
I can also apply for the Universal credit which is 251.77 a month which works out at 

Wage/month+UC-loan=825.49/month

an average unshared rent is around 567 according to the internet. leaving me with 258.49 to play with for food, utility and misc bills. 

Once im in the army thats around 1200/month through phase 1 and 2 so i can comfortably take over the loan and then when i pass out a lance corporal (im heading for military police) earns around 24,524 a year and im then in the clear and where i want to be in life.

I understand the loan shouldn‚Äôt be a crutch and i shouldn‚Äôt use it as my basis as i might not even get the loan but its my best idea so far.

The job only has to last 6-12 months until i enlist but i don‚Äôt know what options i have for:

1. The time between arriving in the uk and finding somewhere to live
2. Income support/social aid
3. Personal loans, i honestly don‚Äôt know how they work.
4. Borrowing money in general, i have never borrowed money or have a credit card so i doubt i even have a credit score.
5. I have no transport or a drivers license but i have already arranged from the airport to Sheffield when needed.
6. How to get in touch with financial help if i have no static address.

Im pretty much very frazzled by the task ahead but i‚Äôve done a fair amount of homework so far but i may have missed something helpful. I can‚Äôt stay in Edmonton cos well its not technically illegal to overstay a visa, however i could be picked up by the authorities and deported anyway. So i need to put a plan in place beforehand.

TLDR 

Moving countries back to Sheffield, England with nothing and no one to help to Enlist in the army. What options are at my disposal financially to stay off the streets for 6-12 months?

financialindependence,Idea for a tax-savings trick the final year before pulling the plug: manipulating state tax witholding,"Any tax experts out there who can help tell me if this idea is legal, or even feasible? My state allows you to request additional state tax withholding above and beyond the amount you are required to withhold. Taking advantage of this, for the last year before you retire, couldn't you up your state tax withholding to a massive amount (say, 1/2 your salary), and then deduct that from your federal income (since itemized deductions are based on the withheld amount, not the actual amount)?


The next year, you will collect the massive state tax refund, and this will be taxable for the new year--at your lower, post-retirement tax rate.


This seems gimmicky enough to not be a truly good idea, but if it works, it could easily save thousands in your final year tax bill.",finance

personalfinance,Please double check my student loan refinancing offer before I commit!,"Hey /r/Personalfinance,

I have been coming to this sub for help with my student loans pretty often and I have decided I need to refinance ASAP. I definitely would like some help going over this to make sure I am making the right decision because so far, it seems too good to be true.

I have an average of around 75k in private loans.

60k with discover, 8k with citizens, and 5k with sallie mae. 

I have an average of 9.2% interest rate for 10 years. My monthly payments are 655 for discover, 92 with citizens and 77 for sallies mae. I make about 85k pre tax.

Now, my sallie mae loan is at 3.2 percent but the rest of my loans are an average of 9.2 percent. I shouldn't include the sallie mae loan into my refinancing because the interest rate is so low, correct?

The offer I am looking at through credible.com is this:

Loan through College Ave:  fixed rate of 5.35% @ 1,446/month for 5 years, lifetime savings of 33k.

OR

Fixed rate of 5.6% @ 859/month (pretty much what Im paying now) with a lifetime savings of 21k.

It seems like a no brainer to go with either of these but it seems too good to be true. Does anyone see any negatives to this? I would generally rather pay it off in 5 years but the 10 year term might be a bit more comfortable.

personalfinance,(US) Tax filing conundrum - 1099-related in California,"**Background:** So I'm an international student currently finishing off my masters in the state of California where I've lived since I came here in 2015. 

Summer of 2016 was the first time I started making income. This was at a startup where my official role was an independent consultant in a 3-month gig. Since this was about 50 miles away from where I was living at the time, I relocated to a place where I paid about $1000/month for 3 months (Bay Area rent prices =[ ) so that I can travel regularly to office.

**Fast forward to today:** In the midst of filing taxes, I did my federal taxes (with the 1099-MISC that I got from this company) and the question **expenses related to your independent service** as a question did not really jump out at me. But while filing my state taxes (which I've not completed yet), I found that question relevant to my situation but not sure if it is. 

I am extremely curious about two things:

1. Does my paying rent qualify as something I can claim as an expense in filing taxes? Do I include the whole amount?

2. If yes, I have already filed my federal taxes. Can I still claim this as expenses through my state returns? If not, can I claim it in later years?

THANK YOU!

gaming,Does anyone remember this kids PC game?,"When I was a kid, my parents bought a windows 95 pc that had this interactive kids game pre loaded onto it. I can't remember all the details, or the name of it for the life of me! Can anyone help me out?

The game consisted of several mini games. 

Stylistically, the game had cartoon-drawn graphics that were perhaps a little similar to the popular Pyjama Sam games that were big at the time. 

The main game screen had a background setting that looked sort of like a cave, which had a ceiling that opened up onto a starry night sky to give you the impression you were in some sort of space cave. 

The characters were whacky I sort of remember, but I don't recall if they were specific animals or aliens etc. 

One mini game had a circle split into quadrants, each with a different colour. You simply had to repeat the sequence after the game pointed and sounded out a pattern.

I also recall a green plant/ fern with a mouth that got fed if you got some answers right in one of the mini games. 

There may or may not have been a rocket ship involved as well.

financialindependence,Proposed FIRE tenant: If you're getting a big tax refund you're doing it wrong.,"I was pleased when we sat down with our accountant and learned that we were getting a big Federal tax refund. Yeah!

But then I realized: we had given the government a big, interest-free loan for the last year. And the refund was almost 10% of our income. That money could have been working for us (and yes, it was accumulated over the entire year, but still).

It's tough to get it exactly right. My goal is to receive a very small refund, or ideally, have less than $1,000 to pay. 

What makes our taxes tricky is our taxable investments. Some years the earnings are big and not offset with losses. A few years ago I had a huge success with a stock and needed to get out. The capital gains was staggering (yes, we had the money from the sale, but still). And it threw off our tax planning for the last several years. 

FIRE advocates are typically super savers. The conventional ""our refund is our savings"" approach seems to be antithetical to FIRE. What say you?

personalfinance,[Debt] Using 0% APR balance transfers to pay down student loan debt - worth it?,"Hi PF,

I'm considering paying down a chunk of student loan debt with a 0% APR balance transfer that has a 2% transfer fee. The loan: I owe $17,000 and my interest rate is 7.5%(V). 

The 0% APR is for 12 months, so I'd only transfer an amount I am absolutely certain I can pay off in that time period.

I'm having trouble figuring out the exact numbers... Not sure if I'm doing this right. Based on what I've found, student loan interest is compounded daily, so at 7.5% my $17K loan gains $3.47 in interest daily. If I use the balance transfer to pay off $1k, the loan accrues $3.26 daily. 

A $1K transfer would be $20 in transfer fees, but the difference in interest accrual would make the fees worth it (would pay for itself after about 100 days, since I would accrue $0.21 less interest daily). Ignoring amortization here.

Is this math right? Or have I oversimplified things? 

**EDIT** leaning towards going ahead with the balance transfer. According to unbury.us, paying $1000 up front and continuing to make minimum payments on the loan knocks over $600 off total interest paid over the lifetime of the loan - if you have a strong argument against doing so, please speak up.",finance

3. Primary home, C has $850k mortgage at 3.625% fixed for 30 years, Monthly PITI=$4900, no depreciation for Primary, but tax deduction is 1/3rd of 3.625% that gives me reduced mortgage rate 2.42%.

If I pay down primary home mortgage, I can reset PITI at reduced rate.

I bring depreciation here as that is tax deductible. Assume I have 33% IRS and 10% CA tax, overall 43% taxes.

Now, I am around 56 age, planning to retire soon in 5 to 7 years. I have $750k cash to pay down my mortgages so that I can free up from mortgage world.

I have Dave Ramsey option 1) Pay full Multiplex B 290k (highest rate 4.25%) and then pay down primary 850k with balance 360k, then reset PITI. But, I find this is not reducing cash flow, but has the risk of keeping the loan for longer period.

I see paying down Multiplex A (733k) will release my mortgage (lowest rate mortgage) a lot, provides me tax free money that I can use to pay faster Multiplex B mortgage. This provides me tax free cash flow and I can pay off both rental homes mortgages in next 5-7 years.

personalfinance,"[Debt] Looking to refinance $107,000 of Parent PLUS loans with Sofi. Advice appreciated.","OVERVIEW
My dad has $107,000 in parent plus loans with FedLoans servicing right now, and he and I are looking into refinancing with Sofi. There are 4 notes all around $27,000 with interest rates ranging from 6.16% to 7.65%. The weighted average rate for consolidation purposes would be 6.85%. The reason we're looking to switch is because over the last two months every penny has gone to interest with nothing going to principal reduction. 

INCOME AND DEBT
My dad has a steady,reliable job making between $45-50k annually. The only other debt he has is an $8k car loan, no mortgage or cc debt. I can't speak too much about his monthly expenses but I know he lives well within his means and has money left over each month. He also says he'll try to throw an extra $100/mo at the loans but I'm not relying on this for my decision. 

My income is $61k annually (up from $55k) with a solid regional bank. I have $20k in student loans in my name but no other debt. I am able to comfortably cover the payment on my own debt and the parent plus loans. My monthly take home (after taxes, 401k, insurance, etc.) is ~$3,200 with monthly expenses ~$1,600 including student loan payments. 

REPAYMENT PLANS
The parent plus loans are with FedLoans on a 25yr payment plan which is $794/mo. Their website shows we could switch over to the 10yr payment plan but the payments would jump to $1,300/mo. 

REFINANCING OPTION
Looking on Sofi my dad by himself could get a 15yr payment plan at 6.49% (after a .25% rate reduction through autopay) which would mean payments ~$950/mo. I added myself as a cosigner and that helped so now we're looking at a 10yr payment plan at 6% (after autopay reduction) which is ~$1,150/mo. Both options are higher than the current $794 payment but the Sofi options pay off quicker and ultimately save me more money. 

The plan all along has been for me to pay off the parent plus loans since my dad took them out for me to be able to attend college. I recently got a promotion which means an extra $200/mo give or take. I have looked at my budget and even with the increased loan payments I would still be fine.

When I lived in Chicago, I was very close to buying a duplex property.  I was going to live in one side and rent out the other side.  The rental income would have paid for about 80% of my mortgage.  From there, I was going to use the equity I built in that duplex to buy more property.

I now live in Southern California.  Real estate is extremely expensive here which presents a barrier to entry.  The rental market is high demand, but laws strongly favor tenants.  The strong tenant laws might not be a problem with investors that have several units, but it could be a nightmare for a small investor like me.  I'm almost ready to give up on the real estate dreams since moving to SoCal.

Unlike real estate, I can't exactly get a loan at 3.5% APR for a $450,000 investment with stocks.  I have to put up money without a loan.  In real estate, the goal was to simply have a property appreciation that's greater than the interest being paid.  In stocks, it's all current.  I've been investing here and there, but it's going to be a long road to millions this way.  How can I catch a break!?  Any advice is welcomed.  Thanks for reading.

We have $30k in a savings account and are saving $2500/month.

We are saving for a house, engagement ring, wedding, everything.

My question is when to do what? Should we get married first? Buy a house first? Should we buy with a lower down payment in a year from now and pay pmi but avoid rising interest rates? 

Decent 3 bedroom houses down here start at around 300-325k.

I don't plan to spend more than 10k on the wedding plus the ring.

It's a tough situation because the apartment complex where we live is going down hill fast and we can't find a comparable place without paying at least another $500 monthly in rent.

It would take us 2 more years of saving to buy a house with 20% down, and we'd have to keep putting off marriage until at least a year after that(if we go that route) 

Anyone have any recommendations for this situation? What would you do first?",finance

I have a 750 credit score and am currently earning roughly $32k per year. My girlfriend has roughly the same credit score and is just starting a new commission based job, so we dont know what her annual income will be yet.

Edit #1
As a follow up, i have read a little about quit claim deeds. Would pursuing this make any sense in my case? From what I have read, they could add me to the mortgage, then I could refinance, and then remove them from the deed. Would i be able to avoid any fees by going this route?

personalfinance,"My parents are offering to pay off my husband's private student loans ($63k), should we take it?","My parents have offered to pay my husband's (both of us are 25) private loans to rid us of interest, then the idea is that we pay them back. They are retiring and this is what my mom wants to do with a lump sum she's receiving from work rather than receive a bit more money each month forever. Theoretically she'd get the money because we'd be paying her, which is fine with us. EDIT: *but they will not charge interest*! We have a great relationship with my parents and they have no complex about money. However, my husband's debt (63k, consolidated already, interest rate: 4.73%, rate discounts: -0.25% (interest rate fluctuates monthly based on market rate)). Right now we are paying about $250 a month **just on interest**. Principal starts in 2-3 years and will be ~$500 a month. It will reach maturity in 2030.

One of the main issues is that I am starting grad school in the fall and am looking at 5-7 years of making grad assistant money while my husband's income is only about 40k a year (at the high end). Saving will already be tough in the area we'll be in and we also pay his public loans (25k). It would be nice to not worry about saving enough for the jump up to $500 a month and keep paying the $250 until we get out of school. I haven't talked details with my parents but I expect them to request we pay the same rate or that they will even have us not pay them back until after I receive my degree.

My question though is, if we are only paying interest for the next 2-3 years, then all principal, does that mean the bank already cashed in on all our interest payments? Would we really only be saving the next two years of payments because we have interest due now? Does it make more sense for my parents to just pay the interest through the bank then we pay the principal? Is that even a thing? We are so confused about this and our bank obviously doesn't really make it easy to understand how much we are saving if we paid it all off... It seems like a good deal but I don't want to cheap my parents out of retirement money they could use for themselves if this won't really benefit us much.

I'm 26, live with 3 roommates and work in healthcare. I graduated in 2013 with 105k in undergrad debt. Ive been working to pay it off and right now owe 80k. I earned 56k in 2016 and on Friday just accepted a position that will nearly double my income. The position is in pharmaceutical services sales. I'll be selling a back end data piece for ensuring patient compliance. The base salary is 82.5k, with the potential to make 7.5k per quarter (30k per year) in commission. This is a new territory for the company so I don't expect that for a few quarters. On top of that, this position is 50% travel (within 2 hours). For that, they will give me $750 per month for a car stipend. 

I drive a 2006 Honda Civic with 110k miles. There is no USB, the AC barely works, and there's no GPS. My new position (starting May 8th) will be traveling to different hospitals, clinics, and health facilities speaking with doctors. I would prefer a newish car so I'm not sweating in my suit and have GPS since I'll be visiting a dozen or so random places within 2 hours. Also, I'd need something reliable. 

My current budget for rent, food, utilities, loans, etc is $2400 per month. Regarding student loans, I owe 50k in a Parent PLUS loan (6.8%), 28k in federal loans in my name (ranging from 4-6%), and 1.5k in a private loan at 8.3%. The private loan was 14k last March but I've paid off a huge chunk. 

I currently have $200 in my checking, and $1300 in my savings. I am giving my two weeks this week. I will be getting my PTO I've saved up ($3,300 before taxes), plus my final paycheck ($1,400 after taxes). 

I'm wondering if I should buy a 20k car, finance it so the payments are $300 or so, and use the additional $450 car stipend from work for gas and whatever else. I'm mainly going to keep my budget nearly identical, maybe allow myself an additional $2-400 per month in spending. Majority will go to my loans and savings. I have 21k in a 403(b), and my new employer matches up to 6% which I will be taking advantage of.

business,How To Prepare For Auto Financing Before Shopping For A Car,"The capability of being eligible for auto financing is something that literally everyone longs for; however, not everyone manages to attain this. The reason for this is poor credit.

&amp;nbsp;


Any FICO score below 600 is believed to be bad credit score by a huge majority of lenders for auto financing.  A big challenge for applicants with bad credit is that most lenders of auto financing just consider the credit score of the applicant but normally overlook other elements that might be important.

&amp;nbsp;


They fail to examine other factors that may otherwise show credit-worthiness, like employment background or personal items on the credit report of the applicant.

&amp;nbsp;

If your credit score is poor, you have undoubtedly gone through some difficulties in getting loan approval. Below are 7 tips for acquiring special auto financing for individuals with poor credit.

&amp;nbsp;


**1.	Get a vehicle which falls within your cost range**



It is advisable to get practical first. Your prospects of becoming 	eligible for auto financing rises if you just opt to buy a vehicle 	that costs less. It would of course be nice to get the 	sophisticated model you have always dreamt of. 

&amp;nbsp;


However, if your credit score is bad, this is not possible. So, choose an affordable vehicle now from a trusted website like buyherepayherelistings.com. In two years, as you endeavor to make your credit score better, you can purchase the improved model.

&amp;nbsp;


**2.	Make a Substantial down payment to decrease your loan amount**




Making a huger down payment is another method of 	decreasing your loan amount and raising your prospects of 	acquiring special auto financing for people with bad credit. 	This might not be possible for you, but this is all right. 	However, if 	you can, put together more cash for the down 	payment, instead of the minimum amount required.

&amp;nbsp;


**3.	Conduct a Personal Credit analysis on yourself**





The poor credit auto financing lenders you will apply to 	shall check your credit score. This is the reason it is a great 	idea to first conduct a credit analysis on yourself. 


&amp;nbsp;


When you do this, you are able to check your report and 	search for any element that is noticeable, good or bad.  	Run 	your report with three agencies that are among the 	top ones and familiarize yourself with all.

&amp;nbsp;


**4.	Enquire from one lender so as to know the rate you are eligible for**




The next vital step to take is ascertaining a ‚Äòbaseline quote‚Äô by 	making an application to only one new lender. Write down 	each of the loan term details provided to you, for instance, the 	repayment period and interest rate, e.g. 60 months. You shall 	ask for the same terms or better, from the other lenders you 	apply to.


&amp;nbsp;


**5.	Create a list of a minimum of 5 poor credit auto financing lenders**




You should now explore further to compile a list of more poor 	credit auto financing lenders. This list should have a minimum 	of 5 lenders. Conduct an online search.

&amp;nbsp;


**6.	Send an application for auto financing to all lenders on your list**





It is now time to begin submitting the applications. Make an application to all the lenders on your list for example loanofficer.us. 


&amp;nbsp;


**7.	Negotiate for best offer**




This is the time to consult the ones who gave you a good offer 	and consult for an even better offer. Your prospects of 	being successful will increase if you negotiate, rather than 	simply acceding to their offer to you the first time.",finance

All this information is what I'm getting from Fidelity when I click on the withdraw all money from account page.

I've read a ton on this, and I just want some confirmations before I proceed. I'm aware of the significant loss of compound interest since I'm only 25, but I'm taking a risk in many ways seeing as I left my job to be a singer. I want to go all in and I need to fund this venture.

I know I'll have to pay tax on the taxable contributions. Do these end up being lumped in with my normal income tax when I file? I already paid more than I would need to for the upcoming tax year since my job's tax bracket was much higher than what I'll end up in at the end of the year. I'm trying to understand what I'll have to pay/get back.

I know that 20% gets withheld by federal law. Do I receive this at some point?

Does the 10% penalty get applied to my non-taxable part as well? I've only had the account for 1.5 years, but I thought you could withdraw the contributions without penalty, but I also read something about needing the account for 5 years or something.

I have an IRA account open with Schwab (I also do banking with them). Would it be simpler to just do a direct rollover to an IRA instead of indirect and then cash that out?

personalfinance,How/when should I pay off my student loans,"Hey everyone, so I'm trying to maximize credit score benefits as well as cash rewards when paying off my student loans.

In regards to the cash rewards, I will be paying my Navient loans with my Citi Double Cash card (to get 2% off) or whatever other card I have at the time that requires some certain amount of spend for the sign up bonus.

However, I'm curious as to how/when I should pay off the loans. I owe about $14k, and they are all subsidized loans (I never needed them, simply a requirement of my scholarship), so 0% interest until six months after I graduate.

To maximize credit score benefits, should I pay slowly monthly or can I pay them all off at once and still see the same benefit? I'm also thinking about waiting until the last month or so to pay them off to get as long of a history with those accounts as possible.

What would you guys recommend?

Also, I'm sure some people will recommend I consider investing the money in something with a higher return than the interest rate of the loans, but I'm saving to buy a home anyway and won't be making any investments until after that... (I'm only investing into my Roth to get my employer match).

Please let me know what you guys recommend! Thank you!

personalfinance,Can a cosigner who has filed for bankruptcy be removed from a loan?,"Ten years ago, my SO took out two student loans (private) with his father as a cosigner. His father recently filed for bankruptcy (Chapter 13) and, as a result, my SO lost all online access and auto-payments to his loan (which gave us a little decrease in the interest rates).


The bank told us that he will not have online access restored to the loans (and the decrease in interest rate) until his father is removed as a cosigner (either by filing a form or consolidation). This goes against what the lawyer has told his father, which is that he will not be able to be removed from any loans during bankruptcy proceedings (which could go on for months). The lawyer has been not very knowledgeable of the situation as it applies to us but we also have very little trust in the bank so we aren't sure who to trust. 


So we've decided to pose our questions to strangers on the internet:
1) Can a cosigner who has filed for bankruptcy be removed from a loan?
2) Will the bankruptcy filing of the cosigner have any effect on my SO's credit? He's been making on-time payments for the entire out-of-forbearance lifetime of the loan.

personalfinance,Any tips on reducing tax burden when withdrawing from 401K?,"I'm taking a job pretty soon that offers a 401k plan. I like the tax saving opportunity. However, if I do want to take the cash out early, here are my three questions:

1. After I leave this job in the future, is it wiser to take these funds out when living in a lower tax state? California = high tax, Florida = low tax (for example). I have the ability to easily move.

2. Is it best to withdraw from the 401K when my taxable income is low in order to be in a lower federal tax bracket? Or is there a flat taxation plan specific to 401Ks?

3. If the employer does not match my contribution, then the 401K may not be the best option. Instead of putting money into a 401K plan, are there better alternatives to reduce my tax burden while also granting me a comfortable level of access to the money?

I get that withdrawing from a 401K early isn't generally a good idea and blah blah. Just asking questions at this point.

personalfinance,Years of Late Payments Affecting Credit/Life,"Background:

Entering college in 2007, I took out a $5000 private student loan at 10.5 % with now bankrupt My Rich Uncle. It was a bad loan, but I needed it then. 

Graduated in 2011, informed that MRU Holdings was bought by Education Empowerment Fund and then sold to Younomics. 

Between the end of my grace period in 2011 and July 2016, I recklessly avoided the loan and missed 39 monthly payments, many of which are 120+ day late payments. Loan now sits at right under $10,000 after accumulated interest and late fees.

Now in 2017, and have brought this account and all others up to date and have been meticulously been tracking my finances from strict budgeting and monitoring my credit score. In 2016, I became a teacher and went from making about $20K to $41K a year. With the help of THIS SUB (praise y'all) I've gone from a credit score in the 460s to just under 700 in the past 18 months. 

Currently, my progress on improving my credit score is being severely limited by these late payments. Assuming the payments will fall off 7 years from the date of missed payment, I'll have these on my credit scores for the next 6 years. The reason I want to move my score up to the next credit tier is so that I can refinance this awful loan and hopefully begin saving for home down payment and apply for a mortgage in the next 2-3 years. I have attempted to refinance through many of the common student loan companies, but have been rejected by all.

What is the the best way to move forward and diminish the effects of these late payments sooner than 2023? I've come up with a few possible solutions, and would love advice and feedback on the plausibility of each.

NOTE: I have 9 open accounts, 2 credit cards, 1 car loan, 1 private student loan, and 4 federal loans that I pay each month, counting towards my total current payments with the credit bureaus.

Option A: Do nothing and keep paying. Ride out the negative effect of the late payments until they fall off in 2023. 

Option B: Contact the creditor and ask some sort of removal of the  late payments. The company is VERY opaque and the only way of communication is by email. The were responsive in putting me on a partial payment plan in the past, but balked at me asking them report to the credit bureaus that my account was current for those months. During those 6 months of partial payment, the account was still reported as 120+ days late.

Option C: Wait a few months, I should be eligible to refinance through my credit union in August when i meet their requirements of 1) Having income of $40,000 and 2) Been employed with current employer for two years. (Alliant CU) At this point, I can pay off the bad loan, and begin making payments at a more reasonable interest rate. This is a great solution, but I would like to maximize the effect of this by maybe again negotiating an in-full payment for the deletion of old payments. Would this work? 

Option D: Ask for debt validation. MyRichUncle went bankrupt under after a student lending scandal. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyRichUncle#2007_student_lending_scandal

So, it may be possible Younomics doesn't have proof of my debt. I've been making payments to them for over a year, so would it be worth it to ask for a debt verification? Thinking they might have lost paper trail over the course of being bought and sold several times over.

Do any of these options seem viable? 


tldr: Private student loan of $10K at 10.5%. Missed 39 payments, which are dragging down my credit score and future financial opportunity. Seeking advice moving forward.

personalfinance,Making progress with my Mom‚Äôs finances,"Mom is 82.  She sucks at managing her money.  Always has, but after Dad died 10 years ago, she didn‚Äôt care about anything.  I know, depressed and should seek help.  But she refused and continues to refuse, so....

Anyway, I‚Äôm 250 miles away and at the beginning of 2016, I found out just how bad her finances are, or I get a good idea without a complete picture.  It took a year to convince her to let me help organize things, creating online access to *every* account, bill, etc.  Then I found out it was worse than I thought.

In January, I created a spreadsheet of it all: creditor, phone number, account, username/password, closing date, due date, last paid, and balance.  For cards, I added expiration date, interest rate, and credit limit.

My brother and I loaned her just over $10K, to bring down the balance on a high-interest card.  Even if we have to wait to get repaid from her estate (houses in SoCal are worth a lot), we can wait.  This made a HUGE difference.

I‚Äôm doing a combination of eliminating low-balance cards and going after high-interest ones.  And getting her checking balance higher, in case of a problem with her house or her rental.  And I‚Äôve gotten her to curtail her reckless spending.  Her not being able to drive anymore has ‚Äúhelped‚Äù with that.

In just a few months, I‚Äôve gotten three of her cards paid off and cut the big, high-interest card to a third of what it was--A THIRD!!--mostly from the interest-free loan from me and my brother.  She‚Äôs already saving over $200/month in interest payments.  I called three card companies (again) seeking to lower the interest rates.  One went down 1.2% to 15.74%, another went down 1.75% to 16.74%--but that‚Äôs the second reduction, it was 22.49% in January (so that‚Äôs almost 6% reduction!!).

I have to make her bill-paying as simplified as possible (and I‚Äôm simplifying it more), and she still messes up.  ‚ÄúMom, you have to pay off this month‚Äôs charges in full.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù  Then she doesn‚Äôt.  So I go online and pay the rest from her account, to stay on schedule.  That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm going to handle it--if she messes up, I‚Äôll keep it on track.  I inform her of everything and keep my siblings informed--especially my sister, who says I‚Äôm ‚Äúkeeping secrets‚Äù but she‚Äôs a fool.  My brother‚Äôs better with money and understands I‚Äôm doing a good job.  My sister declared bankruptcy twice because she spends like an idiot when she knows better.

I‚Äôm figuring Mom can have this paid off in (best case) 1 year to (worst case) 2 years.  Best case is if she remains careful with spending, no costly emergencies, and if she gets a end-of-the-year distribution from her IRA.  It takes A LOT of time and effort to do this, a lot of monitoring, a lot of phone calls (she won‚Äôt call ANY creditor unless I‚Äôm conferencing it), but it‚Äôs worth it to help her get out of debt.

After these debts, she has a timeshare (!!!  I know!!!) to pay off, since she doesn‚Äôt want to sell.  I can‚Äôt override her on everything.  By then, it‚Äôll be another 5-6 months and be done.  Then me and my brother.",finance

personalfinance,Taking out extra amount in a mortgage to cover student loan debt,"So I have multiple student loans worth about $14,000, all with interest rates of 6.5-8.5% (Screw you 2008 recession). My parents sold their house and are looking to buy a new house and potentially take out a mortgage or other small loan to help pay for it. My question is, since my parents credit is outstanding they can expect a rate of 4% or maybe lower. Can  they take out an extra $14,000, pay off my student loans completely, and then have me pay them based off the 4%. It would save me hundreds a year. Is this legal? Would they be able to request the extra money from the bank? Would it hurt them in away way or bring extra costs to them/me other than the 4% on the $14,000?

personalfinance,Refinance? Tackle? Questions from a soon-to-be graduate.,"I'm graduating next month and I decided to start a spreadsheet up for the two loans I have. I do not officially have a job yet, but I am predicting to get an offer for $40k.

- Loan 1 is a Federal Perkins loan for $6,000 at 5%
- Loan 2 is a private loan from a Credit Union for $60,306.16 at 9.5%

Reading through some posts on here, I take it 9.5% is pretty high. I got this loan based on a recommendation of a family member and my parents were on board when I signed, so at that time, I did not know how much interest was high. I'm not even sure where else I would've begun looking for a better rate, I just knew to stay away from Sallie May. I've also read that if you refinance you lose government protections(on government loans). So, is the smart thing to do is refinance the CU loan? If so, would I go back to them and say I wanna refinance?

I will not be living in a huge city so my CoL shouldn't be too expensive. I also own my car and do not have a car payment. Around what should my payments be for my current CU loan? Since I have not graduated yet, a minimal payment has not show in my statements.

personalfinance,Looking for some guidance on the most effective way to pay down my consolidated student loan.,"Hello! I consolidated 3 private student loans last November into one with GSMR for 5.39% interest starting at a principal ~68000. The minimum payment (rounded to the nearest ten) is 560. Using autodebit of 560 dollars on the 18th of each month brings my interest rate to 5.14%. 

The loan was signed as a 15 year term, but i have no plans on paying loans for 15 years. I am looking more at 5-7 years. I have been paying 400 dollars ( 200 from each biweekly paycheck) extra on top of the 560. 
See [Payment History](https://gyazo.com/dc23731776a27e4ec37af33b0b7af77a)

My question to you helpful people is: 
Would it be more beneficial for me to pay this 400 extra the day after the autodebit is credited (to avoid as much accrued interest as possible) or to continue applying 200 dollars on every paycheck to pay off a large amount of accrued interest and a bit of principal so that my minimum payment largely goes towards principal? 

The goal of this would be to pay the minimum amount of interest over the life of the loan. In a few months, once my emergency fund of 6000 dollars is complete i will have 200 dollars per month more to allocate towards the loan as well. 

Long term goal is to eventually refinance again with either Earnest or SOFI without a cosigner at a better rate, but I dont foresee that being possible until a few years down the road.

Ripple,"As cross-border market heats up, Ripple builds a bigger rail","Source: https://www.paymentssource.com/news/as-cross-border-market-heats-up-ripple-builds-a-bigger-rail

Ripple's distributed ledger platform has fed an appetite for cheaper and more efficient cross-border payments, but it may not measure up to the needs of a larger market.

Ripple wants to scale its payment system to something resembling a large card network such as Visa or American Express to accommodate a greater number of participants with more frequent and varied transactions.

Ripple's traditional system isn't designed to handle the thousands of smaller sales processed on behalf of e-commerce sellers working on behalf of small businesses. As a result, Ripple has partnered with banks to enable near real-time processing for international remittance and small business payments.

Chart: What banks want from blockchain
""Traditional money services providers are seeing these small businesses grow quickly and are saying 'why can't I do that,'"" said Miguel Vias, head of XRP markets for Ripple. ""As the world evolves we will get more transactions that are much smaller.""

The company's next step is to add features designed to improve its Ripple Consensus Ledger, or the distributed ledger that settles global transactions and supports Ripple's XRP currency. It's also bolstering the Interledger Protocol that Ripple uses to communicate between distributed ledgers.

""Speed has been an issue with blockchain and bitcoin since its inception,"" said Thad Peterson, a senior analyst with Aite Group. ""While security is incredibly strong with blockchain, the process of moving transactions back and forth has been cumbersome and slow.""

Moving to throughput rates that are similar to the networks is a ""major"" breakthrough in blockchain delivery, Peterson said. ""If blockchain is to be a viable alternative payment channel, throughput needs to be at network speeds, or it won't be adopted.""

One of Ripple's new features, called Escrow, enables funds to be held for a certain amount of time or until certain conditions are met, such as a specific date or a completed task. Escrow manages these conditions without using a bank vault, enabling Ripple to apply its model of ""removing middle parties"" from cross-border transactions for more complicated payment terms.

""It allows for a 'locking' of funds,"" Vias said. ""If I send a payment with delivery date, that value is locked for the term. Nobody can touch it. That's a [new flexibility] for distributed ledgers.""

The second feature, Payment Channel, is a more direct volume play. Ripple has built a distinct channel for XRP, which allows ""throughput"" for thousands of transactions per second, or a throughput volume similar to a major card network.

To address the financial services portion of the cross-border payments market, Ripple recently linked XRP to virtual currency processor BitGo, which processes more than $1 billion in digital currency payments tech month, to boost security, treasury management and other support.

The company is also bolstering its leadership, hiring Marjan Delatinne as its European sales director. Delatinne was formerly in charge of customer engagement for Swift's global payments innovation initiative, which positions her to help Ripple's efforts to add bank clients.",cryptocurrency

I am currently working my first job out of college and am trying to decide if I should focus solely on my tackling my loans first, or simultaneously put some money into retirement.

Long Story: I filed for a complete report from LexisNexis and amongst other errors, they have listed three judgments that are not mine.

I filed for a bunch of corrections and received and updated copy of my report. Some items were fixed however the judgments were still on there.

I called again this time focusing on the lawsuits. Another case opened and a month or so later I received an update. The county court where the judgments were filed verified they were ""real"". LexisNexis wrote that if I wanted to dispute the judgments, I'd have to call the county court office. 

So, these judgement may or may not be real, that's none of my business. What is my business is that they're not mine. They have the same name on them, but the address associated with them isn't mine. There's another person in the same town with the same name but we're completely different people. 

What do I do next? 

* NOTE: Every time I've applied for a loan in person, I've been asked about past judgments and I could never figure out what they were talking about. Sometimes they'd ask if I've ever had identity theft or if I had a family member with the same name. I've always said I didn't have any judgments and the loans always went through. My credit score is in the 'excellent' range via the three major reporting agencies. However now I'm wondering if this negative mark against me is somehow costing me money via higher interest rates.

solar,Low voltage on boat 12v setup,"Hi all,  I'm having issues with charging a 12v battery on a smallish sailboat.  There is one 50w panel that is partially shaded when the sun is highest.  It is not practical to move the panel. There is a pwm controller. 

The issue is that the battery never seems to get higher than about 12.5v charge, even after sitting for several sunny days with no load. I am rarely able to visit at the hottest time of day, but I have done so around 3:30-4pm, and the panel is outputting about 12.5v at that time. I think it's likely that the battery never gets above 12.5v because that's the highest voltage it's ever fed.

I have some options here, but the main question I have is: will upgrading to an MPPT controller help? In other words,  do MPPT controllers step up the voltage coming from the panel if it's too low for the current stage of the charge cycle?

Another cheap option would be to mount an extra, smaller panel (say 10 or 20w) somewhere that can get full sun. I've heard that it's bad to have more than one panel per controller - is it a serious issue?

I have two children, 1 and 4.  No savings to date for them.  Both have 18 months of VA benefits from my GI Bill.  Both will be eligible for 75 hours of college each from the Hazelwood Act, which may or may not be available by the time they go to college.  It is an unfunded (comes from other kids' tuition currently,) veteran's benefit that has seen little Fed support.  From my understanding, it basically is upheld by the schools who participate (most Texas state schools,) and there's no guarantee it will continue.


I will finish my BS in the next year, all funded by Tuition Assistance.  No need for an MS, but plan to get one in the distant future as I'm a ""learner at heart.""


My wife also wants to pursue another BA and an MLS degree (Librarian) to be completed in the next 5-8 years.  She currently has an AAS, which doesn't help much and isn't in a field she wants to pursue any longer.  We expect to cash-flow a lot of this, but probably will end up with some student loans (Expecting a total cost of around $30-35K)


**What I'm looking to do**


I am looking for the best option to contribute about $500/mo to an account.  As I understand it, the 529 is linked to an individual, so my wife would not be able to draw on it if it's listed for my kids.


My kids definitely have about 50% of their education expenses handled, but may or may not have the other 50%.  I want to ensure they do.  If I started today, $500/mo should be adequate split amongst the two of them in separate accounts. (Vanguard calculator, 6% return, 5% rise in education costs, figured based upon current University of Texas at Austin tuition, room, board, etc., costs. 265/mo for the 4 y/o, 225/mo for the 1/yo.)


**Current and future money**


I should have a pension, starting around 52, which should account for about $70K/year in today's money (non-military, state-level pension) and plan to continue to work afterwards. I also contribute to TSP and will continue to contribute to a state-sponsored 401k after I leave service.  I have a very small IRA that I tend to throw extra money into, but plan to max in the near future and continue to max.  My wife is a home-maker for the time being, but wants to be a Librarian when she finishes school, and may or may not have state-level pension, but will definitely contribute to a 401k and/or other investment vehicles.  We do not *need* her income, so anything she makes is a nice bonus and extra savings.  Any loans would likely be paid off within the first year of her finding paid employment.


Currently in the military and moving every 3 years, no plan to buy a house in the near future (probably 10-ish years from now.)  This, and establishing a full 6-mo E-fund are our main priorities at the moment.  College funding is taking a slight advantage due to the nature of my income, although we anticipate having a full 6-mo this summer (getting a small bonus which will assist.)


Otherwise following and tracking well with ""the flowchart.""

personalfinance,Paying off debt before investing?,"Been pretty curious about this lately, and wanted to get some advice.

I'm 28 years old, make about $130,000 a year at a stable job. I have been contributing 15% to an ESPP (employee stock purchase plan), 12% to my 401K and 6% to an IRA on every paycheck. 

On top of that, I am also paying close to $500/month on a student loan balance of about $45,000. My debts include:
- $10,000 in CC debt
- $45,000 in student loan debt

Most recently, last year or so, I've been playing the stock market. I have also been investing in digital currency for almost 5 years now. 

As of right now I have liquid investments of:
- $10,000 from BTC/ETH
- $10,000 in Robinhood
- $16,000 in RSUs
- $5,000 Cash and Savings

I guess the question is twofold.

1. Should I stop contributing to 401K/IRA/ESPP as well as investing in stocks and digital currency until I pay off my CC and Student Loan debt?
2. If my percent yield on my liquid investments is higher than the interest rate on my debts, should I just continue doing what i'm doing?

Bonus question: should I just liquidate all my assets, pay off as much debt as I can and start from scratch? I have 31K in liquidiy vs. 55K in debt. 

Also, 2 loans are federal 1 is private. Would love to consolidate but cant seem to find the best plan of attack.

On top of that, I receive 550‚Ç¨ of my own money, which is spent on food and activities. To total the money up, I get right around 1000‚Ç¨ monthly from this currently.
My expenses are:

* Rent + Food 700‚Ç¨/mo
* Bus card 50‚Ç¨/mo
* Other ~100‚Ç¨/mo

So I manage to save some money from the 1000‚Ç¨ monthly.

Currently I owe the bank around 1200‚Ç¨ with an interest of 2% - I currently pay them back only the interest, which is around 2,50‚Ç¨/mo (I get the interest back due to the military service).

I have recently been unemployed due to the company doing some reformatting, and am being compensated ~8000‚Ç¨ after taxes at the end of this month. I have savings of 2000‚Ç¨ of my own and a credit card for 1500‚Ç¨, which I use frequently but pay back immediately so there is no interest rate.

I'm applying for school and if I manage to get in, will be starting it at the end of this year (after military) and need some money stashed to pay for my bills etc if I can't manage to get a part-time job right after my service ends in november.

What would be the wisest thing to do with the money I am receiving?

I absolutely think we need to increase the block size for continued growth but my current issues are:

SegWit - Seems to me like just a band-aid on the problem. A one off solution to give us a bit of wiggle room for a few more transactions until we're back to the same blocksize issue in the future.

Bitcoin Unlimited - Is actually damn close to what I thought we'd be trying for. Progressive growth based on demand. But then they throw the ""Articles of Federation"" in the mix. Which to quote them at &gt; https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/articles

&gt; Article 2: Confederation

&gt; All Bitcoin Unlimited (henceforth BU) activities shall be recorded and be publicly accessible.
BU roles shall consist of:

&gt; **President:** a publicly identified (real-life identity is known) BU Member who is responsible for the ongoing activities of the confederation. The president shall resolve BUIP number conflicts, organize BUIP discussion (in the forum designated by the secretary), and schedule/initiate voting (within the limits specified in these articles).

&gt; **Secretary:** a publicly identified BU Member who is responsible for recording activities and vote results, and making this information publicly available. The Secretary is responsible for creating, maintaining and moderating a public forum where discussion can be held. Moderation is exclusively limited to moving content with an indication of it being moved - no content may be deleted. The secretary shall tally and report on votes.

&gt; **Developer:** a publicly identified BU Member who is responsible for maintaining the BU code repository, choosing which committers have access to the software repository, reviewing and merging patches, and periodically releasing BU software. The Developer is an outreach position - s/he must actively work to encourage others to work on submissions, and to convert one-time submitters into regular committers.

&gt; **Pool Operator:** a publicly identified BU member who is responsible for running the BU Mining pool as specified in Article 4. The position of pool operator might be vacant and pool operation is optional, as resources permit.

&gt; **Member:** an individual who is invited (by BUIP) to join the Confederation, signs this document, and has joined or voted within the last 1 year. Non-publicly identified members may have restricted voting or other restrictions as determined by subsequent BUIPs - this measure may be needed to restrict duplicate accounts.

&gt; Officer term is for two years. For continuity, elections shall be staggered by 6 months and take place 1 week prior to responsibility transfer. Beginning with the President on Jan 15, 2018, then Secretary, Developer, and Pool **Operator.** This means that the initial officer term may exceed 2 years. Voting for all the initial officers shall occur on Jan 15, 2016.

Which for me makes me nervous, as not being an expert in the issue I can't tell if this really is a sneaky step towards centralization or if it's just a fair way of doing things?

They then told me that they charged overdraft fees because due to [Federal Regulation D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_D_(FRB)) they could treat my account as overdrawn because of the account limits.

I moved all of my money into checking, but they're not budging on the fees. I'm not in a position where $300 is insignificant to me right now.

personalfinance,Trying to help roommate deal with about $14k of credit card debt and need advice on options,"So my roommate was never really taught how to handle money and has managed to work herself into a credit card debt hole. I didn't realize how bad it was until she lost her job recently and came to me for advice/help because she couldn't make her monthly payments (I do most of the finances in our household, help her with her taxes, etc). The short story is this: she racked up a lot of CC debit, then got a loan from Wells Fargo a few years ago to consolidate it, but continued to use her credit cards and now has a lot more CC debt in addition to the loan.

Thankfully she found a new job so she's not on the verge of bankruptcy anymore, but we had a serious talk about her debt last night. She knows she made a lot of bad spending decisions, but is now committed to paying her debt down aggressively. I got her set up on YNAB so she can start tracking her spending and budgeting her money (something she's never done before), so we can get a concrete idea of exactly how much she can afford to put towards her debt every month.

However, in going over her finances with her, I'm seeing that all her interest rates are pretty high and I'm wondering if she can consolidate again and maybe get a better rate. Or if she should try to open a new card with an intro 0% APR and transfer over everything she knows she can pay off during the intro period (Her credit score is 710, so I think she probably could get approved for another CC, but I'm not sure if yet another card a good idea.) Or if there's another option I'm not thinking of? Basically I'd like to help her out in not paying thousands of extra dollars in interest if she doesn't have to.

I'm pretty savvy with my own finances, but I've never had credit card debt, so I'm hoping for a little advice in how to guide her.

Here's a rough breakdown of her debt:

* Installment Loan: $6k at 13.50%

* Credit Card 1: $1.2k at 17.47%

* Credit Card 2: $1.3k at 19.80%

investing,/u/TheRealAntacular Shorts Treasuries; Enters World of Pain,"I‚Äôm turning to /r/investing for some serious help, because I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

As I‚Äôve said elsewhere, the markets rose not just because of DJT, but because of the alleviation of gridlock at the Federal level. I was certain we‚Äôd see a tsunami of pro-growth legislation coming out of Congress: Tax cuts, infrastructure spending, healthcare reform. All certainties that would increase growth, and thus inflation. I thought (and still do) that the 10 year could EASILY reach 3%, maybe even 4  if the entrepreneurial zeitgeist could truly take hold in this beloved country of ours. 30 year seemed destined for 6%.

I didn‚Äôt necessarily want to play the market beyond broad sectors (i.e. financials), determined the next surest bet was to short Treasuries: given how efficient the sovereign bond market is, the drop in prices post-DJT would appear to indicate that the market itself was also expecting higher growth. It seemed like a no-brainer, and as I always say, no one is smarter than the bond market. On top of this, given the recently Hawkish Fed with all those hikes planned this year, I originally thought they‚Äôd hike in February, giving us 4 for the entire year. 

At first the trade went great: I shorted the 10 year between 2.40 and 2.45, and within a few weeks, had already climbed to 2.6%, despite no hike in February. Didn‚Äôt turn out to be a big deal since Janet decided to fool EVERYBODY with the fake-out and went for March instead. Whatever. No big deal. Yet the day of the raise, the yield curve actually shifted downward because suddenly Janet decides to become a Dove again. Such bullshit. I bit the bullet because even if monpol was shitting the bed, I knew my wager on fispol (on account of alleviation of gridlock as mentioned above, trying to get the most bang for my buck on that PoliSci degree!) would pull through. But then something I just couldn‚Äôt believe happened: Healthcare reform BOMBED. DJT hijacked Paul Ryan‚Äôs meticulously planned piece of legislation, and arguably the greatest policy mind to ever be elected into Congress suffered a humiliating defeat. Yields dropped lower on all this, so I did the only reasonable trade: I doubled down.

Fast forward to today, with the 10 year now approaching 2.15. I‚Äôve lost so much already (God knows I‚Äôll eat those 20% losses all day, e‚Äôryday), that I think I should just hold and be patient and wait for my thesis to play out. At the same time, given how much I concentrated into the trade, I‚Äôm losing confidence in my abilities altogether to navigate this market. I‚Äôm almost scared for what happens next with these prices. I‚Äôm torn between doubling down and just holding, because I KNOW with the GOP controlling all branches of govt for at least 4 years (we‚Äôll win 2018), these pro-growth policies WILL eventually pass.

I went to the bank today to drop off some checks and cash in my account, and the teller noted that I might be interested in an Unsecured Line of Credit (The Premier Line through US Bank). 

He said it would combine the 2 cards I have now, and the Reserve Line that was opened as a sort of extra line of money for Overdraft protection (I wish I could shoot younger me in the face now). 

One card is around $4000 with a 17.99% APR, the other is around $1500 with 24.74%, and the Reserve Line is $800 with a 21.90% APR.

So, what I'm curious about is why the bank would be interested in offering to consolidate all of these lines into a single one at 10-14% interest (assuming his estimates are correct) and have me pay 14% interest on $6300 instead of having me take longer to pay across multiple cards with higher interest rates...

I guess this just seems like something that's too good to be true, in terms of saving me money long term.

I hate to assume my bank is out to bone me, or that the teller who seemed like a nice guy might be pushing a line of credit because his job demands it of him, but I'm always a little reluctant on things that promise to save you money when they could be making more from you.

He just got a new job with an 8k salary increase, and he can now walk or take public transit, so we would like to only have one car.  Here is our current situation:  
2 Cars: One - 2014, 46k Miles, worth $17k, loan $16k (1.9% interest)   
           Two - 2011, 96k Miles, worth $6k, loan **$8.5k** (6% Interest)  
Parking: $75/mo for Car 1, $125/mo for Car 2  
Insurance: $70/mo for Car 1, $75/mo for Car 2  
  
We are looking into our options, but Car 1 is impractical to keep as our only car because of its size (really small), whereas Car 2 is nearing the time when it will start having larger problems (it's a Hyundai Elantra) and we'd like to avoid having to make costly repairs.  
  
Is it better to roll $2-3k into a new loan at a lower interest rate if we trade both in?  Or is it better to keep both cars until we are out from under the loan, despite the fact that we would only ever need one car between the two of us.   
  
We'd sell Car1 and just live with Car2 for a while, but it's hard to do a private sale for a car where you don't own the title.  I was thinking of doing a 60 day 401(k) loan, but that also is a gamble if for some reason we can't sell it immediately.  What should we do?",finance
personalfinance,"Bought a house and a new car, changed careers and buried myself and my girlfriend in debt.","As the title says, me and my girlfriend bought our first house this past year and along with it a new car. I finally decided to go into real estate after years of thinking about it and ended up selling one house in the past 9 months for a total commission of $2725.50 after taxes. My girlfriend makes $39,000 annually or bi-weekly pay of roughly $1000.00. I've recently started taxiing 5-6 nights a week to come up with an extra $1200-1300 bi-weekly. We also rent out the main floor apartment of our home for $1100 a month and our tenants pay for their own utilities.

I'm looking for advice on how to reduce my debt as quickly as possible. Below, I've listed our debts and their interest rates.

1. Credit card #1 $16,138.14 at 19.99%
2. Credit card #2 $12,500.00 at 19.99%
3. Credit card #3 $  1,500.00 at 12.50%
4. Line of credit   $  5,869.98 at   4.00%
5. Property tax.   $   1,700.00 at &gt;1.00%
6. Parents.           $   3200.00 no interest
7 friends.             $      260.00 no interest

I know I don't owe any interest on money owed to friends, but I'm paying back my friends first since a. It was never meant to be a long term loan and b. I hate owing money to my friends. My parents are doing well financially and I can pay the $3200 last.

Our monthly income works out to be $5650.00 and our monthly expenses equal $4550.00 most months. I'll be earning lump sum commissions from real estate once in a while, most likely in the $2500-4000 range, but I can't guarantee how often or how many I'll earn this year. Our expenses include our mortgage payment, car payment, insurance, our credit card minimum payments, our phone and internet bills, heat and light, groceries, gas, monthly dues to my real estate company and $200 fun money. 

Essentially what we're doing now is using the snow ball method and reducing our smallest debts first and whatever commission I earn in the future will be put on credit card #1 until it's down to $0. Is this what we should be doing? Would it make sense for us to consolidate our debt? Any advice would help!",finance
technology,"In response to the internet privacy bill, this was the response I got","Dear (DayOfReckoning47),

Thank you for contacting me regarding the recent congressional disapproval of a rule promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) relating to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). I value your point of view and appreciate the opportunity to respond.¬†

As you may know, in the final months of President Obama's administration the FCC adopted, on a party-line vote, rules that required ISPs to gain opt-in consent for the collection of certain user data. The FCC rule would have only applied to ISPs and not to companies like Google and Facebook. After reconsideration by the FCC, the rule was postponed and never implemented. In March, the Senate and House used their authority under the Congressional Review Act to disapprove of the rule.

The disapproval of the FCC rule does not leave consumers' privacy unprotected. As the rule never took effect, there is no change in current practices and consumers' privacy is still protected under Section 222 of the Communications Act and other federal and state laws. Likewise, it is important to note that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) maintains authority over most of the internet ecosystem, including over search engines, websites, manufacturers and applications, and previously had authority over ISPs before 2015. I believe the best way to protect consumers' privacy is to have a uniform set of rules that applies across the internet and does not pick winners and losers. I voted to disapprove of the FCC rule and allow Congress, the FCC and FTC to work together to protect consumers' privacy. I have personally spoken with both the FCC and FTC chairmen and will continue to work to ensure that they will uphold this principle.

Americans' privacy is one of my top priorities. Last Congress I championed a number of privacy-related bills, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act Amendments Act that requires search warrants to access email communications, the SAFE KIDS Act that prevents websites used primarily for preK-12 purposes from collecting or using student data, and a series of bills that would have nullified changes to Rule 41 that allowed the government unprecedented access to electronic media. Please know that I will continue fighting for consumers' privacy and will keep your thoughts in mind should any related legislation come before me in the Senate.

Again, thanks for contacting me. It is my number one priority in the Senate to represent the values and interests of the people of Montana, and your input is very helpful as I do. I invite you to visit my website,¬†www.daines.senate.gov, for updates about activities in Washington that affect our lives in Montana or to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.

Also, I have about $74,000 saved in the bank. My wife and I make about 185k combined - her 75k and me 110k. We are living at home with parents for the next few months until we find a new place near the practice I associate at. I have been paying anywhere from 3000-4000 a month towards my loans (25 year extended plan). We have no rent, no car payment, no CC debt, and wife has no student loans debt. Since I have only 9 months of work history other banks like SoFi won't let me re-fi with them.

Should I...
1) Pay off a big chunk of my high interest loans (40-50k) since I am living at home and ask DRB to re-fi a lower amount?
2) Have my wife as a co-signer?
3) Wait a few years and then try to re-fi and continue my current payment situation?
4) Not re-fi at all, do something else

personalfinance,"Wondering about my current status, and what I should do going forward","Hi PF, I'm turning 25 next month and I'm just now starting to get serious about my finances. I guess I'm curious about what you think of my current situation, and would also love advice for the future, especially about investing and home purchasing, which I am clueless about.


I have 50K in student loans, mixed federal and private at variable rate (30K @6.75% for private, 20K @4% for federal). I'm currently only paying the interest on them, about $300/mnth total.


I take home $3,600 each month. I pay $750 in rent. I save about $1,200 per month, for a SR of about 33%. Currently my savings are actually going to paying off a Line of Credit loan, which I needed to move across the country. It will be paid off next month, after which I need to decide what to do with that $1,200 per month.


I'm thinking first I'll start an emergency fund - I'll always have that LoC I can borrow from in the future, but it would be nice to not have to go into debt for emergencies. What is a reasonable amount? Maybe $5,000? Or maybe two months' rent, $7,200?



And then after that's done, I'd like to figure out how to invest, which seems necessary to have financial success. I know nothing about it. Is the basic idea to turn money into more money? How much should I have? What app/platform should I use? Is there a class on this anyone recommends?


Eventually I would like to buy a house but don't know when I should prioritize that. And then at some point I need to actually start paying my student loans. And then I need to start investing for retirement... And with MMM AMA today, I'm wondering if I could somehow retire early as well. Like maybe 40? I dunno how likely it is.


I guess the biggest thing I need now is a plan. I would love to hear everyone's advice on what I should prioritize and when, and with how much money. Maybe I should talk to some sort of money manager as well? Thanks for reading!",finance

personalfinance,"Considering a refinance; advice needed (US, NV)","(Originally posted in r/mortgages, where it received little attention.)

In August 2015 my wife and I bought a home in Las Vegas (NV) to retire to. I opted for a 30 year loan for the lower monthly rate. Numbers:

    Purchase price  $260,000
    Down payment      78,000 (30%)
    Interest rate          4.125%
    Monthly payment     $872
    Prop tax (month)     200
    Homeowners Assoc      80

I absolutely hate debt. I can afford to put more into the monthly payment to pay it down faster.

Option one: refinance for a 15 year fixed. I went through some mortgage calculators. If I understand things correctly, I get a lower interest rate (about 3.500% currently) but I have to pay refinance fees of $3000-6000. I come up with a monthly payment of $1287, about $400/mo more.

Option two: throw an extra $200/mo at the existing mortgage. I keep the higher interest rate, but there is no refinance charge. My lender has an online estimator that indicates I would pay off the mortgage 104 months (8 years 8 months) earlier.

$200/mo extra is a lot easier on the budget than $400/mo.

If it's relevant: my Credit Karma score is 800 +- 5. I can post details of income, assets, and other debts if necessary.

personalfinance,Pregnant wife discovered husband's credit card debt,"Some context: My husband started a business almost 2 years ago which coincided with the birth of our first child.  The business is going well but he gave himself a very limited salary and I was working part time mostly from home, as child care was too expensive in our area.  This resulted in some credit card debt.  I was aware of it as it happened (mostly necessities but some frivolities like a drink after work and a sandwich for lunch).  My very generous parents gave us some money to help us as we went through this first year. My understanding was that he used this money to pay off this debt and that by the fall of 2016 he had a zero balance on his card.  I asked him directly a few times about it and he assured me the balance was zero.  I discovered this week, 20 weeks pregnant with baby number 2, that he has only paid a trifle towards that card, not even keeping after interest, and it has ballooned to almost 5 grand.  
I confronted him about it and he admitted he had been hiding it and that it felt like this crushing weight that he couldn‚Äôt deal with.  (Full disclosure: there is some untreated severe depression at issue that is now being taken very seriously.)

I am much better with money than he so I am trying to get a game plan to get us back on track.  
I‚Äôve read through the wiki for this sub which has been really helpful and I have a pretty good idea of how to fix this issue, but I thought some other opinions with more nuanced input would be helpful.

The debt is approx. $5k.  We have $1500 in savings and expect a tax return of $2400.  I have a credit card with almost nothing on it that has a lower interest rate than his (17% v 14%).  

My initial plan was to systematically do a balance transfer to my credit card with the lower interest rate (my card has a lower credit limit, so I would have to do this in installments), and also put the entirety of our tax return towards his card.  He paid $500 to the debt today, so I believe we would have about $1800 left to pay off which I think we could reasonably do in 6 months or aggressively in 3. 

My main concern is, I will go on maternity leave in September. Right now, I am the primary bread winner, although, his income will be increasing over the next several months.  Should I put all of that tax return towards the debt and even our savings just to get rid of the debt, or keep some/all of the nest egg since we will be losing some of our income flow in less than six months?

I know that if we take longer to pay off this debt we‚Äôll only be spending more in the long run especially with our high interest rates, but I‚Äôm scared of putting all of that cash towards a debt and then not having anything to fall back on.  When I thought we were debt free, I was starting to be more aggressive about socking away savings (which is hard because we don‚Äôt have a lot of wiggle room), but now I‚Äôm wondering if I should put all this money to this debt and start from square one.

Finally, I know this isn‚Äôt r/relationships, and I‚Äôm not asking for relationship advice, but clearly, we have some issues regarding communicating about money.  I have started a Mint account that we can both look at, and we‚Äôve decided to set aside Sunday evenings to regularly check in on our spending/saving habits.  My husband is also heading to counseling.  Are there other resources that any one is aware of to help increase/improve partner communication about finance?",finance
personalfinance,need help with 2017 estimated tax payment,"Guys, I'm going crazy trying to figure this out.

So here's the deal....I was a contractor all of 2016.

My total taxes owed for the year (federal + FICA, no state income tax) was about $58,000.

However, this year, I am a contractor only for the first few months of the year and am now a full-time employee for the remainder of the year and going forward.

How do I figure out what my quarterly payment is supposed to be? When I become a payroll employee, my paychecks will automatically take out the right amount of taxes.

However, I still need to account for the contractor income in the first part of the year (and include the self-employment taxes, etc. owed for that).

Here's what I got for 2017 (estimated + what's already been paid as a contractor):

* Net profit for contractor business: $75,609
* W2 gross income: $106,250 (estimated based on semi-monthly paychecks starting at the end of April)

How do I work backwards to figure out how much of my taxes will have been paid correctly from the automatic paycheck withholding from the salary job vs. how much I would still owe because of the contractor income?

Ugh, really annoyed with my CPA. She should be helping me with this lol.

The only reason I'm trying to avoid just paying 110% of last year's income is because this year's income will definitely be less, so I'm trying to better estimate it.

personalfinance,"(20) Graduating in one year, with 25k in student loan + 65k salary. What kind of car should I purchase?","Will be graduating in one year with 65k salary. 

I will be needing a car. Since I have a fairly long commute (30km each way, over 1h trip during rush hour) and Ontario has a electric car rebate worth up to $14,000 on qualified cars (has to be new purchase or 3 year lease),so I am leaning towards an electric car. 

Will be living at home for at least 2-3 more years (probably more), so basically no expenses such as rent, utilities etc other than car, gas, food, student loan. I could pay off the loan in less than a year. 

I will have 25k in student loans at 3.5%, interest starts 6 months after graduation (April 2018). My question is, should I save up my income to pay off my student loans in a lump sum ASAP or continue with monthly payments since the interest rate is low? Do I purchase a car or lease one? What can I afford? 

My thoughts

* Ford Fusion: ~25k, with 7k rebate, coming out to 18k plus est. annual fuel cost of 1300 -&gt; 5200 in 4 years

* Tesla 3: Obviously a little bit of a stretch here, but with the 45k cost (35k USD -&gt; CAD), plus rebate, the cost of the car would be 32k, not to mention savings on gas, maitenance fees and more. Probable delivery date would be 2019,2020, which up until then I could share parents car/carpool/bus/FIO and save up in the meanwhile. 

Why? 

* Given the ridiculous housing prices in Toronto, I will probably live in the greater toronto area (GTA) even when I do move out, so I do not think the commute will shorten. 

* Buying a used electric car was an option, but given the maitenance costs + no rebate from ontario gov, the long term cost was very similar to buying a new electric car with the rebate. 

* Yes i understand I could buy a normal used car for less than 10k, however taking into acount fuel costs + maitenance (canadian here, our gas prices are almost double US) the long term cost exceeds a electric car. 

I don‚Äôt mind spending more money for a quality fuel efficient car, given that I am going to be driving more than 2h/day, on the highway. After my student loans, I don't see any barriers in my way.

crypto,The D:; Cipher,"I think this belongs here cause unless I missed something, it would take nine hundred and thirty times the current age of the universe to break the encryption (Worst case scenario, on average, half of that) if you could try a new key 1 million times a second, and it allows a secret message to be sent between two parties, I'd love to see someone break the encryption method though, cause it'd be a great learning experience, anyway enough rambling out of me.

-

This is a simple cipher that I came up with and am personally quite proud of.
It looks something like this:

A|9;D:1;0:5:B:

Method of en/decryption:

Lay out the alphabet from A to Z in a row.
\#: increments your position in the alphabet by # and appends that letter.
\#; decrements your position in the alphabet by # and appends that letter.
Wrapping around is allowed.

-Keyless:

For keyless encryption you put your starting letter I.E. ""A"" in the example, directly preceding a pipe(""|"") and then you write out each letter in encoded form I.E. ""A;"" from A| is Q.

-Pre-shared Key:
For en/decryption using a pre-shared key it's a little more complicated.
The keys look something like 

""-AZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA""

and are in the format

""&lt;Starting Index&gt;&lt;Alphabet&gt;""

Where &lt;Starting Index&gt; is an explicitly signed hex value denoting the index within &lt;Alphabet&gt; to begin your message from, and &lt;Alphabet&gt; is the alphabet to use when decoding and encoding the messages.

To encode using  a PSK:
Write out the &lt;Alphabet&gt; from your PSK:

ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA

Put your pointer at &lt;Starting Index&gt;, in this case it's at -A, 10 from the right, so it's K.

ZYXWVUTSRQPONML_K_JIHGFEDCBA

Find the the relative index of the first letter of the message we want to encode, let's say ""reddit"", so ""R"", which is 7 left of K in our alphabet, so the first part of our encoded message is ""7;"", and we move our pointer to R now.

ZYXWVUTS_R_QPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA

We repeat for the remaining letters and get

7;D:1:0:5;B;

which looks rather similar to our non-keyed version, and for good reason, our inverted english alphabet is a very weak one and ends up identical to our standard alphabet (with inverted signs (I.E. ;&lt;-&gt;:)), except for the starting position.

To decode, just do this process in reverse.

I think that the PSK method is pretty strong, as the 26 character alphabet has 26! or (4.03291461126605635584x10^26) possible positions meaning to brute force a text would take (4.03291461126605635584x10^20) seconds if you could test 1 million alphabets per second, and that equates to about 12.79 trillion years or 930 times the estimated age of the universe.

So I ask you wise people of reddit to give it a crack and try to find cryptographically problems with this cipher, and to point them out in the comments.

Thanks, Q‚àÜE.",cryptocurrency

We are on a strict budget and manage to pay everything on time but I want to pay it down faster. Is it a good idea to pay it out at once in one fell swoop with the loan, or should I dish out a portion of it and keep 30% on the credit cards to help boost my credit? I'm not sure if it matters at this point. Advice?",finance
financialindependence,Non Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for FIRE Goals?,"Recently I've learned about non qualified deferred compensation plans. These plans allow you to defer up to X% of your income. ( limits are up to the company but most choose at least 50%) Then, depending on the plan, payments can be made in a lump sum or installments after X number of years or when you quit depending on the plan. The benefits are that it's like a 401k plan - you reduce your federal and state tax (still paying fica/medicare.) For high income earners it could help out a lot to avoid phase outs on deductions and AMT and put you in a lower tax bracket. If the deferral is at least 10 years then if you move to a state with no income tax then you don't have to pay any to the source state on the deferral. There is investment options similar to a 401k plan but no self directed brokerages are allowed - just mutual funds. And of course it grows tax deferred too.

The hugest drawback is that deferred compensation plans have a risk of forfeiture. They're legally the company's assets until you are paid so they are subject to bankruptcy. You'd be a unsecured creditor and pretty far down the list in order.

For people interested in FIRE it seems really interesting. Unlike a 401k there is no early withdrawal penalty. At age 30 I could put half my salary in the plans to not be withdrawn for 15 years, significantly reduce my taxable income, have it be invested, then FIRE at age 45. I'd have an income stream from that until age 60 with a lot of it filling up lower tax brackets.

The biggest issue I'm running into is finding employers open to the idea. Typically these plans are for executives. I'm a software engineer and my current fair market compensation level for the Bay Area is 200k-300k base + 100k yearly rsus. Talking to recruiters they are either  clueless or get turned off that ""I'm asking for executive benefits."" I'd sure would love to shelter 150k a year pre-tax away in California. The Fed tax savings are huge - 49k fed taxes at 33% - 32k total taxes = 17k tax savings.  Moving to a no state tax state will save another  9% for 13k more savings for a total of 30k savings a year. That's almost half a million dollars in tax savings alone. Does anyone have any experience negotiating for a non qualified deferred compensation plan?

What's your thoughts on such a plan for FIRE? Do any of you have first hand experience on such plans?",finance

personalfinance,Single parent here- What's my best financial move in the property game?,"Hey Reddit

I'm 27f single and co parent a lovely 3 year old. I'm lucky enough to have a white colour job which gets us by, plus a bit on the side for rainy days. Here's a cinch- I've been renting the past 6 months in a pretty tiny apartment due to a relationship split and I really want to buy a property and lay down my roots again to provide some stability for me and my kid. Hopefully after a few years I'll add another property to my portfolio and go from there. 

I have around a years worth of take home income in a retirement savings scheme, and 3 times that much in savings from the sale of my marital home.

I have no debt  apart from a student loan which is interest free. A compulsory 15% of my after tax income goes straight there. With these payments  alone, I will be debt free in 5 years.

My credit cards are paid each month, a have a small number of stocks (that aren't performing), and I own my car outright.

Option 1.
I can use my savings to almost entirely buy a studio apartment within a Hotel Pool in my hometown for investment purposes. I wouldn't live there, it's too tiny, but right next to the university and in the heart of CBD. Rent coming in on top would cover body corporate and I'll have the cream on top to save again. If I buy this apartment, I can only use 50% equity to purchase again based on its size and banking criteria. I also would not be able to get insurance on the property based on a large earthquake that has recently struck the area. I expect this insurance freeze to last several months to a couple of years.

Option 2.
I pull my retirement fund to give me enough of a deposit that I can hopefully afford to purchase a 2 bedroom townhouse in an up and coming area in my city. Things would be very very tight, especially with SL, but house prices are on the rise and I worry if I don't purchase a house soon I will miss out.

Option 3
A variation of 2, only I use the retirement savings to pay my student loan,  leaving me with a bigger loan,  but more cash flow?  

What is my best financial move here?

I am single, 26, and living alone and renting an apartment. Rent is about 920/month and includes utilities (except internet and water). My other expenses are as follows, leaving me with around 2K per month

My current position offers a 403b plan with X+2% match, with a maximum of 5% but I could always add more to it. I am trying to figure out how best to invest into the plan, knowing that I have ridiculous loans that I have to pay off, but I also want to enjoy life a bit. The company that offers the plan offers a traditional method where you select your funds, or it has a different program where it, on a quarterly basis, does a market analysis to determine where best to allocate funds. This programs seems like a hands-off approach, but it seems too good to be true. The adviser mentioned that there is a 0.006% rate that they charge, but that this % disappears once you reach 100K in the account.
  
So I am wondering what your guys‚Äô opinion is, and how much you think I should be putting in each. I'm also thinking of creating one or two separate saving accounts, emergency vs all other savings (CE, certificates, maybe a house, etc). 

Also, any general advice would be greatly appreciated because honestly I know very little about all this stuff.

personalfinance,"In a good position, but lacking ""extra"" motivation","I'm not sure if this is the right place, but I hope so.

Over the last few years, my wife and I (both 29 years old) have worked hard on getting our finances in order, including improving our budgeting and paying off various debts ranging from $200 to $8000.

We now have reasonable monthly bills, do not carry credit card balances, and are down to 2 debts: 

Our car: $19000 remaining at 1.9%. Not too bad I think, we bought a new 2016 Dodge Grand Caravan, base model, pretty practical vehicle. I am not too worried about paying this off extra fast.

Our house: $156,000 remaining at 3.5%, 28 years to go.

We have worked hard to pay off debts, are contributing to our employers' retirement plans, and now want to start working on paying off our house. We plan on living here forever as long the neighborhood stays nice (has been nice for 50+ years according to neighbors). I know that with our fairly low interest rate, we could likely do better investing, but having the security of owning our home is very important to us (we both moved around a lot as children due to parents losing houses multiple times).

My issue is, during these past few years, I was super intense (""gazelle mode"" as Dave Ramsey would put it), and always finding a way to scrape up an extra $50 or $100 to throw towards a debt.

Now we have the house to work on, and it's a much more daunting task than the smaller other debts we took care of. I used to sell stuff on Craigslist, go to the junkyard and pull parts to sell on Ebay, ect.

Now, I feel like I would rather spend a Sunday playing with my 2 year old son in the backyard or taking a family drive to the beach. I think it's great that we are able to do these things, and I don't have to do all these extra money-making things just to scrape by.

We still have between $900-$1200 per month to save/ pay down mortgage. The amount depends on my commission from work, paid each month.

I guess I feel like I've lost my ""edge"" and intensity, and I'm wondering if anyone else has gone through this, and how to get back to being super focused while also balancing family time.

investing,Berkshire Hathaway is Undervalued,"**INTRODUCTION**

Berkshire Hathaway is a conservatively-run, well-capitalized business, managed by one of the greatest CEOs of all time. It uses minimal leverage, operates across many recession-resilient industries, and has grown earnings 20% per year since 1999. Businesses like this rarely trade for less than 20x earnings. Berkshire Hathaway trades for 7x.

While the company is best known for being a collection of ‚ÄúWarren Buffett‚Äôs stock picks‚Äù, it now derives a significant‚Äîand growing‚Äîportion of its value from another source: earnings from the company‚Äôs wholly-owned subsidiaries. We argue that this latter group‚Äîwhose earnings exceed those of Amazon, Google, Netflix, Tesla, Twitter, and Uber; combined‚Äîis being under-appreciated by the market.

**BUSINESS HISTORY**

In 1964, Warren Buffett took control of a struggling New England textile manufacturer, named Berkshire Hathaway. Its net worth was $22m at the time. Fifty years and $411b later, Berkshire Hathaway is now the fourth largest company in the US, with a reach so wide it makes money nearly every time:

* a plane is flown
* a car is sold
* a house is built 
* goods are transported to/from the West Coast
* an iPhone is purchased
* a lightbulb goes on in Nevada
* someone drinks a Coke
* a french fry is dipped in ketchup
* [and the guy at DQ does this](http://shenzhenphotos.com/images/20101213144523_upside%20down%20blizzard.jpg)

So how did Buffett grow a modest textile company into a sprawling conglomerate‚Äîone that now owns dozens of operating companies and a stock portfolio worth $150b?  

In the decades after taking control of Berkshire, Buffett steered the company through three major‚Äîand lucrative‚Äîshifts. He began in the late 1960s by acquiring insurance companies. Then he started using the insurance premiums generated by their operations to buy shares of publicly traded companies. Finally, in the 1990s, he began buying large businesses outright. 

**Phase I**: Buying Insurance Companies to Generate Float

The first step took place in 1967, when Berkshire purchased a small Nebraskan insurance company called National Indemnity for $8.6m. Buffett was drawn to characteristics unique to the insurance business: cash‚Äîin the form of premiums‚Äîis collected years before claims are paid out. In the meantime, the insurance company is free to invest it. This money is commonly referred to as ‚Äúfloat‚Äù. Buffett explains further:

&gt; ‚ÄúFloat is money we hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the money. This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside: The premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay. That leaves it running an ‚Äòunderwriting loss‚Äô, which is the cost of float. An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.‚Äù

In other words: for most insurers, the combined cost of running their business and paying out claims usually exceeds the money they receive from premiums. Most insurers make up for these underwriting losses by profitably investing their float. If they just so happen to earn an underwriting profit‚Äîthat is, if premiums ultimately exceed the cost of running the business plus the cost of claims‚Äîit‚Äôs simply a bonus. 

Unlike most insurers, Berkshire consistently earns an underwriting profit. So not only does Berkshire get to invest the float, but it‚Äôs effectively paid to do so! Buffett says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs like your taking out a loan and having the bank pay you interest.‚Äù 

An insurer that consistently generates float and earns an underwriting profit is a great business. Still, Buffett saw more potential. Instead of investing the float in conservative and low-yielding bonds like a traditional insurance company does, Buffett took a new approach: he used the float to buy stock in other companies selling for reasonable prices.

**Phase II**: Using Float to Buy Partial Ownership of Other Companies (i.e., Stocks)

Throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, Buffett used the proceeds from Berkshire‚Äôs insurance businesses to buy shares of a number of fantastic companies‚Äîsuch as Coca Cola, American Express, and The Washington Post‚Äîwhich were at the time selling for far less than their intrinsic values. By investing the borrowed money (i.e., float) that Berkshire was in effect being paid to hold, Buffett was able to lever his returns‚Äîearning Berkshire and its shareholders 20%+ per year. Even better, this leverage came from owned insurance operations rather than debt‚Äîwhich meant Berkshire reaped all the benefits of leverage without shouldering its traditional downside (such as interest expenses and an increase in risk).

Until the early 1990s, Berkshire Hathaway was in essence a lightly-leveraged, publicly-traded stock portfolio, managed by an unusually prudent investor. But as Berkshire grew in size, it became increasingly difficult to find opportunities in publicly traded companies that were large enough to move the needle. So Buffett changed track for the third time: he began acquiring operating businesses outright.

**Phase III**: Buying Full Ownership of Operating Businesses

hough Buffett did buy a few operating businesses in the 1970s and 1980s, it wasn't until the 1990s that he started doing so in earnest. Present-day Berkshire fully owns dozens of businesses, including: GEICO, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, Dairy Queen, Benjamin Moore Paints, Clayton Homes, and ACME Brick. At first, the collective net worth of these businesses was dwarfed by Berkshire‚Äôs investment portfolio. And to this day it is the investment portfolio which remains the focus for most investors. But as Buffett continued to acquire simple, stable businesses that possessed what he deemed favorable long-term competitive advantages, their total value swelled. Today, they make up half of Berkshire‚Äôs intrinsic value.

**PRESENT-DAY BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

I. What is the Value of Berkshire‚Äôs Investment Portfolio (and Cash &amp; Bonds)?

Included in this half of Berkshire‚Äôs value are its cash, bonds, and 5%-15% partial ownership stakes in companies such as American Express, Kraft Heinz, Apple, Coca Cola, IBM, Bank of America, and many others. Valuing Berkshire‚Äôs investment portfolio is simple. Since ‚Äúcash is cash‚Äù, and the market prices the stocks and bonds every day, one needs only to look up the price and the number of shares owned by Berkshire to get an approximation of their worth:

[Chart](http://i.imgur.com/ayoXqDS.png)

An investor can then apply a premium or a discount, based on whether current market prices are under or overvalued.  An argument could be made that Berkshire‚Äôs stock portfolio warrants a slight premium in light of Buffett‚Äôs investing prowess, but for simplicity‚Äôs sake we are assigning no premium, and assume the market is pricing each company correctly. 

After summing up available cash, stocks, bonds, and preferred shares, we get $257b worth of investments.

 |Book Value|Per B Share
:--:|:--:|:--:                               
Cash|$66.3b|$27
Stocks|$120.5b|$49
Bonds|$23.8b|$10
Preferred/Warrants|$17.3b|$7
Kraft Heinz|$29.6b|$12
**Total**|**$257.5b**|**$105**

On a per share basis, this totals $105, or 64% of Berkshire's current $163/share price. 

II. What is the Value of Berkshire‚Äôs Operating Businesses?

The rest of Berkshire‚Äôs value comes from its operating businesses. After backing out the $105/share of investments from Berkshire‚Äôs current share price ($163), the remainder‚Äîor $58/share‚Äîis what the market believes the operating businesses are worth. 

[Chart](http://i.imgur.com/KdpdCHX.png)

Since the true value of its investment portfolio is more or less determined by the market, the question of whether or not Berkshire is properly valued at $163/share comes down to this: is $58/share a fair price to pay for Berkshire‚Äôs operating businesses? Considering these companies earned $8.56/share (pre-tax) in 2016, we feel that paying $58/share for this group‚Äîor 7x earnings‚Äîis a bargain.

Let‚Äôs break this down. Berkshire‚Äôs group of wholly-owned operating businesses has grown20%/yr for nearly two decades, earning $21b ($8.56/share) in 2016. Broadly speaking, its businesses fall into one of five segments: insurance; Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE); Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF); Manufacturing, Services, &amp; Retailing (MSR); and Finance &amp; Financial Products. 

[Berkshire Segment Subsidiaries](http://i.imgur.com/GArlySE.png)

**1. Insurance**

*2016 earnings: $2.1b (10 % of total)
*Companies: GEICO, General Re, National Indemnity, etc. 

Since the purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire‚Äôs insurance operations have become the largest and most profitable in the world. They have delivered 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits‚Äîa feat unheard of in the industry. 

Aside from unusually consistent earnings, the insurance group provides Berkshire with an even greater benefit discussed earlier: float. At year end 2016, the company‚Äôs float‚Äîmoney that Berkshire holds but does not own‚Äîstood at over $100b. This free financing is available to Berkshire to acquire more businesses across a range of industries.

**2. Finance and Financial Products**

* 2016 earnings: $2.1b (10% of total)
* Companies: Clayton Homes, XTRA, Marmon, CORT

This is Berkshire‚Äôs smallest group, made up of companies that specialize in mobile home manufacturing/financing, furniture rentals, and equipment leasing. 

**3. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE)**

* 2016 earnings: $2.7b (13% of total)
* Companies: NV Energy, MidAmerican Energy, PacifiCorp, etc. 

Berkshire Hathaway Energy is a group of regulated utilities, renewable power sources, and gas pipelines operating in Nevada, Utah, Iowa, Oregon, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Regulators allow these monopolies to exist, in exchange for a limit on how much they can earn. Even with these limits in place, this group of companies provides predictable and recession-proof earnings, with the important added benefit of allowing Berkshire to defer billions of dollars in taxes because of their large capital expenditure needs. 

**4. Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railroad (BNSF)**

* 2016 earnings: $5.7b (27% of total)
* Companies: Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad

Railroads play a vital role within the US economy; they ship goods from point A to point B more efficiently and cheaply than all other forms of transport. And because railroads require massive amounts of capital, land, equipment, and government cooperation, these companies are virtually impossible to duplicate‚Äîmaking disruption by a new competitor extremely unlikely. 

The railroad industry is made up of regional duopolies, with BNSF and Union Pacific controlling the western US. While their earnings are cyclical and highly dependent on the health of the national economy, their long-term returns will almost assuredly be above average. Since acquiring BNSF in 2010 for $30b, the company has already earned a total of $24b, and is now the second largest contributor to Berkshire‚Äôs operating profit. Like the BHE group, BNSF requires large amounts of capital investment every year to maintain the infrastructure. And just like BHE, these capital outlays can be used to defer taxes at the parent-level for decades to come. Being able to ‚Äúpay today‚Äôs taxes tomorrow‚Äù is another nice little form of float; one that lets Berkshire profitably‚Äîand tax-efficiently‚Äîreinvest billions of dollars back into both segments. 

Said more simply: owning utilities is not a way to get rich; it‚Äôs a way to stay rich. And Berkshire intends on staying rich.

**5. Manufacturing, Services, and Retailing**

* 2016 earnings: $8.5b (40% of total)
* Companies: See‚Äôs Candy, Lubrizol, Dairy Queen, Marmon, The Pampered Chef, etc. 

This segment drives the lion‚Äôs share of Berkshire‚Äôs operating earnings. It is an eclectic collection of businesses, selling everything from Dilly Bars to partial ownership of private jets. As a whole, the group earns very respectable returns on capital‚Äîwith almost no use of financial leverage. Furniture, ice cream, airplane parts, and underwear may not be the most trendy businesses in the world, but they‚Äôre safe, stable, and profitable, with many earning 15%-20%/year. 

Together, these five groups earned $21b last year for Berkshire, or $8.56/share.

 |Pre-Tax Earnings|Per B Share
:--:|:--:|:--:                               
Underwriting|$2.1b|$0.86
BHE|$2.7b|$1.10
BNSF|$5.7b|$2.31
MSR|$8.5b|$3.43
Financial Products|$2.1b|$0.85
**Total**|**$21.1b**|**$8.56**

**Are Berkshire‚Äôs Operating Businesses Being Fairly Valued by the Market?**

Back to the question: Is $58/share a fair price to pay for Berkshire‚Äôs operating businesses? 

For $58/share, investors are getting $8.56 of earnings generated by a group of stable companies that: earn solid returns on capital; have been vetted by an investor widely recognized as the greatest of all time; have grown earnings at 20%/yr since 1999; are unlikely to be disrupted by technological advances; and have long-term competitive advantages. 

A standalone company with similar characteristics would probably trade above $170/share. Yet Berkshire‚Äôs operating business group trades for only $58. Perhaps if Berkshire renamed this part of their business Berkshire Hathaway AI Biotech Cloud Data Inc., it would it start trading at a more appropriate level. To put this in perspective, let‚Äôs imagine that certain popular tech companies started trading at a similar multiple to Berkshire‚Äôs operating businesses. Google‚Äôs share price would be $245 (versus actual $823); Netflix‚Äôs would be $4.50 (versus actual $142); and Amazon‚Äôs would be $64 (versus actual $884).

So how many times earnings should an investor be willing to pay for Berkshire‚Äôs operating businesses? Each of the five groups has different economic characteristics, so one could apply specific multiples to each (for example, 10x for insurance, 12x for BHE, 15x for BNSF, 15x for MSR, and 10x for Financial Products are probably appropriate). Doing so may yield a more precise (and probably higher) assessment of Berkshire's worth. But with either approach, the message is clear: the market is undervaluing Berkshire.  

We apply a simple‚Äîand rather conservative‚Äî10x multiple to Berkshire‚Äôs group of operating businesses, which yields $85/share in value. When combined with its $105/share of stocks, bonds, and cash, this puts Berkshire‚Äôs intrinsic value at somewhere around $190/share‚Äîa 15% premium to today‚Äôs price.

**Conclusion**

50 years ago, Berkshire Hathaway was a struggling New England textile manufacturer. The business‚Äîwhich required a lot of capital, was barely profitable, and had no long-term competitive advantages‚Äîwas not a good one. But Warren Buffett decided to buy it anyway, thinking the company‚Äôs assets (e.g., machines, factories, accounts receivable, etc.) were worth more than the price he could could pay for the entire business. After assuming control, business steadily deteriorated, and it became apparent the market had been right‚ÄîBerkshire was a dud. 

Half a century later, Berkshire Hathaway is far from a dud. In fact, it‚Äôs probably one of the best companies in the world. While the textile business is long gone, what remains is an investment portfolio worth $105/share, and a collection steadily growing, well managed, and very profitable businesses, that together earned $8.56/share in 2016. A company like that should trade for 20x earnings. Berkshire is available for 1/3rd that.",finance

personalfinance,Problem Accepting Debt,"After graduating college in 2015 I had trouble landing a good job in my field. Being completely financially independent with no support system, I struggled to make ends meet and student loan payments, fortunately I never defaulted. After a few minimal wage jobs and temporary contract, I was able to land an alright job in my field making 41K in August 2016. With a lot of sacrifice and an extremely frugal lifestyle I paid off my 10K student loan debt in January at the expense of having a sizable emergency fund. My plan after being debt free was to have an emergency fund to cover 6 months of expenses and save to buy a car; I currently do not drive. Unfortunately, I became ill and accumulate around 5K-6K in medical debt. I am currently using care credit card which has 12 month 0% interest rate plan to pay off my medical debt. I have until Feb 2017 to pay of my loan. The problem I am facing now is that being in debt makes me very uneasy and causes a lot of anxiety. I was not born in the US so having debt is a very new and frightening concept.  If I‚Äôm in debt I can‚Äôt think of anything else or enjoy life. Thus, I have been making sizable payments on my care credit card and have paid off 85% of the loan in 2 months. I now particularly have zero dollars in savings; if I lost my job I would have no financial security. Even though being jobless and practically homeless is a scary thought, I can‚Äôt stop making impulsive payments on my loan.  I need help becoming more comfortable with debts, especially reasonable ones like a 0% interest rate loan.",finance
personalfinance,"Staring at about 160K in student debt, how should I handle this?","Hi. I'm about to graduate college (22 y.o) with a marketing degree and I've racked up about 160K in debt over the past 4 years (have about 15K in interested accrued already). I have most of my debt through a private lender Sallie Mae, and the other smaller loans are state loans with no interest or a very small fixed interest rate. Most of my private loans are somewhere between 4%-9.625% Variable rate and I have another loan through the private lender that is 9.875% Fixed. 

Now, before you tell me how royally fucked I am, know that I get it. I took out money I didn't have to go to a school I couldn't afford, but what's done is done and I just want to keep a positive outlook on the situation.

Currently I have about $5,000 in the bank, and I have deferred payment for my loans until 6 months after graduation. My question to PF is what is my best route in terms of navigating this gargantuan amount of debt? Can I put all my private loans together into one loan and one interest rate? Should I invest the money I have in my savings now so I can see some return in the next 6 months to a year?

Currently will be moving back home, so my primary expenses are my car payment ($280/mo) and my insurance on my car ($185/mo). Going to be getting a position at a firm for around $40,000 per year, as well as bringing in maybe $15,000 per year freelancing as a graphic designer. 

I'm really inexperienced at finances, and don't fully understand everything about my debt situation, however I'd like to learn as much as I can so I can face it head on. Any advice is welcomed. 

**TL;DR** 160K in student loans with variable interest rates, will be bringing in around 50-55K per year with about $600/mo in bills since I'm still living at home. 5K in savings currently.",finance

And now, for the final chapter of the saga!  Unfortunately, it's very short and bland.

I just got off the phone with my CU.  They finally resolved the case and it's closed.  They released the $900 hold and also took out the $900 that I shouldn't have.  As a gift for being so patient and friendly with them they gave me $50 in my account.  Yay?

I asked about the letter we received, and he said that was for the original dispute where they accidentally put $900 extra into the account instead of taking it out and not for $300.  Bah!

personalfinance,Refinance auto loan or pay off really quickly?,"My wife and I recently applied for a car loan financed at 11.98%.

(see note 1 below) I have a pretty good credit score (high 700s) so we are considering refinancing through our credit union in the next month or two. My questions are as follows:

1) Is there harm in paying off the loan really quickly if we have other lines of credit that are still active? My budget projection shows we could have it paid off by this December.

2) Would you recommend refinancing to tackle some of the high interest student loans or will refinancing negatively impact our credit (due to the hard inquiry) to a point that it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it?

2. Consolidate student loans to 4% or less and begin paying on it. I have no idea if I can do that since only one is mine.  My work will reimburse my loan when I graduate, but that's 18 months away and doesn't account for interest.

3. Take excess cash of $2500/month and throw at student loans, then car, then house in a snowball fashion with minimum payments.

Even if I do that, its going to take over 2 years to pay off.  Is there anything else I can do?  The only thing I can think of is to try and reduce non-debt expenses to apply towards debt--but its going to get really difficult to accomplish.  I suppose I could stop the 4% 401k contributions, since I have a balance of $50k.  However, they do a 4% match and its immediately vested.

personalfinance,"I have ~$5,500 CC debt, living/working abroad, getting advised to let it go to collections.","I've been working and living abroad since 2013. I teach English and though it can be a lucrative job in some countries, I'm drawn to the low-paying ones, specifically SE Asia. I have 3 credit cards that are nearly maxed out. I don't really use them but the minimum payments I make barely cover the interest rates: 25% 21% and 18%. I taught in Korea for a year to try and tackle the debt, but I managed it poorly since I decided to prioritize my student loans even though those interest rates are much lower and more manageable (6-8%). I regret it, but I can't change it. I also don't want to return to Korea to teach again.

I asked advice from a friend who used to work as a credit counselor. He says I should just not pay the debts and let them go to collections. Currently my credit score is about 700. He suggests that since I don't plan to live in California (my resident state) for a few years that I shouldn't be too bothered with the threat of bad credit. I was of course very intrigued by this and I learned about the 4 year statute of limitations in CA for a CC company to sue me for the debt owed, the 7 years it'll take to have it removed from my credit history, and the apparently low possibility that the company would pursue a lawsuit for a debt as minimal as mine: $5,500 total from 3 cards. If I were to stop paying today, I would probably apply for a secured credit card later on in order to build my credit up again before returning to the states. Even then, I don't think I'd immediately need good credit upon returning, but I'm sure many could argue that that's wishful thinking. Knowing that I won't be in CA to suffer the immediate consequences of not paying the cards makes this a dilemma for me.

I plan to speak with other currently employed credit counselors to make sure I understand the risks involved, but I'm just wondering if anyone has had a similar situation? What would you advise I research further? Has anyone here been abroad while their debts go to collections? Or been sued for an amount like mine?

Total min monthly: $1,700.85

We have a few options with this money and some I had saved up. We can pay up to ~$44k in a lump sum. The two scenarios I see are:

1) Pay off highest interest loans first

2) Pay off highest interest loans with variable rates first

&amp;nbsp;

Since the fed raised rates last month all of our variable loans have gone up by 0.25% and it's expected to happen twice more this year. That's why I'm still viewing that as an option. Since I can't predict the rate future I gamed out each scenario with current rates staying the same.

&amp;nbsp;

1) Pay off highest interest first (avalanche) and roll those payments into the next:

This would eliminate loans 1-11 at a cost of $43,758.91. Rolling those monthly payments into the next would give me a payoff date of January 2024 and I'd pay $14,675 in interest.

&amp;nbsp;

2) Pay off the highest interest variable loans and roll those payments into the next:

This would eliminate loans 1-3, 11, 13 and 14 at a cost of $40,003.02. Rolling those monthly payments into the next would give me a payoff date of April 2024 and I'd pay $16,107 in interest.

&amp;nbsp;

Looking at these two options the initial winner is to focus on higher interest loans no matter if they are fixed or not. However, forecasting fed interest rates a few years from now may change that. 

&amp;nbsp;

Right now I'm definitely leaning towards just eliminating the top 11 loans as that would clear up some accounts and make it easier to handle. I just have to hope rates don't go crazy or I'll need to refi some of them. With that option taken we'd slam an extra $2k per month into the payment plan and that would give me a monthly payment of $3,698 with a payoff date of March 2020 and total interest paid of $5,997 (from this point forward). 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm just looking for a sanity check to make sure I'm not missing something crazy. I appreciate any input. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,New insurance option at work: Flex Credits. Seems too good to be true. Is it?,"The premise is you have pre-tax money deducted from your paycheck, which is then credited back to you post-tax. So you have a smaller taxable income, which results in more money in your paycheck. That extra money is then used to pay for insurance.

They call the money being put back in a ""Claim Payment"", which concerned me. But they say the only thing we have to do to have that claim applied is to fill out the once-a-year health assessment form.

The example they gave looked like this (numbers made up from remembering the PowerPoint they showed us):

 |Before|After
:--|:--|:--
Pay|$2500|$2500
Contribution to plan|$0|-$500
Taxable income|$2500|$2000
State/Fed Taxes/SS/Medicare|-$750|-$600
Claim payment returned|$0|+$500
Take-home pay|$1750|$1900

So there's now a $150 ""Flex Credit"". These Flex Credits are used to pay for the Accidental Injury and Life Insurance plans they offer. We really only get to take the same $1750 home.

personalfinance,Help! I'm an idiot and I need help getting rid of credit card debt,"Hi all. I have around $10,000 of credit card debt spread out between four cards that I've just been making the minimum payments on for a long while. Recently, my job has slowed down tremendously and I'm not making the same amount of money. Ive been late on a couple card this past week and it's becoming hard to try and keep up with cards and just general bills. 

Please help. What's the best route to take towards paying off this debt? One route I want to take is to add the debt from the lowest card amount to my car loan that is at an interest rate of 6.1% to boost my credit score and focus on the other cards. However, I've been late on a couple of cards...so I doubt that route will work out for me at this time. 

What should I do?

personalfinance,Advice needed for car situation,"Background info:

Car #1 (Husband):
Owe ~ $7300
Worth ~ $11500
3.9% interest rate, $285/mo
25 months left on loan

Car #2 (Mine):
Owe ~ $14,xxx (@ end of lease term)
Worth ~ $17,000
$305/mo
Lease ends Oct 2017
30,000 mile cap w/$0.15 penalty for overage. 
I am currently already at 35,500 miles (had to unexpectedly commute for year 2 of lease, no longer commuting)... which will put me at around a $1200 penalty come October (my mileage will be around ~38k by then)

Total car payments: $590/mo (yuck)

Husband and I are trying to figure out what we want to do when my lease term ends. Our end goal, we think, is to share 1 vehicle and save the monthly savings towards purchasing an SUV in ~5 years (cash purchase, ideally no financing). We currently have 2 kiddos and plan to have 1-2 more over the next 6 years so we'll likely need a bigger vehicle at some point as our current vehicles only fit 3 in back and 2 in front. 

3 scenarios we've come up with:

1. Suck it up and eat the $1200 penalty, turn my car in at the end of the lease and share his vehicle for the foreseeable future. Use the $305 no longer going towards my vehicle towards making a bigger payment on his car and getting it paid off sooner

2. Trade his vehicle &amp; my vehicle in at dealership under the contingency that we get a fair trade in value for his vehicle and they waive the $1200 penalty for me. New Loan terms: $15k or LESS loan @ 3-3.5% or less interest for no more than 3 years. 

3. Pay the $1200 penalty, keep my vehicle but turn around and sell it privately. Put profits into savings or into paying down his vehicle. (Don't want to keep my vehicle because it'd be another 3 year loan term, with likely a payment that goes up to $400 or more).

Maybe there is a better scenario out there that I'm not thinking of... the first one seems to be the best, but the 3rd one seems good too. I just hate the idea of paying the $1200 penalty, but we could re-coup the cost with 4 months of not having my car payment. 

Any advice, appreciated. And yes... no more leases.",finance
personalfinance,Should I consolidate all my debt into my line of credit?,"Here's the skinny,

I owe about $10,000.

$5,000 of which is owed to Visa and American Express (visa $4,000 amex $1,000) and the other $5,000 is on my line of credit.

I am currently working full time and earning $1,200-$1,300 every two weeks ($2,400-$2,600/month)

On top of that I work another job that brings in anywhere from $100-$1500/month.

Should I put what I owe in credit card debt on my line of credit? My line of credit has a better interest rate than both visa and amex. 

Right now I'm thinking of doing that and then putting my head down and working as much as I can and putting all the money I can towards paying off the line of credit. 

I'm not looking for budgeting advice but I would be glad to hear your thoughts on what I should do with my situation.

I am a programmer and I can work remotely from anywhere, so finding a job in Hawaii isn't a problem.  

My wife and I have been tossing around the idea of purchasing a home right now and renting it out.  We keep going back and forth between getting a rental property close by our current location vs getting something in Hawaii.  I would like to buy a property that has a mother-in-law apartment that we can rent out and live in the top floor.  Of course we'd rent both out until we move there.

One of my motivating factors in buying in Hawaii is that interest rates are very low right now.  We could lock in right now and not run the risk of higher interest in 7 years.  But then perhaps I'd be better off to wait for a crash in the market before buying?

personalfinance,"Should I use new CC ($8,000 limit) to pay off the rest of an auto loan?","So I have been working on fixing my credit and part of that was removing 2 collections account that belonged to my father with the same name. The thing is, after they were removed, my credit score never went back up to it's high 700's. It remains around like 623 or something.
I only have 2 CC's including this new one. The other has a $500 limit. I've always been frugal about CC's because I have been a little more gung-ho by getting into 2 auto-loans before the age of 22 (at separate times of course). Sort of like, you can have one but not the other. I have never made a late payment on my auto-loans.
So the new card has $8k limit and the remainder of my auto-loan is about $5200. Here are the reasons I have been considering this:


1) I am ready to sell the car. I have tried in the past but people don't like that I'm still owing on it.


2) I signed up for the Chase Sapphire when I did because the deal is that if I spend $4k on it within the first 3 months, then I will get X amount of travel points to start.


3) One of my family members co-signed for that car for me long-ago because she has a mid-800s C-score. So I also figured, why not get her off of it and remove that loan.


4) I'd like the bump to my credit score from paying off the auto loan.


Currently I am comfortable financially. I have about $6000 in savings that I've been adding too and low monthly overhead. I have to spend $4k on the card within the first 3 months anyways.


I don't know the interest rate yet though. I have not received everything in the mail from the bank yet.

personalfinance,"Help! Ford dealership threatening to sell truck out from under me if I don't pay 1,200 a month MINIMUM.","BACKSTORY: So I'm in the US Army and I bought a 2004 f150 from a used car dealership in Clarksville TN, just off post, about a month ago for $4,000. I purchased this truck with a loan from navy federal credit union. After driving this truck for about 2 weeks, I started to notice a small, quiet tick in the engine. I decided to drive it to auto parts stores and mechanics, to ask them what was wrong with it and I was given numerous answers that weren't very consistent with each other. I decided to take the truck to a ford dealership where I assumed it would be given a professional diagnosis and a fix if needed. They told me there was low compression in 6 of 8 cylinders and that it needed a brand new engine. They told me it would cost around $6,000. I told the mechanics that I couldn't afford to pay that within a reasonable amount of time. The man assured me that it's no big deal, they would just hold the truck until i could get it paid off. He literally said ""as long as you bring a few hundred dollars in every few weeks, you will be fine"" so I said okay go ahead and install the new motor. I went out of town for two weeks, got a call saying ""hey, new motor was installed, truck was test driven, everything is looking great"". I got back in town three days later and stopped by to chat with the mechanics and I paid $300 and said I would be back soon with another 3 or 4 hundred dollars within the next few weeks. 

THE PART THAT MATTERS:
One day after making a payment of $300 dollars, today, I got a call from the mechanic I've been dealing with, the same one I mentioned above about making the payments at my own pace, and a few hundred dollars here and there would be fine. He said that his supervisor told him that a few hundred dollars here and there isn't enough and if I didn't get the entire 6,000 some odd dollars paid off in the next 90 days, they would sell the truck. I tried to negotiate with the mechanics and my step father, who is the wisest man I'll probably ever know was the first person I could ask for help. He called the dealership and the mechanic was honest, saying that he DID in fact tell me that a comfortable payment of a few hundred dollars was fine and i could basically take my time. Step father demands to talk to the supervisor who tells him that the BEST he can do is for me to make a 300 dollar payment every week when I don't have that much left after bills. That's 1,200 dollars a month and I have never even heard of someone having to pay that much. That just isn't reasonable. 

I would be grateful for any advice you have for me. This is really stressful for me and i don't know what to do.",finance

personalfinance,"Should I switch insurance plans? Currently on AZ/fed marketplace plan with advance tax credit, but seasonal employer offers insurance.","I am trying to decide whether to take my Federal Government provided health insurance while a seasonal through mid to late September.  
  
Background:  
I have been doing seasonal contract work, so multiple employers, and none long enough to provide health insurance. I am currently enrolled in a federal marketplace plan (my state doesn't have a state marketplace) that has premiums of about $300 a month after my tax credit. Without the tax credit I would be paying just over $700 a month, which would be un-affordable to me.  
I was hired and have just started seasonal work in a branch of the federal government through mid to late September. Recent changes in law have made federal health insurance available to seasonal federal employees such as myself. Once the government pays their portion I would probably end up paying 150 to 200 dollars a month, pre-tax, for a monthly premium. On paper it seems like a no-brainer... However, there is more to it.  
  
I have a chronic medical condition that requires management by a specialist. I just moved to my new state where I have my current health insurance plan. Because of the move and change in insurance I had to find a new primary care doctor, schedule an appointment with them, get referrals for the specialist, schedule an appointment with the specialist, get new prescriptions from the specialist, wait for insurance to go through a pre-approval process for one of them, and then, finally, after 3.5 months I got what I needed. (And coincidentally I've almost met my annual deductible). This was a stressful process, where my health hangs in the balance, waiting on maintenance medication. I'd really like to not have to repeat that process right now if I were to switch to federal insurance, just to have to repeat it again in October because COBRA from the federal plan is prohibitively expensive.  
  
So, my question: I believe under ACA law if I have any employer provided health insurance available to me, including seasonally from the feds, I am no longer eligible for the advance premium tax credit, right? This would make my current insurance too expensive... But switching is a giant headache, especially if I end up with another HMO rather than PPO plan.

Bringing my $33,000k/year income down to about $20,000k/year. After submitting a FAFSA(Fall 2016-Spring 2017) I received a Direct Sub Stafford Loan for $2,625.00 and a Direct Unsub Stafford Loan for $6,000.00. I've submitted one for the 2017-2018 school year but haven't received a response from my University yet. The estimated tuition/costs for completing my graduate degree are ~$50,352 before taxes. 12 courses at $4,196/course.

After hearing that I've received little aid, my parents applied for a home equity loan. Their house is already paid off.

personalfinance,Student graduating - question about how to attack loans,"Hi,

I am graduating from medical school in June 2017, after which I start a four-year program (residency) and can finally start paying down some of my loans. I do not plan on pursuing the PSLF program.

I was seeking advice about the smartest way to attack my loans. 

**Income**:
I made a detailed budget with my wife, and for next year we have an over/under budget of about 4700/month. This excludes any payment on loans and also doesn't include putting any money away, just includes our incomes less all of our expenses. We have about 80000 in savings.
  
**Loans:**  
*3 Stafford loans (dollar amount/interest): Loan 1 (8500/6.21), Loan 2 (23000, 5.84), and Loan 3 (27000, 5.31). *Other details*: has 6 month grace period after graduation.  
*Private institutional loan: 15000 at 7%. *Other details*: subsidized so no interest accrues while I am in school. 9 month grace period. Can be deferred x 3 years.  
*Federal Perkins loan: 14900 at 5%. *Other details*: subsidized so no interest accrues while I am in school. 9 month grace period.  
*Private car loan: 10844 at 2.9%. *Other details*: 60 month loan.  
  
I am not quite sure the best way to proceed. My plan was to allow the stafford, private institutional loan, and federal perkins loan to go through their grace periods, after which time I would defer the private institutional loan x 3 years and then apply for refinancing on the stafford and federal perkins loan. Meanwhile I will make minimum payments on my private car loan because the interest is low. I will then pay off the other loans from highest interest to lowest interest order, as we are able to financially.

We do plan on buying a house next year, so that will add the additional element of a mortgage with which to contend.

Does this plan make sense? Advice? Would it make sense to take some of our savings and attack loans now?

Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,"Got into what feels like a Craigslist scam -- may have gotten the better of the scammer, not sure what to do now (LONG).","Perhaps you guys can offer some insight, apologies for the long explanation but I don't want to leave anything out...

So I'm in NYC and I have items I sell locally on Craigslist using a CL-specific email (always using the relay option so as to not give out the actual email) and I use a dummy number as well for the account to protect my actual. Most transactions are simple enough.. people email or text me about a specific item, I give them the info they need, they come pick said item up with cash, and that's that. I don't like to meet people at specific locations, and I don't like to ship things unless its convenient.. I'd rather people just come by and meet me in my lobby (plenty of people around) and we'll call it a day. Once in a while someone will ask to pay via PayPal or Venmo which is fine, I've never had a problem to-date. I do get scamming messages from time to time but thankfully I've got an eye for spotting them (they'll email me asking me to email them back at a different address, or they'll ask me to ship the item and they'll send me a money order, blah blah etc). This time I'm not quite sure what to make of what seemed like a prospective buyer:

He messages me from a 347 area code (NYC number, so far so good I figured.. most scammers try and contact me from bizarre area codes), and says he loves a $1k watch I'm selling.. says he wants to get it for his uncle. Wanted to know if I could ship it for him if he paid extra (offered $60).. this was not typical but I figured it was fine by me since it was already packaged up and I'd just need to drop it to the UPS store (great experience with the service so its my go-to). He asked for a video of the watch movement, so I obliged. Once he 'approved', he then lays it on me: he asks if he can send payment via Chase QuickPay. Now I don't have Chase, but I know friends who do and given the bank I have, I know its possible to accept payment from Chase to my bank since they are partners.. so I give him the benefit of the doubt and tell him to send payment over (just needs my name and bank-related email, I reluctantly gave it over). Sure enough I get a legit payment notification from the bank, but it's for $1560.. they sent $500 too much. I'm not sure why, so I tell him the deal and he says ""oh no problem just go ahead and refund the 500, my mistake"". When I asked for the name and email to transfer the $ back over, they say ""oh sorry I'd prefer you send me a money order. here's the address: '1234 blah blah lane'.. leave the money order blank, thanks"". So begins my suspicions.

As I'm trying to figure out what the guy's deal is in this moment, I then get a message from him saying ""OH hey man sorry, I just showed the watch to my uncle and he doesn't like it. Please send all the money back and keep $100 for yourself for the trouble"". Now I'm on high alert, realizing that this feels like a clearing scam. So I call my bank and ask when the payment would clear and they said it could take up to 11 business days. FINE BY ME, and I let the prick know I wasn't going to send anything to him until his payment cleared, period. There was ghetto cursing, threats to expose me to ""the LAW"" if I didn't send the money ASAP but I stood my ground. Today (5 days later) and to my surprise, I found that the payment actually cleared, so I was a bit confused.. as if maybe he wasn't trying to scam me and was actually just an idiot? At that point and after a ton of angry messages on my dummy line, I just wanted the guy out of my hair.. mind you, he has access to my CL listings as well as my actual name and bank email -- so I'd prefer that things didn't escalate with him trying to look me up or something. I told him I wasn't going to send a blank money order bc that sounded fishy. I asked him for the Chase name and email so I could send the money back the way it came, but he kept saying ""sorry I don't have that account anymore, you can't send it to me that way"".. instead he tells me to take $160 (up'd from $100) of the $1560 for my trouble, gives me a name and tells me to deposit the money at a Wells Fargo for him. Again, just wanting to get the prick out of my hair I oblige while out handling errands (a branch was along the way) -- how about a Wells Fargo manager had to take me aside and tell me that they couldn't accept the deposit for the account?? I'm literally like 'WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON' at this point..

I went off on the guy, asking him what the fuck his deal is considering I was trying to do him a favor.. finally, he just apologized and asked if I could send payment via Western Union. Now I'm sitting on $1400 from a very suspicious dude and I'm not sure what to make of it. Was this guy just an amateur scammer that didn't expect for me to wait for the payment to clear? Am I being overly generous by trying to send the prick's money back? Technically he did nothing wrong besides being a humongous pain in the ass.. but I'm not sure what to do now.

---

UPDATE: (4/24/17) Basically I got extremely lucky (guardian angel looking out for me, good karmic energy, whatever it is I'll take it) because my saving grace was that Wells Fargo did not accept the deposit that I thought was legitimate because the initial payment transfer had cleared. I spent those next couple of days dealing with BOA's fraud department reps, and basically broke down the entire tale.. being sure to include every sordid detail regardless of whether it made me look like an idiot. They logged all the info down and said it was extremely fortunate that not only had I been calling them from the get-go to chronicle the entire experience to show that I wasn't a part of this scam, but that in the end I had all the money in my account. They mentioned that although it was a bit more sophisticated than the older clearing scam, this was the type they've been hearing about more and more lately which ends up leaving the poor schmuck (me) holding the bag. They created a case, put a hold on the funds, said they'd reach out to Chase if Chase didn't reach out to them first (considering the account holder likely flagged the charge for investigation at this point), gave me the case details and recommended I file a police report at my local precinct.

Meeting with the police didn't go over so well -- I was relieved at first because the first cop I spoke with said that he, like myself at first, didn't understand how it was all a scam in the first place if the payment transfer cleared. Then another with a bit more experience in the matter came along and heard me out.. said that I couldn't file a report until the bank's investigation came back and unequivocally determined fraud, and recommended I come back once that happened with copies of the bank's findings as well as my bank statement. Unfortunately as I'd come to find later, the bank's investigation wouldn't technically result in 'fraud' considering I was the one who voluntarily provided my name and bank-related email to accept the initial transfer in the first place. Had the Wells Fargo deposit gone through, the police (understandably) would've considered me complicit.. a bit disconcerting to say the least. It's a bummer because I really would've loved for the police to try and nab these pricks (I was still stringing them along in text messages at this point to keep them engaged for the police) but it wouldn't go anywhere if I couldn't prove fraud. My gf recommended I reach out to the FBI as well in case they could do something, but I'm afraid the result would've been the same.

In the end, I told the bank of my attempt with the police and they explained the fraud conundrum.. so they placed an expedited request on the hold for the funds to be sent back to the Chase customer as soon as possible. They briefed me that I'd hear back regarding the investigation in the coming weeks, but that I'd not be held complicit in the scam considering my cooperation from the beginning when I first flagged the transfer. As such, the closing of my account would not be likely, although they said I should consider changing my bank-related email in case I keep hearing from the scammer (I got some half-assed corny FBI threat from them, but nothing else since).

Needless to say, its been an adventure. Can't tell you all how grateful I am for your $0.02 on the matter, it helped me a great deal. I will be taking and enforcing a lot of the advice I received here, including sticking to cash transactions from now on as well as moving my meeting location from my lobby (regardless of how well-lit, well-populated it is) to the local drugstore.. I guess I never considered the possibility that someone could take things to the next level which could jeopardize not only myself, but even my gf or the people in my building. Truly thankful! To those conducting online transactions similar to my own experience, please be careful and please be wary.. there are some real shitty people out there.",finance
personalfinance,Why not American Express/ Discover savings vs Alley?!,"So, I always see Alley suggested on here for a saving account, &amp; for good reasons it seems, definitely better than traditional banks with their non existent interests. American Express &amp; discover have saving accounts with quite almost the same rate tho, 0.9 &amp; 0.95% vs the 1% at Alley, I know Alley is federally insured and all &amp; this might be just unsubstantiated paranoia but those companies are way older &amp; more established. If alley goes under sure you'll get ur money but it'll be a hassle, &amp; while I assume they're seperate departments having saving accounts with said company might give u preferential treatment when it comes to their credit cards. Don't think many people would put more than 10K in savings, would make more sense to invest at that point, so we're looking at 5-10$ difference per year.

For above said reasons I'm leaning more  toward opening an account at one of both, am I missing something here about the Alley train? Any reason not to do so?

investing,"Is Schwarzman wrong, or is the market wrong? (BX)","I recently listened to Stephen A. Schwarzman talk about why he thinks shares of Blackstone are worth $100+ a share, whereas they're trading for ~$30 a share. 

Regardless of whether you have an opinion on BX specifically, what about investing in the stocks of private equity firms, especially when the CEO's of those firms have stated that they have no fiduciary duty to their public shareholders (As many have: Schwarzman for BX, Howard Marks for Oaktree which I know isn't totally a PE firm but whatever, Rubenstein for Carlyle, I would imagine Ackman has said the same thing about Pershing Square.)

The Bull argument on private equity, as I read it: Investors are turned off by private equity firms with significantly complicated financials like Blackstone. However, PE firms add shareholder value and make good business sense, and Blackstone is significantly undervalued. It just suffers from investor prejudice, particularly during bear markets (Blackstone was trading for ~$5 a share back in the 2008/2009 days.)

The Bear argument, as I read it: Private equity is overwhelmingly vampiric, driving up the stock price of acquisitions by publicizing their involvement, sucking new acquisitions dry to pay their dividends and dumping them into bankruptcy when they're husks of their former selves (See Carlyle's involvement in [Hawaiian Telecom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Telcom))

This was my first year doing my taxes on my own.

It was answered by a ""turbotax support agent"" so I assumed it was legit. My question is: the page instructed me to call the irs at 1 (800) 829 7650. I did and it asked me to press 1 for english, then it asked to say aloud my SSN. I hung up, frightened. 

I then double checked that I dialed the correct number and then also found the number listed on the IRS page (although it's a bit difficult to find). The link is listed below.

I called the number again, said my SSN, and then after holding a person picked up providing me with his ID number. He also asked for my SSN and other information to figure out what I needed to do to solve the issue. He seemed pretty thorough with fixing my issue and didn't just nab my SSN and hang up. This makes me a little optimistic, but I'm still worried. 

I'm worried because when I flat out googled the number there are a lot of post saying it's a scam. These cases seem like different kinds of situations, though. I contacted the number directly, whereas these 'victims' were contacted by the number out of the blue. I'm aware that the IRS works through mail. I'm curious to know if it's possible for hackers to somehow use the IRS number listed above to show up on caller IDs when they call potential victims. I feel like that was the case for people who were conned and subsequently wrote online that the number was a scam. 

Like I said, I feel like my case is a bit different since I called the number myself and not the other way around. Also, the number I called is listed on the IRS website. Here is the page link: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/federal-payment-levy-program

The number is listed on the final paragraph.

Please do not contact the BFS, OPM, SSA, or any other federal agency. See Topic 202, What to Do if You Can't Pay Your Tax, and Topic 204, Offers In Compromise, for additional information.

I plan to call the official IRS number tomorrow. It's 800 829 1040. I'm an idiot for not just calling that number in the first place. 

So, am I screwed? Or have any of you contacted the IRS through the number I called and everything worked out with no issues.

I have 95k in student loans that I have been making aggressive $1,200+ a month payments on for the past 7 years. My interests rates range from 3.5% to 6.5% most of them in the 3-4% range (thankfully) 

I JUST started investing in a 401k 4 months ago about $600 a month and my company matched close to half of that... until now. It's a young company and having a slow period so they needed to cut the 401k matching. Better than the alternatives but still a slap in the face since I finally started investing on my retirement.

Is it smarter to keep contributing 7% into my 401k or should I throw that $ at my higher interest rate loans now that my company doesn't match anymore?

personalfinance,Unemployed and maxed credit - what are my options?,"Thankfully, I only have 1 credit card.

Regrettably, it's maxed out with an absurd interest rate, because I was unemployed 1+ years ago and my bank gave me 6 months of a drastically reduced interest rate in exchange for a sky-rocketing interest rate after those 6 months.

I recently moved to another state, and aside from a temp job I had for a month, I've been unable to find work.

I owe roughly $2400 on a card that I've been paying into for 2 years. (Started around $3000). Each payment has been just over the interest rate, and I've put cumulatively about $3000 into paying it off. I have no prospects for work, and no reason to believe that my income will be high enough to pay much more than interest when I do find a job because I relocated to a state with lower COL, but also lower wages. (I averaged $13.25/hour bussing tables Friday/Saturday in Florida; now I'm in North Carolina and people with jobs requiring certifications and years of experience get paid less than that.)

personalfinance,Am I wrong to max HSA without maxing 403(b) and while servicing debt? Now with more PSLF and Student Loans!,"I thought that I had everything under control, I've got pretty good systems in place for using credit, autopaying loans and cards, manipulating money between a few accounts to maximize my liquid savings and month-to-month spending. But now I'm second guessing my decision to max my HSA through my employer while still paying down student loans. I know everyone is a special snowflake, but I thought I had a good reason to deviate from the [How to handle $](https://i.imgur.com/CcEVQAV.png) flowchart.

Salary: $47,600 (relatively generous employer that decided to match the FLSA regulation that didn't quite make it)

Currently translates to a little over $2600/month, but that's what I use to budget with. I know you'll want the whole budget, but it's a little in flux right now as it's our first month in a house that we're paying utilities on. The TL;DR is that I'm in a high cost-of-living area, I live below/at my means, and between myself and roommates, we can handle our monthly shared expenses.

I'm on income based repayment for my federal student loans, paying about $75/month on ~$33k that is generating ~$140/month in interest. I work for a PSLF qualifying employer and I *believe* that I have at least 3.5 years of qualifying payments so far. Job security is pretty good, potential for a large increase in income is pretty small. I work side jobs occasionally and use all of that extra money to either pad my emergency fund or go straight to my private student loans.

I pay $350 between a few servicers of my private student loans, with about $42k left on those. I'm stretching the payments a bit with SoFi, but after a couple months when my budget is ironed out I'll be sending more than the minimums. I have:

* $33k @ 6.75%
* $9k @ 4%

I also have an auto loan that is costing me $196/month. It started in December as a $9000 loan at 1.99% and has a balance of ~$8500.

I contribute the max to my HSA ($2900 I think? Employer contributes $500), and just enough to get the match on my 403(b) (it's a required contribution anyway, 3% from me and 5.14% from employer). 

I have a 3-month income replacement fund, and I add to it with $50 deducted from each paycheck that I never see in my budget, it just goes straight to my off-budget Ally accounts. I also have a $1500 health insurance deductible. Both are in individual Ally 1.25% CDs from last year.

Almost the entirety of the HSA contribution is from a raise I got at the end of my first year from $45k to $47.6. I figure the HSA is a good way to force myself to save, and since I'm relatively disciplined and fairly healthy (haven't been to a doctor aside from a work-provided physical in the last two years), that it was a solid way to save pre-tax money, invest it, and probably be able to retire with some of it if I keep the savings rate up. If I were to *not* save that money, I'm not sure that I would be able to safely send it to student loans, I'd probably just be keeping it liquid anyway. I'm also under the impression that it is lowering my AGI and therefore helping keep my income based repayments lower. 

As of right now, my HSA + my 403(b) contributions are working out to be ~15% of my gross salary. I figure it's a good habit to get into, and by my knowledge and calculation, it seems to be basically a wash between paying off the loans now or investing the 403b/HSA as long as I keep it in for the long run.

Am I wrong? Should I just accept the post-tax money from the raise and put it towards debt?

BONUS QUESTIONS:

Should I take my 3-month emergency fund and pay off any of the smaller debts? I know based on interest rates I should just hold onto the $9k private student loan and the $8.5k car loan, but it's so tempting to get rid of one of them. If I don't do that, then I don't feel comfortable just putting the $9k I have in the Ally CDs towards the private student loans because it won't change my monthly cash flow and my ability to save is 100% correlated with how cheap I can get my housing (not very). But none of that takes into account my (small) raise that is going towards the HSA currently. I guess that's not much of a question.",finance
personalfinance,Should I close credit cards I no longer plan to use?,"I recently paid off all of my credit cards and have vowed to not use them unless in an emergency. My credit score went up almost a hundred points after doing so (It's 748 on creditwise through capital one). The thing is, I have five credit cards and they all have a high interest rate and a credit line between 1,300-3,000. Two of the cards are store credit cards, one for toys r us that I use only at Christmas and pay it off within three to six months that I prefer to keep open. 

As much as I hate to admit it, I'm not a very good financial planner. I have always been able to pay at least the monthly minimum and keep my accounts in the positive, but I'm a terrible budgeter and I know if I use my credit cards they will quickly get higher than I can afford to pay off. My husband and I own a house that we owe 50k on but would really like to move to a nicer home within the year. Since our income is fairly low, our credit scores are very important. Last year we bought two cars (the first one totalled six months after purchase) so we each have several hard inquiries (that's the only negative on our scores) 

So I guess my question is, is it better for me to close accounts that I don't plan on using anymore or should I just hide the cards and leave the accounts open to keep from negatively impacting my credit score?",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on whether or not to cosign a private student loan,"My sister needs to take out a $9,000 private student loan for her summer semester. She has maxed our her federal aid, and does not have the money to pay for the remainder. Previously, she qualified for Parent PLUS loans, but recently got married so is no longer eligible. She is applying for a private loan through Wells Fargo. Her father, who is normally the applicant on the Parent PLUS loan, did not qualify as the sole cosigner for the private loan. Her husband is also not eligible to cosign. My sister asked me if I would be willing to be a joint cosigner along with her father.

I tried to research this, but could not find much information on the subject of ""joint cosigner"" and how that might differ from just being a regular cosigner.

My situation is such that I am wary to take on this responsibility and have it negatively impact my credit score and finances. I myself still have ~$50K in student loan debt remaining (paid down from ~$80K initially), and recently purchased a house with my fiance. I also have an auto loan.

personalfinance,"I'm at a financial crossroads, and I need some advice. 61k in debt, new job, and about to get married.","Throwaway account.

I'm an airline pilot and I just started a new job with a very unpopular airline right now. I've racked up some credit card debt to get here but I've also got some significant education debt too. Here's the breakdown:

*  18k in credit card debt (8,000 at 0%, 10k at 11.99%)
*  43k in education loans ranging from 3.1% to 6.5%
* 35k in my old 401k with about 11k of that in Roth

One education loan is at 4.75% variable and has a minimum payment of $450 per month. The rest of the education loans are federal loans with a payment of $186 per month. I just used a balance transfer on 8k of my credit card debt which will be zero interest until May 2018, and I pay about $500 a month on that credit card.

My new job has an excellent retirement plan that automatically contributes 16% of my eligible earnings into my 401k. I set it up to contribution an additional 1%/1% to my 401k/roth for now just to put something in there. My salary expectations per year are: 85k/130k/150k/160k/potentially year 5 jumps to 250k

I'm getting married in September and my partner is a complete opposite of me. She has no debt, a strong 401k, an IRA, and about 100k in savings. We want to have kids and it's probable that she might stop working in a few years for that reason.

So those are the details. Now the advice part.
--
I will put about 12,000 in my 401k this year with the company 16% contribution. I am only adding 1%/1% additional to that because I think I need to focus on debt reduction. Should I pay off all this debt before increasing my contributions? I would likely be able to contribute the maximum 18k in two years or less if I pay off this debt in that time. How do I determine when the best time to start contributing more to the 401k?

Because of my salary expectations, I might reach the 401k cap in 5 years or so (225,000*.16=36,000 in company contributions plus my max contribution of 18k), when that happens, what do I do? We want to have kids and I would like to be able to have some college funds set aside. What's the best way to do that?

With marriage, I'm considering a pre-nuptial agreement because I want to protect my retirement fund as well as my wages in the future should anything happen. Can a financial planner assist me with that or do I need to find a lawyer? What considerations are important to include in a pre-nup?

personalfinance,PSLF vs. Aggressively paying down loans,"Hi everyone, I wanted to hear some advice from the community on my  current student loan situation.  (also posted on r/studentloans)

Basically (long story short): 


26 y/o with the following:

* Student loan debt: $156,000 (all federal)
* Average interest rate: 6%
* Minimum payment (on REPAYE): $700

I currently pay $1400 extra each month after careful budgeting for a total of $2100 each month. 

I recently however just found out that I do qualify for PSLF. The idea of only paying $700 and saving an $1400 dollars each month sounds great and would really help my financial situation.

Two Options:

1. I continue to pay $2100 a month with very little savings each month. (I already have a 3 month emergency fund.) I am projected to pay a total of $198,000 will have paid my total loans in about 7.5 years.
2. I only pay $700 a month, while saving $1400 a month. I would pay a total of roughly $100,000 at the end of 10 years, and would have about $150,000 forgiven then.

The 1st option would be hard as I would have very little savings for about 8 years, and it would be hard for me to do things like pay for a wedding/buy a house. 

The 2nd option also relies on the fact that PSLF would be grandfathered in for those already in it, if it were to be taken away. The idea of still owing $150k at the end of 10 years also makes me sick, were PSLF not to work out for some reason. However, I would have a much better quality of life as I would be able to save, and do many of the things I am putting off until I pay off my debt. 

What would you do??

Any thoughts, advice, input would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Prioritizing credit card debt versus an investment account,"I'm trying to help my girlfriend navigate her debt situation.

At the same time, she has about $15,000 in old credit card debt she is chipping away at.

Our first impression was to liquidate this investment and buy down this credit card debt as much as possible, as that CC interest rate is much higher than expected returns of an investment account.  Is that the right move?

And regarding the $8K in unrealized gain, what kind of capital gains tax should we expect on this?  If we take a hit upon liquidating the account, about how much debt would she be able to buy down?",finance
personalfinance,[Help] Savings Prioritization &amp; Long Term Planning,"I bring in 90k gross (29yo). Spouse (30yo) has been unemployed for less than a month and has a promising second interview this weekend. Once employed again, spouse stands to bring in around 40k at the low end for a combined income of 130k. No kids (yet).

CURRENT SAVINGS:
15k in our liquid emergency fund. Currently able to live off my salary alone.

We also have $6200 in a 0.75% APY online savings account earmarked for a honeymoon trip (and given to us specifically for that purpose), but we *may* be open to using this money elsewhere.

We only have about $18k in retirement, all in a Roth IRA. I just became eligible for my company's traditional 401(k), which offers matching up to 50% up to 6% of my salary, but the vesting schedule is 0% in year 1, 20% in year 2... up to 100% in year 6. I work remotely and don't intend to change jobs, but I also can't predict the future. Currently putting in only 6% of my salary a year.

DEBT:
We have $18,650 in student loans left at 6.125%. Currently only paying minimums.

Also paying off $1680 on a 0% interest CC. Monthly payment ($90) easily fits in budget right now, but does take that money out of our cashflow.

GOALS:
Save for retirement (65 for me, spouse does not mind working until physically unable). Have comfortable 6 months of expenses in our e-fund. Pay off student loan. Save up for 20% down payment on a $300k house ($60k). Eventually buy a (used) car (we currently share a 20 year old sedan).

We are on a HDHP and can open an HSA if we want (not provided by employer). I used to love having some cushion in an HSA, but we burned through that due to spouse's dental needs. Eventually would like to contribute here too, but this would be lower on the priority list for me.

PLANNING:
This is where I could use input. We have about $1760/month available for savings goals. That number will go up ($2300+) once spouse is employed again, and possibly again in January when our lease is up if we find a cheaper place.

First, I'd like to bump our e-fund up to $20k (will take 3 months at current savings rate). As the primary earner, we would need to use savings to get by if I lost my job. If you think I'm being silly here and our current $15k is sufficient, please tell me.

After that, I was planning to aggressively tackle the student loans. We could knock these out in less than year (even assuming spouse is still unemployed)... but only if I continue to put a measly 6% of my annual salary into retirement.

Spouse's parents also have $7200 that was not needed for my spouse's schooling invested in a 529. We could withdraw that money to put toward my loans, but they are an unqualified expense so we would owe state and federal taxes as well as a 10% penalty. Or we could leave this money invested and use (tax-free and without penalty) for our children one day.

Should we cash out the 529 to put toward the loans, or leave it? Is it more important for us to bump up our retirement contributions to 15% given our ages, and put whatever is left over toward the student loans? Or is it better to get these loans off the table ASAP and then throw 15 or 20% of each of our salaries into retirement? 

Should I look into paying off the $1680 CC debt with one month's worth of savings so I can free up that $90/month for either retirement or student loan repayment? Not sure if the trade-off there is worthwhile...

Even if we knocked out e-fund goal, student loans and put 15% toward retirement over the next 2 years, we're not looking at having a 20% down payment for at least 3.5 to 4 years -- and that's assuming we stick with our one 20yo car for that long.

My hope is to be debt-free and own a home before having kids (although emotionally we are ready now!) -- but I also appreciate that our ages are a factor when family planning, so we are on a bit of a timeline.

I worked on Saturdays and during school holidays for about four years before coming to university, and that money, along with birthday/xmas/whatever else, means I've accumulated ¬£6k which at the moment is just sitting in a 1-year savings account, and isn't earmarked for any kind of fees.

I have the option of taking another ¬£9k for my tuition and ¬£3.5k for living costs + accomodation (which my parents will supplement) but is this a good idea? Would I be better off just paying the tuition now and living off my savings (my parents would still help out with rent costs). 

My financial knowledge is rather lacking (the internship is a technology one) but I've read that the interest rates for these loans are going up and up so I can't see any reason to take the loan, but I'm really not sure - it doesn't seem a very 'student thing to do' to not take the laon, although I realise the vast majority aren't able to and I'm very fortunate to be in this position.

* $66K in a regular, old savings account to which we add about $1K every month (Essentially our downpayment fund)

* $11K in index funds to which we add ~$5K every six months

* Both contribute 10% of bi-weekly paychecks to 401K, but could potentially ratchet that rate down in order to ease burden of mortgage payment or increase savings for downpayment

personalfinance,What is an effective method to my various student loan debt?,"I'm simply just trying to throw money at my loans, but needing guidance on how to effectively do it the best possible way. I have two student loan service providers that took care of my finances through college, I'll call them Provider A and Provider B. What I had been doing was throwing down an extra $500/month on top of one specific loan to knock it out. Once paid off, I snowball that monthly payment into the next loan that I choose to tackle next.  
  
What I'm just not able to grasp is which direction should I go... Do I consolidate everything into a lump? Do I continue leaving providers separated and snowball monthly payments into the next loan? More specifically, what should my order of operation be to eliminate individual loans, if going this route ?  
  

I know the best method is of course getting rid of higher interest first, but if I can knock out the loans that are almost paid off, shouldn't I do that first ? 
  
Thanks a lot ahead of time for any insight someone may be able to provide !

personalfinance,(POR): Credit - Do small amortizations or one only?,"Hi there,
Summarized story: Parents got divorced with a house together. My mother can't work and only have an invalidity pension, so I made a (consumption) credit in my name, witch has a high interest rate (12,5%), of 15.000 EUR, because my mother couldn't do it. Was the only way to don't loose the house.

Question: I still have 11.800 EUR to pay over the next 6 years, but I managed to save some money (about 5.000 in the moment). My question is: Should I go to the bank and give them my savings to reduce the credit or should I let my savings grow til I can finish with it?

Quick note: Anticipate amortizations have only a fee of 0,5%, with a maximum of 50 EUR.

investing,Washington Post: Now nearly as many Marijuana Users as there are Tobacco,"&gt; More than half of American adults have tried marijuana at least once in their lives, according to the survey. Nearly 55 million of them, or 22 percent, currently use it ‚Äî the survey defines ‚Äúcurrent use‚Äù as having used marijuana at least once or twice in the past year. Close to 35 million are what the survey calls ‚Äúregular users,‚Äù or people who use marijuana at least once or twice a month.

&gt; Those numbers are larger than what we see in some other surveys. A Gallup poll released last year found that more than 33 million adults identified as ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù marijuana users, although it didn't specify a time frame the way this survey did. The latest federal survey on drug use found about 33 million adults used marijuana in the past year, considerably lower than the Marist poll's 55 million figure.

&gt; But those federal numbers are from 2015, while the Marist poll was conducted last month. Considering four more states have legalized marijuana since the federal survey was done, attitudes on use may have changed enough that more are comfortable admitting their use to a survey.

&gt; Survey mode is another potential factor: The Marist poll was done via phone, while the federal survey involved interviewers speaking with people in their homes. Considering marijuana remains fully illegal at the federal level, people may simply be more comfortable admitting their use to a voice at the end of a phone line than a representative of the federal government.

&gt; [Regardless, 55 million people is a staggering number. It would mean that there are nearly as many marijuana users as there are cigarette smokers (59 million).](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/19/11-charts-that-show-marijuana-has-truly-gone-mainstream/)

personalfinance,Question about avalanche method with multiple debts at same interest rate,"One of those high student loan guys here. So I think I'm in a position to do the avalanche method, but I have a question about the avalanche method on a deeper mathematical level. My loans are the following:

I have 6 massive loans from 3 years of law school
2 of them are about 25k at 7.21%
4 are 20k at 6.21%

Then about 10 other small undergrad loans ranging from a couple hundred to a couple thousand with like 3% interest rates. 

I got a good job starting at 75k with bonuses and luckily will be able to live with family with no bills whatsoever for a while. So I will have a couple thousand a month to put towards loans so what I am wondering is, is do I pay 10 minimum payments of $50 ($500) and then use the other say $2000 on one big 7% loan or both big 7% loans?

I feel like the whole point of avalanche is to ignore all loans except one, but at the same time should I treat the two big loans at the same interest rate as one loan? But this sounds like it'd take me longer to pay them off and thus mathematically cost more interest. On the other hand if I'm ignoring the other big one it might just be getting unduly large with as much interest as principal. I just have no idea how to figure this out mathematically.

Really my question boils down to Federal/State/FICA tax, in terms of what my monthly take home would be - followed by what the tax refund would be at the end of the year. I have a family of 3, with a single dependent child. We also do a fair amount of charitable giving, which is usually doesn't come back until tax returns.

Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Financial planning for higher-income young couple - Student Debt/Law School/Cars,"My wife and I are 26. She makes 120,000 a year. ($100,000 salary + usually large bonus at end of year) I currently make $65,000. We currently manage to save about $3,000 to $5,000 per month and we both have credit scores over 800. 


However - I am going leave my job and go to law school this fall full-time. I will work part-time too, but at about $15-20 an hour. We are relocating to a new and much-cheaper city, where she can work remotely and still make the same salary. Rent will be quite a lot cheaper, but our new city will not be walkable and we will each need cars. Our new budget will probably leave us with about $1,500 leftover each month after expenses. (Not including law school tuition). 

**Assets**
We currently have $55,000 in checking savings. That should grow close to $70,000 by fall. 
I have $16,000 in 401k, wife has $50,000 in 401k and $10,000 in a Roth IRA. 

**Debts**
$42,000 in student loans from undergrad. Half federal/half private. Interest rates range from 3% to 6%. 


**Upcoming costs**

* Tuition $21,000 per year. Hopefully I can find lucrative summer work, but lets just plan on that cost for three years. 
* Will need to buy two cars this fall. Let's say we want to spend $20k total between the two of them. 

**Long Term**

* Will potentially have kids in then next 3-5 years, pending any accidents.
* Could look into purchasing a home in our new city after a year of renting. We intend to live there for the next 3-5 years and maybe even longer depending on where I find a job. I imagine our price range for our first home would be $200-$350k.

**Questions**

1) How should I pay for the $21,000 tuition bill for this fall? Cash? The University has offered a $20,000 federal loan at 5.5% interest and 1% origination fee. Shop around private lenders?

2)  How should we pay for the cars? Cash or financing? I've seen some local dealers offering 0% financing for 5 years - would be stupid to not do that, right?

3) How should we address our current student loan debt? Be aggressive and erase it ASAP? Consolidate? We had been aggressive and paid off $30,000 of 6% interest student loans in the past few months before we decided on school and the move.

4) We've met with two financial advisors - both with somewhat contradictory advice. One suggested to use $30,000 of savings to aggressively pay off all student debt over 5% and try to pay tuition with cash (trying to get debt-free ASAP) --- while the other suggested taking a loan for this year's tuition and putting about $30,000-$40,000 in in a mutual fund like Vanguard and save as an option for emergencies/downpayment on a home.

If I sell, my company pays all closing costs/commissions and gives me 2% of selling price as an incentive for me to move. If I rent the place out, they will pay me about $350-$400/month for house maintenance. The rent is likely to be about $2600-$2700.

I do love the house and if I wasn't moving, I would have continued to live here. The other factor is that when the company moves me back in 2-3 years, they may send me to a completely different city and I am not sure if I will still love my area 4-5 years from now. 

If I sell, I will invest the amount in a Vanguard index fund. The overall life goal is to be financially independent in about 5-6 years and I am trying to decide which option helps me get there quicker.

personalfinance,"Consolidated 30/51k in student loans. That extra 21k is killing my income, how do I refinance it/consolidate without a cosigner?","Long story, I know. But I could really use some help.

I currently make ~30k/year, so I believe that's why I was unable to consolidate any more than I did, back in November. 
So far the 30k of consolidation is at 4.8%, while the other 21k is split between two:

One is 8,500 at 8.75%, ~$97/month

The other is 12,500 at 6.75%, next month's payment will be ~$195...I'm not sure if it will continue at that rate, but last month's payment was only $20, and before that $0 since January (when the consolidation went through). So it's been all over the place.

Those two still have my cosigner's name on them, and will until at least a year since I've been paying them off, but that's not the important part. The issue is the interest accruing every month, and the ridiculous monthly payments I have to make. I feel like they would be much more doable at a lower rate. I mean, the past three months I have been pulling in $2,000/month after taxes (and that's working nearly 50 hours/week), but pile on the $300 from the high interest loans, plus $300 from the consolidated loans, federal loans on an Income-based payment of $125, my $300 rent, gas, food, car insurance, and that only nets $400 back a month, and that's if I eat relatively meanially. I know I could probably save $100 more if I ate ramen all the time, but, I mean...C'mon, a guy's gotta have his burgers, right?

My hours are going to be significantly cut over the summer (my 2 jobs are heavily dependent on the college kids) and I'll be happy to break even for the second half of May, June, July, and the first half of August. Once August hits, I'll be saving $200/month on an amazing housing deal I'm getting through a friend. But still, with all this in mind, I'm a little stressed. It seems like no matter how many hours I pick up at work, I'm always falling behind. I have a decent emergency fund built up, to the tune of ~5k, and I need to keep saving if I'm eventually going to get a reliable car. I'm looking at an auction car that's going to be put up soon.  Hopefully I can nab it for less than $3k. It's an '05, but only has 50k miles on it, so it would be much better than my current '98, 195k car, where things are threatening to fall off, and I'm fairly sure it'll cost at least $3k for all the repairs if it were to happen. 

To those of you who are saying 'try to get a better job,' ...I'm trying. I know im a grad, and that should amount to at least 40-50k, but not where I live, not at my level of education. (and no, I'm not moving. Seriously, a $100/month rent payment?) ...5 applications are currently out right now, with about 3 more that I know of that are opening up soon. So, yeah. I'm trying :P

So I guess, after writing this long-winded sob story about my current predicament, the short question is, does anyone here know how I can consolidate, or.otherwise refinance, the remaining 21k that have kind of ridiculous interest rates, even though 30k is already only in my name? A cosigner is out of the question, due to him just not wanting to. Teaching me a valuable life lesson, I guess (this time the value can actually be calculated). Oh well, so be it. I made mistakes, I won't lie. I just feel like I could be saving an additional $100/month if I could only reduce the loans' rates to something more manageable. Any help would be appreciated. Hell, a ""Don't worry, things will work out!"" Would help too. Are there any additional ways I can save money, aside from cutting food costs? I already only go out to eat like once or twice a month.

Ripple,BBVA uses Ripple to Make International Payments in Seconds,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-20/bbva-taps-blockchain-to-make-international-payments-in-seconds

BBVA is a BIG Spanish bank.

""BBVA plans to use Ripple‚Äôs distributed ledger offering to provide corporate customers a quicker and cheaper way to pay overseas suppliers and execute other international transactions, said Alicia Pertusa, head of the lender‚Äôs Digital Transformation in Investment Banking unit. Processing payments on Ripple costs, on average, 81 percent less than the correspondent banking network that‚Äôs been used to send payments around the world for decades, according to the company.

Ripple also lets companies track their payments like a FedEx package and see precisely how much it will cost to complete the transfer. The current method, which relies on the 40-year-old Swift messaging system, is incapable of providing either of these services. It‚Äôs also too rudimentary to convey details on what payments are for. This dearth of data has forced companies to maintain costly accounting operations to reconcile their overseas transactions.""",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or buy rental property?,"Hi,

I am unsure about the best financial move to make. Please help.

I have $5500 left in student loans with a monthly payment of $118. The interest rate on this loan is 6.8%

I found a deal on a condo that I can rent out that would net at minimum $300 per month in profit. (This is after mortgage, taxes, pmi, water, hoa)

I have no other debts and roughly $7500 in savings.

Should I buy the condo to add an asset to my portfolio, or should I pay off the student loan to get rid of the debt?

Thanks Redditors

***Edit: more details


Here's my thought process and it could be wrong...

If I buy an asset that returns more than the cost of the loan payments per month, the loan is effectively null. The asset pays for it, and then after the 4-5 years when that loan is payed off, I have a bigger revenue stream.

I feel a sense of urgency to make this decision now because I feel that this particular property is a steal for the area it's in and the numbers look good. It won't last long. 

I don't want to miss this deal if it ends up being good. 

I really want to know if this train of thought is flawed. 

As far as emergency fund, etc, I make enough and my other bills are low enough to replenish the savings within 6 months if I had to.

My goal is to semi-retire within a few years. Part of my plan to get there is to aggressively buy properties with good cash flow, even though I don't have a ton of capitol. These are turn key places. 

I'm entirely boot strapped and I don't ask family for money, etc, but if worse came to worse (which is hasn't every yet) I could ask for help from my support system. 




***update: 

Thanks for all the feedback. I think I'm going to pass on the property and pay off the student loan. 

Will revisit buying more properties once I liquidate some other investments, save more and can set aside some good savings from other ventures. 

Also, thanks for the /r/financial independence sub recommendation. Lots of great info that aligns with my goals.",finance

personalfinance,A Few Early Stage Home Buying Questions,"Hi all. I'm toying with the idea of buying a home in the Fall. I'm 30 and I want to settle down for the next 8-10 years.

Here are my questions:

1: When applying for a loan, I see that you need two bank statements. Do lenders also want credit card statements? I pay almost everything with two credit cards (which I pay off every month). Or do they just want to see how much cash I have?

2: I read you shouldn't buy a house more than 3x your salary. Is that number the total home price or the total amount of the mortgage? 

Rough Example:
55k Salary = Get a home for 165k or less 
Vs. 
55k Salary = Get a home for 200k with 20% down leaving a 160k mortgage

3: Has anyone had any experience with the Massachusetts One Mortgage for first-time homebuyers? You can get a PMI-free 30 yr mortgage, even when putting down less than 20%. http://www.mhp.net/one-mortgage/why-one

I know this isn't ideal, but there may be a situation where I like a house but can only afford 12-15% down without wiping out my emergency fund.

I'm assuming this program will offer slightly higher interest rates, so I may not use it in the end.

Still exploring all the options. I have no debts. 800ish credit score, single, no kids. I have a 55k salary with decent benefits. I have a good chunk of money saved for a down payment and emergency fund.

Thanks in advance for your help. I love personalfinance and I check it everyday!",finance

financialindependence,The pursuit of FIRE through a career in sales - how to make it happen.,"So, bit of an overdue post on my end. I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5axeh5/there_are_many_viable_career_paths_outside_of/) about 5 months ago while bored one day and wanting to make a case for sales. I got a *ton* of people messaging me about a variety of questions on how to get into the field, if I had encountered this or that in my job, etc. Here I'll try and address some of the ways of breaking in, what you can expect, etc. Hopefully you guys find it informative as I really feel like sales is an underappreciated career that can absolutely take you on a quick journey to FIRE if you play your cards right.

To start with, I'll make a quick recap of why sales can be an absolutely awesome field. Keep in mind this entire post is about *outside/field sales*, so other jobs like call centers/inside sales do not exactly align. Let's start with what everyone is most interested in:

1) **Salary potential**. This can and does vary tremendously by industry, who you are selling to, experience, and the sales role (hunter vs. account manager - I will expand on this later). Interestingly enough, geography doesn't seem to play a huge role in pay from my experience. Great if you live in the Midwest, unfortunate if you live in the Bay Area. Here is a very quick snippet of jobs I see posted by recruiters on my linkedin. I work in medical sales, so they're obviously skewed to that industry:

http://imgur.com/a/3Yen7

As you can see, even in just a few postings, there is a lot of variety in what you can expect for pay. Some have high bases of 100-150k, mixed with a low commission of ~50k. Some have a low base of 50-60k, but higher commission potentials of 100k+. It's important to note here that these are legitimate recruiters, so when they say you can earn 400k+ in a job, they aren't BS'ing you like you see on those ""Earn 2k a week!!"" craigslist posts. You can earn a *lot* of money in the right job with the right approach.

Also important to keep in mind that sales typically offers perks like car allowances, meal allowances, mileage, etc. I have not paid for gas, car insurance, etc. in years. I'm in my late 20's and just crested 200k in investments + house equity, and that's due largely in part to having a decent chunk of my living expenses nullified by my jobs.

2) **Flexibility**. When I say flexibility, I mean it in regards to multiple facets of the job. Your day to day is incredibly flexible if you're in outside sales. No one is watching what you're doing under a microscope, so you can (to a reasonable degree) wake up when you want, plan your day out however you'd like, call on clients or stay in doing research/lead gen/what have you. All in all, most credible field sales jobs more or less let you treat your job as your own business and to run it as you see fit. Granted, if your sales start to fall off, someone will eventually step in and start scrutinizing what you're doing. Beyond day to day flexibility, there is a tremendous amount of flexibility in where you work (sales people are needed more or less everywhere), in the industry you work in, how much you want to earn, etc. It is unparalleled in this aspect to any other job IMO.

3) **Varying degrees of difficulty**. Sales, like any job, can be as easy or as challenging as you'd like it to be. A lot of people are scared off from sales thinking that it's a day in/day out grind, always on the hunt for the next person to shove your product down their throat, and an angry manager watching your every move. The truth is, this *can* happen, and it does happen, but you can control this to a large degree. Many industries, like pharmaceutical sales, are more of an account management position. You are not tasked with finding new business, but rather working with already established clients to grow their ordering. This is much, much, MUCH easier, and the pay often correlates. In my experience, there isn't a ton of stress in this position. The accountability of your sales is severely watered down. On the other end of the spectrum comes the ""hunter"" position. This is where you are given a territory and tasked with finding new business. This is, of course, much harder. You're taking a person that typically has little to no knowledge of your product, and convincing them to part with their hard earned money to buy it. This often comes with a great deal of pressure because it's very cut and dry how well you're doing - you often do not have a book of business that is artificially inflating what you're doing, but rather people are watching for a single sale to come in. On the positive side, earning potential in these roles can be tremendous. It's very feasible to earn 300k+ in these roles, though certainly not common, and you will not just walk into a job like that.

4) **Your background doesn't really matter**. Degree in psychology, sociology, biology, it doesn't matter. Most jobs just want to check the box that you have a 4 year degree. Other than that, it all comes down to experience. The more years you put into sales (with positive results), the more comfortable a hiring manager becomes with trusting his territory to you. The barrier to entry for sales is very low initially, though it grows quickly once you start getting into the software/device jobs.

At this point, I might as well throw in a few words about why you shouldn't be discouraged from a career in sales:

1) It isn't necessarily high pressure. Not all sales jobs come with tough targets and a boss that breathes down your neck. Some do. Often times this just comes down to picking the right industry, type of job, or getting lucky with a good manager.

2) You do not have to be a superstar to do well. Yes, those 500k+ jobs selling SaaS to F100 companies are typically reserved for the people murdering their quotas 10 years in a row. You can be a very average, consistent performer and still make six figures in sales. Trust me.

3) Not everyone thinks you're a sleezeball in sales, not all managers are assholes, and not all companies will toss you after missing a quota. Some will, but in my experience companies tend to be more forgiving than not.

At this point you may be thinking ""Great, you can earn a lot of money and it can be a flexible job. How do I get into it?"". Or, you might be thinking I'm full of hot air, sales is the worst career choice one can make, and you're already preparing a snarky comment to make. Suit yourself. If I were starting over, this is how *my* approach would be to taking off this in career. This is certainly not *the way* to do it, and I'm sure other people have different/better ideas.

* First, be real with yourself and decide if this is something you want to do (and more importantly, can do). I'm an introvert, I'm not a smooth-talking/beautiful Jake Gyllenhaal from whatever that pharma movie he was in, and whatever stereotypical salesman things you can come up with. But, I am completely comfortable interacting with customers, taking a beating from some of them, and trudging along. If you cannot fathom the idea of walking into a business and pitching to people you do not know, or cold-calling someone on the phone (depending on the job), this probably isn't a career for you. You absolutely need to be comfortable conversing with strangers in what can sometimes be an adversarial-feeling conversation (you/your business vs. them/their business). Not only do you need to be comfortable with this, but you need to have some sort of drive. No one is watching you punch in each day, and I personally know of reps who literally work 1 hour a day. They will eventually fizzle out. You need to have the drive to push yourself to actually make calls, prospect, etc. This isn't like an office job where your physical presence forces you to engage in the job in some way.

* Identify what industry you want to work in, and what type of sales you want to do. I would emphatically suggest B2B (business to business) sales. This is where you, representing your business, sell to other businesses. This is in contrast with something like B2C (business to consumer), like car sales where you sell to an individual. I think there is often a lot more credibility and money in B2B, but you'll have to make that choice yourself. Beyond that, do you want to work in medical and sell to doctors/hospitals? Do you want to sell software? Do you want to sell mechanical components and solutions to factories? There are countless options here, and I would really recommend going into something you personally find interesting. Healthcare is really difficult, especially with the ever-limiting access reps have to clinics, but I personally find interest in it and it keeps me engaged. There is money in all industries, but software/tech/medicine are what I understand to be the heavy hitters. On the other hand, my friend sells sensors to factories for their robotics/automation processes, and he far out-earns me. There is simply money in mostly any industry, so if you can find one you personally enjoy, all the better IMO.

* Once you have an idea of what you want to get into, you'll need to accept what is often the worst part of a sales career - Time to grind it out in an entry-level job. The harder it is, the more hiring managers will want you later. Jobs in payroll software, copier sales, yellowbook ad sales, etc. that really require grit and grind to do well are absolutely loved by hiring managers. If you can grind it out for a year or two and survive/do well in it, you can walk into a six figure software/device/what have you sales job afterward. Throughout this job, save emails from clients/colleagues that praise you, any awards/sales numbers showing you exceeding quota, etc. If you do your job well, people *will* notice. There are so many sales reps out there that do not follow up, ignore customer requests, etc. If you set yourself apart and act with integrity and competency, clients/colleagues will take note and comment on it. Absolutely save those correspondences.

I never did the grind job and instead found an entry-level sales position in healthcare. This job isn't nearly as enticing to hiring managers as those copier sales jobs are, but it's a viable start as well, and doesn't require nearly as much of a grind. Look for things like ""associate sales rep"" positions to identify them as entry-level. In these roles, it's realistic to expect ~30-50k base salaries and 5-15k in commission. I would highly suggest working your ass off here to meet and exceed quota as this will be the foundation for your next job. Not only that, but in these jobs you often have a mediocre product competing with countless competitors, so you learn a lot about the fundamentals of sales.

I would suggest looking on either linkedin or indeed for these positions. Once you find them, send over your resume and cover letter to the hiring manager. Your cover letter should offer a compelling reason for why you want to be in sales, what motivates you (think competition, money, being in control of your destiny, etc.) and how you'll kick ass in the territory. Highlight your strengths and why you can succeed in the role. Above all, be PERSISTENT. I have gotten job offers for jobs that I thought I was being ignored about, merely because I continued to bug the hiring manager (tactfully).

Once you have an interview lined up, be ready for the song and dance. You need to demonstrate that you speak well, are not afraid to engage in conversation, and will ask for the job. Seriously, at the end of the interview, ask them for the job. If they won't commit to it (many won't), ask them if there's anything about you or your experience that will make them hesitate to hire you. Often times they will say they don't have any hesitations, so ask for a commitment to move you on throughout the process. If they do have hesitations, address them one by one and then go for a commitment to move forward. Do this and you will outdo 99% of applicants for these types of jobs. Sometimes, the manager will run you through a shit test and tell you he doesn't think you have the experience or whatnot. Do not let this discourage you, but rather take it as an opportunity to show them how you're will to fight an objection. Often times, they just want to see how you react to stress/objections. After the interview, follow up with a brief thank you email and again ask to move forward. Do all of these things and you will be a standout applicants, guaranteed (okay, maybe not guaranteed, there are a multitude of factors involved here, but this will help tremendously).

* Engage recruiters throughout your job. I'm going to assume you followed my suggestions at this point and got the job. Congrats. Now it's time to build up your network. I leverage the hell out of linkedin. I have not applied to a single job in years, but rather wait for recruiters to reach out to me about jobs I might be interested in. I started out with a ~30k salary, now I'm making about 90k [base + commission] within a few years, and I'm currently interviewing for a 90k base + 40k or more commission job. This is all from recruiters. Add them on linkedin, and make sure to keep your linkedin up to date, especially with awards and numbers of how well you're doing. If you're doing your job, and doing it well, recruiters will notice and start to reach out to you about jobs.

* Once you have some interviews lined up for higher-paying jobs (and you will), this is a good time to assemble your ""brag book"" and plan. Take those emails full of praise that you've been saving, your quota-busting numbers, etc. and organize them into a nice book of sorts. Also include a plan for how you would attack the territory for whatever job you're applying for, and make it specific to that job (managers will roll their eyes in disgust if you give them a generic plan). Take this book to FedEx, bind it up nicely and make it presentable. This will distinguish you by far from your competitors. 

* Within 1-2 years of your initial grind job, you should realistically be able to secure a job with a base of 50-80k and a total OTE (on target earnings) of 80k+. Yes, within TWO years of getting into sales - I do not think many careers can offer that kind of increased earning potential, personally. I am, admittedly, below my potential earnings after several years in sales, but I like my job for the most part and mostly ignore the fact that I'm paid well below what I could get (though I am now interviewing).

Once you have established yourself with a few years within an industry, you are more or less set. As I like to say, once you're in, you're in. I have a few years of medical sales experience now and I get recruiters asking me to apply for jobs on the regular. I suspect most people fizzle out of sales because they don't respect the job, or are frankly lazy, and it makes the pool of qualified applicants for higher-end sales jobs increasingly smaller. Great for us, bad for the hiring managers, and it gives you a lot of leverage.

If you're diligent about networking, doing your job, and persisting for better jobs, I don't think it's at all unreasonable to estimate your earning potential can go from (total earnings) of 50k -&gt; ~80k -&gt; 120k+++ within a few years. Some people are absolute hustlers and will get there faster. Other people are like me and are content with a solid salary and a skewed work to life balance, and will accept being in the middle of the pack. The choice is yours to make.

Feel free to reach out with any questions, why you disagree with me, whatever you'd like. I'll try and answer what I can, but do keep in mind I'm still relatively green in sales on the whole.",finance

personalfinance,Bonus directed to 401k still taxed (US; ARK),"(In the voice of Joe Friday: ""The dollar amounts have been changed to protect the poor""...lol)


So I recently received a bonus from my job, of which I directed 90% of to my traditional 401k, with the other 10% going to my normal direct deposit account. When the amount I expected to go into my 401k was less than expected, I started researching. My company, which uses ADP to crunch all the numbers, tried to explain the following. 


They explained that while the feds don't tax bonuses that go into my 401k, that SSI, Medicare, and the State (Arkansas) still do. So that meant that the entire bonus was taxed 6.2% for SSI, 1.45% for Medicare, and 0.8% for Arkansas tax (even the HR guy couldn't explain how the data processors got that number). This should have left me with 2.8% of the original bonus, which I expected to be highly taxed for fed taxes, as most bonuses are, going to my direct deposit...but instead the whole amount was contributed to federal taxes. The numbers add up, but I don't understand the logic, especially since this is not how my 401k contributions are taxed on my bi-weekly pay.


Here is the way the bonus was paid out (in percentages):

(Bonus: 100%)


401k contribution: 88.77%

Fed Tax:2.80%

SS Tax: 6.20%

Medicare Tax: 1.45%

AR State Tax: 0.78%


To me, it would have made sense for the remaining 2.8% of the bonus (which ADP processed as federal tax)to be federal taxed at 25%, making the fed tax amount 0.7% of the original bonus and my direct deposit being 2.1% of the original bonus. 


Can someone explain or verify?

I'm wondering if I should a) max out my Roth IRA, b) aggressively pay off student loans, or c) put it towards saving for big future purchases (hopeful wedding, honeymoon and down payment on a house within the next 10 years).

My e-fund is *almost* complete at 10k. It should be totally complete by June 1st.

personalfinance,Help with upside down auto loan! (US),"Sob story: About a year and a half ago my wife's car crapped out, and mine wasn't too far behind. I cycling almost exclusively nowadays so we decided to trade them both in and go down to a single car.  

We shopped around briefly, neither of us had a much experience with buying or financing vehicles in the past. We ended up buying a used 2013 Toyota Prius with 50k miles on it. Neither of us have great credit, we ended up with a 18.99% interest rate, which was horrible but we knew that we would be planning on refinancing later on down the line.  

So the stats at the beginning were as follows:  
18.99% APR  
16k financed amount  
11k finance charge(&gt;.&lt;)  
1300.00 down payment  
28.5k total sale price  

Yikes! 16 months later we've been able to pretty consistently payed $400 on our $330 payments and so now we're sitting at:  

6.3k paid on the loan  
13.5K balance  
89k miles on the car (I know I should by cycling more)  

So I know my loan is upside down by a fair amount, our credit scores have gone up a good amount since we bought the car but not enough to refinance outright ourselves. Thankfully we have family with incredible credit (800s) that having seen us make these payments is willing to help us by cosigning.   

We've tried once through BoA and still got declined due to my poor credit history (irresponsibility when I was younger and studentloans were defaulted for a few years)  

My question:  
What do you guys think is the best option for us at this time? Where can we find a bank that will refinance for us and give us a better rate? Should we just ask fam to open a personal loan and pay them? Are we just f***'d?

This post describes how I do what I will call ""conservative/small-scale/no-fee/no-risk"" churning. Maybe an even better description would be simply ""maximizing cashback rewards"". I'll start by describing what I was looking for when I was applying to cards:

- No annual fees
- No complicated miles, points, or redemption structures
- No ""first 3 months"" sign up targets to hit

The true churners over at /r/churning will tell you I'm not really playing the game correctly. I admit that I am not. My scheme is a lower-risk (of messing up your spending math and losing money) and lower reward scheme because I focus on straight-cashback % cards instead of cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which have high yearly fees ($450) but also high rewards, IF you can hit the monthly spend (you can get $750 of travel once in the first year if you spend $4,000 in the first 3 months). My list of 3 ‚Äòwants‚Äô listed above preclude me from ‚Äògoing big‚Äô on churning, and for me, that is ok. If you are willing to take on the risks you can save more money. But for my peace of mind, I decided not to go this route.

My route is a bit more conservative and predictable. Here‚Äôs my card setup:

- First Card: Citi Double Cash = 2% back on everything. This was my first cc and has the highest straight cashback % (year over year) of any card currently on market (unless you are a USAA member in which case they have a 2.5% card I believe). This was my 'everyday spending' card.
- Second Card: Amex Blue Cash Everyday = 3% back on grocery stores. I use this card ONLY at the grocery store! This works for me because it has no annual fee and I know I‚Äôm getting 1% more (not a lot, but every cent counts!) for food than if I used the Citi card. There‚Äôs also an Amex Blue Cash Preferred card which gives you 6% back on groceries, but carries a $95 yearly fee. I did the math, and at my grocery spending, I save more by forgoing the yearly fee and taking the lower 3% rate. If you have a family or just have higher food costs, the Preferred option might make sense for you.
- Third Card: Amazon Prime Store Card = 5% back on all Amazon purchases. I‚Äôm a Prime subscriber and I get lots of stuff from Amazon, so this was a no-brainer to me. It gets me 3% higher cash back than the Citi card, and has no annual fee. I only use this on Amazon. I don‚Äôt even carry the physical card around since the card is saved on my Amazon account. There are other cards that will give you 5% back on Amazon year round (as opposed to only part of the year with rotating category cards like Chase Freedom or Discover It), like the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card. That Visa will give you 5% on Amazon as well as 2% at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores, but I already had the 2% Citi card so I wouldn‚Äôt have necessarily needed the Visa. 
- Fourth Card: Discover It Miles Card = 3% back (first year only, 1.5% after that). Recently got approved for this. This one is slightly more interesting because it is technically a miles card, which was something I was initially trying to avoid. The way it works is you get 1.5x miles per dollar spent. 100 miles can be redeemed for a $1 statement credit. This gives you a rate of 1.5% cash back. This wouldn‚Äôt have made any sense for me, since I already get 2% if I use the Citi card, BUT Discover offers a first year cashback match. At the end of 12 months they double every mile you‚Äôve earned. And these miles can be redeemed for statement credit, so functionally, this is a 3% back on everything card for the first year. And with no annual fee, it made sense for me to get this card and literally only use it for one year. 

So the Discover will be my ‚Äúeveryday card‚Äù (replacing the Citi for 1 year), and then I‚Äôll have my ‚Äúgrocery card‚Äù and my ‚ÄúAmazon card‚Äù. Perhaps by the time my first year cashback match runs out for Discover, there will be a new 3% card on the market from some other company that I can apply for. Or I‚Äôll just go back to the 2% Citi.

The only expense I cannot currently pay for using cc‚Äôs is my rent (paid directly to my roommate), so I figure that for all my non-rent spending, I can average somewhere north of 3% overall cashback in the next year. The way I like to think about this is ‚Äúone tiny little hedge against inflation with no risk‚Äù. If the Fed targets a 2% annual inflation rate, I can keep up (in the spending realm at least) through my credit card rewards. And I never have to worry about ‚Äúwhich card should this charge go on?‚Äù or ‚Äúif I lose my job, will I still take the same number of flights this year? Will I still be able to hit that $4,000 spend in the next 3 months? What if I fly less next year, making the yearly fee not worth it?‚Äù etc. No annual fees and no spend targets helps me with that.

Not mentioned are the other ‚Äúthrow-in‚Äù bonuses that some of these cards occasionally offer. Getting approved for the Amazon card got me a $70 Amazon gift card, I believe. Currently the Amex Blue Cash card is offering 10% back on restaurants in the first 6 months and $100 back after you spend $1,000 in purchases on the Card within the first 3 months. That spend limit would have been a bit high for me (I don‚Äôt spend $333 in groceries per month as a single) but the 10% restaurants is nice. 

Of course, you still have to be responsible with your spending. I have a high credit score (750ish) and I never carry a balance. Paying interest will wipe your yearly expected savings out in a jiffy! So be sure to set up your autopay at the end of each billing month and for goodness sakes don‚Äôt spend too much. This is all part of my CONSERVATIVE approach. If you want to maximize your cc rewards while avoiding yearly fees, spending targets that might force you to ‚Äòmanufacture‚Äô spending, and unneeded complexity, a scheme like the one I‚Äôve got might help you too. 

p.s. - I‚Äôm always on the lookout for ways to optimize! So If you know of any good ideas on what my ‚Äònext card‚Äô should be, let me know! I‚Äôll wait some months of course because too many applications in a short time is no good for credit scores.",finance
personalfinance,New job : is my scheme to spare myself student loan payments a smooth move?,"I finally got a real job.  73k a year, in field, + benefits.  Unfortunately, due to decisions that seemed like good ideas at the time, I owe north of 200k in a consolidated federal student loan.  Let's just call the debt $MonopolyMoney, because the size of the number is depressing and I am never realistically going to be able to pay it.  So I've been taking classes in OMSCS online, and ""half time"" enrollment is 6 hours a semester.   

I'm of course enrolled in Income Based Repayment, and owe something like 18 more years of payments, but up til now, that amount has been $0 since I haven't made enough money.  Now that I have a RealJob, it's a real harsh on my buzz to have to pay 10% of that towards student loans.  

And my employer reimburses tuition, so tuition is free to me.  SO...if I take enough hours every semester to be considered ""half time"", I would take 4 years to finish a Master's degree and would have taken over 60 hours.  As a side note, I would essentially take every course in the entire program and thus have grad student level understanding of every single topic.  Sounds legit.  And I wouldn't have to make any student loan payments for 4 years.

$MonopolyMoney would now be a bigger number, but since I cannot ever repay it, what difference does it make?  They would just forgive more of the balance in the future, at least 22 years from now.  I would owe income taxes on that forgiveness, per current law at least, but it's still better to get more total dollars forgiven, even if you have to pay taxes on it, right?

What do you all think?  This is not an example of a debt I could practically pay by ""buckling down"" and living on ramen until it's paid off.  $MonopolyMoney is too big a number, and to be honest, I'm sick of living poor.  I want to live a little large while I'm still young enough to enjoy some of the things.",finance
personalfinance,"Refinancing student loans, while paying of part of them in a lump sum","Hi all, new to this sub so hope this isn't a question that gets raised too often...



My wife and I are trying to refinance her student loans.  Currently, she is on a poorly reviewed company, Navient, with many small loans of various interest rates, most of them over 6%.  We are looking to refinance with another company, Sofi, which seems to have a better reputation, at least from my research on the consumer financial protection bureau site.  But this question is not about the companies involved.



I'd like to pay off a lump sum of the loan, say 20K of the total 100K during this process.  Sofi recommends that I pay off the entire loan amount with them, then pay Sofi the 20K, and refinance with them again later.  I'd prefer not to have to refinance twice, and would like Sofi to pay off 80K with Navient, and then I would pay off the remaining 20K myself.  However, I'm worried that paying it off in two payments in this way, that some of the payment will be applied to ""future interest"", or some other shifty tactic that loan companies are notorious for.



So my question is this:  Should I take Sofi's advice, have them refinance the full amount from Navient, and then pay it down after?  Or should I try it my way, and let Sofi refinance a smaller amount, and pay off the Navient loan in a second transaction.  Are there any problems with doing it this way?  Or is there a third, better way to handle this?



Thanks in advance for any advice!",finance
personalfinance,New to budgets in general and /r/personalfinance specifically. I will be beginning my residency soon and wanted to submit my budget to the community for feedback. Any help/comments/feedback/suggestions are greatly appreciated!,"Hi all,  
I will be relocating to a major city soon to begin my residency training (that thing you do after med school) and am trying to get all my numbers lined up. I am new to making budgets in general and just want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything and am looking for general pointers/advice as well.
  
I've ran the numbers on my income ($52,200 annually before taxes), which comes to roughly $3,300 per month (assuming I'm taking the correct federal/state allowances). Even with fewer allowances I think my net per month would be something like $3,100, but I'm using $3,300 as my working number for now.
  
The major factor that motivated me to create a budget in the first place was the cost of living and in particular, the cost of rent, to the city I will be moving to. My big question right now is ""What can I spend on rent?"" as I look at potential places to live. Most all of the 1BR apartments I have been looking at are in the $1300-1500 range. All advice I've garnered from ""financial experts"" of the internet seem to indicate rent should be roughly 30% of income, however, this is putting me closer to 45%. I do feel somewhat conflicted in this area. On the one hand, I know that it's prudent to try to keep rent down as much as possible and I definitely have the mindset of still living a ""student's life."" However, on the other hand this is going to be a big move for me from a rural area to a rather metropolitan one and having a decent apartment has always been a priority for me from a QoL perspective. Some of that is due to bad experiences in the past with less than ideal living arrangements and I'm not saying I need excess lavishness (far from it), but when you spend a big chunk of your time at the hospital, it's nice to be able to come back to a place that allows you to unwind and decompress/you don't have to deal with the neighbor's noises/shady characters/etc. Many of the apartment communities I've been looking at do offer amenities such as gym and bundled or low-cost utilities/parking included that would help reduce my total living cost. I guess in summary, I know this is an area where there will be lots of debate and I am definitely willing and going to look into apartments that are more in the $1000 per month range (if they do in fact exist in this metropolitan area), however what I'm finding is that most are going to be more in the $1300-1500 range, which is quite a step up from what I am currently paying. I suppose I ultimately just need to do some further research in this area and see what the differences in quality would be between the two. In this vein, I am definitely open to any helpful websites for apartment hunting, as I'm currently just using good old Google Maps/Yelp/cross referencing with other websites for reviews. I currently live in a rather rural area, where a few companies control most of the apartments and you have to deal with them directly, so I‚Äôm kind of out of the loop on good websites for apartments.
  
A quick side note on the apartment issue just to give some perspective: A specific example would be my first year of med school I lived in a real shit hole of a 1BR and paid $650 per month-no windows, loud AC unit outside of my bedroom, small, etc. When a 2BR opened up in the same unit I was in, I jumped on it and it cost me $750 per month. The difference to me was well worth the extra $100. The place had windows, a view, was obviously more spacious, and I could dedicate the second bedroom to a study. I suppose it‚Äôs ultimately a cost-benefit analysis but this experience has made me think that if it‚Äôs a difference of $100/200 (and I can afford it) it‚Äôs well worth it from living in a dungeon to living in a place that makes me happy.
  
A few other points to note:
I do like the idea of putting away something like $100 a month to an emergency fund. I know this is a basic savvy-financial thing to do in general and if at all possible, I would like to begin doing this.
  
I have roughly $2,300 in credit card debt that is sitting on a 0% interest card, which I've been paying $110 a month on for some time.
  
I will have to begin repaying student loans from medical school at some point in the future (likely not until next March or so due to the grace period, however these will ultimately be in the $200-300/month range).
  
Living close to the hospital would help keep gas costs down (my current vehicle averages in the mid 20-s for MPG), and I do plan on eating a lot of meals at the hospital as well, as there is a food stipend provided. I drive a used car that is paid off, but will likely use public transportation some of the time if possible/cheaper/more convenient.
  
Anyway, here is my monthly budget as it stands currently:
  
Total Budget: $3,300  
  
Fixed Costs:  
Rent (including utilities, internet, cable, gym): 1500  
Credit Card Debt: 110  
Health Insurance (includes health, dental, vision): 166  
Auto Insurance: 100  
Emergency Fund: 100  
Cell Phone: 100  
  
Sub-Total: 2076  
[Student Loan Repayment: 300, beginning sometime around 3/2018]  
  
Variable Costs (whatever is left over from fixed costs): 1224  
Food: 750  
Gas: 150  
Entertainment: 324  
  

A final note is that I cross-referenced my budget with this budget that I found online to get a general idea about things and found that it matched mine pretty well when it came to considering categories: https://wealthkeel.com/blog/the-official-non-official-monthly-budget-for-medical-residents
  
If you've made it this far into my post, thanks so much for taking the time to read it! I know I'm probably overlooking some obvious stuff and any feedback/input/comments/suggestions are welcome as I begin this transition and next chapter of my life.
  
Thanks,

personalfinance,"50k Salary &amp; 50k in Debt: Not in the best situation, but I finally have my feet on the ground - How am I doing?","Hey all -  I've had money anxieties for some time now (you've given me general, wonderful advice before) but I finally have my ""feet on the ground"" so to speak. Despite numerous scholarships I left college with significant student loan debt ($43k) like most millennials. It took me 5 1/2 years to graduate due to some health reasons, another 6 months to find work, and a very rocky first year with a move, a couple of job switches, and a few financial time-bombs. But now I've got a life built out here, a good place to stay, a great relationship, am finally making good money (for my degree and area: $50k) - but I definitely have an uphill battle ahead of me. Would LOVE to hear your guys' two cents - so here's the breakdown:

DEBTS:

$43.5k Student Loans @ 5.25% (I've been treading water on these for the past year just paying off the interest - getting my feet on the ground, had a couple financial tough spots)

$6.2k Auto Loan @ 14% (HORRIBLE interest rate, I know! I was in a tough spot with poor credit and needed a car that could eat LOTS of miles, it's a very low mileage Accord I plan on driving for 5 years+, paid off $1.8k of the $8k total so far, 9 months in)

INCOME:

$50k Salary 

$3,030/mo Take home (I have a couple of tax exemptions, doesn't hurt me per se, I just don't get any tax return)

SAVINGS:

$2,000 Emergency Fund (Plan on growing this a bit more later this year)

$1,000 EU Trip (I know this is financially stupid and I'll get crucified for spending money so frivolously but it's happening - GF &amp; I got plane tickets for an absolute steal and they're paid for - will have full $2,000 saved by the summer)

401k (not much yet - making pretty small monthly contributions, more focused on paying down debts now)

BUDGET:

&gt;$600 Rent (20%)

&gt;$150 Bills (5% - Phone, Electricity, Gas/Utilities, Internet)

&gt;$100 Health (3% - Gym membership, regular medications, doctor's copays)

&gt;$425 Food (14% - Includes eating out &amp; Groceries - I'm a HUGE guy, I lift, I eat a LOT, but I do lots of cheap pasta &amp; beans and rice - could probably stand to cut down eating out a bit more, now do so about 2x/week)

&gt;$175 Gas (6% - I drive a lot, 30mi/45min each way, 5 days/week - my Accord is the most fuel efficient car I could find that I could also fit inside of)

&gt;$125 Insurance (4% - Includes car and renter's insurance, good, low deductible plans)

&gt;$500 Savings (17% - Currently goes towards my EU Trip, which will be done by the summer, then I'll either aim this towards a bigger E-fund, or possibly towards loans? Not sure?)

&gt;$220 Student Loans (7% - Currently making no progress here, just treading water and staying ahead of the interest)

&gt;$500 Car Payment (17% - My actual car payment is $250, since I got a big raise recently each month I make a second payment of $250 that goes directly to the principle)

&gt;$235 Left Over (Misc spending, sometimes pocket money, although I don't buy much, usually my food budget will eat some of this up and I'll dump the rest into savings - really it's just wiggle room I keep for sanity's sake)

So I'm shooting to have my car paid off by next spring or summer - after which I'll take that $500 and dump it into my Student Loan principle (in addition to my normal $220 payment). What are your thoughts? I know I'm not in the best situation and this probably isn't the best plan. Usually I try to be pretty frugal - I don't buy myself much of anything in terms of material goods or toys - and my only discretionary spending comes in the form of dinner dates or concerts, which I try not to go crazy with.

Thanks for taking a look - very open to any and all advice!",finance
personalfinance,"Brother sentenced to 9 years, quick question about credit card debt negotiation.","Hey PF,

My brother was sentenced to 9 years of federal prison last week, which will probably end up being 6-7 from now.  He has been incarcerated for the last year.  I have his power of attorney and have been dealing with his finances.

He originally had:

* 18k on one credit card
* $700 on another credit card (different bank)

We had been expecting him to file bankruptcy (fee $2200), so we haven't been paying on the cards at all over the last 3-5 months.  However, I called up his bank and was able to negotiate a 25% settlement on the 18k card, which works out to $4600, which changed the situation.  I've decided to split it with my parents, in order for him to avoid bankruptcy.  We'll also be able to recover some of that money by selling his car, which we were holding onto.

My question is regarding the other card.  I realize $700 is not much compared to $18k.  I called them up to negotiate, but really don't have as much leverage, since there's no way anyone would file bankruptcy over that amount.  They offered to settle at 70%.

My questions:

* Is it worth it to settle this one, only to save $240?
* Or should I hold out for a better offer?
* Or should we pay in full, or is it even worth dealing with the future impact for the small savings?

Thanks!",finance

Bitcoin,Interesting email from an exchange about banking developments.,"Bitcoin and Money Services Businesses (MSB) find it very difficult to open and maintain bank accounts. The global hysteria over possible venues for money laundering (unless of course you are HSBC) has caused banks globally to curtail their support of MSB clients.

Several exchanges figured out that Taiwanese banks would bank them with minimal issues. The two most well known exchanges utilising Taiwanese bank accounts are Bitfinex and OKCoin International.

The American perception of Taiwanese banks lately is that of financial institutions with lax KYC / AML procedures. Read the following excerpt from a¬†Reuters¬†article about problems with Taiwan‚Äôs Mega Financial last October.

It is the second bank branch of the state-controlled firm to run afoul of U.S. financial authorities, after its New York branch was fined $180 million for lax compliance and anti-money laundering violations in August.

Mega Financial, which has close ties to Taiwan's government, has been under scrutiny since about 200 of its customers were named in the so-called Panama Papers, a massive leak of documents from a Panamanian law firm that put the spotlight on the shadowy world of offshore companies used to avoid tax.

In order for Taiwanese banks to maintain their banking relationships in America, they must update their KYC / AML procedures for MSB clients. Unfortunately a large swath of MSB clients will be deemed too expensive to bank, and will be jettisoned.

Compliance is extremely expensive. Banks waste billions of USD a year on compliance and compliance related technology. It only serves to further protect incumbent financial institutions at the expense of small and innovative upstarts.

Bitfinex, OKCoin, and possibly other Bitcoin exchanges are affected. It may be that they have been told their accounts will not longer by active by a certain date. They are now scrambling for alternatives.

Bitfinex officially announced¬†that both USD deposits and withdrawals are halted. OKCoin International has posted a notice that all USD deposits will be refused by their banking partner in Taiwan. Many old-timers know that the suspension of fiat deposits and withdrawals heralds tough times ahead for any Bitcoin exchange.

To some traders, this feeling is all too familiar. Mt Gox's slow motion bankruptcy began in 2013 when their USD held in America was frozen. As users rushed for the exits, the Bitcoin thought to be held in custody was not there. In early 2014, Mt Gox shut its doors and filed for bankruptcy.

While traders are right to be nervous, it is not a given that Bitfinex and or OKCoin will be unable to operate. Yet, careful traders will take action. This post will examine how to get your money off the platform, and for those risk seeking traders, arbitrage opportunities that will arise during this time of stress.

Correspondent Banking

The biggest hurdle to successfully operating a Bitcoin/Fiat exchange is obtaining and maintaining a bank account. The quality of the banking relationships held by the exchange is a large success determining factor.

Most Taiwanese banks have branches throughout the Asia Pacific region. However, most do not have branches in the US. Ultimately that means that movement of USD between non-Taiwanese entities must pass through a correspondent bank in the US.

The correspondent bank is fully licensed to do business inside America, and can clear USD. Without the assistance of a correspondent bank, exchanges‚Äô Taiwanese banks cannot process USD deposits and or withdrawals for foreign entities. Given that the majority of Bitfinex and OKCoin‚Äôs customers are not Taiwanese, most if not all incoming and outgoing USD must be processed with the assistance of a correspondent bank.

Wells Fargo, The Canary in the Coal Mine

In late March, according to a lawsuit filed by Bitfinex, Wells Fargo ceased processing outgoing USD SWIFT wire transfers from Bitfinex‚Äôs Taiwanese bank accounts. Wells Fargo is the correspondent bank for the various banks Bitfinex uses in Taiwan. The lawsuit alleged that $180 million of USD was effectively frozen.

This lawsuit is one of the only public windows the community received into the struggle between Taiwan banking institutions and their American correspondent banks. A similar situation may have occurred with OKCoin, but they did not choose to fight back through a public lawsuit.

Bitfinex vs. Wells Fargo Lawsuit

Get Me Outta Here

Bitfinex and OKCoin USD IOU holders are rightfully concerned. All is not lost. There are still ways to remove funds from these platforms.

The easiest way is for users to buy Bitcoin and withdraw it. Then they can sell that Bitcoin on another platform. As more users exit via this method, the price of Bitcoin rises on Bitfinex and OKCoin relative to other exchanges. Those exiting these exchanges are pushing up the price globally.

Users can use altcoins such as Litecoin or Ether to exit as well. At the time of writing, the Bitfinex premium to buy alts with USD is similar to buying Bitcoins. Given the low liquidity in altcoins, this may not be cheaper.

Bitfinex first indicated in a¬†blog post, ¬†that users could withdraw funds via Swiss Francs (CHF) and Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). However a few days later, they¬†announced¬†that their bank refused to process any outgoing wires in any currency.

The solution now put forward is to wash funds through their lawyer's trust account. They claim that as creditors of Bitfinex, users can withdraw¬†via this method only¬†once. Those lucky enough to have domestic Taiwanese bank accounts face no issues withdrawing any fiat currency.

As of right now, OKCoin has not issued any announcements regarding the status of funds in their Taiwan bank accounts.

Arbitrage

Risk and profit seeking traders will be able to conduct arbitrage trades during this funding crunch. The trade I describe below is the most obvious.

Buy Bitcoin outside of Bitfinex.

Sell Bitcoin for USD on Bitfinex at a premium.

Withdraw HKD to your bank account from Bitfinex.

Wire the funds at your bank rate back into USD to a cheap Bitcoin/USD exchange.

Rinse and repeat.

The ability to execute this trade is predicated on the ability to withdraw HKD or another fiat currency easily and quickly from Bitfinex. Given the recent updates, this assumption is questionable. All MSBs globally face similar issues, it may be weeks if not months before Bitfinex, OKCoin, or any other affected exchange is able to establish banking relationships again.

Due to the halt of Bitcoin withdrawals in China, XBT/CNY trades at a 15% discount to Bitstamp and GDAX. Therefore the premium on exchanges where fiat cannot be withdrawn, could easily reach a similar 15% premium.

Bitcoin / HKD: Bitfinex and OKCoin‚Äôs Savior

Days after filing, Bitfinex withdrew the lawsuit against Wells Fargo. Suing a correspondent bank in America may have been lights out for Bitfinex‚Äôs current and future banking relationships. To make matters worse, it may have attracted attention to other exchanges. If Wells Fargo is blocking Bitcoin exchanges, other banks should be thinking: should we block them too?

For now, there is still some hope. For every HKD issued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority backs it with an equivalent amount of USD. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will conduct open market operations to maintain a peg between 7.75 to 7.80 USD. While the peg holds, HKD is a liquid proxy for USD. If Bitfinex and or OKCoin can launch a liquid XBT/HKD market, they can continue to effectively serve as the most liquid XBT/USD spot markets.

Clearing HKD does not require funds to transit through the American banking system. Most of the world just wants to do business, and not worry about hypocritical moralising American politicians' inspired regulations. Given enough effort, time, and willingness to pay high fees, exchanges will find banking partners willing to process HKD wires.

The on and off-ramps between digital currencies and fiat continue to cause significant friction. However, once traders squeeze through fiat gateways into the crypto universe, the trading opportunities are rich. If you desire a product to speculate on the value of Bitcoin without touching fiat, consider trading the BitMEX Bitcoin / USD Swap,¬†XBTUSD.

Strongman Bullies and Bitcoin


Trump, Xi Jinping, Putin, and Erdogan: these four men are the embodiment of Strongman Bully leaders. Global trends indicate we will soon have more world leaders with similar mindsets.

Over the past 30 years, throngs of Chinese, Russians, and Turks have become rich. The masses held their tongue, while the elite shamelessly lined their pockets. In China, the wealth amassed in coastal cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou stands in stark contrast to the developing and rural interior. Similar disparities exist in the metro areas of Russia and Turkey.

Xi, Putin, and Erdogan are all promising to restore the bargain with labour at the expense of capital. In previous decades, the masses have accepted disproportionally slow wage growth so long as their standard of living continued to increase. As global growth sputters, the bargain has become less tenable. The plebes are getting restless.

The marginal effectiveness of printing money to generate GDP output is waning. To make matters worse, population growth is shrinking in end markets like America and Europe. In response, central banks are reducing asset purchases. The net result will be higher interest rates and less trade.

All strongman bullies in all countries cannot be successful at the same time. Instead of trading for what they need, these leaders are likely to threaten to take what they need through war. A desperate leader can apply physical force to take resources, disrupt competing markets, and distract the local population from failed promises.

During times of war, assessing financial counterparty risk becomes a key investment survival skill. Will a USD deposit held in a Russian bank be worth the same as one held in an American bank? Every asset that you own must be evaluated on the basis of two concerns: beating domestic inflation and movement friction. In times of war, we are very likely to see inflation in necessity goods and deflation in other goods.

Where will the masses turn? Gold has value everywhere and is likely to triumph during these times. Recently, gold rallied when Trump authorised a missile strike against Syria, and when North Korea announced a potential nuclear missile test. Further rallies will come if global instability grows.

Bitcoin fits into this dynamic. Despite all of the issues it faces, it has persevered for over 8 years and still has substantial global value. Consider that as a vote of confidence in its ability to serve as a safe haven asset for a small pool of global capital.

personalfinance,"Question about a special Certificate my credit union is offering, just looking to know if it is good or not","Hi. I know next to nothing about money, but have been reading a lot of the wiki articles and required reading of your sub, and it is very educating.

That being said, I have a question about a ""Special Certificate"" offered by my credit union, which is Navy Federal.

They are currently offering a 17 month certificate with a 2% APY. The max is $50k, which I would throw in all at once upon opening the certificate. This would leave me with about $40k in a MMSA in case my employment/career is lost (which is a possibility, long story) and I have to find employment at a much lower salary.

I know you folks know a lot about money, and I must appear like an absolute idiot for holding ~$90k in a MMSA (but I am contributing to my 401k up to employer match, so I did one thing right).

So I understand that there are TONS of resources on this sub for me to still go over, and I am, believe me, but I was just wondering if anyone could offer a quick yes or no to the certificate on whether it is good, and I should go ahead with it or not. I can't risk leaving it in any sort of longer term setup because of my employment situation. There is a good chance that this money is the most I will have before being forced into a much lower earning career and needing more fluidity will likely occur.

So if you have made it this far, thank you for your time, and any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: [Here is a link to the CD I am looking at. It is under the ""Special"" tab](https://www.navyfederal.org/products-services/checking-savings/certificates.php)

personalfinance,(USA-PA) Elderly Grandfather Moving In?,"Just over half a year ago my grandfather lost his wife (my grandmother) of 55 years. He lives 500 miles from his nearest family (me, and my father live in PA, while he lives in ME). I've been looking over the options to move him here which is what he would like to do. Unfortunately, he does not have much money (lives off SS exclusively) and I'm the only person in my entire family who is financially able to help (most of my family makes just enough to survive, or less). Initially my wife and I considered buying a seperate property but financing isn't easy for second home close by for a relative. Follow that we were looking into putting an apartment for him in a garage we were looking to build on our property. Unfortunately zoning wouldn't allow it, and we were denied at our variance hearing as well. Now the only other options would be to buy a trailer/mobile home in a community somewhat nearby (15+ miles away) or to somehow renovate our house to accommodate him. We do have a semi-finished basement that we only use because we have to walk through it to get to our laundry room. However, there are many updates, and changes that would need to be made for it be accessible for him now, and in the future. My wife and I had $12k that we were going to use for the down payment on the garage/apartment. I've begun looking over the costs and they certainly add up quick (new drain system to avoid getting any water in the basement, adding a kitchenette, electrical, plumbing, etc. in addition to making the current storm door setup into an entry way that would be accessible for him). Anyway, the purpose of my posting here is to see if:

A) Other people here have been in this situation, and how did you pay for it? We have access to a ton of credit (cards) but at 15+% interest I'm not sure we really can afford to pay so much interest on what could turn out to be $10-$15k in purchases that would be paid off in 2 years at the earliest (so $1k's in interest at least)

B) I've been told by several people that programs exist for this situation that offer low interest loans, and grants in some cases. This would be great but I have no idea where to look. I've checked both the state of PA and the Federal websites to no avail, and have also done some google searches. It seems like every program is aimed at keeping elderly people living in their own home, and not toward helping family members make their home livable for an elderly family member. Any advice here?

Thanks for reading my huge wall of text. Hope I posted in the right section (there are so many reddit sections). 

Thank you,

personalfinance,Bad To Refinance Personal Loan After 1 Month For Lower Rate?,"In order to deal with some private student loans about to default due to my parents bankruptcy, I took out a personal loan of $30,000 at 9.6% interest for 60 months. This is a pretty high rate (about $250 in interest a month) and I was hoping to get it down to pay sooner. I figure I can both reduce the term I have to pay by about a year or two paying a higher principal and lower the interest rate going somewhere else (already found Wells Fargo will drop me about 2% interest and looking around for anyone lower). 


I'm wondering if this is a bad move to be shifting these things around, both credit wise and otherwise. I've already paid around $400 of the loan before the first payment which is due to come out in a couple weeks, and my credit is pretty good (740 score), I just want to see if I'm not thinking of any consequences of this move.",finance

personalfinance,Debt Assistance?,"Let me first by stating the wife and I live paycheck to paycheck. The spring is always the toughest for us financially because its the only season where one of us doesn't make extra cash separate from our regular jobs. First a little bit about our financials. Both of us have student loans, various credit cards, car payments, mortgage, utilities, etc. Overall we make about 4800 a month and our expenses not including gas and food (family of 4) equal about 4000 a month. I have taken over our finances from my over burdened wife. 

So let me get to the question at hand: Our mortgage is about two months behind. (I have the money to pay our March 1st Payment but will be behind (about two months consistently) our mortgage till about mid summer when we have extra money to get caught up. I contacted our mortgage bank to try to get some assistance and ask them to bring it current and tack the late payments onto the end of our mortgage.... or something of that nature. (Didn't even know if this was a thing.... was just trying to get some assistance). This is what they offered and I need to know if I should follow through or just be behind and get caught up in the summer. 

Our mortgage as of now is 915 dollars a month and we have 23 years and 5 months left on our 30 year mortgage at 4.25%

The bank offered to lower our payments to 850 a month at the same interest rate but make it start at a 30 year mortgage again. I also wouldn't start payments till June 1st. 

Let me first by saying I don't expect to live in my current house for more than 5-7 years. So I will be moving prior to ever getting to the end of the 30 years. Currently this would save us about 2700 right now and allow us to pay other bills and allow me to really get a hold of our finances. 

The big dilemma with going through with the banks offer is obviously the 6 plus years of the loan. But does it really matter if I don't plan on having the loan 30 years anyway? 

Also, the other option for me would be to do the banks offer but still pay the 915 a month as opposed to the 850 offer to help lower our principle. 

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Paying for living expenses entirely in student loans? Need advice please.,"Hi everyone!

I'm 19 years old and will become a 1st semester nursing student this fall at BSN program. And although I am very excited and anxious to start I still have a lot of anxiety because I will have to move 3 hours away from home to my new apartment (I stayed with my mother for my first 2 years of college to take out less loans).

I currently have no money saved up and I work for my mom by babysitting my 6 month old brother for $140 a week. So for this summer I am looking for a second job to increase my income. But I won't have these jobs once I leave unfortunately.

Since I will be moving out in less than 4 months I have been calculating my expenses:

Rent(not a student apartment) : $440 for 1 BR and already signed the lease for 1 year.

Utilities: Water ($20) &amp; electric ($80): $100

Internet: about $40-$70 (I've decided to forgo the cable to pay for a higher Internet connection).

Car insurance: $145 ( I only have 1 year of driving experience with some red light tickets and 1 at fault minor accident). I plan on paying this in 1 bulk yearly payment with loans.

Food: I will be appling for food assistance but I will assume $200.

Misc: $60 ( This is how much I pay already a month for cleaning supplies and other products.

Netflix: $8

Laundry: $20 once I move for onsite coined laundry. I usually wash my clothes every othe day since I don't have a wide variety to choose from.

Gas: $80 (Long commutes to clinical which are about 40min to 2 hours away. But I will reduce this commute drastically if I find people to carpool with).

I will pay all this with loans if I can not find a job or cannot work because of the diffculty of the program.

My mother will be sending me about $300 a month while I'm away also.

I current have $11,500 in student loans at 4.29% all federal in which half are unsubsidized and subsidized. My program will cost me about 15,000 a year in tuition and fees.

So my goal is take out the maximum loans (7,500) each year + an extra 5,500 a year in private loans for living expenses. I usually get about $20,000 in financial aid without taking out the maximum loans.

So adding up my financial aid:

Pell Grant (5,900) + federal loans (7500) + state grant (5,000) + 5,500 private loan's should net me 23,900 with 8900 left once tuition and fees are taken out for the year for living expenses.

I would also like to point out once again that program is 16 months w/summer and 22 months w/o summer, I can choose either. Plus, I will only be able to save about $400 before I move in if I cannot find a second job since I still have to pay for laptop, books, school supplies (including an $80 stethoscope), scrubs, and all my shot immunization's since I don't have health insurance.

personalfinance,When should I refinance student loans?,"I just graduated in December so I'm in my grace period. I have federal and private loans. I've putting as much money as I can into my private loans since I have 6 of them and 2 are over $12,000 with a 9% variable interest rate. In January I took out a car loan which gave me a glimpse of my credit score. Then it was around 650. I've never had a credit card until February. I've been making all my payments for loans and the credit card on time.      

My plan was to wait about a year to improve my credit score and then refinance to try and get a much lower rate. I saw a commercial for SoFi refinanced student loans. Looking at their site it looks like their variable rate loans are between 2.5% and 6.5% and fixed rate loans are 3.4% - 6.7% making me think now would be a good time to refinance. I also have federal loans on the lower end of those spectrums so I could consolidate and put them under the same account. 

Would now be a good time to refinance considering my interest for my private loans is probably around $300 - $400 a month or should I wait a bit longer to improve my credit history? Is there an easy free way to track my credit score? Will I run into fees associated with refinancing?

personalfinance,Is This Plan Sound For Planning For Grad Schoool (Budget Review)?,"Hi!

Using a throwaway because other account is linked to me


I am currently 22 and finishing undergrad and I am starting a full-time job this summer. The pay is about 95K + bonus + overtime. **Realistically, I can make about 115K this year and about 140k next year** (with huge upwards mobility after that). However, in order to advance in this field/my office to reach engagement manager, I will have to get an MBA. 

Given the small size of the firm, it is highly unlikely that they will pay for my MBA (but they will cover test prep/application fees/give me unlimited PTO to interview and tour). Thankfully, my generous parents said that they will cover half the total cost of grad school. Even though they will pay half, I will still be on the hook for 75k/80k.

**Current positions:
**

5k in Vanguard brokerage account

10k in savings/checking (going down to 7k after my post-grad trip)

4k in a 401k (internship match)


1k in Venmo (currently transferring to bank). 

Total ~ 20k.

2300*12 = 27600 1st year
If I go to grad school in 3 years, I think I will able to reach the goal.

1.  Is this budget realistic? I've never tracked my expenses before (yes I do pay for a few things in college - food, all fun money, travel, car,  books, clothes)
2. What vehicle should I save in? Should I open a 529?

3. is a 10k cash cushion ample for an emergency fund?

4. How much should I give to charity my first year?

5. is adding about 1k a month to my 401k enough? Should I be doing more?

6. Is there anything that I should be doing?

MachineLearning,[D] RL: GANs as MCTS environment simulator for deep model-based planning?,"Apropos of the [news on AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyUFy29z3Cw), [""Recurrent Environment Simulators""](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02254), [Guo et al 2014](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5421-deep-learning-for-real-time-atari-game-play-using-offline-monte-carlo-tree-search-planning.pdf ""Deep Learning for Real-Time Atari Game Play Using Offline Monte Carlo Tree Search [MCTS] Planning"")/[Desai &amp; Bannerjee 2017](https://nihit.github.io/resources/spaceinvaders.pdf ""Deep Reinforcement Learning to play Space Invaders""), [Mathieu et al 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05440 ""Deep multi-scale video prediction beyond mean square error""), and [LeCun's talk on unsupervised learning/RL](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/yann-lecun-2017-3-30), I have been wondering something: has anyone proposed or done any work on using Generative Adversarial Networks for forward planning such as in a tree search method like Monte Carlo Tree Search? It seems like what people are working towards when they bring up GANs in RL-related talks, but I don't recall anyone explicitly suggesting *how* GANs would be useful or this specific approach, and [some searching](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28%22GAN%22+OR+%22generative+adversarial+network%22%29+AND+%28%22MCTS%22+OR+%22Monte+Carlo+tree+search%22%29+-gallium+-methylene+-LED+-disease+-diode+-electrophoresis+-tumor+-dental+-nanoparticle&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C21&amp;as_ylo=2016) doesn't turn it up for me either. So here goes:

GANs [approximate a data distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875 ""'Wasserstein GAN', Arjovsky et al 2017""), so drawing samples from a GAN trained on data from sequential timesteps should constitute a distribution over the true environment data distribution, weighted by likelihood; with this sampling, one could combine it with MCTS to evaluate deeply the decision tree, estimate the value of each action, and choose optimal next actions. A MCTS+GAN RL agent would inherit most of the strengths of GANs and MCTS: simple implementations, able to learn from off-policy transition samples, create a deep environment model, do long-term planning, quantify its uncertainty for better exploration, provide any-time estimates, run in parallel, etc. This could be extended by using [dropout-trained](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/blog_2248.html) GANs or [bootstrapped](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07608 ""'Deep Exploration via Randomized Value Functions', Osband et al 2017"") GANs for deep exploration by training the GAN, taking actions in the true environment based on MCTS+GAN estimates, and using the newly collected samples to retrain the GAN. The MCTS+GAN value estimates could also be used to distill down into or pre-train a fast reactive deep RL agent like DQN or A3C by providing high-quality transition samples or a highly accurate advantage function.

(Note: I'm not sure GAN use here is strictly necessary. PixelCNN appears to be competitive with GANs for modeling visual data distributions, so perhaps that approach would also work.)

So to go back to LeCun's talk: one of his points is that for RL, we want some sort of model-based planning for look ahead. Model-free or non-planning is too sample-inefficient to get anywhere, although it tends to be very fast and have advantages; so in humans we see a fairly clear looking difference between immediate System I reflexes and intuition, and slower System II explicit planning and 'thinking through' possible futures by exploring a little model of the environment in our heads. But how do you have a deep model predict the future? He shows an example with cars. You can take a CNN and have it predict subsequent frames using something like RMSE loss and autoencoders, but this leads to blurry images immediately as it averages each pixel over all possible futures; this is not very helpful for planning since a blur doesn't tell you anything about what actions to take. The future is very multimodal, but the autoencoder will just produce the average. Then LeCun demonstrates GANs for predicting next frames - the sample is very sharp, as it picks out one possible future and depicts it as exactly as possible. But this isn't useful either: while it's probably the future with the highest likelihood, the maximum likelihood is still very unlikely, and the more steps out, the more that *exact* sequence becomes vanishingly unlikely, plus it ignores the expected value of the slightly-less-likely alternatives. What we need is planning over the entire distribution, not a single sample from it. Fortunately, a GAN does provide us the entire distribution of futures weighted by their likelihood, via the z-vector: we just create, say, 1000 unique sets of uniform deviates and feed them into the GAN and we will get an approximation of the distribution of futures, each one sharp; if in 500 futures the car continues forward, then on average 500 of the samples will have slight variants of the car moving forward, then perhaps another 250 have it turning left and another 250 have it turning right; with this, we can start doing planning and note that there's a 25% chance of it turning towards us and coming unacceptably close with potentially huge negative rewards, so we should slow down. This is not something we would get from an autoencoder (which would just show an expanding blur of grayness) or a single sample from a GAN (which would usually safely show the turn going straight or turning away from us). To account for actions changing the environment and turn it from a predictive model to a causal model, you would make the GAN conditional: in addition to the z-vector, provide an action. If there are immediate rewards rather than just terminal rewards, then the GAN prediction is both the new environment state and that state's immediate reward (which doesn't require knowledge of the total value of that state or the policy that was being followed, since the future agent's will be done by working backwards from an eventual terminal state and summing all the discounted 1-step rewards).

If you have a sharp simulator of the environment, what do you do with it? Well, you plug it into a decision tree: enumerate all possible sequences of actions and stochastic outcomes, and do backwards induction to figure out the optimal action at any outcome. That's too hard? You approximate it with MCTS. The simulator provides the possible outcomes for each action, which can then be fed back into the simulator to explore another ply down, and so on until hitting the depth limit and exploring randomly until a terminal state, at which point the cumulative rewards for each node are estimated, and another rollout begins.

So the whole algorithm goes:

1. create a dataset of environment+reward+action samples (perhaps from following a random policy in an ALE game or from expert human trajectories)
2. train until convergence a GAN (like [Improved WGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028 ""'Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs', Gulrajani et al 2017"")) to approximate the distribution of new environments conditional on old environment, action, and noise z-vector
3. for _n_ games in parallel:
   - initialize the RL agent in the environment
   - until termination, take each action according to MCTS using the GAN as environment simulator by drawing a relatively small number such as 5-100 samples (similar to Go's branching factor), while adding all environment transitions+rewards+actions to the dataset
4. go to #2

This could probably be implemented fairly easily using Gym+Improved WGAN.

This is:

- parallelizable, since the agents act independently and stochastically while the GAN can be trained in parallel on the 'experience replay buffer'
- can learn off-policy, since the GAN is focused only on the immediate state transition and reward, which doesn't depend on any successive actions following a better or worse policy - the full value is estimated only during the MCTS search by backwards induction
- keeps maintaining sharp environment states, since each individual GAN sample represents 1 possible future, not an ensemble or average
- capable of exploring deeply, using MCTS to prioritize promising lines of action
- capable of handling all environments that DQN/A3C do now like the ALE, and further capable of handling sequence data given the recent work on Improved WGAN and other GANs on discrete and sequential data
- anytime, since each rollout updates value estimates incrementally

The major weakness is that I'm not sure how well the MCTS part would handle continuous actions. This hybrid algorithm seems to fall closer to DQN than A3C in the taxonomy. There is also the potential for curse of dimensionality here - many of the drawn GAN samples will be morally equivalent in that they are the GAN reflecting the same basic causal change but with slight appearance differences, which despite MCTS's usual ability to handle extremely high branching factors like in Go, might wind up killing the approach.",technology

- My employer matches 4% on my 401k for 100% and an additional 2% for 50% match. 


I have a job offer to work as a 1099 contractor for 6 months. My hourly rate is going to be $60. If I'm going to work 48 weeks * 40 = 1920 hours / $115000 annually. 

I expect to have around $17500 in expenses (training and travel expenses per year) and my wife has roughly $2000 dollars in expenses on a $25000 dollar income, so we end up with $120000 taxable income. My estimated taxes are: federal $30000, NJ State income tax $6000, self employment tax $18000 (15%): total taxes $54000. This means that we have a net income of $66000. Is this correct?

I need help trying to figure out the best way to pay down my CC Debt. I have roughly $12,000 in Credit Card balances right now with varying interest rates and I just received a Personal Loan Pre-Approval from Citizens that I'm wondering if I should take advantage of.

If I did this I could definitely pay off the $2,605 (21.74%) and maybe a couple of the other high balances and rates.

investing,4/21 Executive Orders TL;DR and Discussion (X-post from WSB),"I saw a lot of hype on these before they were released but no real substance on what they contained. Here are the three orders. Technically two of them are presidential memoranda.

* [Presidential Executive Order on Identifying and Reducing Tax Regulatory Burdens](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/21/presidential-executive-order-identifying-and-reducing-tax-regulatory) 

Tl;dr: Secretary of the Treasury shall bring me a plan to make taxes cheaper, to make filing taxes easier, and to point out any taxes that exceed the IRS's statutory authority. 

* [Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/21/presidential-memorandum-secretary-treasury-0)

Tl;dr: Secretary of the Treasury shall examine the Orderly Liquidation Authority and determine if it causes undue moral hazard, whether it's really necessary to prevent failing companies from failing in the first place, whether it causes financial burden to the taxpayer (whether the Orderly Liquidation Fund works as intended), and whether liquidation of failing companies instead could be handled by a new chapter of the bankruptcy code or by a modified chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.

Background on the OLA: The OLA steps in to quickly and (hopefully) less painfully liquidate companies than would happen in normal bankruptcy proceedings. The costs of this are to be borne by the Orderly Liquidation Fund, which is supposed to be replenished by assessments on other financial companies. Basically instead of letting a dying elephant thrash around and cause panic, the government comes up and shoots it.

Basically the two sides to this executive order are: (a) if you're an elephant and you get sick, is the government gonna come shoot you cause they think you were gonna die anyways? And does this mean we don't need to worry about dying elephants around us? Plus who pays for the bullets and cleanup? (b) These panic caused by an elephant in its death throes may cause an injury-causing panic/stampede, even if no other animals are gored by the flailing tusks. [More in-depth pro-OLA by Ben Bernanke himself, though for some reason he doesn't use elephant metaphors](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2017/02/28/why-dodd-franks-orderly-liquidation-authority-should-be-preserved/). 

* [Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/21/presidential-memorandum-secretary-treasury)

Tl;dr: Secretary of the Treasury shall examine the Financial Stability Oversight Council to determine its transparency, whether it uses due process, whether it gives implicit bailout guarantees, whether its methods of evaluation considers the likelihood of distress (rather than just potential magnitude), whether specific quantitative magnitudes of potential damage of failing institutions to the US economy are generated, whether the costs to the regulated entity are examined, whether entities have a fair chance to defend themselves, whether entities are told how they can reduce their risk below the threshold, and whether the FSOC is consistent with Trump's earlier executive order, titled ""Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System.""

Background on the FSOC: Some large institutions are not regulated by any bank regulators (OTS, OCC, Fed, FDIC, NCUA) and do not fall under the requirements of Basel III, yet act similarly to banks and have similar consequences of failure. For example: Fannie and Freddie, Countrywide's non-bank section, AIG FP, bank holding companies, money market funds, and other shadow banks. In an attempt to close this loophole, the FSOC was created and given the duty (among a few other duties) of identifying these companies or industries, and determining whether they are to be brought under the supervision of the Fed. This isn't just for regulatory purposes, but also allows the entities to use Fed's wire transfer system (fedwire), and allows the Fed to more easily pump liquidity into these entities through the use of the discount window, without having to (I believe) use [Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section13.htm).

Basically the two sides to this executive order are: (a) this is a way for the government to regulate anybody they want as a bank without the burden of proof, and (b) if you're gonna be too big to fail and may require a bailout, you need to be regulated as such.",finance

But I still have a crapload of student loan debt: $59,000 at 5.25% interest. I'm not interested in refinancing, as it's a consolidated federal loan that is on IBR, and I'd like to keep it there. (FWIW, I checked out Sofi the other day and their interest rate was even higher for me!) 

The other part of this is that I haven't started saving for retirement yet, and I'd like to do that lickety-split. I'll be opening a SEP IRA through Vanguard with the 2050 target-date retirement fund. Looking over the returns of this, however, in the last 10 years it is only a bit more than the interest rate I'm paying on my loan, at 5.71%. 

So I am a bit torn. My goal is to pay off my loan by the time I'm 40, which would be about $875/month. The **total** amount I have to put towards both of these goals is $900 (for this year, at least -- my income should be larger next year), which includes the $300 automatic student loan payment that I'll be paying regardless, but which mostly just pays interest at this point. 

Would I be better off prioritizing the loan and holding off on opening the SEP IRA for a few years? Or should I try to max the SEP IRA and just take my time with the loan? Or something in between? I'm curious how you would allocate the extra $600.

personalfinance,Filing taxes as a Canadian in the US (both contractor and full-time),"I'm looking for advice on how to file my taxes given an unusual situation:

I'm a Canadian in my mid 20s working full-time at a tech company in California. I'm on a work visa and by now considered a resident alien. Last year I did a mixture of contract work and salaried work. The contract work was 75% remote from Canada and 25% on-site in California for meetings.

For several years prior to that I would alternate as a student in Canada and a paid intern in California. 

I've only filed my taxes once which was in 2015. Prior to that they may have been filed by my parents. I would like to figure out the status of those past returns and get everything sorted out now.

To complicate things, after filing Canadian taxes in 2015, I was given a Notice of Reassessment which I didn't discover until early 2017. The assessment shows that I owe around $14,000 because I didn't mail in proof that I paid my taxes to the IRS while working in California in 2014. I have since sent various proof to CRA but have not heard back yet.

For the current year, I've sent forms for time extensions on the federal and California taxes, and Canadian taxes are not due until April 30th.

A few questions:

- Can I still collect tax returns for previous years (2015, 2013) despite filing late? 
- Given the unusual work situation last year, should I just hire an accountant?
- Should I start by filing the 2016 taxes, then 2015, then figure out the status of the years before that?
- How should I handle the situation about money owed for the 2014 reassessment?
- How far back do I need to file taxes in the US and Canada?

personalfinance,Need Help Choosing Between Long-term Promising Federal Career or Lucrative Short Term Overseas Contract Gig,"All,

I just want to thank you all for your help. I am very active on this page, however I am using a throwaway account just for privacy concerns.

Personal Financial Profile: I am a 26M and currently have roughly 42,000 in Debt all of which I am making on time payments towards. 7k is being floated on Credit Cards for which I am currently trying to balance transfer to get a better rate. 5k has been issued by peer to peer lending companies. 30k is for student loans that I took out while getting my Masters Degree. 
Total payments to Debt is 1300 USD/Month.

The Story: I have been working overseas as a linguist for the US government for nearly a year now making roughly 107k annually. The job while fairly easy has zero security (It is most likely to end in May of next year), no prospects for a pay raise, and because of my remote location prohibits me from applying to other jobs. 
 With my current salary I am able to save between 4-5K USD a month, and my gross monthly expenditures for me and my wife is 4.5K USD a month. Me and my wife our anticipating that by next May we can save a minimum of 50k USD.

However on the flip side, I recently was offered a GS-9 Step 1 ladder position (55K USD/YR and with a START DATE of May 15th) in DC with the US Government that will involve frequent travel overseas after my initial 6 months of training. The benefit of this job is that after one year I will be eligible to be promoted to a GS-11 (66K USD/YR) and one year after that to a GS- 12 (80k USD/YR). An additional benefit is that when I travel overseas for work I will be entitled to per diem, though the amount is still unclear.

A complication is that my wife is from the Middle East and to be frank cannot work in traditional office/stressful environments. However she is proactively pursuing a Computer Science degree so that she can work in more relaxed conditions doing more independent work.

The Issue: My wife, due to her studies and my prolonged absence, signed a 1 year lease in Phoenix, AZ. As my job is in DC it will be at least a year before she graduates and is able to move with me. With that being said we will end up needing to pay 2 rents, one for her in AZ, and for me in DC.

The problem is that with a GS-9 salary I can expect to get roughly 3.4k after taxes, and benefit payments. This will fall well short of our current 4.5k budget. We have worked it out to where we can trim our expenses down to about 4K a month, which includes rent for both locations, as well as the 1300 payments to debt.

All the money we have saved has gone to paying for her degree as well as making big payments on our debt. The 600 dollar shortfall a month may require me to take out a loan until I start my overseas rotations where I will be paid extra money.

My wife has given be the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù to do whatever I feel is best, but she is extremely pessimistic about the viability of the government job in DC as she believes it‚Äôs too early for me to have a career. Given that this is probably the biggest decision I have had to make in my life I could really appreciate some additional help making it.

The Question: Is it better to take the government job which offers long term stability and career prospects, but may lead to short term financial burdens, or stay with the overseas contracting job that offers short term financial gains but will most likely end after one year?",finance
personalfinance,Should I cash out whole life insurance policy?,"Recently found out that I have a whole life Insurance Policy started by my grandparents. It currently has a cash value of $13,300 and death benefit of $80,000. From what I understand the cash value grows at a 5% interest rate. It is fully paid off after paying 20 years of $500 annual premiums. 

Background information. I am a 21 year old college student graduating this year with a nursing degree. I will graduate with $20k in school loans and no other significant debt. I will be living at home after graduation so will not have any large bills. I will start working in August and will be financially independent for the foreseeable future (should make 60-70k my first year). I have very little money to my name right now and have no source of income. Considering cashing out or taking out a loan so I can have money this summer which will be my last summer before working for a long period of time. Probly will want to spend a few thousand to enjoy myself and pay off a significant part of my school loans. Quite unsure of what I should do because I have little financial knowledge. To me, a 5% interest rate is very good. Thank you in advance for your advice !",finance
personalfinance,"Car was totaled after I was rear ended on the freeway, still waiting for insurance to declare total loss or give me any other info. Any reason I shouldn't just buy another car now?","A few more details: the driver who hit me told me at the scene he was uninsured and the insurance card he provided was expired by a few weeks. I don't carry rental car coverage through my insurance, so a rental car is entirely out of pocket at this point. I drive 300 miles a week for my job as a home health PT and carry a lot of equipment with me, so going without a car for any length of time is not an option. I'm currently using my fianc√©s car but it's not a sustainable option as we're paying for him to take uber to and from work everyday. 

I know my price range for a car and what make/model I would like. I have cash available for a down payment and there are cars available in my area. So my question is, is there any reason to wait to hear back from insurance before purchasing a new (used) car? Will the fact that my current loan hasn't been vacated yet affect my interest rate (my credit score is excellent). Regardless of the payouts from insurance or the other driver, I'm going to need a new car and I'll be sticking with the price range I've already set. 

I'm also including a link to pictures of the car involved in the accident to show why I'm extremely confident the car is a total loss.

personalfinance,Seller Carry Back option,"My friend is buying a house through a friend of his. They are doing a seller carry back and will be paying 2% interest to the seller for 5 years. The purchase price of the home was going to be lower (295k) and they would be paying a 4% interest rate but instead they dropped the interest rate in half and upped the sell price by 10k. 

Now instead of paying $1000/month in interest they only pay $500/month + utilities. If they ever want to pay more than the $500 it will go to pay down the principle. 

When my buddy told me about this deal I couldn't believe it. They are getting the home for  20-30K less than the comps in the area (homeowner saved about that on realtor fees, and my friend will need to re paint and re carpet the whole house). 

I guess they did it this way because they would not qualify for that price of a home right now and I guess they are planning to be making more in 5 years when they get a mortgage and cash out their friend. 

Did they make the right move? Does this deal sound too good to be true?",finance

Avoiding lifestyle inflation is definitely on our minds, as is our desire to attack our personal finance goals smartly. Our long term goals are:

- Pay off student loans as reasonably quickly as possible
- Save for a home, in about 5 years time (~ $500k)
- Save for retirement (hopefully by 60)

And our current situation is:

- Total household income: $200k
- Student loan debt: $100k
- Student loan interest rates: ~ 7%
- Auto loan debt: $6k
- Auto loan interest rate: ~ 1.7%
- Credit card debt: $0
- 401k matching at both employers
- $50k currently in retirement and mutual funds
- $15k liquid assets

How can we best prioritize our income after expenses to hit these goals (especially in the next five years)?

personalfinance,IBR Student Loan Repayment Calculation,"I am having trouble figuring out a calculation on the IBR repayment plan for my federal student loans. And would love some insight. I am trying to figure out if it makes sense for me to utilize an IBR plan, aiming to pay the minimum and have debt forgiveness after 25 yrs.

Details: I currently have $250,000 in consolidated federal student loans (principle + capitalized interest) at fixed 6.4% interest. Last year my AGI was $136,000 and I don't see that increasing by more than 2%/year so for all purposes we can keep that number fixed at say 140k/yr. I live in CA and my family size is 1. I didn't make any real money the first 2 years out of school so at this point my term to reach forgiveness is 23 yrs not 25. 

According to studentloans.gov repayment estimator on the IBR plan my initial payment would be $1475/mo and I would repay the loan in 196 months with no forgiveness. However they assume a 5% increase in discretionary income/yr. What I am trying to calculate is what this scenario looks like maintaining a fixed income at 140,000 over the next 23 years. How much would be forgiven at the termination of the loan given those conditions? 

(My overall goal is to determine if it makes sense to do IBR and pay the minimum, get debt forgiven, knowing to save for the tax hit, or to do an extended repayment, try to re-consolidate parts of the debt at lower interest through private companies and pay the full thing off asap. I think the most I could put toward loans would be 2k/month but that would leave me with zero savings, or 1500 would be more comfortable)

btc,"Fedcoin is a trap for them not us, and other useless blather. (rant)","We will always have options to do what we want.  If and when they create Fedcoin as Doug Casey predicts:

http://news.bitcoin.com/fedcoin-u-s-issue-e-currency/ 

They will not be trapping us, they will be trapping themselves. (or we will be trapping them) 

All we have to do is make sure they do not use any other currency than their Fedcoin, then we use the blockchain to force the government to be transparent.  

If I pay my taxes in Fedcoin I can watch my money move on the blockchain and actually see where it goes.   The excuses that I dodge my taxes because it's wasted on welfare won't be an argument if I can see that it's actually spent on roads or education or science.  

Fedcoin may be inevitable, but when it comes we just need to make sure it's open, transparent and honest.  

I hate the fed, but I would love to see the books.   In fact maybe if I could see the books I would be more willing to support them. 

If they create Fedcoin all we have to do is demand it be a fair and honest money...............if the fed had a fair and honest money bitcoin would loose most of it's use case.  

If bitcoin was what forced the Fed to become transparent and honest I would argue that bitcoin has been very valuable and even if it gets replaced by an open and honest Fedcoin then we win.  

Any economy that uses honest money will flourish.  Silver for example was a ledger that worked well and was very honest and created huge economic gains for the Spanish that they still reap today.  (although maybe they are at the end of that benefit). 

Silver was honest money, it was a ledger, but rather than being a ledger based on proof of work it was a ledger based on proof of possession.  Silver was a ledger the same as bitcoin, and bitcoin for now is honest money.  That is why it grows in value.   If Fedcoin become a provable honest money then we all win,,, 

Just remember that once they create Fedcoin then all the wealth of the current elite will be held in Fedcoin,  as long as we make it an open honest ledger we can force the government to be transparent and end the theft of the current dishonest system. 

Phase 2 is when we let Fedcoin work, and let them all denominate their wealth in it,  then we just walk away,,,,,  they loose everything.  We the producers just need to stop accepting it. They need our production so they will end up giving us all the power.  They need us, we don't need them. (or at least this quest for balance of power is about if we need them or not) 

Fedcoin is a trap for them,  it may be a step toward their goal to herd us all into the same cage, but what they don't realize is that by getting us all together we hit a critical mass and we realize freedom.  

The herd turns into a stampede at any second and can trample any fence they use to try and hold us.  

Fedcoin may be a very useful step in the evolution towards a real honest and fair system,,,, but it will not be the end of the evolution.  

One day we will have a fair and honest system where the most valuable thing you can do is balance your own production and consumption.  Over production and over consumption will be self taxed.  A balanced consumption and production will be the most efficient and therefore the most sought after position in the economy.  

We have the technology to do this sitting right in front of us, and it will take many shapes before we finally find a balance,   but I can assure all of you of one thing for sure,, 

In the end each person will be individually rewarded with less friction if they achieve perfect balance between their production and their consumption.   

Anyone who over produces will realize market friction, and anyone who over consumes will as well.  The only way to reduce the friction will be to perfectly balance your production and consumption to a foot print of zero,   zero everything.  Zero impact on all things.   This will make you like a fish in a river,  effortlessly floating in a current as if propelled by some invisible force.   

This force is balance, the fish in the stream who seems to hold it's position within the current without effort is the best natural example of what money should become.   Balanced. 

Those who impact the least get a free ride,  only changing positions costs energy and that energy is paid to the current of the river itself.   

The economy may become slower moving, but that just makes holding your position easier.  

Go to a bridge where you can see fish swim below in a current and consider the river as the economy and the fish as any market participant.   The ultimate money will be one where where the market participants are balanced perfectly and expend very little energy to maintain position.  They are not consuming energy or expending energy to hold a position within the economy.   That is the end result of the evolution of money.  

Fedcoin may be another step on the way,  and it won't be the end of bitcoin, but some other new invention may very well be.  

The fact is that it doesn't matter,,,,   Only balance matters.  

Become an economic ""Grey Jedi"".    That is where this is all headed.  

This is fair, and honest, and is the end of the evolution of money. In the meantime we may see huge battles and kingdoms rise and fall,  but in the very end only balance can remain.  

avoid the battle, find a nice place in the stream to balance your production and consumption.  Find effortless existence.  

Never add friction to a battle,  just let the current carry you to a spot that has no battle,  and never try to fight your way upstream, there is nothing up stream that won't soon arrive at your current position in the stream, and there is nothing down stream that you haven't already experienced.  

Find your balance of effortless existence and be the example to all.

You need not struggle to survive, the river will bring you everything you need, and you need not paddle your way anywhere.  It's all coming to you in time.   

You are exactly where you are supposed to be,,, stop the panic, stop the effort,,  and you will see that you can just be.  

There is no ""dark side"" ""fedcoin"" without someone declaring that there is a ""light side"" ""Freedom coin"".  One creates the other.  

The evolution ends at balance.   Period.   

Effortless existence can be had by you right now.  

If just one of you sees what I am trying to say then it was worth my time.    Bring on the trolls,  do your worst,  it doesn't effect me.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Buying first home, mortgage loan officer raising interest rate 3 weeks before closing date. Can we do anything?","Hi PF, long-time reader, first-time poster. I love the feedback here and would really appreciate some advice, even if it's just ""them's the breaks, they got you"".

TLDR: mortgage officer said we would get a 4% interest rate verbally (after we got pre-approved), later recanted and committed to 4.125% over email and now, 3 weeks before the closing date, is saying the best we can do is 4.25%. 

Details: Before putting down an offer, we went shopping around for mortgage rates. We landed at a large, national bank. The mortgage loan officer said the standard rate was 4.125% but that he was sure he could get us 4%. We got pre-approved, put an offer in for an apartment we liked, had our offer accepted and then began finalizing the mortgage.

A few days later, the MLO called and said he was unable to get a 4% rate, but that he could get us a 4.125% rate and a small lender credit to partially make up for it. We were disappointed but overall OK with that and decided to keep going with that bank. 

Fast forwarding a bit, one day before the commitment letter was due, the MLO called us and told us that the bank's underwriting group would not give us 4.125% and instead could only give us 4.25%, this time with no lender credits. He said this was based on my credit history, as I only had 1 credit card that had been open for more than 2 years. This is true (I've had 1 CC for several years and another for a year and a half), but I wished he would have told me earlier. He had run my credit history early in the process, so I don't understand why it just came up then unless he was afraid that if he told me, I would go to another bank.

I called the manager of the bank branch that we met the MLO at and asked if this was the best we could do, he said he would look into it and get back to me. The MLO then came back asking if he could use my wife's credit history to get the lower rate. We were fine with that; he checked her credit history and emailed me clearly saying that with my wife and I both on the application, we would get the 4.125% rate. I confirmed this with him a couple times over email over the next 2 weeks, he said things were going fine.

...until this past Friday, when he told us that the underwriters were refusing to consider my wife's credit card account because it was a joint account with me. OK, but again, wouldn't he have known that weeks ago, after he ran her credit? The closing date is in 3 weeks, and we're back to the higher interest rate.

I'm planning to call the manager again and see if he's able to help us out again, but I don't have high hopes. Do I have any next steps here other than to take the higher rate?

---

Update: Thanks to everyone who commented! First a point of clarification: we did ask him to lock us in at 4.125%, and he did not. His excuse after the fact was pretty amazing: he said he had clicked the ""lock rate"" button on his company's internal system, but his session was expired, so it didn't actually go through. Something makes me doubt that explanation...

Anyway, the seller agreed to give us an extra 2 weeks to close, so we got a bit more breathing room / leverage. I called another major bank who agreed to 4.125% and said they could close in 30 days. Woohoo! I also spoke to the branch manager at the original bank. I said I was going to go to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and that I had been promised a lower rate, with an email to prove it. Hours later, the original loan officer told me he got us back down to a 4% rate, with some points. I don't plan on taking the offer.

So things are going in the right direction. It sucks that we have to move June 1st because a lot of other people will be moving then as well, but it happens. I also will ask for a refund on the appraisal fee from the first bank, because we will have to pay to have it done again by the other bank.",finance
personalfinance,Opinions on renting vs. buying?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I was looking for some opinions on my current situation. I am 22, graduated about a year ago with a bachelors degree and currently work for the government making about 50k a year. I have never lived away from my home with my parents, but I am looking to move out and be more independent if it makes financial sense. Some background:

-I have 10.3k in student debt (monthly payments are 119 but I pay at least 150 every time and throw extra money toward it)

-I have about 13k on a car loan (monthly payments of 285, interest rate is 1.99)

-I pay for my car insurance (240 - very high, I'm looking in to switching) and my cell phone (61). I spend about 100 a month on gas, and other than that, I don't have any more monthly expenses. 

-Savings: 25k

-I'm contributing 9-11% of my income to a mandatory pension plan and an additional 3% is going in to a roth IRA.

My paychecks average about 1450 (so monthly, about 2900). I live in an area with very high rent because its a major city, so if I get a roommate I can expect to be paying between 800-1000 a month plus utilities.

I am saving about 1500 a month living at home with my parents. My question is do you think it is worth it for me to stay home for about two more years and save up for a down payment on a house/condo (would like to keep it under 315k if possible), or should I just rent and take longer to buy a house?

Anyway, what I'm wondering is what to do with my loans. I'm in my grace period currently, and my original plan was to aggressively pay them down as quickly as possible, but I recently got a reminder letter about them letting me know that they're just going to take the monthly payments out of my bank account. I was just thinking that instead of throwing a couple k at them at a time, to just not think about them until they're gone (as I'm typing this out I realise it sounds stupid, but we'll see). My reasoning behind that is that it would be nice to have money to do other things (investing, RRSP etc). But I guess the only way that would be smarter financially is if the expected return is higher than the interest rate on my loans? And at the moment my cash is just sitting in the bank. My employer RRSP kicks in in about a week and they match up to 3%.

So my loans:
Federal: $1,520
Alberta: $5,520

And honestly I'm not exactly sure if the interest rates are fixed or floating. I can't recall and I've been having the hardest time getting into my online accounts. I'm pretty sure interest has been accruing in my ""grace"" period?

I also have a maxed out LOC of $8,000 that I used to purchase a car 2 years ago. The adviser at the bank recommended doing it that way so that's what I did. Interest rate is prime +1 and I'm being charged monthly. Currently it's 3.70%.

Also, I use my credit card for everything and pay off that same amount every night (or as soon as the transaction shows up). There's nothing wrong with doing this, right?

So what should I do? Like if it were you, what amounts would you be throwing at these things at this moment with the cash I have available and how should I be saving/investing.",finance

financialindependence,State income tax spreadsheet for FIRE,"I've been curious for a while about how state income tax affects FIRE. Obviously the no income tax states are optimal, but beyond that it's difficult to compare due to the complexities of each individual system. /u/JEdwards was kind enough to point me to [this page](https://taxfoundation.org/state-individual-income-tax-rates-brackets-2017/) from taxfoundation.org which details exemptions, deductions, and tax brackets for all 50 states plus the D.C. Using this information, I wanted to calculate, what would my state income tax be for each state if I used a FIRE strategy of having regular income (interest + non-qualified dividends + Roth conversions) up to the personal exemption + standard deduction limit, then long-term capital gains (either for living expenses or harvesting to increase basis for the future) up to the top of the 15% bracket. Go Curry Cracker shows in [this post](http://www.gocurrycracker.com/the-go-curry-cracker-2013-taxes/) how this approach yields no federal taxes.

My Google Sheet is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aXf0DrmLSD2hCxVFA32UuvD2Jw0WIprTdVMc1QfsLPw/edit?usp=sharing), based on a regular income of $10,400/$21,800 (single/couple) and long-term capital gains of $37,950/$75,900 for an adjusted gross income of $48,350/$97,700. For simplicity, I'm assuming that capital gains are taxed at the same rate as regular income, which for most states seems to be the case.

There's a few surprises in here. First off for me was seeing that at least from this perspective, California actually isn't that bad. Also, a lot of Southern and Midwestern states are pretty low on this list, I suppose because they tend to have flatter tax systems.

Anyway, hopefully somebody finds this helpful. The median tax is nearly $4k for a couple so if you're planning to live on ~$40k/year that is certainly a significant expense.

DISCLAIMER: The spreadsheet and associated results are guaranteed to have errors and incorrect assumptions. I mentioned already that capital gains are sometimes taxed by states differently than regular income. There's also tax credits in some states which reduce the taxes owed. If you spot major errors let me know and I'll try to fix them. But I think this gives you a decent idea of what to expect.

EDIT: Added average property tax rate and average combined (state + local) sales tax rate to spreadsheet and table above, as some requested.",finance

After researching the position, it seems like starting salary with no experience is around $45k, and highest it goes is $66k. I'm looking to be making at least high $50s, low $60s. 

But, I also dont want to shoot myself in the foot and throw out a number thats much less than what they want to offer.

We have about double the FHA down payment, and plan on paying that into the house as well (about 14k). 

Over the past year, we have been making accelerated payments (4x the normal payment) and obviously, have made significant progress. We are getting near the point where it may make sense to pay off the rest of the car with savings (roughly 5k) so we can focus all of our energy on saving. But would this be robbing Peter to pay Paul? 

Interest rate on the car is low-ish (2.99%) and if we continue as planned with the accelerated payments, it would be paid off in August.

personalfinance,Should I Refinance My Federal Student Loans?,"Looked around to find the answer however I'm dumb and struggling to come up with ""is this worth it?"" or not given my specific situation. There are equations I can't come up with on my own because math.

I have four remaining federal student loans being serviced through Nelnet. The loans are as followed:

* A: $2,288.31 at 4.5% fixed
* B: $7,063.80 at 6.8% fixed
* C: $2,942.12 at 4.5% fixed
* D: $1,526.06 at 6.8% fixed

In total I have $13,820.29 remaining at an average 5.65% APR. While I have been making the minimum $230.45 payment each month since October 2013 I've recently finished paying off another loan which should allow me to start pumping an additional ~$500 towards these loans to get them out of the way sooner rather than later.

Given the fact I'm able to make larger payments of $700-$750 a month to get this remaining student loan debt cleared from my name I investigated what I could refinance to and if it would end up helping out during this time. Looking at SoFi currently I can get a 5-Year fixed rate at 5.25%. Can someone help determine if it's worth going with SoFi and paying them my increased payment amount for the sum for all loans or should I target paying off the higher rate loans with Nelnet first and skip refinancing all together? Are there any additional fees or anything related to refinancing with SoFi that would make it not worth the effort?",finance

personalfinance,Planning to refinance student loans multiple times an acceptable strategy?,"Looking for advice on whether planning to refinance student loans a couple of times over a couple of years is a good strategy.

Details: I've got about $27,000 in four different student loans at 6.5%-6.75% interest.  I removed some errors on one of my credit reports and my estimated score went from 690 to 780.  With those corrections, I thought I'd try and refinance my student loans. 

I'm getting married this year and we plan on buying a house in late 2018 - 2019.  I don't have anything in savings currently as I'm aggressively paying down credit debt. I expect to pay down the remaining $4,000 in the next month or two.

I have $27k in student loans at 6.5-6.75% fixed interest rates and paying $387/month.  My idea is to refinance at 3.6% variable at 15 years to lower the monthly payment to ~$190.  This coupled with paying off the ring early will reduce my monthly expenses by $447.  The money would go towards paying remaining balance on the credit card, followed by saving for a down payment on a house.  

My target is to save $30k in the next 2 years.  My fiancee will match and if needed, we can get help to make up a difference.  After buying the house (in 2-3 years), I would refinance the student loans again, most likely choosing to pay off in 5-7 years with the lowest rate possible (I see a 2.9% variable/3.8% fixed for 5-years).

I thought I'd ask if planning to refinance twice is a feasible plan or if there are hidden costs. The more conservative plan would be to refinance at 4.84% fixed for 10-years ($280/month).  This plan would be of marginal long-term benefit and would direct $810 towards loans in comparison to the first plan. (and ~$1k next year, dependent on interest rates)

personalfinance,How much is too much to spend on tuition?,"Some backstory, I graduated high school in 2013, went to a public city university for Nursing and struggled for two years there due to anxiety and depression, I only earned about a semester's worth of credits and a lot of bad grades. I took a semester off, then went to community college and took classes towards a biology degree for the last year and a half where I got my grades back up and am somewhat back on track. Now I need to transfer schools because I want to finish my B.S. in Biology. Ideally, I'd like to try to get into a PA program or some other masters program after I get my B.S. but because school has been such a challenge and still is, I'm not totally sure if I will continue with graduate education and getting my B.S. is my main concern right now.

The school I'm considering is a small private university, known for sciences in the area that costs about $37,934/yr. It's expensive but they give decent merit scholarships. Unfortunately because of my previous poor grades I only qualify for the lowest one at $15,000/yr. I may be able to get $17,000/yr if my GPA increases. 

I've received my finical aid package and it looks like I'd need to come up with $18,234/yr after the merit award and federal loans. It looks like it might be 2-3 more years to finish my degree.

I originally paid for tuition for the first university with savings bonds and federal loans, and a little bit of what I made at my part time job. I work 20/hrs a week at a retail job and make about $500/month. I live at home so expenses are pretty minimal, mainly gas and $100/month for therapy. The money I have in my Ally savings was from a life insurance policy from my grandmother, and I've been trying to not touch it at all, and immediately replenish if I take money for school expenses. I figure I may need it for a car down payment in the next 5 years.

&amp;nbsp;


Ally savings (1.04%): $11,000

Federal Loans (3.6-4.6%): $16,000

SallieMae (8.5% b/c I have no cosigner, currently making payments as much as I can): $2,500

Potential Tuition: $18,000/yr (for maybe 3 years)

&amp;nbsp;


The reason I am considering this school is because I feel like it's the school I'm most interested in and feel like would be a good fit considering my previous experiences. I'm afraid if I go to the other school I'm considering I'll have a really hard time completing my degree. I'm imagining I would be paying for school with mostly private loans since I don't want to touch my savings. Is it completely insane to spend that much? (I mean I know it is, but is this a worthwhile risk?) Should I just use all my savings anyway to minimize loans? Any other suggestions for how much I should be spending on school at this point in time? I'm also concerned that since I've been in school for so long that my eligibility for federal loans will run out before I could finish, not sure what I'd do then. I'm hoping to get a higher paying job soon but it's hard for me to work a lot and maintain good grades.

personalfinance,US college student seeking mental aid,"WARNING:  Sorry this will be rather long but I'm unsure how to shorten it without giving you every detail necessary.  

So, I'm a 24 y/o male attending community college for software development while working between 20-30 hours a week at an Italian restaurant and dealing time management with a girlfriend.

I've been on/off college student since I graduated in 2011 and I wasted all of my federal grant help by being unsure of what I wanted out of life.  I finally found a subject I can see myself focusing on for the rest of my life and I would say I'm a lot more confident in my knowledge and ability to complete college classes now rather than withdrawing out of 3/5 every semester and screwing up my entire college career.

So this past/current semester ending in may would be considered by 1st semester towards my software dev associates, but I have basic computer classes and 2 english class credits to transfer towards my degree.  At the beginning of the semester I was on financial aid warning because of the amount of classes I withdrew from in the past, so I was forced to get my first loan from my school for (I'm not exactly sure without looking into it) around $1200.  I was cutting it close to the deadline for classes and needed the loan so I wouldn't fall behind anymore considering people I graduated high school with are all starting their jobs now and i'm essentially starting college.  But the basis of what I'm getting at is the fact that I have no idea how these loans I'm going to need work.  From what I've been told, I feel like I'm going to owe a lot more than what I originally got from the school.  But i have no idea when I'm suppose to pay them off, who I'm suppose to pay or anything.

On top of that, I believe I owe a debt collector around $150 and my previous community college I was at is requested I pay them $330 before they transfer my credits to my current community college because of a semester that went unpaid when I was there, although I thought my grants had covered all of that, but I am willing to pay it off just to get my credits transferred and so I won't have to retake an entire semester at this new community college.

After that, I owe $50 a month for insurance, $30 a week for gas money, and $75-80 a month for my phone bill.

I make $10/hr at the restaurant I work at, but I tend to only work 20 hours a week (maybe more depending on other circumstances) due to my lacking ability to focus on school work.  This is why I take online classes so I can focus on the work more at my own pace and whenever I choose since doing HW at 2-4am is a lot more beneficial to me.

So, in all I believe I'm around $1700-$2000 in debt right now including the first loan I received from my school.

I have no idea how to even start a budget although I've read into some of the basics around this /r , I still find it hard to even process for whatever reason.

I'm honestly hoping some kind soul out there can help guide me in the right direction and maybe even give any advice on how to stay focused on schooling while dealing with debt and a girlfriend who likes to go out drinking almost every weekend.

I want to please everyone at work, in my life and myself, but I find I'm lacking heavily in the ""Me"" department and I hate the fact that I'm going to have to make some temporary cuts in my life to make up for the time and money I've lost in these past 6 years I've pretty much blown since graduating high school.

If anyone needs any further information to help help me, please just ask.  I appreciate any and all help thrown my direction! :]",finance

personalfinance,Can anyone explain Student Loan Refinancing to me?,"tl;dr I have over $50k in student loans, the bulk with 10% interest rate, any way to refinance or consolidate to get a lower interest rate? 

Background: I have two loans from Navient (formerly Sallie Mae). One for $23,752.70, one for $26,326.49, both a 10% interest rate. I have one other loan from Nelnet for $2,733.52 at a 6.55% interest rate. Loans were first taken out in 2006 when I first started college and have been growing due to interest ever since. Credit Karma lists my credit scores as 668 and 671. I have been making on-time payments for the past several years.

In a lot of ways, I have my finances under control. I live with family that only charges me $75/month for rent and utilities, I own my car so I'm only paying gas and insurance. I do pay for my own food and entertainment but I try to keep those both pretty minimal. Unfortunately, I'm only making about $1500/month (after taxes and insurance) and I don't foresee that changing any time soon (I was unemployed for a while, then found a min. wage 25 hour/week retail job until I finally found my current job which is full time). Currently I'm paying the minimum balance to Navient and Nelnet for my loans which comes out to a little under $700/month. 

I'm in my late 20s and I'm living paycheck to paycheck. I can't save up or put away for retirement at this rate. Even being able to move out on my own is looking scary at this rate. I don't mind not being able to pay off my loans for several, several years...I just get crippled by the way the amount increases due to interest. 

Oh a BIG note: I did not finish my degree. I struggled with personal issues my junior year and dropped out. I do want to go back to school to finish, but I'm very hesitant to go back if it means taking out new loans. I have taken a few night courses at the local community college (while working full time) but I've run out of money to pay out of pocket for those.",finance
financialindependence,Am I wrong to max HSA without maxing 403(b) and while servicing debt? Now with more PSLF and Student Loans!,"I thought that I had everything under control, I've got pretty good systems in place for using credit, autopaying loans and cards, manipulating money between a few accounts to maximize my liquid savings and month-to-month spending. But now I'm second guessing my decision to max my HSA through my employer while still paying down student loans. I know everyone is a special snowflake, but I thought I had a good reason to deviate from the How to handle $ Flowchart from r/personalfinance. That reason being, trying to make my income look as small as possible to minimize my Income Base Repayment amount on my federal loans since I'm trying for PSLF.

Salary: $47,600 (relatively generous employer that decided to match the FLSA regulation that didn't quite make it)

Currently translates to a little over $2600/month, but that's what I use to budget with. I know you'll want the whole budget, but it's a little in flux right now as it's our first month in a house that we're paying utilities on. The TL;DR is that I'm in a high cost-of-living area, I live below/at my means, and between myself and roommates, we can handle our monthly shared expenses.

I'm on income based repayment for my federal student loans, paying about $75/month on ~$33k that is generating ~$140/month in interest. I work for a PSLF qualifying employer and I believe that I have at least 3.5 years of qualifying payments so far. Job security is pretty good, benefits are very good (including tuition waivers), increase in professional licensing and experiences is very good, potential for a large increase in income is pretty small. 

I work side jobs occasionally and use all of that extra money to either pad my emergency fund or go straight to my private student loans.

I pay $350 between a few servicers of my private student loans, with about $42k left on those. I'm stretching the payments a bit with SoFi, but after a couple months when my budget is ironed out I'll be sending more than the minimums. 

I have:

* $33k @ 6.75%

* $9k @ 4%

I also have an auto loan that is costing me $196/month. It started in December as a $9000 loan at 1.99% and has a balance of ~$8500.

I contribute the max to my HSA ($2900 I think? Employer contributes $500), and just enough to get the match on my 403(b) (it's a required contribution anyway, 3% from me and 5.14% from employer).

I have a 3-month income replacement fund, and I add to it with $50 deducted from each paycheck that I never see in my budget, it just goes straight to my off-budget Ally accounts. I also have a $1500 health insurance deductible. Both are in individual Ally 1.25% CDs from last year.

Almost the entirety of the HSA contribution is from a raise I got at the end of my first year from $45k to $47.6. I figure the HSA is a good way to force myself to save, and since I'm relatively disciplined and fairly healthy (haven't been to a doctor aside from a work-provided physical in the last two years), that it was a solid way to save pre-tax money, invest it, and probably be able to retire with some of it if I keep the savings rate up. If I were to not save that money, I'm not sure that I would be able to safely send it to student loans, I'd probably just be keeping it liquid anyway. I'm also under the impression that it is lowering my AGI and therefore helping keep my income based repayments lower.

As of right now, my HSA + my 403(b) contributions are working out to be ~15% of my gross salary. I figure it's a good habit to get into, and by my knowledge and calculation, it seems to be basically a wash between paying off the loans now or investing the 403b/HSA as long as I keep it in for the long run.

Am I wrong? Should I just accept the post-tax money from the raise and put it towards debt? Is there anything else I could do to shelter income from immediate taxes and/or reduce my IBR payments?

BONUS QUESTIONS:

Should I take my 3-month emergency fund and pay off any of the smaller debts? I know based on interest rates I should just hold onto the $9k/4% private student loan and the $8.5k/1.99% car loan, but it's so tempting to get rid of one of them. If I don't do that, then I don't feel comfortable just putting the $9k I have in the Ally CDs towards the private student loans because it won't change my monthly cash flow and my ability to save is 100% correlated with how cheap I can get my housing (not very).

I've lived at home for a year now rent-free but the commute to work (1.5 hours each way) is costing me more in time and gas and sanity than I'd like. Ideally I'd like to move out and into an apartment where my split of the rent is about $580 a month, plus about $150 in utilities.

The problem: with other expenses, bills, etc., (I live in a very high-cost-of-living area!), I can't keep paying $1K+ on my loans each month and expect to also pay rent, groceries, bills, etc. I just don't make enough monthly. 

Should I continue living at home for longer to get these loans paid down or should I commit to paying significantly less monthly on loans and move out to shorten and cheapen my commute? I feel like I'm going crazy living so far from work and in this tiny house with my whole family (4 kids, 2 parents, always people around, living out of boxes...)

personalfinance,Need Advice on Budget/Debt,"First post here so I hope I'm doing this right. I was just going through creating my budget to see how much my wife and I really have left over during a typical month.

We are both 26 and just had our 1st kid.

Net Income every month is about $5600. Our mortgage we pay minimum currently which is $1460 and almost 30 months into the 30yr mortgage.

We both have student loan debt mine is about 15k with a minimum payment of 399 I pay 450. Hers is about 17k and she pays $299/month

We currently have 1 car payment with minimum payment of $371/month over 72months.

After a typical month after all bills and entertainment expense (eating out/shopping) we are left usually ~1500-2000. This does not include credit cards which we definitely need to cut back on.

When I went through my budget I strictly went off of only payments from our bank account not our credit cards.

If you add in credit cards we end up ~1000 in the + column per month.

We only have about 1000 in savings currently.

My question for r/personalfinance is where should I be increasing payments. Should I be increasing mortgage and auto payments? should I just leave those payments as is and build up savings?

Would appreciate all advice.

edit: Auto Loan is 2.32% Mortgage is 4.5% I believe (need to double check) My student loan automatically pays off highest interest first but it is broken up into 8 different loans $1878.75 @ 6.55%, $2833.57 @ 6.55%, $3208.29@ 6.55%, $3571.90@6.55%, $585.60@3.15%, $1225.10@6.55%, $1824.76@3.15%, $212.39@6.550%.

personalfinance,[US][Credit] High credit lines,"I recently applied for a credit card through my credit union. Here's a little background explaining my question:

* I haven't had a credit card in 6-7 years. I have opened a store card here and there - immediately paying them off (just to get discounts - paid off before interest hit)
* One delinquency from about 12 years ago, that was settled and paid off in full.
* Paid off 2 cars, and bought a house since last credit card.
* Income:Debt ratio is good. $10k:$2k
* I have a good amount of savings. 6mos gross income. (but, the credit union never asked for this information)

I got approved (Yay!?) at the lowest interest rate available on the card. But, my line of credit is $24,000. I heard/read/imagined that having a high line of credit can be a bad thing. If all of my available credit is tied up in a card I have absolutely 0 intention of utilizing is that not an ideal situation?

The purpose of the card is to use it on lunch/coffee/gas, etc. Wait for the statement to be issued and pay it off during the grace period. It accrues points that can be exchanged for cash back offers that I want to utilize.

**TL;DR**: My question - I got approved for a $24,000 line of credit on my first credit card in a long while. Not sure if that's bad from the perspective of available credit.",finance

personalfinance,Explanation of WHY we should pay low-interest debt before saving for retirement?,"I'm finally in a position where I have the freedom to attack debt or save additional income for retirement. From everything I've read, on this sub and elsewhere, conventional wisdom says that once you've met employer match, pay off debt above ~4% before investing further in a retirement account.

I'm just about ready to move forward with this, but the idea of leaving that sweet compounding interest on the table is bugging me. 

Personal situation:

* 28 years old
* $65,000 annual salary, very low cost of living area
* $2,000/year employer match on 401(k)
* $65,00 in student debt, weighted average 6.5% interest rate

I feel like by grinding it out and paying off these loans over the next several years I'll be further behind the ball when I finally start to save beyond employer match, and may regret not starting earlier and starting to snowball compounding interest. Clearly I'm the one misunderstanding, but it'd be helpful to have it laid out to me *why* this line of thinking is incorrect.",finance
personalfinance,"SO just received life insurance pay-out, what is the best thing to do with it? Pay student debts? Down payment for house? Invest?","Hey PF, 

So my SO's mom passed away recently and he received a payout from her life insurance for approximately $110,000. We have been researching and reading, trying to decide what to do with the money/what would be smartest. 


He has about $50,000 in federal student loans. They are two separate loans, each at about $25,000. One of those loans has a 4.5% interest rate and one has a 2.5% interest rate.  Would it make sense for him to pay these off all at once? Or maybe just the higher interest rate one? We were looking ""Public Service Loan Forgiveness"" the ""Repaye"" option. We are not married, so if he signed up for that payment plan he would pay 10% of his discretionary income (he is a public school teacher) per month, which at this point would be doable for him. 

The problem we face here is that we would like to get married in the next year or two, but once that happens they will calculate the 10% of discretionary income from both our incomes. I am going into the medical field, so this would really raise the payments and if we calculated things right, he wouldn't actually have any of that debt forgiven after completing ten years of payments. We would actually pay about $55,000 total when factoring in both our incomes. 

So, pay it all off? I feel like it might be a smart thing to do, but just sending off half of that inheritance is scary/a bummer. But I understand it may be the smartest thing to do. It is also worth mentioning he has meh credit, score of 608, so would paying the loans off over some time using that money to build his credit be smart?

Ok, so whether or not he pays off the loans, he'll have about 110k - 50k still. He is not very responsible with money, a fact he is well aware of, so he wants to do something smart with it where it is also not super accessible. 


He was considering investing the money in an index fund. My understanding of this is that it is a good place to put money for a couple years? I'm in school and we'll be moving for my 3year grad program to a city that we would not want to buy a house in. Would it be smart to invest that money for the next 3-4 years, see if we can grow it at all, and then later use it for a down payment?

Another option is investing in real estate. We live in Hawaii, so houses are veeeeery expensive. We have been scoping some condos that are in the ballpark of 150-400k. We have only been looking at ones that we feel we could rent out for the equivalent amount or more than the mortgage payment + HOA.  There is the possibility we would live in it for about a year. In a year we pay about $18,000 in rent, so that would then be paid toward something we own instead. After this year we will certainly be moving for the aforementioned grad program, and that is when we would need to rent whatever we bought out. 

Ideally, we'd buy a house, no HOAs, no one telling you what to do, our preferred choice.  But a cheap 3bed/2ba house here is at least $500,000 (if its not a tear down) and that seems too steep for us at this time. We also feel like the market (real estate and rental) is inflated and maybe it will come down in a couple years? Could be wrong, certainly. 


So, TLDR;
SO got 120k inheritance. Should he pay 50k student loans? Invest remainder or entirety in index funds? Invest remainder or entirety in real estate?",finance

personalfinance,Car broke down and cannot get a car loan. Catch-22 type situation.,"Last weekend I went on a road trip of about 1500 miles to see my parents.  On the way my car broke down 4 times, and I had to stay in hotels for almost 7 nights.  Altogether it wiped out my savings and I ended up defeated, travelling home in a rental car with a completely depleted savings account.  

Thing is, I'm a Navy veteran recieving the GI bill as my primary income.  Total each month is $2082 with $600 for rent, $140 for bills, and ~$500 a month for food and entertainment.  So I have a little bit of income to play around with.  However, that trip wiped out my $4,000 I had in savings and actually put me in the hole for about -$400.  I sold the old car for scrap, sold my only handgun for $500 and I'm basically out of options.

I need a car.  I need a way to get to school.  I tried applying for a car loan of $5000 and they declined it since the GI bill cannot be used as income (even though I have 796 on my FICO).  I'm literally in a pickle jar trying to get out.  Banks tell me that I need a job to get a loan, but since I'm without a vehicle I can't get one.  I can't even get to school! Since I don't have a job, I'm pretty much hosed.

I tried looking on craigslist for a car but the SF Bay is full of fuckers who want $4000 for a 200k mile civic.  

The only saving grace is that I have 2 credit cards with a total of $17,700 limit (Funny, they won't approve my $5000 loan but they're okay with me having nearly $20,000 in unsecured credit)  I don't want to buy a car with a nearly 13% interest rate, but its looking like I might have to.

Here‚Äôs my situation: I‚Äôm 24 and live in Los Angeles, I‚Äôm living in a home with a few others and we aren‚Äôt on a lease and we are paying low rent, but there is the possibility of the landlord renovating the home in the next couple of years and forcing us out. I make $65k/ year + 5% bonuses every quarter, pending performance. My car is paid off  and in lieu of having low rent, I‚Äôve been spending more every month on my loans. I‚Äôm currently sitting on $16k in loans (5 separate loans varying interest rates) paying $500/month spread across all five.

* Loan 1: 	$2,854.93	4.250%
* Loan 2:	$1,103.89	6.550%
* Loan 3: $2,783.28	6.550%
* Loan 4: $3,206.36	6.550%
* Loan 5:	$6,329.08	3.610%

I‚Äôm paid ahead on my loans by $7k because I‚Äôve thrown money from my savings towards them because I really just want to be debt free. 
I currently have $5k in savings and float $2k in checking accounts for monthly bills/ utilities/ food/ fun/ etc.
My 401k is at $17k and I‚Äôve been contributing 10% for a while now.

My Idea: Withdraw from my 401k and from my savings account and completely pay off my student loans. The main reason for doing so is A) financial freedom and B) If my landlord decides to reno the house and rent it at a normal rate I would be forced to move out and pay higher rent elsewhere and continue to pay off my loans only I‚Äôd have to decrease my monthly payment and therefor extend the amount of time I‚Äôd actually be paying these off.

I know there‚Äôs a 10% deduction penalty and additional taxes for withdrawing early, as well as risking future financial retirement security, but I figure if I can pay these off in full, now, I can continue at my low rent spot for the time being, increase my 401k contributions while building my savings so by EOY I can move somewhere more stable while also having been adding more to my 401k.

Overall I think this is just a risk analysis I need to look at, from my end, BUT in the long run, being only 24, is withdrawing from my 401k this early THAT detrimental as many seem to think?

Although I‚Äôve been at my current job for seven months now, prior to that, I was working small contract/temp jobs for two years (not by choice.) That lack of security had me stashing every spare penny into an emergency fund. I thought of paying off debt, but staying liquid always won.

While I‚Äôm still technically a contractor, I‚Äôve have been told it‚Äôs pretty much open-ended until the company has the budget to absorb me. It will also hopefully come with a raise.

personalfinance,Have to pay off an outstanding tuition balance and I don't know where to start,"This is my first time posting in this subreddit, but a friend of mine recommended it so I figured I'd take a shot. It's a crisis that I've been wrestling with but made the horrible mistake of ignoring it until it reared its ugly head. 

I need to know if there are loan options for me to pay off a $25,899 balance on my student account. I'm being threatened to be sent to a collection agency. I can't believe that I let this whole situation snowball, but moving forward I need to know what I can do now. 

Are there firms that retroactively pay off tuition in the form of a loan that I would take out with them? What are interest rates like? What requirements do I need to meet? How soon can I have the loan go through? Which firms do you recommend? How flexible is scheduling repayment?

Sorry if I sound financially illiterate but this is my first forlay into anything this intensive in terms of personal loans and borrowing. 

Any and all advice is appreciated. I need to dig myself out of this whole.

CryptoMarkets,Let's talk about Changelly and transparency,"Hey all,

I've been having a lot of issues with Changelly lately, and while I expect their PR to kick in a say it's all good and it's my fault, it's not. Maybe not that many actually care, but I feel that the way they treat customers needs to be talked about. My main problem with Changelly is the lack of transparency in everything they do, where they always come up with a mostly reasonable explanation *after* you got screwed over. A couple of examples:

- If you buy any crypto with a Credit Card on their service you get a ridiculously lower exchange rate than market. Of course the actual exchange rate is not written *anywhere* on the site, you need to check for yourself (which you should anyway), and if you don't and complain later they say that hey, it's the Credit Card provider, it's not their fault, they sure have high fees but it is what it is. This is **not** ok, at least not with me. They should include the exchange rate and the fees one is incurring into, but instead they tell you that it's very convenient and fast, and nowhere you'll find the fees you'll be paying for the CC transaction.

- When asking for a refund they'll take forever to reply, and even if the problem is on their end you won't get a full refund. You'll get *almost* the whole sum, but not all. They'll keep something and they **won't tell you**. They probably won't even reply when you ask why you were refunded less than you spent, or they'll allude to some fee or another - again, after the fact and without ever even hinting about it before.

A footnote: their system is *always* overloaded with support requests, which means they are either severely understaffed, highly inefficient or their system is really, really bad.

I won't be using them again, which means I'll be having a harder time buying some cryptos, but so far their less than transparent behavior has always left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,[Europe] I'm able to pay off my mortgage. Should I do it or invest the money?,"Oh hi!
Some years ago I bought a very large, new, apartment with some inherited money, but took a small loan anyway to be on the safe side. 

At the moment I'm left with 20k‚Ç¨ to pay for another 10years, at a 4.1% fixed interest rate. Since my mortgage is so small I can't transfer it to another bank to get a lower interest rate (current ones are at 3% or less) nor negotiate a lower rate anymore. 

I also have 25 k‚Ç¨ in cash that currently sit down on the bank account for some 0.4% gross return a year (0.05 net or so a year).  No other debts whatsoever, free healthcare, I already own an apartment way better than needed and the car. And, I don't want to rely on that, but there's my family, in case (decent savings, guaranteed income, zero debts etc...). I also voluntarily put 200‚Ç¨/month in a ""voluntary"" retirement fund, which is completely optional here, as you already pay for the state pensions system. (It's like I saved 500‚Ç¨/month, but these 200 can't be used with the exception of retirement or special occasions).

If I paid off my mortgage that would leave me with a 7 months emergency fund, plus I save about 300‚Ç¨/month (when paying the mortgage which is 200/month) . So... What should I do? Pay off this mortgage or invest the money? My interest rate is 4.1% but I get a tax refund of 19% of the interests paid (3.3% effective interest rate). What kinds of solutions exist here in europe that could give me expected *net* returns higher than 4.0%, while being very safe? (You see I have little money, so I don't want to make risky bets).

I could increase my contributions to the retirement fund, but I don't get fiscal benefits if I put more than 5k/year, plus the money gets ""locked"".",finance

personalfinance,"Car Debt is Ridiculous, can I sell or trade my vehicle?","Hi PF,

First time poster here, let me start by saying i'm an a huge dumbass (at least 23 year old me was). I am now 25, I make 65k a year income from my job and the first thing I did with my new job was buy a brand new 2015 Chevy Camaro (I know I know....). At the time I was living with my parents and it was my only payment so it didn't seem like a big deal when I was pulling in more money than I had ever seen in my life a month. My car cost 24,xxx$ I have an auto loan with Chase with an interest rate of 7%. I pay off my loan monthly but at this point in my life my circumstances have changed drastically. I moved in with my GF and moved to a new state, blowing through all of my savings in the process.

My question is basically this, I pay ~460$ a month on my auto loan and another ~260$ on insurance (Florida). I owe about 19.5k still on the car, is there anyway to slice this where I could trade in or sell my car to get rid of this loan? I tried re-financing but my bank (Chase) could only offer me like 5% intereset and an increase in my loan term length AND they would only cover like 17k (I would need 2.5k out of pocket which I dont have at the moment).

Needless to say, I love my car. It puts a smile on my face everytime I get in it. However, I spent a ton of time worrying about it (It's the nicest thing ive ever owned) so I sink all kinds of $ into the car wash a month, cleaning supplies &amp; other random things to protect it. At this point I just need to get a more practical vehicle and get rid of paying this absurd amount every single month.

Is it better for me to stick it out and just pay it off? Or should I try to sell / get another vehicle?",finance
personalfinance,Offering 97% on asking price of new home...?,"Tiny backstory, I'm 7 years older than my boyfriend &amp; have been married, owned a home, and divorced. I feel as if I understand what to look for in a new home, &amp; I have a good idea on property value &amp; comps in the neighborhood. 
His family has bought a total of 1 home in the time he has been alive, &amp; they had immense financial help from their mother to offer a substantial down payment. Therefore, they could negotiate more. They feel we should be offering at least 10% less than asking, &amp; feel I was immorally swayed by the real estate agent, for her percentage to be higher. (We are putting no earnest money down, &amp; we are getting a federal grant for our down payment. No help from mommy or daddy here.)

That being said, here lies my problem:
My boyfriend thinks I pushed him into making a home offer that is unfair &amp; is questioning the morals of our real estate agent. We offered 97% of asking price &amp; are asking for closing costs. The seller has only been in the home a couple of years, paid $102,500 for it, &amp; is asking $106,900. The home is in a great family area, has a new roof, new hot water heater &amp; furnace, a dry basement installed, updated plumbing &amp; wiring, 2 wood burning fireplaces, &amp; no foundational or structural damage. I know to look past the cosmetic side &amp; look for the stuff that costs a lot to fix. The comps in the area are actually selling for an average of 98% of asking. The price of this house is also less than the assessed value.

My boyfriend thought we would ask 12% below asking to start &amp; negotiate from there. I reminded him, not only are we coming up with $0 of our own money, but we are also asking the seller to pay closing costs. We can not offer her less than she paid on the house! I feel the offer we made is fair, &amp; the seller will probably be enticed more to actually pay the closing costs if she at least breaks even on the property. 

Is the real estate agent really that hungry for chump change on this sale? Or are we going about this the right way? This should be a joyous event, &amp; my in-laws &amp; boyfriend think that I am a fool &amp; am being taken advantage of. This isn't my first house buying experience, &amp; I am insulted that they think they know better because they bought a house over 27 years ago. 

As a side note, my income is the only income in this deal as my boyfriend stays at home with the kids. His mom doesn't work, &amp; his dad has been working manual labor/kitchen work all his life. So it's not like he comes from a family of well informed accountants...

Please if anyone has any advice, opinions, feedback... I'm all ears. I'm already stressed enough from being pregnant with my 3rd child, &amp; working in a retail management position full time.",finance

The company stock never really performed, I got distracted by work for a couple of years, and last week I look at my account, and the stock has done pretty good. Let's not talk about short term stock - I'll ignore that for now and figure out ways to better handle incoming stock awards in the future. But regarding the long term stock:  

Stock amounts were originally adjusted and lessened when deposited into my Fidelity account on time of vesting. 25% for federal income tax (FIT), 6.2 percent for Social Security, 1.45 for medicare.

It's in a taxable account (Fidelity)

Its total cost basis is $186,000  


The unrealized gain is $158,000

I've read the information here on this site, and I gotta get this sold based on the recommendations in the articles and posts. I'm feeling nervous about the economy, possible war abroad, etc. I've got the emergency fund taken care of, and I'm contributing 15% of my salary to my pretax 401k and will probably retool that to include an additional IRA (probably a backdoor ROTH but that's another post), and fund an HSA more.


Question 1: So is my math right here regarding expected taxes?
.15 (cap gains rate) x 157,000 (unrealized gain) = $23,700
and then that could be minorly offset by the loss above. Is that it? Or is there some sneaky thing I am not factoring in? Like would it affect my tax bracket? I don't see how it would but I'm ignorant with this stuff.


Question 2: I'll probably max out the IRA once I retool my contributions as noted above. But where does this sold stock then move into? Should I just keep it in the taxable account and trade it for index funds that are in accordance with the allocation strategies in the wiki?


Question 3: Is this too much to sell in one year? I guess it would be a pretty big tax bill next year, but in a way it would lessen the burden of these stocks hanging over my head.

personalfinance,"First time home buyer in crazy housing market, lots of questions!","Hello /r/personalfinance!

I'm an occasional browser of this sub, but have never posted here. But recently, we have been considering purchasing a home for the first time, and I wanted to ask for advice. We have pretty much come to the conclusion that we are able to and want to, but want advice on best methods in doing so.

______________

***Current situation***

First, here's a quick overview of our situation: I'm married with no children, and we make ~$250k gross each year, steadily rising (I've had 25% and 10% raises in back to back years, and expect 3% minimum going forward, same for my wife). We have ""student loan debt"" of $80k but are in the fortunate situation of repaying a family member for that debt at a 2% interest rate ($600/mo payments). We currently pay $2425 for a one bedroom apartment (see ""crazy housing market"" portion of the title). We give $~1500 monthly to various non-profits and we want to keep that in tact, though we may shift to using ESPP shares twice a year to do so rather than giving cash monthly (using credit cards currently for points!). And we don't have any other unusual regular expenses, other than we probably spend too much on eating out each month.

______________

***Housing Budget***

For our house, we're looking for something up to $900k, as that's something we can do fairly comfortably.

For the downpayment, we have $100k set aside for using towards a house, then we also have $80k in various investment accounts that are easily accessible. In addition, we can pull $50k from my 401k for a loan if needed (one of my big questions!). So we *could* hit 20% downpayment fairly comfortably, but would deplete investment accounts or would have to take a 401k loan. Is that a bad idea? My first thought is I'd rather take from 401k where I'm paying myself back over 5 years and keep some investments on hand in case of emergencies, but I'm not that familiar with 401k loans.

My other options is an 80/10/10, which was a new concept to me. Idea is that I put down 10% (easily doable from what I have), then take 80% loan (no difference from above), and then 10% is Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). This HELOC I would only have to pay interest payments on (~5% interest and $700 payments, all tax deductable), and could refinance down the road and roll it back into one big loan. But if rates are going up, should I plan on refinancing? I'd think not... This to me was just another way to keep some buffer room with cash on hand, then could focus down the HELOC over a couple years hopefully, leaving me with a normal mortgage payment after 2 years, higher one the first couple years, but more cash on hand up front. What do you guys think about this option compared to above?

This all leaves monthly payments. With loan, property tax, HOI all included, we're looking at $4600 monthly. This is obviously much larger than our current rent, but a couple factors lead me to look at it similarly. 

First being tax write offs. We'd be able to write of $30k in year one, with a marginal tax rate of 37.4%. That gives us ~$1k extra per month that we can afford in mortgage compared to rent. Then if we change our monthly donations from giving monthly cash to stock, we lose an area we are normally saving (company stock, which we usually just ignore), and are essentially ""saving"" in our house.

So with those two large factors, the monthly payments would be essentially equivalent, plus or minus a few hundred per month, which we can adjust for comfortably.

____________

***Final Thoughts and Questions***

So given all that, a few questions:

1. What are your thoughts on borrowing from 401k?
2. What are your thoughts on an 80/10/10 as an alternative?
3. Or should I even consider doing both, just to keep more cash on hand in case of emergency?
4. Am I reaching too far on monthly payments? Is depending on tax write-offs too risky?
5. Please share any other thoughts or suggestions! I'm here to learn!",finance

personalfinance,[Credit] Last thing keeping me from good credit is a defaulted student loan...how to proceed?,"Long time reader, first time poster. This is a throwaway because it's kind of an embarrassing situation.

Years ago I was unemployed for a bit, and ended up defaulting on a small private student loan because they would not grant me deferal/forbearance/lower payments in any way during my hardship. I recently got a great job and now have plenty of money, but I want to find the best way to take care of this so my credit isn't buggered for longer.

So right now, this loan is the *only* thing hurting my credit report. It's with Navient and I can still see it when I log onto their site (which I do monthly to pay my other federal student loans) with a balance of about $5400. However, when I called them to ask about it they refused to talk to me and referred me to the debt collector they sent it to. And indeed, if I look at my credit report it is reported by Navient but in charge-off status. I tried disputing it, but they responded by mailing me a scan of the original promissory note with my signature on it, so that route is a no-go. Even though they have sent it to collections they seem to be the one reporting it to the credit bureaus and they have retained all the documentation.

So that in itself is weird. If they are reporting it, and I could I guess pay it on their website (I haven't tried yet but the button is there) then why are they telling me on the phone I need to go to a collections agency to pay it? 

The other thing is, I have the cash to go on their site and just pay it all right now (or as the case may be, call up whatever agency has it and settle it out with them). Thing is, according to the last credit reports I pulled, this thing vanishes from them in 9 months. I'm not out to stiff Navient for the money I borrowed, but will the charge-off still fall off if I pay the loan, or will it ""reactivate"" and now show up with all the years of missed payments and default for another 7 years? I'd rather feel like a scofflaw and have good credit than fork over five grand and get locked out of buying a house for 7 years in exchange.

Any advice on this, or anywhere I could go to get good information?

edit: Reading it back over I don't know if the weirdness with how to make a payment is entirely clear.

So I called Navient and asked what my options are to resolve, and they told me they will not accept a payment because they don't own the loan anymore, they sent it to a debt collector.

Then I sent a credit validation letter to the agency they told me. In response in the mail I received a copy of my promissory note...but the return address was to Navient, not the debt collection agency (I know Navient owns a few agencies, but the one they pointed me to is not one of them). This is why I'm skeeved out by the loan payment button on Navient's site, because on the phone they told me I can't pay to them. But at the same time, if they have the promissory note and show the loan on their site, how could I pay to a collection agency without my money vanishing into a black hole? And on top of all of that are the concerns about whether it would even help my credit at this point since the loan poofs off of there in less than a year anyway.",finance

personalfinance,Girlfriend wants to finance car to build credit,"Hi r/personalfinance! My 20 YO girlfriend, J, is looking to buy her first car. She has $5000 saved.

She could buy the car outright. Her only bills are about $300/month and she makes $1200/month. 

She will have to pay for full coverage insurance if she finances the car, which will increase her insurance premium by at least $50 a month for the 18 month period

personalfinance,Would creating a sub-30% debt payoff plan help with current maxed out CCs?,"Hey All,
Ever since I started my new job last month, I've been crunching numbers to establish an aggressive payoff plan for the remaining 14.5K in CC debt that I have.

&amp;nbsp;

On January 1st, I was at 460. Today I am at 597 (none of the cards have updated since last month though so that may go over 600 soon).

&amp;nbsp;

The remaining debt is as follows:


**Card # - $OWED ($MAX) APR%**

* Card 1 - $1,901 ($2,000) 0% (Note: 22.49% after 10/17)
* Card 2 - $2,585 ($3,000) 23.49%
* Card 3 - $2,183 ($2,500) 23.49%
* Card 4 - $2,801 ($3,000) 22.49%
* Card 5 - $664 ($3,500) 18%
* Card 6 - $4,416 ($5,000) 13.9%  

&amp;nbsp;

As you can see, utilization is quite high on each, roughly around 90% for all of the remaining balances. I've been using undebt.it to plan out a proper road path using the existing budget I set up. The minimum payments are around $500~, but I've budgeted and am dedicating $1,000 monthly to this process each month not including windfalls/OT/etc. in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

Now with all of that out of the way, on to my main point. In combination with getting my debt-to-utilization ratio down, I'm trying to come up with ways to best increase my credit score as I go to try to qualify for 0% APR transfer cards to ease the astronomical interest fees I'm paying at the moment (averaging $302.52 in Interest according to Undebt.it).

&amp;nbsp;

To combat this, I'm trying to come up with the best way to reduce my overall utilization so I can ""look better"" to creditors to either get these 0% APR Cards, or qualify for credit limit increases. On two that I zeroed out to try, their immediate response was my utilization was too high to have this done (fair of course, but worth the shot).
Now, while most people discuss paying off credit card debt, almost all of the chatter always focuses on the debate of Snowball vs Avalanche or a hybrid of the two. 

My thought AND question is this: would it be worth my time if I were to focus on getting utilization of my individual cards all down below the 25-30% utilization level instead of paying each one off one by one and letting the snowball/avalanche move to each card?

&amp;nbsp;

The plan I'm thinking off would do something like this:

&amp;nbsp;

Monthly Budget towards CC Debt: $1,000

* Current Total Monthly Minimum Payments: $507

* Card 1 is getting paid off right away before October 2017 to utilize the 0% APR.

* Card 2 gets both the minimum payment plus the ""snowball amount"" while Cards 3-6 are each staying at minimum payments.

* Once Card 2 has reached the 30% Utilization Level ($900 owed in this example), that snowball is shifted to Card 3, while Card 2 is reduced back to minimum payments.

* Once Card 3 has reached the 30% Utilization Level ($750 in this example), repeat for Card 4, 5, and 6.
As you can see, the only exception to my idea is Card 1 getting paid off completely before its cutoff time. The rest, I'm basically treating 30% utilization as the ""$0 mark"" before the snowball moves on to the next debt.

&amp;nbsp;

Note that the above order doesn't necessarily matter for this plan aside from Card 1 (I could change it to either highest interest rate or lowest balance), but just writing them down in the order I read them.

Once I hit sub-30% utilization across the board for all the cards, I'd use one of the standard snowball/avalanche payoff methods to completely zero out the balances.

Thanks again for reading and any thoughts/comments you may have.

*****
TL/DR: I have 6 credit cards in my debt payoff plan that are all near max utilization. Is there any benefit towards paying each down to only 30% (treating the 30% as the baseline temporarily) for my credit score to qualify for credit limit increases / 0% APR card qualifications?",finance

At the time of submitted my withdrawal request, I believe that was also my formal notice of course withdrawal. Apparently I was wrong, and two days late.

personalfinance,Where to go from here with my credit score,"So, let me first start off by saying that I think my credit score is fairly good (680 TransUnion, 700 Equifax) especially for where I am at in life right now. I'm looking for more specific help on where to go from here, especially since I am looking at getting a mortgage in 1-2 years. Below are some details on my credit score, then my financial situation.


Breakdown from CK:

0% credit card utilization

100% payment history

0 derogatory marks

1yrs 3 mos avg. credit history

10 total accounts

2 hard inquiries (0 on equifax report)


I have one credit card, a secured one through my bank. I use it almost daily and pay it off each month. Other than that, my only other accounts are my student loans. More on that in a moment.


As for where I am at, I'm done with college this month and have a full time position each year. I'll be bringing in $58,000 a year base, roughly $45,000 a year after taxes based on a 10% retirement savings and my state taxes.


I'll be living with my parents for the time being while I save up for a house, and pay off my student loans, and prep for my wedding.


Loan wise, I have 22,500 in federal loans, plus around 400 accrued in interest. What I am looking at doing is putting a thousand a month in to the loans, and saving fifteen-hundred a month for emergencies and a down payment. That puts me in a position to be debt free and mortgage ready in about 2 years.


My reason for not paying off the loans faster is this: the difference is only $500 in the end for interest, and since the loans are the bulk of my credit, I feel getting rid of them too soon would be a bad idea.


Should I go ahead and do the thousand a month, for two years? Am I missing something important here? What should I do in the meantime, apply for cashback cards every couple of months to build accounts?


Sorry if the answers are obvious or in the wiki, I just didn't see anything detailed enough to really cover this. Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Debt and Investment (Non-US),"For anonymity reasons I'd prefer to not mention certain details like the country or company I'm working in. Here goes.

I live in a country that has no taxes whatsoever, so all the tax-related topics do not apply to me. I am self-employed in a startup and earn about $6,000 a month. Our social security retirement pension fund takes a cut of about $560 a month, so pension fund is handled by the government.

In 2015 my parents were in a financial situation as they had invested money in real estate and the project was delayed, delaying their ROI for some time. They'd take a loan but the bank wouldn't grant it given that they're above the eligible age, so I helped them out and took it in my name with the agreement that they'd pay me the loan installments  (stupid decision, I know. Wish I could go back and change it). I also increased the loan amount to invest in my own startup.

The loan in 2015 was taken for 15 years, a total sum of around $140k. The terms of the loan is 5% interest rate fixed for the 5 years, then it changes for every other 5 years (+- 2% at the max).
I pay about $1120 monthly installments for it and my parents pay me back around $890 each month.

At the moment my personal expenses are around $600-$900 a month, though come the end of 2017 I may have to chip in with the rent as I live with my parents and that'll be another $600 more. I have no other debts and no credit cards (I strictly use debit cards).

I've been saving money and have totaled today an amount of $33,000. I calculated my emergency fund which should be around $9,000. If I continue to save in the same rate as I have been over the past year, I can close my $140k loan by 2020.

Here's where I'm not sure what to do. Should I close the loan or just continue to pay the minimum and invest the money I've saved? ($23,000)

Should I pay more than the minimum to reduce the loan or wait till 2020 to completely close it down in 1 payment?

If it's better to invest, would I need to consider liquidation in 3 years? If so, what are my best options for a 3-year investment?

Also, I've been watching Bitcoin and it seems promising for a long-term investment. Would it be wise to put some money into that?

I appreciate all the help I can get. Thanks in advance.

Summary:

* Income: $6,000 per month
* Retirement saving: $560 per month
* Loan installment: $1120 per month till 2030 @ 5% interest (can fluctuate every 5 years within 2% margin)
* Personal expenses: $600-900 per month
* Possible extra expense by end of year: $600 per month (rent)
* Other revenue: $890 (loan payback from parents)
* Total saving per month: $4,300-$4,600 per month (could decrease to $3,700-$4,000 by 2018)",finance

I am at a better job now and am looking at even better paying jobs so I'm in a position to start paying this debt down. I was considering opening a second credit card aimed at free balance transfers with no interest for 12 months to help pay it down.

My credit score seems to be around 700-720 depending, 720 the last time I looked. Would opening another card to do a balance transfer be a good or bad idea? Would I want to leave the other card alone after doing a balance transfer or would it be better to do some purchases but pay them off each month? I appreciate any advice you guys can give me",finance

**VIEWPOINT:**

Finnish nuclear law needs to enable advanced reactors

The draft update to Finland's current nuclear law would fix it to meet today's European requirements and the situation here in Finland. But if Finland aims to be a leader in clean energy and climate mitigation technologies, we need a more comprehensive and open-minded update, writes Rauli Partanen.

Practically all the credible scenarios and roadmaps (for example IPCC 2014) for effective climate mitigation require a significant increase to our current global nuclear capacity. The next generation of advanced reactors, commercialising in 2020s and 2030s, aims to meet precisely the needs that Finland will be facing after cleaning up its electricity grid in the early 2020s: Producing synthetic fuels for transportation, clean heat for district heating and high temperatures for industrial processes.

The next, more comprehensive update on the Finnish nuclear law should answer these future needs.

personalfinance,Student Loan company is telling me I cannot focus on one student loan debt without giving min payments across all my student loans. Any workarounds?,"Hi Reddit,

So next month I start paying my student loans. Logging into the portal, I see that I have 6 groups of loans.

Group | Balance | Interest Rate | Minimum Payment 
---------|----------|----------|----------
A | $5,745 | 3.4% | $59.41
B | $9,264 | 6.8% | $110
C | $5,779 | 3.8% | $60.99
D | $5,705 | 4.6% | $62.35
E | $7,813 | 4.6% | $85.39
F | $7,933 | 3.8% | $0

Total monthly payment: $379 (or something like that)


I want to focus on paying off my smallest loan then tackle the next smallest, etc (Snowball effect), but when I called the student loan company, Nelnet, they said if I want to focus on one loan, I have to give the minimum payment on all THEN give extra to the loan I want to focus on. I feel like thats going to take me even longer to pay off just one loan. I'd like to give the $379 (even more if I have the funds) to Group B, until it gets paid off, but they're requiring to disperse the money between all the loans. Of course, that is in their best interest that I take longer to pay them since they're collecting that sweet interest money.

Am I shit out of luck with this? Do I have other options on approaching this?

Sorry for the confusion if any, and thank you!

I graduated with a B.S. in Chemistry in May 2016. I have yet to find a full-time position in my field as most industry here is oil, gas, petro, etc. The stability lies in healthcare. I'm applying to a program that will certify and allow me to work in a hospital lab.

I'm just questioning how much I should request. I have approximately $3500 in credit card debit and my program will cost about $6-7000 in all. I'm considering pulling out $7-8,000 in a personal loan and paying off all my credit card debt. The remaining money I think will go towards saving for my apartment and all other school expenses.

Bitcoin,"Idea: Progeny AltCoins. Think of Bitcoin as Gold and a specifically programmed AltCoin-in-a-box as currency directly redeemable for Bitcoin held in a ""Fort Knox"" wallet.","So I have this idea which I haven't seen anywhere else, and wanted to share it to see if it makes sense or not.

My understanding is that bitcoin has some issues with transaction speed (and/or transaction cost) which causes people to worry about its ability to go mainstream and establish itself as a core global currency.

What if instead of expecting bitcoin to be as practical as USD, EUR, GBP etc, we actually thought of it more like the Gold of crypto?

Back when we tied our national currencies to gold, the [paper notes were meant to be literally redeemable for gold](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/history.aspx) (or silver, or coin, etc). The currency was tied to a guaranteed asset. 

Paper is much easier to carry around than gold. It is much more divisible (infinitely so) than gold. It is more practical in virtually every way possible - it just has no value outside of the promise it carries. It promises to be worth gold. So as long as people believe gold has value, the paper has value. And whether gold is convenient for handling transactions or not is irrelevant.

So why not use Bitcoin the same way? 

We need to program a specific ""AltCoin-In-A-Box"" program which anyone could easily run and create their own AltCoin. 

**It would work like this:**

During setup of the new AltCoin, the new blockchain programmatically ties itself to a bitcoin wallet, which we will call ""Fort Knox"". An exchange rate is chosen, for example, 1BTC = 1000 ProgenyCoins, and the setup is complete.

An interface is then made available which allows people to buy your newly created ProgenyCoins from the ""Federal Reserve"" of ProgenyCoin-istan. Register your intent to buy (provide bitcoin address where BTC are coming from, and ProgenyCoins address where your ProgenyCoins will go), then send 1BTC to ""Fort Knox"" and await the (slow, painful, horrific) BTC transaction to be confirmed.

As soon as the BTC transaction is confirmed, ""The Federal Reserve"" sends you 1000 ProgenyCoins. ""The Federal Reserve"" can produce as many of these coins as it needs to meet the BTC deposit in Fort Knox, and will only pay out ProgenyCoins for that reason. Similarly, sending ProgenyCoins to ""The Federal Reserve"" will allow you to withdraw BTC to a BTC wallet of your choosing.

Buying ProgenyCoins from the fed on this brand spanking new tiny blockchain which is optimised for rapid, free transactions has now given you a practical local currency to use in everyday transactions which doesn't require the bitcoin chain, but still benefits from all of the value held in the bitcoin chain. If bitcoin rises in value, so too will the value of your ProgenyCoins. And since all of these new progeny coins are being created by locking BTC up in ""Fort Knoxes"" all over the planet, the value of BTC is likely to increase to match the increased demand and lost supply.

Basically, the parent BTC blockchain is spawning lightweight, mostly-independent, children chains to do the transaction work for it. Hence the progeny reference. Obviously.

**Considerations and Risk**

1. By making the original code for this concept a well established opensource  piece of software, the ""AltCoin-In-A-Box"" certificate of BTC redeemability will guarantee the value of every new ProgenyCoin you encounter. Presumably the ""AltCoin-In-A-Box"" software could also include a generic platform which will handle all such coin-wallets in one place.

2. Each new coin will need to gain enough nodes/miners to ensure security against attacks before people can be confident trusting them to not steal their money.
Perhaps an international organisation can help provide early stage node hosting for a fee paid by the originator of the currency? (I haven't really put any thought into the incentivisation for 'mining' - I guess transactions would need a miner fee to ensure people did run full nodes?)

3. Many more I haven't thought of, I am sure.

personalfinance,"Moving to take a new job, but no emergency fund. Is a personal loan my best option?","So, I'm changing industries to start over at the entry level with the federal government. The starting salary is way more than I've ever made in my life, but still not all that generous (low $50s). Still it's a good opportunity with an upwards trajectory. 

The problem is that taking the position will require a major relocation. (NY to TX). The employer said upfront that they will pay no relocation costs, and I couldn't get them to budge in negotiations.
We (wife and 2 kids) have virtually no savings at the moment. We *used* to have $5k in emergency savings, but an unexpected tax bill (see post history) and some mandatory car repairs have brought that down to $1k.

I'm estimating that it will cost about $7k to move. And that in renting a new place we'll have to do about $3k security deposit plus first month's rent. We have excellent credit and can easily charge the whole cost to the credit cards, but I am wondering if there's a better way to try to finance this expenditure than reverting to the CC's.

***Edit: Thanks everyone for all the advice. I ended up calling my bank and they gave me limit increase and a 12 month 0% cash advance of 10k on my CC to cover costs for a $300 fee. We'll look into economizing on the move, and just pay the rest back against the card directly.

personalfinance,Best order to pay off these credit cards in? All 0% interest,"Hello! I've built up almost $8k in credit card debt over the past 5 or 6 years. It was just due to being silly and spending beyond my means, and I've come to my senses now and am determined to get all of this paid off and be credit free within 2 years. My credit score isn't terrible - 610. I haven't missed a payment in about 5 years, and there's nothing that's ever gone to collections, so I think the only thing that's going to improve that score is actually reducing the debt.

This is my current debt vs. credit limit on my different cards:  

* $500 / $3000 limit  

* $1000 / $2200 limit  

* $2400 / $4000 limit  

* $4000 / $5700 limit

So my first question is, what's the best order to pay these off to improve my credit score? Do I concentrate on the smallest debts first or the biggest? Is it worse for my score to have one card with a really big debt or the same debt spread across a few cards? I haven't mentioned interest rates because thanks to some balance transfers/reshuffling last year, they're all on a 0% offer period for a while yet.

My second question is, once I've paid a card off, do I close the account? Does an old account that's open but fully paid off look better than someone who just doesn't have a bunch of credit cards in the first place?

personalfinance,Helping a friend with her student loans,"To start, let me apologize if the format of this gets messed up (Typing on a phone).

My friend came to me asking for advice on the best way for her to pay off her student loans. Currently she has way to much in personal savings that is just sitting there earning 0.9%. So I figured this was the best place to get advice for her. 

Some background, she makes around $54k a year (after taxes, 401k, insurance, etc.) with monthly expenses at about $2,750 (which includes a car loan of $28.5k with an interest rate of 0.9% and a monthly payment of $565).  That being said she has $33.5k in savings and 3 additional loans. The first loan has a balance of $18k with a 4.0% variable interest rate. Her second loan has a balance of $5.7k with a 3.25% variable interest rate. These two loans are consolidated and have a minimum monthly payment of $180 together. Her final loan is a loan from her family for $21k and she doesn't pay any interest on that one nor have a minimum monthly payment.

My initial thought was for her to set aside a 6 month emergency fund from her savings and then with the remainder immediately pay off her second loan. Then dedicate the rest of her money and monthly payments to her first loan. Then she can work on the car loan and finally the family loan.

personalfinance,Mom died. I am executor and sole beneficiary. Need to figure everything out.,"I know there are already threads like this and I've already read through them, but I was hoping some of you lovely people would give advice on my specific situation.

My mom passed away fairly suddenly a little less than two weeks ago. My father is deceased, she was never remarried, and I have no siblings. In a handwritten letter that she left for me she requested I give some money to certain family members (which I will honor), but the actual Will names me Executor and sole beneficiary of everything. I have the original copy of the Will signed by her and two witnesses, however it is not notarized and doesn't appear to be from a law firm. It looks like something she downloaded a template for, filled in the blanks, and then signed in front of two coworkers who signed as witnesses. (I'm sure I could get the witnesses to appear on my behalf but would rather avoid it if possible). State of residence is PA (for both her and myself). I also have plenty of official copies of the Death Certificate.

**Her Life Insurance / Assets**

- $244K in life insurance. I am only beneficiary.

- $67K in a 401(K) that I am named beneficiary of.

- A condo that she owed $115K on. Based on real estate website estimates and recent comps I'm guessing it's worth about $200K. One comparable unit (same floor plan, less updated) did sell for $165K last year though, so I could potentially use that to fudge down the value if it benefits me. (I have no desire to live in this or rent it out, so I will almost definitely sell). 

- $4K in a joint savings account that my name is already on.

- $2K in a checking account that my name is not on, with probably another $2-3K coming at the end of the month from her final paycheck.

**Her Debts**

- A car that she owes $18.4K on. Based on research I think I could sell it for slightly less than that, so I can probably get out of it with just a small loss if necessary. (I'm sort of tempted to take it over because it's really nice and my car is not, but I already own my car so I feel like this is not the prudent financial decision). 

- I'm guessing around $10K in credit card debt (haven't figured that out for sure yet, but that's an educated guess).

- We also had about $15K in funeral expenses, plus $1,500 in travel expenses for my immediate family (she was buried in another state...long story). This is being paid out of the life insurance, but I wanted to mention it in case it can help me on the estate.

**My Family / Financial Situation**

- I am married with one child and another on the way.

- I have about $45K in student loan debt. My mom had been paying this off for me and I'm not sure of interest rates. Regardless, I will be paying this off with life insurance immediately. She made me promise years ago that I would and I intend to keep the promise.

- My wife has about $70K in student loan debt. Interest rates range from 3-6% depending on the loan.

- We have a house that we bought last year with no money down on a USDA loan. We owe about $233K on it and that's probably just about what it's worth. Interest rate is 3.65% and we pay about $100/month in PMI. (I know many won't approve of this choice, but it's already done and we're currently happy with the house).

- About $3K in recent credit card debt that hasn't yet accrued interest but will next month if not paid off. About another $1K in credit card debt that won't accrue interest until Sep.

- About $5K in savings. No retirement account (yet). 

- Enough monthly income to pay all the bills and living expenses each month and still put a small amount into savings.

- One car owned and another that we owe about $16K on at 2.9%.

**Things I've Already Done**

- Got 15 official copies of the Death Certificate

- Notified one creditor (Synchrony Bank) about her passing. (In retrospect I kind of wish I hadn't, but she had a payment due and I wanted to avoid late fees). Turns out she has several lines of credit with them.

- Informally notified her bank of her passing. Haven't provided a Death Certificate yet, but I stopped in the branch yesterday to ask some questions.

**Things I Haven't Done Yet**

- Taken her Will and Death Certificate down to the Register of Wills. Was planning to do that after work today, but can hold off it might benefit me.

- Notified her mortgage company, car loan, or any other creditors about her passing.

**Questions**

- Can/should I just make mortgage/utility/condo fee payments in her name until I can sell it? At what point, if at all, do I need to/should I convert the mortgage into my name?

- Instead of declaring her checking account on the estate, can I just leave it open as-is and use it to make the above payments temporarily?

- As credit card payment due dates come and go, should I make the minimum payments out of her checking account or just let them go? Will late fees be assessed?

- If the condo is the only thing in the estate (nothing liquid), what is the process by which creditors seek reimbursement from it?

- Any other advice or anything you think I'm missing?

Credit Karma recommends that the best way to build my credit score (currently about 660) is to have more accounts open, I figure the best way to go about this would be to get a credit card, use it to buy groceries and such, and then pay in full every month like a good doobie. Given my credit score, what's the best card that you guess think I'd be approved for? Because obviously I want to limit the number of hard pulls on my account. To add a few criteria, I'd prefer a card with no annual fee, I don't care about the APR or penalty APRs because I don't intend to ever put more on the card than I can pay off that month, and a good/decent cash back program would be nice.",finance

personalfinance,(2017) Leasing vs Buying: Leasing can be at par with financing/paying cash even when holding the car long term.,"I am getting a new Honda Odyssey EX-L and have been running the numbers on leasing vs financing vs paying cash. I will be keeping the car until 200,000 miles.

MSRP: 37,100
Purchase Price: $32000
(Excluding taxes in all scenarios)

1. Leasing for 3 years, then financing for 6 years:
Lease terms: 

- 12k miles per year
- Money Factor: .00030
- Residual: $19,663
- Monthly Total: $350
- Total lease payments: $12,600 (350 X 12)

Now I finance the car at the end of 3 years @ 3% for 6 years.

- Total amount financed: $19,663
- Monthly payment: $299
- Total of all monthly payments: $21528

Total cost to full ownership: 34,128.

2. Financing out the door for 5 years ( I could technically finance for 8 years, but interest rates are very high. Incentives don't apply):

- Purchase price: $32,100
- 1.9% loan at 60 months: $559/mo
- Total cost to ownership: $33540.

Opportunity cost of money:
Leasing, then buying costs less in the first 5 years.  
In the first 3 years there a monthly difference of $209. Invested at 6% and compounded annually we will have a total of $8491 after 3 years.

In the subsequent 2 years there is a monthly difference of $260. Starting with the $8491 and adding $260 per month, also at 6% annually, we will have $16,061 in saved cash compared to financing. But I will also owe about $13,232 in the case of leasing then buying. Assuming that I keep the $16061 invested at 6% and withdrawing the $299 monthly for payments, I will be left with $1797. So have some wiggle room on interest rates.

So, is leasing the absolute best thing in this scenario?

I have often heard people saying ""Lease a car if you want a new car every 3 years"", but it seems to me that ""You can also lease a car if you want to keep it for the long term"" and possibly come out ahead, while retaining low monthly payments.

I'm wondering if that is just standard procedure when they send back for anything. Like if no matter what they ask for w2s of it is sent back (it was I supposed to send them the first time and I'm just dumb?) or if this implies they are taking a deeper look at them.

So effectively $2k/mo in expenses currently and I'm looking to add a car. I've currently got $3k saved up.

I've been looking at cars in the 10k-13k range, newer mid size cars (I'm a tall person, compacts don't work). I'd like to put $3k down, and then blow through the loan payments as fast as possible so interest doesn't gouge me too badly.

personalfinance,"Would you guys mind critiquing me? Who am I kidding, of course you wouldn't!","I'm (attempting) to put a detailed table below with our income and expenses. I believe that, in a nutshell, we do a good job of paying ourselves first/saving, and we do a good job of keeping our fixed expenses low. However, once we're done paying ourselves, we... pretty much spend whatever is left on retail/lifestyle stuff (online shopping, house decorations, home improvement stuff, etc). There's probably some room for improvement here, as it's 12% of gross income. However, it is within our means and is only done after we first pay ourselves.

&amp;nbsp;

We keep an emergency fund of $10,000 in a checking account which we also operate out of, because the checking account is with a small local Credit Union that gives us 2% interest on the balance. If our monthly spending is higher than normal, and our balance is dropping below 8-9k then we have a family meeting, tighten our belts and save up for a month or two to bring our balance back up. When we get over 10k balance, we'll use it for some non-urgent planned expense, or contribute to our kids' ESA's.

I feel like our next step/goal financially would be to budget appropriately enough that we could begin regular contributions to our kids' ESA's (ages 6 and 2). We are not there yet, and although we contribute periodically, it is not consistent.

personalfinance,Annual interest rate calculation on regular investments,"I have various investments in indexes here in NZ through a company called ""Smartshares"" (Which is basically the NZ version of Vanguard). They allow regular monthly investments with no trading fee, so for the past 3 years or so I've deposited $100 a month into various funds.

I use Google Finance to track my gains and losses. As it stands now, on one of my tickers I am up 32.06%. But the issue is that's over 3 years, and I can't just divide that by 3 as the money I put in last month is being included and it's essentially gained 0% (Or maybe that is the way it should be calculated?). 

So my question is, is there an equation I can use to work out an annualized gain when doing regular contributions?",finance
personalfinance,Interest on Federal Student Loan While In School,"I can't seem to find any answers on this question, but I'm sorry if this has been answered before.

I will be going to graduate school later this year and will take out some federal unsubsidized loans to help with living expenses while at school. The way these loans work is you can defer payments until 6 months after you graduate, but interest starts accruing from the time you take out the loan. If you don't make any payments while in school, then the accrued interest gets added to your principal (they call this capitalized interest), increasing future interest as well. 

Everything I've read on the studentloans.gov and other places on the internet says you will save so much money by paying interest while you're in school instead of letting the interest get capitalized. My calculations show the opposite though. Let me explain my calculations:

Assumptions: Amount = $20,000. Interest rate = 5.31% Repayment period = 120 months, starting 6 months after graduation (or 27 months after initial loan disbursement).

Say I take out $20,000, and I will have 27 months between the disbursement and when the normal repayment begins (6 months after graduation). If I pay interest each month on that $20,000 it will be $88.50 a month for the 27 months, and then monthly payments of $215 a month starting 6 months after graduation. In total I'll pay $28,210.

If I take out $20,000 and let the interest capitalize, then when the repayment period starts, I'll pay $242 a month and in total pay $29,090. So according to this logic, it's better to pay the monthly interest while in school because you'll pay $880 less overall.

But wouldn't it make even more sense to just take out a smaller loan amount and let it capitalize? Instead of paying the $88.50 interest only payments a month while in school (total of $2,390), wouldn't it make more sense to just decrease the total loan by that much? By my calculation if I take out $17,611 in loans instead of $20,000 and let the interest capitalize, then my monthly payment will be $213 and I'll end up paying $25,615 - which is $2,600 better than taking out $20,000 and paying interest each month. 

Am I thinking about this wrong? Everything on the internet says I'd be better off paying interest each month during school, but to me it seems like a no brainer that you should just reduce your total loan amount by what the monthly interest payments would be while in school.

Am I missing something? Would it really be better to take out $20,000 and then use $2,390 of that to make monthly interest payments?

personalfinance,I am in over my head. Please advise if bankruptcy is the best choice.,"Hey guys, I am big lurker and rarely ever post, but  would like your insight.

To give as much detail as possible, currently I am exactly $21,665 in credit card debt (almost $750/month in minimum payments). I owe almost $60,000 between 2 vehicles ( one is for a pickup truck at 5.5% @$850/month and one is a car for 11% and $620/month). We took out a personal loan from lending club and owe almost $8,000 to them (the interest rate is something insane, like almost 30% but we were desperate) @$420/month. We also owe almost $2,000 for a mattress we bought @$160/month. We also have about $10,000 in medical debt from a emergency room visit. I rent a cheap cheap house in North Texas and pay $600/month. Also, my wife was hit from behind and totaled a vehicle in January that we owed more than it was worth, and after the insurance payed out we still owe almost $8,000 on a car we no longer own @$500/month (learned a huge lesson, get GAP insurance kids). I am current on everything but I am stretched so far in minimum payments that I don't have hardly any money left over at the end of the month to try and pay this debt.

 My wife works and brings home about $1,000 bi-weekly, but we are expecting a baby in july and she will be leaving work soon to take care of our son. 
Now, I own a small trucking company, but business has been slow and I can only afford to pay myself about $650/week right now (net). I started this company around this time last year and it was very slow to get off the ground, that is the reason we got the lending club loan, we didn't really even have money to put gas in the tank or feed ourselves and this offered a way to survive so I took it.

I realize our finances are a giant mess. It keeps me up at night and I hate hate hate being in debt like this. I have been working really hard, and trying to pay off this debt that I know I owe but I have gotten nowhere. With the fact that my wife will soon be leaving work, I have been racking my brain trying to think of ways I will be paying these minimum  payments once she leaves. Honestly, I was raised by very financial responsible parents ( I am a first generation Mexican-American and my parents always worked several jobs to make ends meat) that carried very little debt and I feel like a huge failure. This looming debt has me very depressed and I have been contemplating suicide. The only reason I have not done it is because I learned most life insurance policies do not pay on suicides. This debt is all I can think about and I hate it. I know we got ourselves in this situation, but when I learned about bankruptcy I finally saw a light at the end of the tunnel. A fresh start is what I dream about. I feel like if i could just hit the reset button, I would do so much better with a fresh start. I have not used my credit cards in months, I feel like I have learned my lesson when it comes to credit card debt. Pay off your balance at the end of each month. 

Anyways, I was hoping to get your insight on my situation. Once my wife leaves work, I wont be able to pay the minimum payments on everything and things will start to get behind. Bankruptcy right now seems like a god send. I know it ruins your credit, but the last thing I want right now is to borrow more money.",finance
personalfinance,"23yrs old and buying a home/condo, is this a bad idea? Looking for advice and clarification on some details","So the title is just the gist of things, let me explain my situation some more so you guys can better understand.


I'm 22, turning 23 in August, living in Southern California.


I have a stable job as a software engineer making 80k a year (a bit more with overtime, maybe ~5k), but I feel like I am underemployed and considering studying for tech interviews again in pursuit of a higher paying/ more interesting job at a company such as Microsoft/Google/Amazon, which are all in my area.


Recently I have decided that I don't want to live with my current roommates anymore. Something that I've realized during the past 5 years of living with roommates is that just because you are good friends, doesn't mean that you are good roommates for each other. I prefer to sleep early and wake up early while they prefer to stay up late drinking on the week days. Regardless, that ship has sailed since I have given up my spot in the house to another friend of ours.


After explaining this situation to my mom, she looked at apartment prices and decided that it would be better to buy rather than rent. So I guess a more appropriate title would be ""Mom is buying me (23yrs old) a condo, is this a bad idea?...""


My mom used to be a real estate agent in the area I'm now looking for a house in and has decided that a 2 bedroom is best so that the place can eventually be resold easily and we're only looking at 2 bedrooms around $600,000. 

My concern is that a 2 bedroom condo is too much for me to afford on my current salary.


Normally, this wouldn't be feasible at all, but my family has considerable money... we're not ""fuck you rich"", but we're well off. My mom has agreed to put up a down payment of $200,000 so that my mortgage loan would be ~$400,000 over 30 years. At 4%, this would put my monthly payments at ~$1950 according to Google's calculator.


After taxes, benefits, 401k, RothIRA, I usually take home $1000-$1100 a week. So basically I'm expecting to pay about half of my monthly income to my monthly payments and I want to know if this is a stupid idea? I have no other monthly payments (my car is owned by my family and payed off) and the rest of my expenditures are basically food, clothes, entertainment, and investments.


I'm concerned that if I pay so much of my paycheck each month to housing, I won't be able to invest in indexes and mutual funds. My mom says that instead of indexes and mutual funds, I'll now be investing in the house, but is the return on a house going to be more than Vanguard or BlackRock? I always hear about rich people investing in real estate but I don't understand it well.


The obvious answer to my money concerns would be to rent out the second bedroom, which I am not excited about but I'm realizing that I might not have a choice. If I do find a roommate, I'd want to make sure it's as perfect of a match as possible and spend a decent amount of time searching for one. I'm worried that during the time I'm looking for one or if I can't find one I won't be able to afford the $1950/month.


Another question I have about owning a home is that it's apparently supposed to reduce my taxes because I can claim it as a deductible or something like that. Currently I am not claiming any deductions since I don't have any kids or a home or car, but is there anyway to calculate how much owning a house would save me on taxes? I'm currently being wrecked, paying almost 30% of my paycheck each week to federal and state taxes.


Anyways, sorry for the long essay but thank you for reading and for any advice you may give. To sum up, the main points are:

* My mom wants to me to buy a $600,000 2 bedroom condo, but will give me $200,000 for the down payment.
* This leaves me a mortgage loan of $400,000, which at 4% makes my monthly payment $1950 as calculated by Google.
* I make ~$4k/month after taxes, benefits, retirement savings.
* I have $15k sitting my savings and maybe $3k of shoes and clothes I could sell if necessary.
* Is it possible for me to survive on my currently salary without a roommate?
* Is this a smart investment?
* Will this save me money on my taxes and is there anyway for me to find out how much?

I guess it's worth noting that the whole reason my mom is doing this is because our family has money, but I have no idea how much since she won't tell me and because of that I don't want to be reliant on it or to need a bailout from my family if something goes wrong.

personalfinance,Do I Need A Financial Planner?,"Hi r/PF,

My question is whether under the following circumstances you would recommend I **pay** for a financial advisor/planner.

My fiancee and I are both attorneys. We are both 27. Our household income is $140,000.00 annually. No children. We rent a house for $1,500/mo.

We have around 400k total in student loan debt that is currently in repayment under the federal PAYE program. We have no trouble meeting that payment and would probably be okay meeting even the full 10-year level repayment rate. There are some unresolved questions about optimal repayment plans for us as our incomes grow in the next few years of our practices, but nothing firm on the horizon right now. No other debt, no car payments, CC paid off every month, no health issues, etc.

We are currently wrapping up a few major expenses (a move to a new state, a wedding) and beginning to look at buckling down and saving at least half of our take-home pay over the next year or two. 

However, our current cash balance is only around $5,500 due to late '16 Roth contributions.

I am fairly financially literate. The current plan is to maintain a liquid emergency fund, then max matched 401k contributions, (I understand in the flowchart that debt repayment comes next but given the scope of our debt, the current uncertainty of when our incomes will increase, and the potential for forgiveness under PAYE, I think there's a question mark here), then fill other tax favored accounts, then buy market investments.

My question is, under these circumstances, should I pay any amount of money at all to get advice from a financial planner?",finance

Another option is to pay an additional $10,920 between the next two semesters. This is given my financial aid remains the same. I would be taking 22 credits in the fall and 23 credits in the spring.  

My rationale behind this is that I can start working full time in the summer of 2018, rather than the start of 2019. I was fortunate enough to get a paid internship this summer at a great company as a data analyst. I'm hopeful that it can turn into a job offer. Entry level would be ~50k  
&amp;nbsp;

Some other factors  
I will have ~15k saved up after this summer.  
I work long hours on the weekends, may not want to do this if I'm taking additional courses.  
Is there something wrong with me thinking the time I spend between next spring to end of fall (graduation) is wasted? I suppose getting another internship could be valuable; thoughts?  
I'm at the point in school where I just want to finish/stop obtaining debt. I'm a transfer student and I really like the academic program, but not loving the whole commuting from home and working weekends to pay for school.

personalfinance,"looking for a job, but have a 'mark' on my record - advice?","edit;; aaa, looks like i put this in the wrong subreddit. thanks to anyone who offers advice or takes the time to read anyways.

---

pardon the length of this post - i tried to keep it brief as i know people don't have time for novels, and i'm including what i feel is the most important information. there's just a lot of it. it's wayyyyy longer of a story than what i'm putting here.

basically, i got hit with a 'bad stretch' of jobs for about two or three years (essentially right after my first high school job) - at this point i'm considering that i might be cursed lmao. the first one closed almost immediately after i went to school, so there was no returning to it once my schedule permitted.

my second job was fast food, and while i was working 32+ hours a week for $7.25, i sure as hell wasn't bringing that money home. essentially, my management decided since we were severely understaffed, it was okay to 'fix our hours' without our knowledge and pay us for anywhere from 3-7 hours less than we worked a week. 

went to whoever i could about it, but they 'couldn't find any problems' since i signed my time slip (obviously, me wanting to have money to eat and pay bills was not nearly as important as calling them and waiting a few days for them to give me the money i worked for) and took my check. obviously not one of my better choices but, hey, some of us will take what we can get. 

anyways, the day after i found out this was happening, i walked out of the job without a two weeks notice (d'oh) and was told by my manager that 'i would never get a recommendation from the company'. not super relevant, but every one of my coworkers, and the district manager who allowed these practices, has since been fired from the company. this one doesn't bother me so much. oh well.

fast forward a few months to my next job - this is at a thrift store. and well, it went great for a while! we had a wonderful manager, and the district manager only occasionally came in to complain and bitch. however, about a month or two into employment, they decided to kick my old manager out and bring in a new one - hey, it happens right? everyone loses a manager they like once in a while.

it was evident pretty quickly - from the frequent visits by the DM to the store just to see our manager, to the constant e-mailing and texting, to the talking on the phone every minute of the day - this woman got her job not because of her qualifications, but because she was a 'good friend' of a powerful person. she had managed a much smaller store in another part of town, and we had the biggest store in the area. it was a pretty clear move. the lady was a recently convicted drug addict with a literal mug shot available online. employees AND customers knew about it and felt uncomfortable.

she couldn't do her job worth a damn. she gave things away for free to her friends when they came in, if she thought a guy was cute she would give him free shit, refused to serve certain customers because she had personal problems with them though they had been shopping there for a long time and i had personally dealt with them and had no trouble whatsoever, her favorite employees got to set aside stuff from the back room before it went out on the sales floor (the official rule being you can't take anything until it's been out on the sales floor for 24 hours). 

she played favorites with employees (better scheduling for friends, more hours, putting in for raises), personally verbally insulted people in meetings, accusing her employees of stealing (and she said nothing after later finding the merchandise that was misplaced).

to cut an even longer story short, me and about four of my co-workers beat it, and quick. despite my telling her  very clearly that i am no longer working there - i QUIT - about two weeks later i receive a letter. i had been 'discharged' from my job for abandoning my duties. my other co-workers, who to varying degrees had told her to go shove it, received the same letter. 

no one was allowed to 'quit' - no, she had to MAKE SURE they paid for it like the scumbag she is. and signed right at the bottom was her name, and the name of her best buddy, the district manager. i can't really even call to get this resolved - because we ALL know where my complaints get directed! 

i've given up and removed the job from my resume entirely - i'd at least like a chance to get a job for once, haha. and any time i list it on my resume, i dread the inevitable question - ""have you ever been discharged from a job or asked to resign?"" it sure as hell says i was on my record, even though the words 'i' and 'quit' definitely left my mouth before i left that store.

aannnnd i'm pretty sure if i put 'no' in response to that, and they call the store, that's gonna be some hot water for me. should i just forget this job ever existed and deal with the questions of 'why do you have such a long gap between jobs?' - or should i spend 300 words per application explaining how a corrupt b*tch pegged me for abandoning a job i told her i was done with anyways.

after leaving, i would still visit the stores around town - and i spoke to the store she managed before. she had chased off a lot of employees, and made employees who had been with the company for 10+ years leave in tears because of how she treated them. i had customers tell me to my face that 'they will never to go that store as long as she is managing it'. so. you know.

as of last week, i've moved over 1,000 miles from that hellhole, but the bullshit practices of my previous employers are still haunting me on my current job search. i don't have time to hope some employer takes pity on me and hires me despite all this. i need a job NOW. i need rent NOW. i have a few months rent before this permanently screws me over and leaves me homeless.

if anyone has any relevant questions, feel free to toss them in the comments and i'll respond as quickly and in as much detail as i can. also, i was suggested by my bf to use this sub, but if you think this would be better suited for another sub (like jobs) then feel free to push me in that direction.",finance

personalfinance,18 (M) about to go to college may need to take out a loan? Questions about student loans?,"So, I have a friend who is 18 and will be attending college in the fall in August. He doesn't have a car but was planning on taking out a loan to pay cash for a car and to pay somewhere near $1500-2000 of the rest of the remaining tuition and fees each year after fafsa and grants are subtracted. Is him taking out a loan to pay cash for the car a good idea? He was expecting to pay no more than $2000-3500 for a car. So I guess the total amount for a loan for his first year of college will be no more than $5000-$5500.

I don't know much about student loans nowadays because me and my friends were able to receive full scholarships and not take out a loan, so I don't know who to ask for this kind of information around me. I would just like to give him the best advice so he doesn't have much to pay back after he graduates.

A few other questions:
What are the most common different types of student loans?
Do all student loans have grace periods? 
Can he take out any amount that he wants or is it a given amount based on tuition? 
Should he start paying back on them his junior year in college to avoid a higher interest rate?

Any recommendations to certain loans will be greatly appreciated. 

Some extra information if it helps:
He lives in Kentucky and will be attending Indiana University Southeast with in-state tuition. 
I can provide more info if needed.

personalfinance,Thoughts on Options for PLUS vs. Personal Student Loan Repayment,"At 19, I stupidly took out a lot of loan debt. I went to grad school and was a bit more cautious but alas, here I am with 78k in student loan debt, a gross salary of 50k, and no way to travel back in time and slap myself in the face so here I am.

In my name, I have ~22k in debt at interest rates between 3.4 and 6.2%. As PLUS loans in my parent's name, I have ~56k at 7.9%. My credit score is about ~750 and my dad's credit score is improving but currently in the low 700s. (Don't have anything more exact than that at this time.) I've agreed to pay off the PLUS loans because I don't feel right about someone else paying them. He has his own, similar loan debt burden and has saved little for retirement.

I am ready to buckle down and throw money at my debt. I have 3 months of expenses saved, got rid of my car and use public transportation (44/month), and eat just as I did when I was a grad student. However, I do not know which option to choose.

Breakdown of loans in my name:  
~2,800 @ 3.4%  
~6,000 @ 6.2%  
~13,000 @ 5.84 %  

PLUS Loans:  
~55,800 @ 7.9%  

I see 3 options.

1) Make minimum payments on my own loans and focus on paying down the PLUS loans first because they have the highest interest rates. I don't get to take advantage of tax benefits this way but I guess I never will so no sweat?  

2) Make minimum payments on PLUS loans and pay down the loans in my own name first. This way I could improve my own credit and maybe be able to refinance the PLUS loans at an even lower rate. 
 
3) Refinance the PLUS loans in my own name through an appropriate lender at a lower interest rate now but lose all the benefits for federal student loans on a large chunk of change.  

I am leaning towards 3?

A morbid, shameful consideration of mine is that my father is not in good health. Another consideration is that if I stay with my current employer for 10 years, I may qualify for PSLF. This is my first ""real"" job, I like it a lot and it will give me very impressive projects to put on my resume. But, my skill set is in demand and I could make a lot more by switching jobs once I get a few years of experience (I have seen salary estimates ~110k median, 70-130k range).

I would love any thoughts or advice on additional options or which of these 3 options I've posited here might be best. Thanks, /r/personalfinance. Appreciate ya.",finance
personalfinance,Which loan should I focus on during grace period/deferment?,"I will be starting my grace period for my loans next month, and will have to start paying off my loans in November. The following is a list of my loans, along with interest rates:

- Perkins loan: $10k at 5% interest which starts accruing after the grace period, the rest are accruing interest
- Stafford loan 1: $3533.67 at 3.61%
- Stafford loan 2: $6791.37 at 3.61%
- Stafford loan 3: $4552.25 at 4.41%
- Stafford loan 4: $6673.29 at 4.41%
- Stafford loan 5: $5558.79 at 4.04%

- Stafford loan 7: $3238.06 at 3.51%
- Stafford loan 8: $4175.05 at 3.51%

My question is since the Perkins loan is essentially at 0% interest rate until November, should I still throw money at it while in my grace period because it will become my highest interest loan? I am working full time and I think with my upcoming bonus and my aggressive saving I will be able to knock most if not all of it out before it starts accruing interest.

personalfinance,College Student Taxable Income (US),"Hi Guys,

I'll be working around 15 weeks and I can expect to put in 40 hours a week. Is the only income tax I have to pay Federal? Are there state income taxes I have to pay as well? I'm also paying college tuition and I was planning on using the money to pay off my tuition for junior year. Can I get a tax deduction for that? I assume I'll have to file for taxes next April?

personalfinance,Requesting Input on Student Loans and Financial Planning,"Hello PF. I've been keeping an eye on this sub for awhile and there appear to be several of you helping others with great advice. I've read through several posts but I seem to be in a position with few options. Here's a challenge for you. I'm looking for the best way to tackle my student loans, which are substantial, and try to make financial headway concurrently. Not sure if it is possible. 

Here's my situation. I have 2 categories of student loans, and several loan groups under each category; my own federal loans which are in my name and ParentPlus Loans in my father's name. When the ParentPlus was taken out, we were told the loan could be transferred to my name which turned out to be false. Since it is not in my name, and since my father makes far more than myself, I cannot adjust monthly payments. I have looked at having the loans bought out but the monthly payments would be comparable and would only reduce interest by ~2%. This would require leveraging equity that I don't have so  that is no longer an option. It is not possible to consolidate federal student loans to reduce rates and these loans are bankrupt proof.

I work at a good company but there are limited financial growth opportunities. Make $51,000 a year. 7% of each paycheck is going to retirement (company matches 6%) and I have an employee stock purchase program that allows me to designate up to 5% of each paycheck to accumulate a fund that will automatically purchase stock in the company at a 15% discount quarterly. Immediate 15% return and it is a good company so I would like to preserve that if possible. Pay ~$790 in rent and utilities monthly. $110 monthly car payment. $75 auto insurance monthly. Company pays phone bill. After taxes and the aforementioned retirement/investment, I take home $2600 a month so after bills (and $150 a month for saving) its about $850 for groceries, gas, entertainment, etc . I live in an area with significant population growth which is sky rocketing housing costs so it is very difficult to get into a home to build equity and stop renting. That goal will likely take several more years.

ParentPlus Loan: 

Group A = $14,182.41 at 8.5% interest, $197.05 monthly. 
Group B = $7,093.30 at 7.9% interest, $95.50 monthly. 
Group C = $15,005.16 at 7.9% interest, $202.50 monthly. 
I have spent a good amount of time looking into refinancing these or trying to reduce the interest rates but have found nothing yet.

Approximately $380 a month with income based repayment. I'm exploring where I should focus any extra money each money and which group would make the most sense to pay down first.

I am trying to prepare myself financially so that when these loans are paid down and I come out the other side, I'm not ten years behind on my financial goals, but I do know that people in hell want ice water. I know I could adjust how much goes into retirement/stock but am struggling to find a good balance. I've looked into joining the Army Reserves as they claim to pay off your loans but I would only have a the next year to commit and I might not pass a physical. Still in shape but my joints are shot after a life of contact sports.

Questions:

Would it be better to pay off the higher principal loans first in order to save overall or lower principal loans in order to reduce the amount of loans? Should I focus on the loans with highest interest first? 

I'm beginning to shop around for part time jobs but haven't found a great fit yet as my current position requires ~10 hours a day, 5 days a week and I sometimes have to leave the state on a days notice. Do any of you have suggestions for a good way to make money on the side?

Do any of you have experience with a certified Financial Planner and do you think meeting with one would be beneficial or be a drop in the bucket?  

Any advice, input or recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks for the time, PF!",finance
personalfinance,Is it better to take a lower percentage rate (4.25%) for a mortgage or take a lender credit with a little higher rate (4.5%),"Seller accepted our offer today.  Escrow opens tomorrow and I will be speaking with my lender, so I am curious what PF thinks.  I was in escrow 3 weeks ago but backed out of the house because the inspection went terribly.  At that time, I locked into a 4.5% 30 year fixed with no points and a lender credit of $3600 towards closing costs.  This sounded great so I could close with less cash.  Now that I am going through the home buying process again on a different house, I am wondering if the lender credit thing is a bad idea. 

I am a first time buyer so I am learning.  As I understand it, if I take the credit I am essentially betting on the interest rates staying the same or hopefully going down in 2 or so years, refi, then get a lower rate.   If I plan to be in the home for any length of time ( I do plan to be there AT LEAST five years, more like 10, and possibly forever) then a lower interest rate is better, and I should pony up the closing money and take the lower interest rate.  

Is that correct?  What is the overall consensus?  Lender credit or lower interest rate?",finance

personalfinance,"""Student Loan Solutions"" from mortgage titan Fannie Mae","[This](https://www.fanniemae.com/content/announcement/sel1704.pdf) should be available from any mortgage company, bank, or credit union, offering refinance mortgages underwritten to Fannie Mae guidelines, effective immediately. If you clicked that link and want to read it from Fannie instead of me, scroll down to the ""Student Loan Cash-out Refinance"" section. 

Context: Normally, pulling equity out of your home gives you a selection of three less-than-ideal choices. In this example, we will use a scenario where it'll end up at about 75% LTV (eg, ~25% equity) with a 705 FICO score. The ""loan level pricing adjustment"" there would be 1.000%. 

To handle that LLPA, the homeowner could either...

* Take a higher interest rate. Not just on the debt one might be consolidating into the mortgage, but on ALL of the mortgage debt.

* Be 1% of the loan balance more in debt, assuming this would still put someone at 75% LTV.

* Write a check for 1% of the loan balance at the closing table.

From a /r/personalfinance perspective, these all kind of suck.

Now: Fannie Mae is waiving that ""cash out"" LLPA entirely, provided that the only purpose of the cash out refinance is consolidating student loan debt. She is doing this with the introduction of the ""Student Loan Cash-out Refinance.""

Ballpark, it'll be a little over $225/mo in monthly household cashflow improvement per $50k of student debt thus consolidated (assuming the LLPA waiver allows you to keep the interest rate about the same as what you've got, or better). Fannie Mae is trying to gobble up your student loan debt into her portfolio, more or less, and amortize it over 30 years with a fixed interest rate (with no IBR, no forbearance, etc). Over the course of 30 years she will obviously collect more in interest than a student loan amortized over 10 years, so that's what she's after. 

(This is not restricted to 30YF, it could be an ARM or 15YF, I'm just covering the typical/probable scenario)

It'll make sense for some households. For others, it won't. 

As always, a pattern of cash out mortgage refinances is problematic and recession-causing. To help recover from the aftermath of a one-time thing, like going a bazillion dollars into debt while in college, IMO it is not crazy.

I think one possible way to implement this, supposing you have $100k in debt @ 6% with 7 years left:

* Trading unsecured debt for secured, oh crap! I better have a plan.

* Figure out how to STILL pay that $100k chunk off in 7 years.

* During that 7 years, pay interest in the amount that is normal for a mortgage currently available, rather than 6%.

Should be available from any fast/nimble mortgage lender, immediately, that doesn't screw around with implementation. Some lenders are ""Freddie Mac only"" &amp; this will not apply to them. Some take a while to implement. You get the idea.",finance

I found a non-degree certificate program through UCLA Extention that is perfect for 'career changers.'

1. Take out a personal loan for non-degree programs. I only found two of that kind, which I may or may not qualify for:
https://www.salliemae.com/student-loans/career-training-smart-option-student-loan/
https://www.wellsfargo.com/student/community-college-loans/

2. Get a full-time job that I can tolerate for now. Pay for one class at a time out of pocket. Take 4 years to complete.

Ideally, I would take out the loan to go full time, get a part-time job at Trader Joe's, and finish in 1.5 years.

Here's my financial situation: unemployed no income, enough money saved for food and rent, good to excellent credit score (depending on credit bureau), no longer contributing to roth IRA, have federal loan currently in deferment.

Any thoughts on what I should do or different options? Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,"Yet another ""should I get a private student loan"" thread.","27 year old accounting major. Looking at 16 credits done after this semester. I'm working part time graveyard shifts, 28 hours a week @ 8.5/hr + tips, (which are pretty few and far between, so i don't really bother counting them). I live with family. I have about $500/mo in expenses: car, car insurance, phone.

Now, I know living with family is free and all, and I love them to death, but my god, they're starting to drive me up the wall and I really want to move out for my own mental health. There's just so much clutter everywhere and their neuroses don't really play well with mine, (e.g. I have legit diagnosed OCD, and some of them have significant boundary issues; it takes a lot of effort to not lose my shit every time I do laundry and find their stuff mixed in). Besides, I'm pushing 30. I need my own space at some point.

My job doesn't pay me enough to cover rent and stuff on top of my other expenses, and I've burned through my financial aid until August, so I'm considering hitting up Wells Fargo or Sallie Mae for a few grand to cover stuff until my federal loans and other aid comes in.

Off the top of my head, I have about 8k and change in federal loan debt so far @ somewhere around 6% interest. I'm not really worried about my ability to pay back the loans in the future, since accounting averages 45-50k/yr right out of school and I'm not adverse to travelling/moving for work, but school was never a strong suit of mine so I'm taking classes at a somewhat slower rate: I'm probably looking at 5.5-6 years until I finish my bachelor's. My short-term goal is to get my AS and looking for AP/AR clerk roles so I can make better $$ and get experience/build a network in the field.

personalfinance,Need Advice - Have goals in mind,"Hey all, creeped for a while, burner for advice because friends/others know my main.
25 y/o

I'll summarize my financial situation for reference, but I'm looking for advice and information regarding 401k, stocks, management of finances, planning, etc.

I'll round everything for easy keeping:

80k a year rounded down - paid bi-weekly. ~5k in checking after payment today mentioned below, and around 1500 in savings.

Whats going on:

*  Student Loans: ~450/mo, but I pay 700ish/mo (35k left, chose shortest term, paying extra per mo to get this done with). Total 35-38k. Question: which loans should I focus on? High interest? older ones? higher amounts? mix of variables? plz halp? 

*  Debt/Credit report: 4500 to school owed in unsub loan, not sallie mae or fed managed(was 9500, isnt on credit report but they wont give me degree til I pay, paid 5k moments ago of the 9500$. 2250 of remaining 4500 due in 3 weeks, then 2250 more due 2 weeks later; This isnt on credit report as far a I can see.), miscellaneous 2k med/others, credit at 600...

*  Car Insurance: 110/mo

*  Rent + misc: 750/mo + 150/mo others regarding living = 900/mo

*  Credit: Unfortunately @ 600ish. Dropped heavy within past year or two due to multiple low total medical bills, and a large school bill. (I have since graduated). On my report are multiple successful auto loan repayments, but then the above mentioned, should I work with lexington law or write my own pay-for-delete emails/letters or phone calls?
    -21 accounts on report, (16 student that i mentioned above that i feel confident about but need advice, 3 auto loans that total 3 years with only 2 late payments :(, 2 credit cards that have low limit that I havent used in 1+ years with no missed payments). 4 items in collections (300$, 200$, 300$, and 10k.....) - 10k is :( student loan that wasnt gov subsidize-able. handling this after i pay the current tuition outstanding bill mentioned above. Should i contact lexington law about the others or no? The 10k has grown to 13k in like a year, and im worried about it.

What I want:

*  To invest in tech stocks I'm confident in - less than 1 year investment, confident in return or at least safe gains.
*  Defense stocks - due to Trump's increase of def. budget of 10% year over year (correct me if im wrong), i see lockheed northrop boeing etc growing steady for at least few years. free money and safe? tell me if im wrong.

*  401k

*  New(er) car. Will buy used. Current car is 1000$. What I want is 20-23k. Will put down plenty, familiar with this process. Very adamant and eager about this. Trying to follow the 20/4/10 rule

*  Peace of mind.

*  organization!!!! excel sheet to plan? what do you use? halp

*  Credit card? To boost credit? yay or nay? if so do it now or wait til credit repaired a bit, regardless - which one?

What do you think my steps forward should be?
Thats it, thanks",finance
btc,Bitcoin as Gold reserve to AltCoins,"So I have this idea which I haven't seen anywhere else, and wanted to share it to see if it makes sense or not.

My understanding is that bitcoin has some issues with transaction speed (and/or transaction cost) which causes people to worry about its ability to go mainstream and establish itself as a core global currency.
What if instead of expecting bitcoin to be as practical as USD, EUR, GBP etc, we actually thought of it more like the Gold of crypto?

Back when we tied our national currencies to gold, the [paper notes were meant to be literally redeemable for gold](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/history.aspx) (or silver, or coin, etc). The currency was tied to a guaranteed asset.

Paper is much easier to carry around than gold. It is much more divisible (infinitely so) than gold. It is more practical in virtually every way possible - it just has no value outside of the promise it carries. It promises to be worth gold. So as long as people believe gold has value, the paper has value. And whether gold is convenient for handling transactions or not is irrelevant.

So why not use Bitcoin the same way?

We need to program a specific ""AltCoin-In-A-Box"" program which anyone could easily run and create their own AltCoin.

**It would work like this:**

During setup of the new AltCoin, the new blockchain programmatically ties itself to a bitcoin wallet, which we will call ""Fort Knox"". An exchange rate is chosen, for example, 1BTC = 1000 ProgenyCoins, and the setup is complete.

An interface is then made available which allows people to buy your newly created ProgenyCoins from the ""Federal Reserve"" of ProgenyCoin-istan. Register your intent to buy (provide bitcoin address where BTC are coming from, and ProgenyCoins address where your ProgenyCoins will go), then send 1BTC to ""Fort Knox"" and await the (slow, painful, horrific) BTC transaction to be confirmed.

As soon as the BTC transaction is confirmed, ""The Federal Reserve"" sends you 1000 ProgenyCoins. ""The Federal Reserve"" can produce as many of these coins as it needs to meet the BTC deposit in Fort Knox, and will only pay out ProgenyCoins for that reason. Similarly, sending ProgenyCoins to ""The Federal Reserve"" will allow you to withdraw BTC to a BTC wallet of your choosing.

Buying ProgenyCoins from the fed on this brand spanking new tiny blockchain which is optimised for rapid, free transactions has now given you a practical local currency to use in everyday transactions which doesn't require the bitcoin chain, but still benefits from all of the value held in the bitcoin chain. If bitcoin rises in value, so too will the value of your ProgenyCoins. And since all of these new progeny coins are being created by locking BTC up in ""Fort Knoxes"" all over the planet, the value of BTC is likely to increase to match the increased demand and lost supply.

Basically, the parent BTC blockchain is spawning lightweight, mostly-independent, children chains to do the transaction work for it. Hence the progeny reference. Obviously.

**Considerations and Risks**

1. By making the original code for this concept a well established opensource piece of software, the ""AltCoin-In-A-Box"" certificate of BTC redeemability will guarantee the value of every new ProgenyCoin you encounter. Presumably the ""AltCoin-In-A-Box"" software could also include a generic platform which will handle all such coin-wallets in one place.

2. Each new coin will need to gain enough nodes/miners to ensure security against attacks before people can be confident trusting them to not steal their money. Perhaps an international organisation can help provide early stage node hosting for a fee paid by the originator of the currency? (I haven't really put any thought into the incentivisation for 'mining' - I guess transactions would need a miner fee to ensure people did run full nodes?)

3. Many more I haven't thought of, I am sure.

personalfinance,"Lendkey will not let me increase automatic payment amount, need advice about what to do.","Some background, I currently have 2 loans, one for $94k through lendkey and one for $26k through Great Lakes, which is more like 10 smaller loans, but I just consider them one. All of the interest rates are between 3% and 5%, since I just finished paying off the 6% loan through Great Lakes. I make $62k a year as a mechanical engineer and still live at home, so I have virtually no expenses. My minimum payments for the two loans are just over $1300 a month, but I have been paying about $2000 a month and plan to continue that to hopefully pay them off sooner.

So moving to my question, I was planning to increase the automatic payments on my Lendkey loans, but apparently they do not allow you to do this. You have the option to manually pay extra, which I don't have a problem doing, but my worry is that these extra payments wont give me a ""buffer."" What I mean by this is them allowing these extra payments to accumulate and push back any required payments that I may miss in the future, if I need to that is.

For my great lakes loan, I am about 11 months ahead on the loan, so it says that my next required payment isn't until April of next year. Now, while I don't plan to miss any payments, the job that I have currently requires that I get a security clearance, which I should be able to get no problem, but if I do not get it then I lose the job. I have been there 7 months now and still haven't gotten my clearance and so I just want to be prepared in the off chance I do not get it. I have about 4-5 months of bills saved up currently, so I could get by for a while if I do end up losing the job, but would prefer to not have to cut too far into my savings.

So, my question, should I go ahead and make the extra payments even if they do not give me the cushion, or should I put the money into savings in the off chance I don't get my clearance? On the extra payment page it has the following sentence and I am not sure what it means, since it says ""next"" payment.

""If your additional payment is processed when no outstanding payments are due, and prior to receipt of the invoice for your next payment due, then the additional payment will be applied to your outstanding balance and will not satisfy your upcoming payment.""

investing,The real fed funds rate sits below 0% - what does that mean for the markets?,"The Fed is looking to hike multiple times this year, but the real fed funds rate - the fed funds rate minus median CPI - is still at about -1.0% ([chart here](https://www.jonathanhtodd.com/2017/04/27/real-fed-funds-rate-says-about-us-economy/)).

In the past the real fed funds rate followed the market cycle - it went up as the markets went up, and fell when the markets fell. But the number is still sitting below zero as the markets have risen over the past 8 years.

Anyone using this as an indicator? My guess is that this is just the manifestation of secular stagnation - we're going to be in this territory for awhile, because how high can the Fed realistically raise rates without breaking the fragile economic growth?

On a side note, if banks are going to take real losses on deposits, they're going to have to make that up elsewhere. Like all those fun fees that we all love.",finance

It's been 13 months and it's still at 1%.

personalfinance,"Getting a Huge Bump in Salary, Need Help Planning for Future","So I recently got an offer for a new job.  I've been unemployed for a year, and before that I made $120,000.  This new job is paying me $200,000 with a $50,000 bonus.  In addition, I'll be a partner in the company and have a 10% stake.

Not to go into too many details, but despite this company being a startup, we're going in with large amounts of contractually guaranteed work that is based around federal regulations.  So we'll be a startup, but with solid, established business, if that makes sense.  The large windfall potential comes in doing work under budget.  For example, in our negotiation for work, if a project was budgeted at say $30,000,000 and it gets done for $20,000,000, we take home half of that as free and clear profit, 10% of which is mine.  And we will be doing dozens of such projects a year (not that they will all end up hugely under budget. Our regular operating expenses are covered by other more steady cash flow and even there cash flow exceeds operating expenses before we even get into the big projects.

So basically, I'm looking at going from unemployed to $200,000 guaranteed, very likely another $50,000, and potentially hundreds of thousands to over a million more.  On top of that, we have a 10% 1:1 401k match.

Currently, I have $110,000 in the 401k from my old company, another $60k in another retirement account, around $50k in cash and $120k in student loan debt (around $1,500 if I pay the minimum).  My daily expenses are naturally fairly low given my current unemployment.  That said, before being laid off I had the following expenses:

Amount | Category | Explanation
---|---|----
$500 | Housing | I own a duplex, rent half.  Mortgage, maintenance, taxes, etc after rent.
$1,500 | Food and Entertainment | I like to eat out, cook with nice ingredients, and go to lots of local cultural events
$600 | Car Expenses | Paid off cars.  Insurance, gas, maintenance.
$1,000 | Travel | I like to travel and get 5 weeks vacation, so I travel a decent amount.
$2,000 | Misc | Buying fixtures for the house, gifts, charitable donation and whatever else isn't easily categorized.  Clothes too.  Going to need a new wardrobe for this new job.
$1,500 | 401k | My old company matched 15% dollar for dollar
$1,000 | Additional Retirement Saving | Put into a separate account, not the 401k

So as you can see, at $5,600 in expenses and another $2,500 in retirement savings I believe I was in pretty darn good shape.  I tried my best to resist lifestyle inflation and hope to keep doing so.  That said, I do like to spend on certain things, like travel and food.  I'm married as well, but my wife is very much on the same page as me.  If anything, she's cheaper and really only spends much money when I insist.

But going forward, I need to collect thoughts and advice on what to do with what will be the large percentage of my income that I'm not spending.  It was easy enough before to max out the 401k, put a little more in another account, and sock away the rest.  Now I'm entering potential territory where there's going to be a lot more savings coming in and I want to maximize their utility.

My best case scenario goal would be retiring at 40 (I'm 31).  Obviously if things go well, this is pretty easy, but I'd still like to work towards that best case even without contributions from my stake in the company.  How should I be saving what's left of my salary?  What would be the wise thing to do if I get a huge windfall when profits get distributed at year end?  When should I focus on putting a bunch of money into paying off my student loans?  Any other thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,56k student debt- split up between Parent PLUS and Fed loans- Need advice on best repayment strategy,"Howdy r/personalfinance. I'm in a bit of a pickle on the best way to go about paying back my student debt given my circumstances, and would love some advice.


Here is the basic rundown of my situation as it stands now:

Age: 25

Income: $37k

Take-home: $1900/month

Student debt: $55k

Breakdown of debt:

* Loan 1: About $6k left, Private. Defaulted when parents declared bankruptcy and I had no idea payments were due. Worked things out with the bank, paying $200/mo until debt is gone- originally $9k- nothing I can really do about this one.

* Loan(s) 2: $24.9k balance - Federal Loans in my name. 7 loans total between $1-4.5k. APR 3.15%-6.55%, weighted average 4.57% - minimum payment: $353.20/mo - been paying $400 since graduation

* Loan(s) 3: $25.4k balance- Federal Parent PLUS loans under my parent's name. 3 loans, 10.5k, 8.5k, 6.5k. Respective APR- 7.9%, 6.41%, 7.9%- 7.42% weighted average APR - Minimum payment $369.67/month- been paying $400 since graduation

* Credit Karma credit score: 641/647

Rent: None, live with my parents *for now*

Checking balance: $1.5k

Savings balance: $2k


All right, PF, here is my dillema. I've been putting a little less than a hundred dollars per month into these loans, spread out evenly across all of them. HOWEVER I am receiving a promotion at work which will raise my salary to around the $55k/year mark (or potentially higher, I hear the initial offer tomorrow and negotiations will begin). I have spoken long and hard about this with my girlfriend, we were planning on moving in together around February of next year, but with this promotion we decided it would be smarter to postpone this, and dump as much into my debt as possible and see how far down we can get it before starting our life together (potentially debt-free?).


My question is this: would it be better for me to dump my extra $1000/month into my higher interest, larger loans under my parent's names before focusing on my smaller, lower interest loans? Or vice versa? I know that I would save more in the long run by focusing on the Parent PLUS loans, but if I focus and bang out the loans in my name, it would help my credit score, and allow me to potentially get a better deal on financing a home in the future, whereas the Parent PLUS loans that I pay in my parent's names won't help my credit at all.


 If my raise pans out to be what I am thinking it will, I could afford to dump an extra thousand into these, but want to do what is best for my future. Which loan should I focus on paying off first to better prepare myself for a transition into this new phase of my life? (Marriage, home ownership, kids, etc) -  I do not plan on leaving the area (rural Pennsylvania, lower housing costs (about 150k for a nice home, 200k if I want a few acres of land (I do)).


I would also like to raise my credit score, because that bankruptcy and delinquency was not kind to me- never even made a late payment on anything before that, haven't since. I don't know if paying off my debt under my name faster will increase my credit score more than making the payments I currently make on it will, though.


Any advice/help on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,How do you sell a car in which you're both way behind and way upside down?,"Full Disclosure: This is a burner account. I just feel more comfortable asking this question in this manner, for privacy reasons for my family.  I've also posted this in the Dave Ramsey subreddit, hoping to get as much advice as possible.

Last April, a few months before our baby was born, my wife and I bought a new 2016 Kia Forte, although because her credit was poor and not used, I'm the owner. We did this because we were fearful that her original vehicle was going to be repossessed, even though the creditor hadn't taken any action in several months. The dealership where we bought the car said the creditor is notorious for just repossessing cars that you're behind in, even if you attempt to make catch up payments, so in fear, and a baby on the way, we bought the Kia, and of course by bought, I mean completely financed through Kia. We also voluntarily returned her vehicle to the creditor.

At the time, my wife was working, although she went on maternity leave shortly thereafter, and has since stayed home with the baby. While at first we were able to make payments, in the last few months, we've had a lot of trouble on just my income, which only just a couple weeks ago grew to around $35,500 a year, we've been very late on it, and it's trashing my already poor credit score. We're just not making enough money to catch up on it, although we're doing our best to do so, we have many other debts, and a $1,000 rent each month for housing. We did attempt to go to the dealership this month, and somehow trade it in for something with less payments, but being so far upside down, which I'll explain in the next paragraph, they wouldn't/couldn't do anything.

As it stands as of today, the car has a payoff amount of $20,495.27, a past due of $431.96, and a total amount due of $894.28. The normal monthly payment is $462.32. Thanks to my credit as it was at the time of purchase, it also has a 15.9% interest rate. Right now, it's 38 days past due, and this is the second time in a row that we've been 31-60 days late. The trade-in amount, according to KBB, is between $9,300 and $10,500, and private party, around $12,000.

Clearly, the amount due is more than 50% of my income, and although we have many other debts, the monthly payment is absolutely killing us as far as making any kind of headway towards saving anything for Baby Step 1.

I've seen and read Dave Ramsey's post about selling upside down cars. Unfortunately, Kia financed it, so we can't just go and talk with them, and I'm sure they have no incentive to help us in any way. Dave also makes it sound so easy in all of his calls where he tells people, ""Just sell it,"" but doesn't get into any details as to how. The dealership won't help us, and I'm honestly not sure that Regions, which is who we bank through, would either. We feel really stuck, and depressed, with such a heavy burden over us and seemingly no way out. I really appreciate any help, thoughts, or advice anyone can offer. Thank you very much.

Edit: Thank you so much for everyone's responses so far.  I'm doing my best to reply to all of them.  I don't quite understand the downvotes on the post, as I'm sure it's pushing the post further and further down.  I know I'm an idiot, but I'm really and honestly trying to get some help and advice about all this.  Thank you.

personalfinance,"Have $110k in student debt, we can sell our house for a profit of $200k. Should we sell or stay?","I have roughly $110k in student debt (M, 29). My wife (F, 29) and I are currently paying it down at $1250/month and plan to increase that to $2450 in October 2017. Once our car payment ends in May of 2018, we plan to increase that to $2850/month. I have 4 loans all with interest rate of 3.5% and I have one loan that has an interest rate of 5.25%. I am making the minimum payment on the 3.5% interest rate loans, and putting the rest towards the 5.25% loan to pay it down faster. I have looked into re-fi but the interest rates are too low for it to make sense (based on what I have seen). Based on these number I have us paying off the loans completely sometime in 2020. 

We bought a house in 2013 before housing prices started to soar in our area. Our real estate agent feels confident about getting roughly $550k for our house, based on the other transactions in the area. This would leave us $200k in profit after paying off the balance, paying closing costs, realtor costs, fixing items etc. 

We both have stable jobs, she is a Nurse Practitioner and I'm a civil engineer. She also has a side gig that contributes $900 towards the student debt payment I mentioned earlier. That number could fluctuate however its been steady for a least a year now. 

The question is, do we sell the house and pay down my debt and pocket the extra income now? Or do we wait the 3-4 years and pay down the debt per our plan? The potential sale price of our home could keep going up, stay the same or go down. We can't exactly predict the future. If we sell we would have to rent, which could be higher than our current house payment. We do want to move to a better school system, however we don't plan on having kids in school for at least 5 years. 

Personally, I think that real estate in our area will continue to grow or stabilize and we could sell our house for maybe around $550k in 2020. Where we want to buy prices are rising as well, and I think we would maybe need to spend roughly $750k - $850k for the future home.

For background/clarity: I work at a fairly large privately owned IT reseller firm based in NJ, but in our sister location in Texas.

My role is sales support management so while I dont get any commission we have bonuses that are based on work performance/metrics. Not Rev or GM. 

The supplement a lower base salary with a total of 10k in bonuses for the year, which are pretty much guaranteed unless you suck at your job. I do not.

This AM we got a notification from management that our bonus checks would be less than expected. As expected myself and my entire department, which is about 150 people, are up in arms. This was the justification provided:

During a recent audit of our payroll process we discovered that the way that we have been processing bonuses with ADP is inconsistent with federal guidelines. While bonuses are classified as supplemental wages and can therefore be processed under 2 different methods of taxation the way that we process our payroll only allows for us to process one of those ways and have them taxed correctly. Under direction from ADP we have been using the Aggregate Method for taxing bonuses which in most cases, essentially all except when extenuating circumstances require a special payroll to be processed, because it is paid alongside the employee‚Äôs base pay was being taxed at a rate lower than the IRS‚Äôs guideline of 25%. Starting with February‚Äôs payrolls we have switched to the Percentage Method for taxing bonuses as this will more accurately tax the bonuses at a flat rate of 25% for federal. Please note that 25% is for just federal taxes and does not include the other taxes such as state, Social Security, and Medicare.

So Reddit am I just fucked? this cut is going to take ~500$ each quarter out of an expected bonus check. All of which was going towards a house down payment fund.",finance

personalfinance,Planning after near bankruptcy,"(Sorry, new to posting, on mobile, etc. Whoops! Format edit...)

A bit of back story: 30-something female, Midwest USA, joint custody of teenage son, 2 cats. I quit my job a year ago. It was pretty much literally killing me from the inside out, between the stress inherent in the job and being physically and verbally harassed/threatened daily with no action from higher ups. I didn't think it would take so long to find a new one since I have a degree in applied mathematics as well as education, secretary experience, and a tech background. I wasn't picky about the jobs I applied for - I went for admin assistant, receptionist, analyst, data entry, factory floor worker, tech writer, IT support, entry level programmer, trainer (I was a high school teacher and wrote district curriculum/trained teachers as well as taught in the classroom), whatever. I continually got questions of ""what firm did you hold [job title] with previously? ... None? ... Yes, I can see that you have transferable skills, but you've not held this position before. Thank you, good bye."" (Except the factory floor position, the guy looked at me in disbelief and said, ""Lady, you're going to be bored out of your mind here."")



Current: I haven't been able to completely meet my monthly bills for about five months. I didn't realize that I would have been eligible for unemployment due to the working conditions until after the deadline, so I missed that perk. I'm at the point where I started looking into bankruptcy, and found a forgotten retirement trust that would have been liquidated anyway in the process. So I'm just liquidating it myself. Yeah, I'm going to hit a tax penalty and lose the employer matched portion, but I've got debt collectors and lawyers calling me at least three times a day, and warning of utilities getting shut off. I just started a new job this week (FINALLY!) that will actually pay my monthly bills from here on out. Not going to be a fancy lifestyle on it, but I'll keep up, be able to go out once in a while, and put some in savings.



Question and numbers: I think I should pay everything off, and give myself and my son a treat. Here's my breakdown, in rounded numbers.

Roughly $17,000 coming in. This does not count the 45% that I'm setting aside in some sort of CD or something that will earn interest while keeping it safe to pay next year's taxes. Tax penalty should actually be 35%, but I'd rather have extra than not enough. Due to the type of fund, I have to take it all - I can't take a loan or just part.


Debts:

One credit card: $1200 (part due, lawyers involved)

Medical bills (still paying off from cancer surgery 5 years ago and diagnostics to make sure it didn't come back -melanoma): $2000

Utilities: $1300

Personal loan: $700 (@ 27% interest rate, past due, lawyers involved)

Internet (It got cancelled two months ago): $500 Past due balance

Loan from parents: $700

Past due rent + May: $900 (I rent from a lady, not a company. She's amazingly understanding about my circumstance, maybe because my insufficient rent usually came with fresh cookies or breads)

Various things (library fines, vet fees, community groups): $150


Federal student loans (not currently considering paying these up front. At the moment, they are in economic hardship forbearance. Current monthly is $0, but it will be recalculated with my new job): roughly $22,000


Expenses needed for new job:

Drivers license and related fees (I got rid of my car and let my license lapse to save $): $200

Car- I'm looking all over. I know a bit about cars and have friends that are mechanics and willing to work for baked goods/beer and conversation, so I am looking for decent but not perfect. Budgeting up to $2000.

Based on my probable car choices and location, one year of insurance paid up front is roughly $900 (bundling with my renters insurance).


The annual mom/son trip that we usually take costs roughly $800 for hotel, transportation, food, and entertainment for the two of us. We skipped it this year due to finances, and I'd like to splurge on relaxing with him. Otherwise my splurges this last few months have been 2-ply toilet paper and a card game I can play solo to distract from not going out with friends. Mental health gain from relaxing is important! Plus, going as a thank you to him... Teenager with no internet is not fun nowadays, but he's been great.



Any advice on what to do with the rest? I'd like to get a new phone on a different plan. The one I want would cost about $500 up front- but save me $40 per month on the phone bill, and priceless frustration I have with my current refurbished 3 year old phone.

I would also like to take some courses to keep my teaching license active, in case I want to return (expires in June of 2018, I need one particular course and some paperwork to renew).



Also, due to the year of unemployment/part time mall shop work, my credit score is tanked, in the low 500s. Due to some bad decisions a few years prior, it already was kinda low to start. Would I be better off not paying off the debts and just getting current, then making payments on time? 



I know this was long, but thanks for any suggestions as I dig out! It's not where I want to be, but despite the financial stress I'm more at peace than I've been in years. I'm working out more, drinking less, and not looking over my shoulder for threats everywhere I go. And while it's not the best situation, I've at least got a light at the end of the tunnel.",finance
personalfinance,Starting Over. Mistakes Were Made. Advice Needed.,"Quick and dirty background:

Married. 2 kids. 

Me: 35 years old. Net $515 weekly (after contributing 6% to 401K to get full company match). 

Wife: 32. Hot (sorry not relevant, but bonus). Nets $500 weekly. 

Ok, so these incomes are recently new for us. We've set up a budget and we have more than enough money to meet our current bills and living expenses (renting a house, $1050 monthly). 

However, we were stupid through our college years. My wife just graduated and now has a job, but before she got the job and after her school money ran out, we almost went broke. Well, we basically did, but we hung on. So many of our debts went to collections and to make it short and sweet, it all went to shit.

I have a line of credit of about $9,000 that was sent to collections. I've never dealt with collection people and don't know the best course of action. 

Most of our other debts we've managed to work things out and with tax return this year we got a lot of little stuff paid off and to the point we can make payments and they'll go away soon. 

I am going to be getting a windfall of $10,500 dollars next month, this is after 20% set aside for taxes (this was the amount I calculated the feds will want). 

Would it be smartest to just pay off the collections people and be done with it? Or best to take care of accounts that aren't already in collections? Or put the money in savings and continue adding to it for a down payment on a house and just slowly pay off collections?

I really would appreciate any advice. Please let me know if I can give more info to clarify.

Oh, my credit and my wife's are pretty shot from years of late payments here and there and then these recent collections. No evictions or bankruptcy or anything, just idiotic money decisions for too many years. It's time we fly right and act like adults.

personalfinance,retirement options for private healthcare + VA employee,"I'm about to graduate from medical residency and will begin working as a part-time VA employee in addition to holding a job in the private sector.

* Are any other tax-advantaged retirement options available to me as a VA employee?

personalfinance,What do I need to know when considering co-signing an auto loan?,"My father broke his neck about a year ago. He's in a powered wheelchair. He's been in a clinic for most of the past year, and was recently released to his new home - living with family. He and his wife currently have a leased car, but he can't get in it. She's looking to end the lease and finance a used wheelchair van. She's asked me if I can co-sign the loan.

I'm planning on saying ""yes"" or helping out in some other way. I'm more than aware that if I say ""yes"" then I have taken out a loan for the financed value of a vehicle I don't own. Lots of details below - any further advice or questions from the community?

**To be clear, if I mix family and money this way, I am willing to lose the money. I just want to make sure I'm not making avoidable mistakes that would result in worse outcomes. Or missing out on other ways to solve this problem.**

Details:

* $19k vehicle, 12 years old
* They plan on putting $8k down
* Thus, the loan is $11k

Their financials:

* I don't know a lot of details, but Dad's not working obviously. He's collecting long term disability and I believe SS SDI. He's 60, the LTD should cover him until he hits SS retirement.
* His wife's not working, don't know if she has plans to.
* I know their credit is not good, and probably bad.

My financials:

* I could pay the finance amount today, out of my e-fund. That would drain it however.
* That's my personal e-fund; my wife and I have a separate one that's twice that size.
* I carry no debt.
* Using CapitalOne's simulator, this loan would drop my credit score from 795 to 788.
* I'm not planning on any future loan needs for at least 12 months. We might want a replacement car for our 11-year-old Prius after that point.

Questions for them:

* What's the term, interest rate, and payments? 
* How will this affect cash flow for them?
* Would a bigger down payment help? I could do this easily

Considerations for me:

* Does co-borrowing make sense? I may be required to carry insurance on it...
* If the rate is too high, should I simply apply for the loan myself and have them pay me?

Requirements from me if cosigning, found here : http://www.realcartips.com/carloans/387-things-to-consider-co-signer.shtml 

* ""ask the lender to agree in writing that you will be responsible only for the principal balance on the loan. You want to be protected against legal fees if the lender decides to sue.""

personalfinance,Should I prioritize paying off my student loans or saving for retirement?,"I'm a 28yo guy living in a very HCOL area and just recently got a raise. As of now I'm making about $71.5k with a possible bump to $78k in 5 months. It's a great bump for me since I've been pulling in about $56k for last couple years, but this new position comes with almost no benefits whatsoever except healthcare (this isn't a 1099 position)

In the last year I've gotten more serious about retirement savings and bumped my 401k contribution to 10% and fully funded a Roth IRA, but now with the new position I have no 401k anymore and I have to decide to leave the funds with the current servicer (they're terrible) or roll it over into my Roth IRA at vanguard... but I would immediately lose 80% of my match for last year. There's a shot I may get to keep it in a year or so due to unionization and some benefits changes so I may just let it sit there and see what happens.

Anyway now that I don't have access to a 401k I'm wondering if it's a better idea to just focus on my loans while still fully funding an IRA for the time being.

All my loans are federal and were consolidated at 5.75%. I've made 33 payments on an IBR plan, but all except for the most recent one only went to interest...

Current balances:
Unsubsidized loan - $46k
Subsidized loan - $25k

Roth IRA - $6k
Roth 401k - $8.5k

Currently my payments are about $414/mo and I'm thinking about throwing an additional $400/mo at the unsubsidized loan in lieu of contributing to a 401k... would the be wise? Or should I continue on the IBR plan and stick the $400/mo in a taxable account?

After that, there will be lots of extra money left each month, and we'll need to leverage it the best we can to be able to have 20% down on the next house.

personalfinance,"Cleaning Up My Debt Mess, Trying To Stay Sane","I'm a 26 year old software engineer (sorry for the STEM-jerk...) with a few choices of myself as well as my parents that have put me a little less than $100,000 in debt. Most of it is at a decent interest rate, the bulk of my problem is one high interest personal loan I just took out to deal with a bunch of student loans due to default in my cosigner parent's bankruptcy. Well...at least I saved my credit.

Here's what I'm looking at:

Income:


- $100,000 gross, $60,000 take home ($5000/month)
- 6% Employer Match 401k Contribution + Insurance 
- HSA available but currently not being used
- 2 partners each paying $600/month to rent, food, utilities totaling $1200/month
- 401k @ $22,000
- $4000 in savings
- $4000 in checking (I tend to keep $3000 + enough to get by each month in checking)

Debts:


- $635/month min,  $37,000 @ 3.25% for car (about $10k underwater)
- $201/month min, $24,500 @ 6.55% for fed student loans
- $632/month min, $30,000 @ 9.615% for private loan consolidation via personal loan (only option I had)
- $75/month, $525 @ 0% credit card
- $115/month, $3500 @ 0% credit card 


My living expenses are currently taking up the rest of my money:


- $1325/month rent
- $100/month power
- $80/month internet
- $45/month PS VUE TV (I'm a weirdo who likes his live TV, sue me, I don't use Netflix/Hulu)
- $80/month cell phone
- $100/month car insurance

I seem to be spending about $1200-1500 a month on misc expenses including gas, food, going to doctors (anxiety disorder management) and a few video games or nights out here and there. I've been trying to cut this down 




I'm also taking college courses since I never got to finish my degree, currently a few community college reqs at about $300/month, I could take out loans for this as an option to weigh against, once I go back to university I'll likely be borrowing another $20k probably at around 6-7% interest to finish up.




My plan now that this personal loan is in repayment is to put about $2,000 a month into my payments total, maybe more if I can swing it but it's hard knowing I can't really do much fun for the next 5 years of my life. I am planning on trip to PAX West later this year which will cost me around $600-750, but mostly I don't plan on doing much else and I doubt myself if I'm making the right decisions.


Things I wonder about:


- Should I pull my 401k contributions to pay more towards my debt? It'd be about $300/month to debts vs $600/month to 401k but that 9.6% interest is pretty high on that loan
- Should I drop out of school or stop paying out of pocket and go the fin aid route? I don't feel confident in myself in my career so I'm trying to finish for more stability but I'm already a few years into my career without it.
- I wonder if there are ways to get that interest down on my personal loan, maybe find some 0 interest credit cards to shift the debt around since I have a high credit score?
- The $1,500 a month for food for 3 (plus 3 cats), gas and misc expenses seems high, but I'm having a hard time cutting it, I already have all my meals cooked or brought for work, but it still seems super spend




I think aside from that having this much debt is just mentally breaking me. It'll take 4-5 years to pay off and 31-32 and debt free might be nice but it's hard to see myself doing nothing but sitting around paying debt for the next few years. Most of the things I enjoy like going out, traveling and most of my hobbies require money. How do I deal with being bored and poor even on my salary, not to mention the feeling that if I lose my job I'm doomed? It's been weighing on my anxiety a ton and I just want some peace of mind and to stop staring at spreadsheets of debts.


Update: I've looked into a few more things, dropped my payments on my fed loans to $140, found I can pay less on my $525 balance to $50/month and still not pay any interest, cut my 401k giving me $300/month more income to pay and that gives me another $385/month towards my high interest debt, so that's something.",finance

**Current Situation**

We are paying part of my student loans but not my wife's student loans. My father-in-law plans to retire next year and has offered to watch the little one (saving us $1,600 a month). 

I generally get a raise ever year as does my wife averaged out to a 4% raise at both our jobs.

**Debt Plan**

First, we are going to reduce our entertainment budget by half. We are also looking at our car insurance, cancelling cable, and so forth. 

Second, once we no longer have our child care expenses I want to use that money exclusively toward debt reduction.

Third: We are looking at re-finance options through companies like Sofi. However, the main draw back with these options is that once I re-finance I must start repayment. No forbearance or deferment options. 

*My plan is this*: put all our federal student loans into forbearance for 2 years. After our current expenses, use almost every dollar targeting one student loan at a time using the avalanche method (e.g. highest debt, greatest interest rate). To do this, I will refinance individual loans one a time then make monthly payments. Based on my credit, and my spouse's credit, I think we can get fixed interest rates at roughly 4.5% per loan. 

In total, I think I can pay off approximately $100k in high interest student loan debt over two years. Thereafter, I'm not sure what my next step would be. 

Finally, once our 0% interest credit card payment is done we will use those funds toward student loan payments.

- Electric: ~$100/month

- Cell phones: $135/month (60/75)

- Internet: $60/month (We just got rid of cable and bought our own modem, and it feels good!) 

- Groceries: $240-$400/month

- Gas: $~80/month

- Medical Insurance: $76 each per paycheck (and that's already taken out when we get paid) 

- 401K: ~$50 each per paycheck (also already taken out). For the 4% we contribute, our employer matches 1%, and that's the max available. We just started these last year, and we have $1922 (him) and $1613 (me) in there so far. Not a lot, but a start!

- Dental Insurance: $75/month (covers both of us) 

- Renter's Insurance: $129/year

- Ring Insurance: $31/year  

- Car Loan: $2400 left at 4.69%, we pay $255/month 

- Golf Tournaments: In season (about 7 months of the year), he plays in golf tournaments a few times a month, totaling $200-$300. This is good for his career, as it's a networking opportunity, can earn him continuing ed credits if there's a meeting/learning portion, and he could win his money (and sometimes more) back. 
He also gets new golf clothing and equipment each year, and receives a stipend of $500 through work. This year, he put a portion of that aside for tournament entry fees. He is prioritizing these and only signing up for those that are most important to him.

My student loans: $850 left, paying $200/month 

My husband's student loans:

- 1) $1850 at 4.8%, federal

- 2) $1200 at 4.8%, federal

- 3) $900 at 2.7%, federal

- 4) $1651 at 2.7%, federal

- 6) $19,940 at 7%, private through Wells Fargo

- 7) $11,697 at 9.9%, priviate, WF

- 8) $19,991 @5.0%, private, WF

He pays $275/month toward federal, and $485/month to Wells Fargo. We've tried to consolidate/refinance with WF and other banks multiple times, but our debt-to-income ratio is too high so we haven't been approved yet (does anybody know the percentage that would get us approved?). 
My credit card: $5,000 (I just transferred the whole balance from a 13.99% card to a the BarclayRing card, which has a $0 transfer fee and 0% APR for 15 months. I aim to pay $330/month until it's paid off. (Note: This card has a $7,500 limit, and I can transfer from another account- even my husband's- within the next 45 days). 
His credit card #1: $3,000 at 0%
His cc #2: $3,300 at 17.9% (I'd like to move $2,500 to my new card, but wanted to make sure that is a good move first).

Thoughts/Questions: 
We're trying to figure out how to prioritize paying these down, at least enough to consolidate and refinance his student loans, before we feel like we're ""ready"" to buy our first house. We were pre-approved, house-hunting and almost made an offer a couple weeks ago, before we took a step back to reassess. Now we're putting most of the money we had saved up for a downpayment into our debts, and trying to make smarter choices now for a better life later. SO inspired by all that I'm reading, seeing and talking about with friends/family. It's amazing/sad that we don't talk about money more. Kids should really know what they're getting themselves into when they take out tens of thousands of dollars worth of loans at 18. 4% interest isn't the total amount of interest you'll owe on the lifetime of the loan, it's what you'll pay every.single.year. Life lesson learned. 
   
We have started paying down some debts and making efforts to minimize/save wherever we can. We aren't sure exactly how to prioritize everything, or the best ways to do it, but we're ready to make some changes. 

That being said, we'd like to buy our own house, and will want to get a 2nd car at/before that point. We had 2 vehicles up until about a year ago, when we had some trouble with 1 and it just wasn't worth fixing. Living 10 minutes from work and working at the same place, we've found a way to make 1 car work, but we would love a 2nd at some point. We'd like to start a family, put money into an emergency fund and grow our investments for retirement within the next few years. 

My husband is constantly on the lookout for a Head Professional position, and when that happens, his income will likely double (at least). We are hopeful that it would be within an hour's drive of the area where we live now, but it's not a guarantee. We know we should stay in a house for 5-10 years to be worthwhile, and therefore we've been renting together for 9 years and counting. We want to invest in ourselves, too. 

We value your opinions, and would love some help figuring out how to be financially secure/smart going forward! Thanks for your time and consideration.",finance
personalfinance,Saving during Grad School (STEM)/planning ahead.,"I will be starting a PhD in applied math next fall. I'll be moving across the country and I am in the process of trying to figure out my finances for the next 5+ years. My parents have very graciously paid for some of my undergrad tuition, but moving forwards I would like to be completely financially independent. 

**Self**

* I will be living in Seattle, and want to be near downtown. I would prefer to live alone, but I would be fine with roommates. I have a good (&gt;750) credit score, but no renters history.

**Savings**

* $5k saved from my current job, probably will save another $5k-7k this summer 
* I will use 2-3k for moving/furniture/etc and set aside another ~$3k as an emergency fund.

**Debt/Long term expenses**

* $22k in federal student debt from undergrad. This will not accrue interest while I am in grad school. I don't plan to pay anything on this during grad school since my income will be much larger after graduating.
* In the very long term I expect I will have to provide some monetary support for my parents' care late in life, but that is probably 30+ years off.

**Income**

* $2575/month TA stipend, with yearly increases roughly matching the increase in rent prices. 
* health insurance 
* public transport pass. 
* I cannot work additional jobs due to my TA contract.
 
**Yearly Expenses**

* $1000 of required student fees each year.
* $1000 for flights home 
* $500 books

I don't see a lot of advice on grad students finances in general, and especially not for students in STEM who receive funding during grad school and who will have fairly high incomes after grad school. Essentially I feel like I'm in this weird place where I'm not making much money now, but will be in the near future, and so I want feedback on living in the moment vs preparing for the future.

My biggest question is whether I should think about saving money during grad school. To me it seems like the small amount of money I might be able to save is not worth the decreased quality of life, given that my income will be *much* higher after graduating.

From the more [detailed budget](https://pastebin.com/GiQrri5Y) I wrote up it seems like I could spend $1.4k on rent, live very comfortably, and still be able to have a few hundred left over each month. I have no desire to have cable or a car which seems to be two big expenses for lots of people. 

Am I missing something big/ making a mistake by not saving anything the next few years? 

Any thoughts/advice/etc. is appreciated. This is the first time I'll be truly financially independent so I'm in uncharted territory.",finance
personalfinance,Fixed or Variable interest rate for 5 year student loan refinance?,"I am considering refinancing the remaining $19,000 of my student loans - all federal, $15,000 at 6.55% and $4,000 at 2.4%. I have over 6 years remaining in my standard loan repayment plan. If I refinance I could potentially pay off the loans in 5 years keeping my payment around the same now (which I am comfortable with). I am usually not a risk taker, hence my concern with going with a lower, variable rate but the loan duration of 5 years is a short (relatively) amount of time. Is refinancing worth it? Do I take the risk and go variable and make extra payments? TIA from a long time lurker.",finance
personalfinance,"Single parenting PhD student, seeking advice about financial aspects of completing degree, managing SSA money","Hi PF. I'm looking for advice about a few upcoming financial decisions. Big questions: 
 
Should I make an in-town move into a relative's rental property in order to reduce my rental expenses and save money?

Can I afford to buy/maintain a car for my daughter?

Should I pay college fees out of my savings or take out a loan? If loan, which lending entities should I consider?

Any advice about managing my son's Social Security Survivor's benefits to save as much as possible for his college/future needs?

I (34/F) am a single parent of two, 16/F and 12/M, and completing my 4th year in a social science-oriented doctoral program at an R1 institution in Texas. I have an additional 18 months to 2 years until graduation. My current financial situation:

  $0 debt of ANY kind (credit card, student loans, auto, etc.) 

  $46,000 in a non-interest bearing checking account at a local bank 

  1 credit card: Capital One Platinum with $2,800 limit, paid off in full every month, 1.5% cash back on all purchases

  765 credit score as reported by Credit Karma  

  $0 retirement for me (not offered at work)


For the first 4 years of my program, I had funding that paid all of my academic expenses, a yearly stipend of $18,000 and an assistantship that paid $9,000/year for an annual income of $27,000. 

This fall, my funding decreases fairly substantially to paid tuition (I'm responsible for fees) and a 9-month assistantship paying $18,000 plus health insurance reimbursement of all but $130 for health/dental/vision and $104K life insurance policyfor me. This funding package will be in effect until I graduate.

Child-related income:
 About 6 months ago, I started receiving child support for my daughter. I currently receive $732/month for her:

  $540/month for current support

  $92/cash medical support

  $100/arrears (this just pays off monthly accrued interest on the arrears, doesn't pay any toward principal)

I am owed $42,000 in arrears for the first 15 years of her life. NCP will pay current child support for another 2 full years until she graduates high school. Upon her graduation, NCP will continue to pay $732/month until his arrears are cleared.

My son's father was unemployed veteran with severe mental health issues, had not paid child support in years and took his own life in February 2017. He left behind a negative estate; my son will receive nothing in terms of inheritance. I have applied for Social Security Survivor's benefits for my son. He is eligible to receive $1445/month in SSA benefits until he turns 18 in June 2022. 

Income summary: starting in September 2017, my household's monthly income will be: 

  $4177 during the academic year

  $2177 from June-August 

Expense summary per month if we stay where we are: 

  $925 rent for 3/2/2 house

  $200 utilities

   $90 full coverage for me on 2007 Accord (fully paid off) and renter's insurance

  $195 braces for son (will be paid off Nov 2018)

  $105 3-line cell plan

  $130 health/dental/vision/life insurance premiums

  $500 groceries

  $300 dining out (We go out Mondays and Fridays when I teach late.)

   $67 monthly maid service

  $200 lawn service

  $150 daughter's math tutor

    $0 cable/internet/streaming services (We rent movies for free at my university library and read ALOT!)

Total Expenses: $2762/month

I have the opportunity to move into a relative's rental property in August 2017. I don't have the best relationship with this relative, but it would reduce my rent to $500/month for a 3/2/1 house.  I would not have to pay for lawn service at their property. This property is in a slightly less-nice neighborhood than we're in now, though by no means an unsafe area. My total expenses would be $2237 per month if we moved here. 

A car for my daughter: She currently has a permit and plans to get a license during Summer vacation. I would really like to get her a car because it would save me about 1.5 of driving my kids to/from school/tutoring/etc  per day. As a full-time PhD student and working 20 hours a week, having those 7-8 hours per week freed up from driving kids places would help me tremendously. 

We are looking at a 2001 Toyota Avalon that's for sale by a retired realtor-lady in my neighborhood. It's got 150K miles, but is very well maintained. Her asking price is $3,800. KBB tells me for this year/model/mileage in top condition, it's value should be ~$3,000. But it is a nice, simple, reliable car. I would pay cash for the car from my checking account. Changing up my auto policy to add my daughter as a driver and the Avalon at liability-only would add $103/month to my auto premium. I'd guess she'd spend about $100/month in gas and need about $50/month for maintenance. Getting this car would add about $250/month to my expenses. My question is, can I afford the monthly expenses on this car myself at my current level of income? I'd rather her not take on a job because she's in a rigorous International Baccalaureate high school program that frankly wouldn't permit her the free time to maintain her straight-A average AND hold a job that pays $250/month. If this car is going to happen, I need to make it happen with my own money.

My academic expenses: I will be responsible for paying my own university fees starting in Fall 2017. They will be about $3,000 per year. I can afford to pay them out of my checking account, but should I? If I pay it outright, I should qualify for a refundable Opportunity Tax credit. The university will offer me a federal loan for graduate students, which starts accruing interest from the day they're disbursed. I don't know if that's a good type of debt to take on. Are there other options I can consider for paying the fees? Are there any federal loan forgiveness programs I might be eligible for if I work for the govt after graduating?

My son's Social Security money: Clearly, the $1445/month I will receive for him over the next 5 years is an unexpected source of income that's come about from a tragic situation with his father's death. It is frightening to know that this Social Security money is the only financial help my son will get from his dad for the rest of his life, but I'm glad to have the security of knowing that this income is guaranteed for 5 years. I'm not opposed to using it to pay my household expenses now. I would also like to save some of it for his college needs. I have no saving dedicated to his college expenses right now. Can you give me some suggestions about saving/planning for this particular situation?

Sorry this is long. I'm editing to space things out to make things hopefully a little more read-able. If you have insight into any one of my questions, I'd appreciate it. General advice for things I didn't ask about, but should have would be great, too.",finance

personalfinance,Any downsides to paying off student loans instead of putting money down on a car?,"I've got a few student loans at 6.55% (a little under 9k) and one at 5% (around 7.5k).

I've been looking at refinancing them but have only seen rates as low as 3.x% with a 5 year term.

At the same time I'm looking to get buy two cars and was going to buy one in cash (used) for around 12k and then trade in our older Prius for a new Prius Prime, which after the trade in and rebates would only require financing about 12-15k. But it seems like I can get a much better rate (between 1-3%) on a car loan than I can on my student loans.

At first I started thinking I should definitely finance the used car if I can get a rate under 3% and put that 12k toward my student loans, but then I started thinking about it and I'm wondering if I should finance more on the Prius Prime and then when I get the rebates (2500 cash back from Toyota, 4500 fed tax credit, 1500 ma state rebate) just pay off the rest of my student loans. Any major downsides I'm missing (besides the lag in rebates before paying off some of he loans) to using this strategy to essential refinance my student loans with a car loan?

My wife and I each have a credit score &gt;790 according to CreditKarma (I think it showed both transunion and equifax). Any reason we shouldn't put both our names on both cars?

I got a new job working for a Town Board of Education about a month ago.

However, last week, which was the 3rd week, they lost my paycheck somewhere between the Central Office and my location. They have since cut me a new check but this event caused me to question my DD. This is when the issue arises. Their response was ""we never received it"". This quickly changed when I produced a document with signatures of received new hire documents.

Barnard College: total cost $71,000 per year

Background: I'm first-generation, but my parents worked extra hard and invested their money so while household income is below 80K, we will have a lot of assets so I didn't get any financial aid.
My parents said if I go instate, they'll pay for my entire tuition/fees. If I go to Barnard, I'll have to cosign $20K in loans per year (federal loans included, so private loans are involved.) They're not really informed about loans, and the loan calculators have been very confusing to me. I hope you can help me make the right choice. Also, I really want to attend Barnard because this is once in a lifetime opportunity for my whole family (my two younger siblings aren't as academically invested as I am.) My parents said they will let me go, but they want to take out $80K in loans (total for four years), despite the investments they have available to nearly fund my education. I want to make the most of my college experience and make my parents proud for achieving so much despite hardships, but I don't want myself to be struggling in the future. I hope to make at least $50K as a fresh grad to begin paying off loans. Is it worth the extra cost to attend Barnard?

personalfinance,Hacking my FHA refi - am I doing it right?,"**My questions:**  
First, after checking out me details is there anything I'm missing? I think I'm doing a solid job shopping around getting quotes from 6 lenders, and the title work.  
The 30 year loans are not very attractive to me, it's great to get greater flexibility in our family budget - but I like big picture wealth accumulation better. Realistically we are trying to decide between a 20 year where we will basically see our P&amp;I remain the same but looses the $75 PMI and pays off our house 3 years sooner OR doing a 15 year that raises our overall payment about $150/mo total when factoring dropping the PMI but will have me owning my house before I'm 50. I'd love to hear some other opinions on this.  
  
**Current Loan:** 30 yr FHA $200,000 @ 5%  
 $176,000 left on principal with 23 years left. Paying PMI of $75/mo ($900 annual) Also have a 2nd position lien of $8,000 that we qualified for as first time home buyers from a nonprofit in my county. Interest free, but we can **not** get money back at the table, nor can we take out a home equity line of credit. Otherwise we don't need to repay that $8k until we sell the house and the organization that provided it is okay with a refi to improve our rate and/or lower interest rate.

**The house** Did many improvements (including new kitchen) and the market has appreciated around here. Conservatively it should appraise at least to $230,000. That gets us over 20% equity so we can refi to conventional. Zillow estimates value at $246,000+ but I think that may be high.   
  
**Exploring Refi options** want to go conventional and ditch the wasted PMI of $75/mo, in addition to getting a better rate. Excellent credit (over 800) and planning on keeping this house for a long time (over 10 years, maybe more). Checking with a handful of lenders and looking at the following rates with 0 points:  
30 years -&gt; 4.375 to 4.125  
20 years -&gt; 4.000 to 3.750  
15 years -&gt; 3.750 to 3.250  
  
closing costs seem to range between $4400 and $3300, although my current lender said that for a 15 year @ 3.625% they can do a discount of $450 that brings closing costs to $2742.  
  
I'm also waiting to hear back from my original title company who I contacted asking if they would give me a break on the title work if I used them again since they already did the work once.

gaming,I had an idea of modernizing Duke Nukem,"I'm not going to let developers say he is dead.  Indeed true 90s Duke Nukem is dead, but I've figured out a way to modernize him.

Now be warned, this concept is a big departure from the Duke you know.

Look up modern crew cut on Google Images, nobody wears a flat top crew cut anymore, so a modern crew cut will do.  He will also wear Aviators and have a red latex shirt(Similar to the shirt Chris Redfield wore in RE5).  His Jeans remained the same, but his voice sounds like someone who served in the Marines and had a snarky sarcastic attitude.  Dukes personality is less Sexualized and more based in the real world.  He is not a wealthy man and he has a drinking problem.

Now here is my story for the New Duke.

Duke Nukem, a Disgruntled Ex Marine Discharged for getting the Generals daughter pregnant is all of a sudden called by the General after 10 years to escort him to Area 51, when they arrive, they find President Drumpf talking a lot of smack to the Aliens, the Aliens pissed call an invasion of Earth.  The General contacts the Galactic Federation about the problem, and Duke must fight off the Alien Scurge until the Galactic Federation Arrives.

During this process, The Generals daughter gets kidnapped and the General knocks out Duke, and when he wakes, find out that a telepathic connection has been made between Duke and the Generals daughter, who now see's Duke as less of a man and more of a schill for abandoning her with her kid those many years ago.

Am 25, about to finish my MS next month in engineering.  
Continuing for a PhD (~4 more years) in the fall. Full tuition coverage and a yearly stipend of **32k**.

Private loan - 24.2k, 6.7% interest  (new)  
Fed. Unsub. Loan - 20.5k, 6.2% interest  (new)  
2x Fed. Sub. Loan - 5k, 3% interest  (old)  
3x Fed. Unsub. Loan - 2k, 6.8% interest (old)

I have **10k** to spend toward loan repayment and wondered which plan will ultimately result in the most money saved? I know the subsidized loans don't accrue interest while I'm in school (deferment) but the unsubsidized and private loans are building interest. Should I pay off the smaller unsubsidized loans first or work on the bigger ones? Both have about the same interest rates so does it even matter then?

personalfinance,Value in holding onto low interest mortgage for credit building?,"I'm fortunate enough to be able to pay off my $300K home mortgage in roughly 4 years. It's a 30 year loan taken at 3.5%.

I have no car payment and due to regularly opening and closing cards, my avg. credit history (per Credit Karma) is only 2.3 years.

Is there any value in holding onto my relatively low interest mortgage at a lower principal balance for a couple of years, or would closing our the loan be positively reflected in future credit checks and loan requests?


It seemed like a no brainier at first, but if I can find index fund returns comparable to my mortgage interest rate, I was curious if there was some value add in holding on the loan from a credit sake.

MachineLearning,[D] Sequence to Sequence LSTM architectures,"The LSTM example in Lasagne (and most examples online) take a sequence and produce a single output. The LSTM layer is unfolded for the entire sequence and fed to a Dense Layer:

    l_forward_1 = lasagne.layers.LSTMLayer(l_in, N_HIDDEN, grad_clipping=GRAD_CLIP, nonlinearity=lasagne.nonlinearities.tanh)

So let me start this post by saying sorry for how embarrassing this debt is, nothing in my entire life, including beating cancer, has stressed me out as much as this and I mean that with all seriousness. I currently owe $16,645 on an auto loan for my vehicle which has an interest rate of 21% (look, I have no parents and learned about finance AFTER poor life decisions, lol) and I have a credit card with a $4,800 balance, a credit card with a $1,515 balance, and a credit card with a $1,670 balance on it. I have just quit my job due to having a terrible boss and terrible subordinates that were taking a toll on my mental health for 6+ months leading me to chronic depression and more mental health issues. (My performance at work wasn't up to my bosses expectations and I was basically going to be fired anyway, however my body decided to have an anxiety attack at work and figured I'd make the decision for her a little early.) I now make $720 a month and will be semi off the grid from society, living in a friends van on a farm. What do i do? Im only 22 years old and I will be on this farm for 6 years. Should i file for bankruptcy? Also I live in California if that is necessary and just to add a bit more information im looking for alternative ways to earn side income, however i have very little options when it comes to work due to medical conditions and lack of education. (I do have a highschool diploma!) I have heard some people say to let everything go to collections, and then pay off a fraction of the debt balances to settle them with the collection agencies in the future, and I'm currently trying to sell the vehicle to a private party, however it is only worth roughly $13,000-$15,000. If i do manage to sell the vehicle for no less than $15,000 i have the difference in savings, however it would be every penny i have saved, which isn't too big of a deal. Im just looking for ideas, keep in mind I can't have my wages garnished due to the fact I make $720 a month cash playing music. (This is not a variable income it is always $720.) Lastly, once again i don't plan or intend on needing or using credit for 6 years at the least, I live a very different than traditional California lifestyle (consider me a new age hippie) and I am somewhat of a bum. Any ideas will be greatly appreciated. Also any idea if i can hide the car for many years and somehow magically keep it?

The medical bills are all under $200. After reading about the snowball method I gave the first company a call and asked them if I paid in full would they delete the account from my credit reports. They said once paid it would be removed within 48 hours. I asked for this in writing but they said ""we don't do that.""

I want to start things off right, so my question to you is, is it legal for them to not send it in writing? Can they go back on the promise to remove it from the reports?

gaming,Your greatest memories in Online Gaming - What are they?,"Online gaming can provide circumstances from which absolutely incredible moments can be born, and I've had my fair share of truly impactful moments, even in shitty games.

I'll share mine in the next paragraph, but I'm really interested to hear yours. Bonus points for good story tellers.


K here's one of mine.

The game was the very first iteration of H1Z1, an alright game at best, but my first foray into MMO(ish) open world survival gaming. 

I didn't know the lay of the land, and didn't really understand how to exist in this world and had met a terrible fate several times in a row - once to a machete wielding scavenger who found me hiding in a motel bathroom... another to a bear who had wandered into a hardware store, a number of other times to unseen foes with long range weaponry - I never saw it coming.

Finally I cross paths with another newbie. He had a pistol and promised me protection if I promised to tag along and share supplies - 2 people looting is quicker than 1 person looting.

I agreed, of course, and we began our journey heading north toward the vague direction of a large town known as Pleasant Valley, where apparently we might find guns in a police station basement.

We ran headlong into a group of 3 other players, each of which was armed to the teeth. They were friendly, and warned us of a hunting party that was slaying anyone who came near Pleasant Valley- a group of 5 or 6 players who apparently didn't like interlopers.

So we branched off North East toward a town called Cranberry, following the advice of this group of strangers. They embarked on their own mission to the South.

At some point we made the decision to detour to the radio tower at the top of the tallest mountain. There, we found a shack, an abandoned cooking grill and a knapsack containing a little food and some ammo, and in a crate, an extra pistol which I equipped. I had collected enough .45 rounds earlier that I had about 2.5 magazines worth of ammo to run through it before it became a blunt instrument.

We cooked the meat found in the knapsack and purified our water, and replenished our survival meters.

In the early morning, I spotted through my binoculars to the Northwest what appeared to be a farm, although it was hard to tell. We decided to move toward it.

Fought a bear on the way down, fed it an entire magazine's worth of .45 before it laid down for a permanent nap.

We reached the bottom of the slope and crossed a river, pausing to refill our water bottles. 

My friend, whom I'd spent the last 2 hours of game time with, turns toward the Northern shore and takes a bullet to the head. I rapid fire in the direction the shot came from, and turn to the east, running as fast as possible to get behind a mound for some cover.

With only 3 bullets remaining, fighting wasn't an option at all. Keeping the terrain between me and danger was all I could do.

Turning North beyond a small hill, I came face to face with 3 players, each holding a long gun of some form, but I'm pretty sure the one with the shotgun is the one who fired the fatal shot. 

The death cam revealed 3 additional players running up from the direction I had come from. They had me surrounded. 

I respawbed, but I never found my friend again. I explored the map as much as possible, hoping to run into him, but he was just gone.

That's the closest thing to experiencing a real death that I've ever experienced in a video game.

It was incredible.",technology
personalfinance,To rent or buy? Please help. (grad student in NYC),"I need some sound financial advice about living in NYC. (I know this is long.)       
Details as to your reasoning would be much appreciated, thank you!!       

I‚Äôm moving to NYC to go to graduate school at NYU, full time in Sept 2017.   
I‚Äôm not too familiar with NYC although I have been going there to look at apartments recently.  
I‚Äôm 26, live in Philly, had the same full time job for 2 years but i'm quitting in August 2017 to move for school.
     
My biggest question is whether to rent or buy. But first, tuition.

I‚Äôm thinking of my tuition and living expenses separately because I‚Äôm living off campus.   
I‚Äôm doing a 2 year masters.  For the first year, when I Subtract my school‚Äôs merit scholarship, work study, and an 8K fed. loan I‚Äôm taking out, I need to come up with  $14,000 for the first year. I intend to get a part-time job teaching ESL to pay this off myself. Also applying for outside scholarships to hopefully cover it. For the second year, assuming I get the same school‚Äôs merit scholarship,  I‚Äôm going to take out a max $20,000 fed. loan to cover the remaining tuition. So my school loans will total $28K or less.   

   I have no debt and My savings totals $14K. I‚Äôd like to save this for emergencies. But I‚Äôm gonna be using this for my personal spending money in the beginning before I get a part time job.   

   Renting or Buying:    
This is my biggest concern and I‚Äôm really unsure about this decision. Especially which one makes more sense financially.   
My aunt died suddenly in winter 2016, she had no kids or husband, and I inherited $40,000 from her will. (This is probably the largest amount of money I will ever get until my parents die, which I really hope doesn‚Äôt happen for 30+ years)     
Because of this 40K, My boyfriend's saying I should buy a coop/condo in NYC instead of renting.
(His long term plan is to accrue small income properties in cities. He already owns a condo in philly for himself and one in CA as an income prop. We‚Äôre not connected financially. )   
But for me, Is it better to rent or buy? Here are the two choices.   

   If I rent:    
Minimum: $1,200K a month = $28,800 for 2 years.      
Maximum: $1,600K a month = $38,400 for 2 years (almost 40K wasted, I don‚Äôt want to spend this much!)     
Cons: would be wasting the money instead of investing     
Pros: I would get to live with roommates, be much closer to the school, like somewhere like bed-stuy, (not as much or fancy as williamsburg) and have a better social life / better job opportunities.     
I would only have to pay for a place in NYC for 2 years if I don‚Äôt want to stay there.        
      
If I buy:      
 
His reasoning is 
 If I buy I can live in it for 2-5 years and then when I want to move out of NYC (I probably will) I can turn it into income property and rent it out, have all the mortgage expenses covered by the renter and  make slight profit. 
With my current income at 32K, and this 40K mutual fund, I got preapproved for a 150K home loan. I would get a studio or 1BR condo/coop. I don‚Äôt need a cosigner and won‚Äôt involve my parents.
I am working with a real estate agent to try to find my properties to buy, for under 150K, all monthly expenses under 1,300 a month at best.     
I would like my closing costs to be under $10,000 including all homeowners insurance, HOA fee, property taxes, etc. I would use my 14K personal savings for the closing costs.      
Buying:      
$10K closing costs. = ~6% down payment (FHA loan)     
$1,300/ month mortgage = $31,200 for 2 years + internet bill, utilities.     
$1,600K a month = $38,400 for 2 years + internet bill, utilities.          

     
My thoughts about buying:     
After 2 years I will have all of my $40K money gone and will still have  this mortgage!      
I can‚Äôt rent it out as an income property until after the 3rd year so will have to keep myself afloat in NYC for 1 yr. after I graduate. Plus 20-28K school loans.     
What if I have trouble getting a good salary? I still have the mortgage to pay until I rent it out.     
Will this property really be a great investment to keep after I move out of NYC, will the renter cover all my expenses with a bit of profit? 
Should I look at it as a potential money maker or a 30 yr. mortgage prison?     
-Last thing: the only properties we're finding for 150K are in Brooklyn, in Midwood or Brooklyn College area in Flatbush.  I don't mind, except that my daily commute will be 1hr. on the subway to get to NYU every day. Is it insane for an NYU student to live this far?      
And I really want to make it a point to be  social with classmates and employment connections at NYU iso  that I can be part of the community.  

Which is the better choice considering the math and the timeline of a mortgage??
I can see the benefits and pitfalls of both, and it's really worrying me that I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the better choice. Thank you so much!!",finance
financialindependence,Whoo-Hoo 2 Comma Club! Real Question: Asset Allocation,"**Celebration**

Obviously a throwaway account since I can't tell anyone.  Our household (36m 33f +infant) just hit two commas of NW (cash, stocks, bonds &amp; mutual funds).   Zero home equity as we rent. 

* How did we do it? 

1. Simple ~~boggle head~~ Boglehead (https://www.bogleheads.org/) approach (before I knew it was a thing)
1. Still lived.   Spent other peoples moneys on travel, food, experiences.  Multiple month long vacations partly on points.   Honeymoon in Europe paid by my employer (on assignment for a few months and took a two week vacation in between)
1. Live in a ~~VHOL~~ VHCOL (SF Bay Area) w/ low cost housing - rent control allowing a high saving rate.   Pure luck.

* How are we celebrating? 

1. Takeout + alcohol + massage
1. Tesla Model 3 - Early reservation holder, probably opt for the base model assuming I can get the full Fed rebate.   If I can't get the rebate, I may skip depending on ~~TOC~~ TCO.  35k is a bit pricey for my taste.


**Question**
What are people's thoughts around asset allocation as they reach milestones?   We have multiple portfolios depending on the duration in our case we have the following:

1. Living expenses - cash
1. E-fund - cash and ibonds
1. 529s - 100% stocks
1. Housing down payment - short term bonds - 100k
1. Everything else - 90/10 stocks/bonds, 800-860k

Everything happened much quicker than expected, so I am wondering what I should make my ""everything else"" portfolio allocation?  80/20, 70/30, etc...   What would you do?

I plan to keep the other portfolios as is or I might potentially build up the housing portfolio so I can pay in cash in a medium COL area.

personalfinance,(CAN) Credit card balance protection insurance?,"I got a Visa credit card as soon as I turned 18 (I needed it for travelling and online stuff). I diligently kept the balance paid off, but about 10 months ago I got kicked out of my home unexpectedly due to personal issues with my family. I didn't have any savings at the time, and between paying for rent, car insurance, my phone, and not knowing how to cook for myself (and thus buying a lot of take-out food I shouldn't have purchased) for a few months while I searched for a job in a new town, I ended up maxing out my card at $8000. (Yeah, I'm aware of how stupid I am. Should have come here a lot earlier).

After finding stable employment, I got to paying off what I owed on the card, paying a bit more than the minimum payment every month on average. I switched to paying for things debit-only, and haven't used the card at all. This was about eight months ago. A few months ago I noticed that, hey, the balance is still at $8000 every month, what is going on? I haven't been spending on it, so it's should just be the interest being charged to the account, but checking the statement, there's several charges on it.

There's the interest charge, of course, a big one called ""purchase"" and a smaller one called ""cash"". Then something called ""balance protection insurance"" which is taxed, and alone accounts for over $100 every single month. I can't fathom what use ""insurance"" would have for me on a maxed out card, and it's effectively doubling my interest rates, putting me at an annual rate of over 40%, which seems a bit high to me.

I recall when I signed up, when I called to activate the card the man I spoke with discussed the balance protection insurance with me, and was very insistent about getting me to accept it. I declined several times, and he continued to pressure me on accepting it, and was adamant about me getting it, telling me it would only be a few cents per month and that it would save me a lot of trouble if my card was ever stolen. I didn't really have a choice. I don't remember agreeing to the charge, though I may have in order to get through this conversation. And now I'm realising what a mistake that was, which has cost me well over $1000 at this point (not quite sure what the total cost has been, since you'd have to factor in all the extra interest I've paid due to it) to absolutely no benefit towards myself.

By the time I noticed this though, I had already been charged several hundred dollars. I intended to call Visa to clear it up, but I've been procrastinating doing so because I don't know how to handle this. I feel like I shouldn't have been charged for this and would optimally like to have the charges reversed, but I've never spoken with Visa after initially signing up for my card, and the predatory nature of the rep I spoke with makes me hesitant to call because I'm not sure what to say, and I'm afraid I won't see any of the money I've lost.

I'm tired of being perpetually broke and want to resolve this, but having little experience dealing with this (I don't even know what the balance protection insurance is for). I should have dealt with this as soon as I noticed it, but either way I'm dealing with this now. My question is, is being refunded for the balance protection insurance charges a possibility? And if so, what should I say to Visa?",finance

personalfinance,Wanting to pay off a loan fast but not much left in the budget.,"To clarify, I am perfectly capable of making minimum payments on all of my debt every month after utilities, food, clothing, etc.  I'm not in a bad spot, I just want to be in a better spot quicker!

I have four sources of debt right now (not counting my mortgage).  Two student loans and two car payments.  All of them have a balance of $5k, plus or minus about $200.  One school loan is federal, very low interest, so I'm not too concerned about it.  The other is a personal loan, higher interest, and the cars are right below the school loan.

I'd like to get one of the car loans paid off quick, as it's a higher mileage care now and there's something really sucky about paying for repairs AND the loan...or worse yet rolling the loan into a new loan cause the car completely broke.  So I want a way to generate 5K quickly.  As things stand now, I can put a little bit extra into the payments under very strict budgeting and maybe have it paid off at the end of the year.

Other options include a part time job on weekends (which would suck for my family), just making minimum payments (bleh), or using some of my home equity (mortgage is around $94k, home was just appraised at $134k).  Or get lucky with the lotto or find a generous benefactor haha.

Suggestions and comments appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Divorcing, taking over mortgage?","Hello. I am getting a divorce after 17 years. We bought a house together in 2008. We paid $172k and borrowed $168k. We refinanced in 2013 at 3.375% for 30 years. At the moment the principal is about $155k.

My ex would like to move out and I would like to stay. We would like for her to take half the equity and she would like her name off the mortgage at the time she leaves. It's going to be hard to beat that interest rate, and though I have decent (740) credit, I have only just been working full time again. My ratios will be good but I'm not sure whether they will want to see me longer at full time.

1) What is going to be my best strategy‚Äã for taking over or financing the mortgage in my name?

2) Do I have much chance of getting equity out so that I can pay her off? The other choice is to raid my retirement which I am loathe to do but I'd pick that over giving up the house. I view the house as my primary retirement. But, it would clearly be better to borrow against the house if I can, even if it means 

3) What's a good fair way to determine the value of the home? Have an agent do a comparative analysis, hire a private appraiser?

4) I have done some improvements to the house such as siding, windows, new kitchen. If I'm going to go for equity what's the best path to get them to take this into account? Our local market has picked up hugely and my sister in law just paid $220k for a similar place.

personalfinance,Income tax withholding - ideally would like to withhold zero. Accountant says this is possible.,"Hi all,

Starting a new job in a few months and, going forward, I would ideally like to withhold as little federal income taxation as humanly possible. My accountant, who I semi-trust, said that this can be accomplished just by claiming 99 exemptions. Is this the case?

I understand that I will have to pay up prior to 12/31 each year, which is fine. He mentioned that I could do so by ramping up withholding just prior to the years end, though I would personally rather do this by just paying the IRS directly if possible (much easier to just cut them a check for the $110k or whatever my liability is for the year). Does anyone know if that is possible?

And one last question - if possible, would this also postpone payment of FICA taxes until years end, or is that forced out in each paycheck to keep your employer compliant?

Thanks all. I obviously intend to run this by a (different, new) accountant when I move as well, but I'm modeling out my personal cash flows right now and am trying to confirm/deny whether this works as he mentioned.


**TL;DR: Want to have zero / minimal taxes withheld each paycheck so that my taxes are paid at year end:**

- Is this possible

- Can I pay the IRS directly or do I have to ""catch up"" at year end by ramping up withholdings?

- Would this also push FICA taxation to years end or is that forced out each paycheck?",finance
personalfinance,Paying student loans and saving for a house. What is the best thing to do.,"I am currently refinancing a private student loan. It is currently at $14,700 with a high interest rate.

So-Fi:
5 year fixed - $275/mo @ 4.625%
7 year fixed - $209.mo @  5.125%

CommonBond:
5 year fixed - $281/mo @ 5.49%
7 year fixed - $212/mo @ 4.86%

I am currently working part-time as an art teacher, as well as subbing the other days of the week. Next year I should be teaching full time. I plan to make around 35,000 salary from teaching. I would like to payoff this loan in 5 years or a little more if possible. My wife and I currently have $30,000 we have been saving for a down payment on a house. (this is money she received in the form of Boeing stocks as a child, and this is its current value. We would have to pay tax to access these stocks) Would it make more sense to use about half of the 30,000 to pay off my $14,700. Or would it make more sense to save for a house since the interest rate is lower?

I also have a government loan that is currently in deferment as I am taking a few online classes. I plan on working in a low income school to obtain $5,000 loan forgiveness. This loan is for $40,000 and has a much lower interest rate. When I begin payments they will be around $440/mo minimum 

Right now we live in a friends rental. The highest we pay for rent is $500 a month. Often times we pay less in exchange for my handy work. 

We are currently researching how to best pay off our loans and eventually invest in a house. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

I used turbotax to file my 2016 taxes. Turbotax had me input everything and all seemed fine and dandy. A thought I was going to 200 back for VT taxes and 800 Fed. I got excited, entered my bank account info and submitted. 

Two days later my account had a negative balance of -$800 as both were charged. I was confused and thought I was going to get money back, so I downloaded the 1040 from turbtax and checked and I actually owe that! I was confused because I didn't make much that year. I then checked that turbotax said I made $16,000! I'm a student who pays for everything on his own, so I only actually made $3,200. 

I live with my parents when not at school and my good grades pay for school. 

I know I don't actually owe 800 to the gov and 200 to VT. now there is a bill at my house for the 800 I owe the gov because they couldn't get it out of my account. I want to pay this today so I don't get a fee for avoiding taxes. I honestly couldn't afford a fee on top of all of this. I can pay it but then I'll be broke, but that's fine I'll use my credit cards for a bit for gas and coffee and such.

I am trying to determine the smartest way to destroy some of my credit card debt.  When I was younger, I made some bad financial decisions and got a lot of credit debt.

One thing I've been doing over the past 2 years to try to lower this debt is balance transfers to 0% cards. I have  pretty large amount of stock ($14,862.06, gains are 1,727.66 of that amount) in long term holdings that has only net 13% margin over 3 years. It seems like it would be wiser to use this investment money in paying off debt.
My current credit debt looks as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

**Chase credit 1:**
&gt; Limit: $5,300.00  
&gt; APR: 15.99%  
&gt; Balance: $1877.22  

&amp;nbsp;

**Chase credit 2:**
&gt; Limit: $12,900  
&gt; APR: 19.74%  
&gt; Balance: 0   
&gt; 0% APR through billing cycle ending in 03/2018. The balance transfer fee is 2% of the amount transferred with a minimum of $5. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Bank of America credit:**
&gt; Limit: $23,000.00  
&gt; APR: 13.99%  
&gt; Balance: $11,554.81  
&gt; This balance just went from 0% APR to 13.99% this past month.   
&gt; Account offer:  0.00% promotional APR until  Nov 2018 on balance transfers completed by Jun 19, 2017. The transaction fee for balance transfers is 4% (Min. $10.00).

&amp;nbsp;

**Amex Card:**  
&gt; Limit: $8,500  
&gt; APR: 12.99%  
&gt; Balance: $6,038  

&amp;nbsp;

**Sofi personal loan** (consolidated a bunch of old credit card accounts to this)  
&gt; APR: 9.615% (fixed)  
&gt; Balance: 22,779.06  
&gt; Loan Term	60 months  
&gt; Remaining Term	53 months  
&gt; Monthly required payment: $526.38 (fixed)   
&gt; Extra paid toward principal: $5.10  


**Available cash in savings accounts:  **
approximately $5000  *(About 3000 of this will be being depleted soon due to an emergency.)*  
Selling my stock would net approximately 13134.4 of original investment and 1468.51 post tax gain.

Annual Income: $130,000.

I have other debts, but they are mortgage and student loans at &lt;6% interest rates and I don't feel like there's any rush on those.


A couple of ideas I have had are:


1)  Transfer BoA balance to Chase, then transfer it back. This will cost more due to the percentages, but allows me to keep utilization on a single card &lt;50%.  Use $10,000 stock money to pay down Sofi loan.


2) Use stock money to pay off BoA, do a balance transfer of part of sofi loan to BoA to save on interest during 0% period.


3) Use stock to pay off Amex and partial pay down BoA. Transfer rest of BoA to Chase for 0% for a year.


4) Use stock to pay off Amex, Chase and partial pay down BoA. Transfer rest of BoA to Chase for 0% for a year.


I am open to other suggestions and ideas.  Thank you!

personalfinance,I'm In A Weird Tax Situation And A Little Short On Time,"I'll try to stick to what's relevant and not get into too much unnecessary background here. It might be more information than is actually needed, but just in case I want to be thorough. 

Last winter my husband and I received a letter from the IRS stating we owed $7000 in old taxes. This letter claimed we had received $50,000 in 2014 and hadn't paid on it. We were both very confused as this didn't happen. I wasn't working that year due to health issues and my husband was in the military at the time. The mystery account had only my SSN, so I went googling, eventually found the company it was associated with, and contacted them. Long story short it was an old retirement account that my mother had left me. She passed away very unexpectedly about a decade ago and this account had apparently been overlooked. The checks had been issued by the company managing the account that year, but they were sent to her old address. We were able to get them re-issued to my current address and I received those funds in December 2016. This turned out to be something of a lifesaver because within a month I was laid off and my cat became deathly ill and had very expensive emergency vet care (she did fully recover) and a month after that I had another health issue arise. Also during the last year and a half my husband left the military and attempted to start his own business. He's stubborn and tried that for close to a year, but it failed and he eventually moved on to a normal job.

Because of his attempts to start his own business we had originally planned to file our taxes as married filing separately. He requested that we let his mother do our taxes to make sure they were done right and that we got an optimal return (his mother is an accountant) and also that we ask for her help with sorting out the issues of the taxes from this old account. TL;DR here is his mother and I are No Contact, she's a bit of a JustNoMIL, but hasn't mistreated her son and we had no reason to think she wouldn't do a great job with this. 

So we asked her to prepare our taxes as well as look into the issue of the $7000 I owed the IRS because when the checks were originally sent out, the required taxes were withheld. This eventually updated in the IRS's system and they sent me an adjusted bill. We forwarded all of this information on to his mother. She procrastinated a lot and everything with our taxes ended up very last minute. Husband and I were both pretty angry with her and I've told him she will not be touching our taxes again, but it got done. We did get a return, but the balance was applied to the outstanding debt I have. We've already agreed she will never touch our taxes or my financial info again (husband I keep our finances separate, if he wants her help that's his business).

As I'm sure anyone here can guess, she did nothing she promised to do regarding my account. She didn't look into it, she did nothing to help us sort it out or get any of the fees taken off, so now here I am with 2 days til it's considered due, scrambling to get things together. Sorry if that's too much backstory, but that's how I ended up where I am. We obviously no longer trust her to be involved and this situation was a bit too much to sort out through google. 

The most recent IRS letter we have accounted for the taxes that were originally withheld when the checks were issued in 2014. That brought the total owed to 2713.01. Our federal return was $1212. That should leave 1501.01. I tried to start an account on the IRS website to confirm the balance due, but it couldn't match our address so I wasn't able to do that. This amount still owed includes a $422 ""Accuracy-related penalty on underpayments penalty"" and a $183.01 ""Increase in interest"" which is being calculated from 4-15-2015 to 4-10-2017. So basically there's an extra $605.01 in fees being charged because the IRS thinks we got this money in 2014 even though we had no idea it existed and we didn't actually receive it until Dec 2016. I want to have as much information as possible before I call them tomorrow to get this paid off and if those fees can be removed that would be very helpful and I would appreciate any help knowing how to approach the situation.

When I want to purchase funds like below (just an example, I believe these are the ones Mr. Buffet suggests) do I use the money from the money market fund to buy them?

* Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX)
* Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIMAX)
* Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF (VSS)
* Vanguard Short-Term Government Bond ETF (VGSH)
* Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) 

Are there ""Target Date"" funds I can use to ""set and forget"" as can be done with a ROTH IRA?

How can I know what ""mix"" percentage I have with certain holdings, as in ""Allocation: 10% of Portfolio"" etc.?

Do you have any suggestions for funds I can invest into? I have almost 12k sitting in the bank earmarked for retirement/investing and not sure what to do.

personalfinance,Selling my home soon and I'll have a decent chunk of money to sit on for about a year. I'm looking for potential short-term investing advice.,"Hello all,

I currently live in the US and will be moving to the UK this summer to attend a 1 year graduate school program. I've owned my current home for approximately 9 years and I'm expecting my net proceeds from selling it to be around ~$80,000. 

I qualify for federal loans and am planning to use them to temporarily fund the graduate program tuition. I plan to pretty much immediately pay the federal loans off within a month of moving to the UK using the proceeds from selling my home in order to avoid accruing much interest. 

I expect to then have between $50,000 to $60,000 (after tuition and estimated living expenses) just sitting in the bank and I'm curious what my options might be to grow that money some while it is sitting there. My plans after graduate school are not yet set but I'd expect to buy another home with that money eventually.

It would be nice to not be restricted from withdrawing from that money in case of emergencies but if there are higher interest gain options that lock it away for a year then it may be worth considering.

Thanks for any advice.",finance

personalfinance,seeking advice about what advice to give to a friend in debt.,"A friend asked me for some financial advice, and i'm not sure i'm giving the best information to her, so i thought i'd ask for more ideas here.

She has roughly 10k in debt, she owes 2600 to a 401k loan, and the rest is spread across a few different credit cards.

She has fallen behind on the credit card payments which have all been raised to the max percent, probably something like 30%. Needless to say, working part time in a mall isn't making ends meet. she has got her monthly expenditures under control, but the higher interest rate isn't making for a realistic repayment situation. 

My first thought would be to looking into 0% balance transfer offers, which i figured would cost a bit upfront, but potentially save her in the long run provided she never ever put any other money on that card. I've never done this so i'm not sure what happens at the end of the offer period.

Second thought (probably the better idea) was to look into debt consolidation, but i've never done that either so i'm not sure if it's a viable option, and if it is, i'm not sure her credit score is high enough to qualify for one. not sure. she does have cosigner should one be needed, so that might help.

And that's where my ideas run out. Anyone have experience with things like this. what advice should I give? Thank you in advance for any assistance.",finance

I need advice with my taxes for this year,  I made roughly $20,600 and I owe $1400 in taxes.  I don't really have the savings to be able to drop all that much at once.  To my understanding my 2 options are either to pay as much as I can and have the difference be taxed at something close to 5% ( according to last years interest rate) or I can throw it all on my credit card which I already owe about $1,500 which would basically max out my card.  I believe my credit card interest rate is close or at the 20% mark. Is there anything obvious i'm missing here? I feel like the best thing to do would be just to pay off as much as I can and deal with the difference being taxed at 5%.  Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated.

So my mom died about a month ago and left me with 100k life insurance and 5k from some other money she had (sister and step dad got the rest). I already had around 10k in savings from during school and make very little money (13k last year working as a TA (was also a student/recent grad) for a few months but only like 10-15 hours a week). 

Tbh, I make so little because I am working to slowly build a business and as you will see my expenses are quite low. Also, I'll likely be teaching/doing higher paying school work as a side job soon as I only just graduated with my BS last May. 

I am just looking for general advice with this money with my goal being having it grow OR using it in a way that will benefit me the most in the future. I've been ""poor"" for most of my life, so I don't really know what to do with an influx of money this large. I am responsible and own most of the spendy stuff I want already though, so I won't accidentally spend it.

Income:

$20/hr @14-20 hours a week
$350 steady income a month from commission stuff

Debt:

24k Federal Student Loans @3-4.6%

4.5k Perkins Loan @5%


Savings:

10k previous

100.6k life insurance

5k other post tax


Expenses:

Student Loans: 350+ (extra money I have)

Random yearly expenses broken down monthly: Uh, like 100? (Renter's insurance, registration, me going to McDonalds when I feel a little shitty, copays, etc)


Among other things I was planning to just pay off my loans, possibly investment around 5-10k in a new small project for my company, spend like &lt;1k on random fun stuff, keep 5-10k in my main savings account and then I don't know what to do with the last 50-60k. 

My company is co owned and we are/were all recent students. I'm not too interested in investing too much of my personal money into the company. It's been growing slowly, but steadily and has been stable. I don't pay myself (or the other owners) despite CTO/CEO (me) duties and instead use the money to pay others (more satisfying to see students and starving artists get paid). I also use it as an artistic outlet/hobby almost. 

Investing sounds kinda scary to me. My mom literally died for this money. I don't know if I want to risk it in the stock market, but I'll do what is smart. :)

personalfinance,Switching to a lower paying job to move bacj closer to my family - suggestions,"Hi all.

I am looking for suggestions on how to manage well my savings and have a somewhat upper-decent quality of life.

- Foreword #1 : I have no debts whatsoever, I own no property, 100% of my assets consist of liquidity
- Foreword#2 : I am not american. I am european, currently employed in Asia.


I am now working at corporate level - making the six figures and so on (ard 120k/yr).
For personal reasons (personal health situation) I have decided to leave my present job and move back to my home country in Europe.
At the moment I have some 180k in my bank account. I plan to leave and be back to Europe in 60-90 days max.
Given the situation in my home country and my personal health situation I cannot find / aim at a job at the same income level as my present one, I am likely to find a job in a similar but lower position or in a smaller company - therefore I expect my salary to drop at around 70k/yr due to lack of all of the ""expat"" benefits, which is fine considering that the place I'll live will have a cost of life waaaay lower than my present location.


A couple comparison on the living costs: 
- here in Asia a big Mac menu costs 5.5 bucks, back where I'll move it would cost 3.5;

- in this city a 100sqm (1000sqft) apartment cannot be found for sale at less than 500k, in the place I am going to move with 220k one can purchase a house, plus here since I am not a national it would be harder for me to get access to loans;

- here in Asia I cannot benefit from free public hospitals but I have to pay for a private health insurance, which is costing me ard 2k/yr, obviously in Europe I will not need it (free healthcare aw yeah !);

- other expenses such as yearly trip back home would not exist (that costed me up to 4k / year);

So the kind of suggestion I am looking for is :

- where should I put my money ? Should I buy property ? The interest rate on mortgages there in Europe is pretty low (1~2%)

- how should I plan my expenses ? 

- should I invest in government bonds/else ?

- should I buy stocks ?


Thanks for your suggestions. If any information you think is relevant is missing above let me know and I will add it .

financialindependence,"What $100,000 USD means for a single person pursuing FI in NYC.","I've wanted to make this post for a while. The point I wanted to get across is that a ""six-figure"" salary by itself does not allow a person to make as much progress toward FI as you might think. I certainly used to think that $100k income somehow meant that you can be more free with money without caring about savings. That's not the case. Below I describe how $100k might get allocated by someone seeking FI (I admit this is partly based on my finances on my first year in NYC).

1) $18k to 401(k).

I think it's almost a given that anyone looking for FI probably want to max their 401K. So let's do that.

2) $26.5k to various taxes.

I ran an income tax estimate on $82k of income on https://smartasset.com/taxes/new-york-tax-calculator. The income tax estimate includes ~19.5k for Federal and Social Security , ~4.5k for NY state income tax and ~2.5k for NYC taxes. After this you're left with take home income of about $55.5k.

3) Cost of living of essential expenses. ~$24k

Ignoring the possibilities like living in a car or scavenging for food from trash cans. I think it's reasonable to say you should budget $2k a month for essential living expenses. This includes rent, utilities, phone, food and things like toilet paper. This does not include any fun or entertainment money.

After all that is said done, the $100k pre-tax salary becomes $31.5k for you to spend on the non-essentials of life and your savings and investments for the future. For expenses of life, this includes things like dating, eating out, having fun, group activity with friends, hobbies, weekend trip and vacations. For savings and investments, this includes retirement savings, stock investments, (possible) real estate investment, night classes and such for investing in yourself.

In the end, the person still need to make tough decisions about how to spend the after-tax-after-essential-expenses money and leave some for investments. Without careful planning, it's not too hard to get into a paycheck to paycheck situation.

Anyhow, these are just thoughts I wanted to express about FI in a HCOL city. Hope it wasn't completely boring to everyone. Happy Saturday!",finance

$40 a month for gas ($10 per week).

My aim is to earn at least 3-4 months worth in savings towards my future move, in which the rent range in this new city is around $1300+. This is to sustain me in the case of when i can get a paying job while im over there. I will no longer be paying the phone bills except for $50 which is mine, $136 for the insurance.

personalfinance,Looking for a sanity check on my financial situation and advice moving forward,"Hey guys, I've been working really hard to get myself in order financially and I think I'm on the right track, but I want a sanity check and a bit of advice like I said in the title. Anywho here's my current situation:

Income-
I'm about to turn 24 and I work as a mechanical engineer in the auto industry (Metro-Detroit area). I currently make $68,000 per year and I expect to be making around $75k by this time next year. 

Investments-
I currently have a Roth IRA maxed out for last year and this year so it is at about $11400 (in various mutual funds), and I have a Roth 401k with a little over $2k in it. the money was in a model retirement plan but it wasn't doing well so I moved it to the Vangard admiral index fund recently. I was contributing 6% to get the 4%match at work but I just increased it to 15% this month.

Savings-
I currently have $15,000 in an MMA as my emergency fund. I have about $6,000 in regular savings/checking. I also have $10,000 that was left to me for my wedding when my mom passed away this past fall. I am getting married next summer but we are trying to do a very minimal wedding so that we can have a kickass honeymoon and still have some of the money leftover.

Credit score ~740
Credit line $28k

Debt-
I have $11,000 in federally subsidized student loans that have about 4.5% interest rate but they won't start collecting interest or require payments until July of this year. I am planning to do grad school but I'm point to get that payed for by an employer. I payed off my car earlier this year and I don't carry a balance on my cards month to month. 

I purchased my first home in march this year In a very nice neighborhood that is mostly families and young professionals but has been growing for many years. I bought the house for $189k (appraised at $195k and is now worth 200+ as I am fixing it up). I only put 10% down because I needed money to buy furniture (this is my first time moving out so I had basically nothing) and to fix the house up. So I currently owe $170k on the house and have a 4.6% interest 30 year loan. Works out to about $1,200 a month for the mortgage and insurance and luckily I don't have to pay pmi even though I didn't put 20% down.

Note: I would like to refinance next year after I get married and change to a 15 year mortgage

Expenses-
So I have my house which is $1200/month but I have a roommate who pays $400/month plus utilities. I am decently frugal so between all my other expenses I have the better part of $1000 a month leftover. Up till now this has either been spent on the house or put in savings.

Fianc√©es situation-
She will be graduating in December with a degree in music and about $40k in school loans. She has a 650 credit score due to minimal credit history. Her plan is to teach lessons and maybe work at churches to start chipping away at her school loans until she can figure out what grad school program she needs for her actual career plan (basically music/art therapy or administrating a non-profit).



So that's my whole financial situation, here are my questions-

1) am I missing anything big that I really should be doing?? Like some super obvious thing that I somehow missed

2) what should I do with my extra money? Kill off my student loan fast? Put as much in my 401k as possible? Put money into the house (extra payments or investments in the house)? Open a brokerage account and invest there?

personalfinance,What makes it so difficult for people to grow and maintain high credit scores?,"Hi all!

So long as I don't waver from my budget, I never run into a problem with the bank or my score.

Now I'm not saying life events don't happen; I understand certain situations make it difficult to protect your credit. But in general, you'd think it was a life/death battle with creditors and banks half the time from what you read on here/see in public forums. I was shocked when I realized this doesn't have to be the case at all.

personalfinance,How fast should I pay off my car? Should I wait a while so I can make payments and increase my credit score?,"Dear PF,

I'm a recent college grad and new to the credit scene. I never had a credit card before and only paid for utilities. Right now I am an authorized user on my mom's credit card.

I recently purchased a car and they said my credit was 675. I asked them if I had any negative points and they said no, its low because I am young and I never had a credit card before.

1. My interest rate is 6.75% and I have the ability to pay the car off in full. Should I make 3 months - 1 year of payments just so I can increase my credit score and then pay it off in full? I'm willing to take a interest hit if I can raise my score.

2. What else can I do as a young man to raise my credit since my problem is a lack of credit history? I applied for the Bank of America Cash Rewards Card but they denied me and instead wanted me to do a secured credit card. Are secured cards the only way?

personalfinance,Overwhelming dental school loans,"I am a currently practicing dentist in the US (just starting to learn how to adult properly) with two major federal loans pulled out for dental school. The first loan has a balance of $265,000 at a 7.5% interest, and the second is $230,000 at 6.5%. I currently make $125,000 a year. 

Right now I'm enrolled in the Pay As You Earn program, which really doesn't even make a dent in the interest; the idea being that I pay 10% of my income towards the loans for 20 years (18 years left for me), then the remaining balance is ""forgiven"" (really it's counted as income for that final year and taxed). Two major issues with this current program are the huge taxes I'll have to pay at the end and also the possibility that the program may be capped at a certain amount forgiven or even discontinued altogether as there is no actual guarantee when enrolling.

Currently I am considering refinancing the larger loan at a lower rate and aggressively paying it off while making the same 10% income driven payments on the smaller loan while I wait and see what the future may hold for the PAYE program as a lot can change in the next 18 years. This would be a compromise of sorts as I believe any refinanced loans are disqualified from any potential benefits from PAYE as they transfer from federal to private loans. 


Hopefully within the next 18 years I have left in the program I'd have completed paying off the higher balance loan and realistically the remaining federal loan balance would have accrued a significant interest. It would then be forgiven as income and taxed, giving me time until then to hopefully save or liquidate assets to pay it off or go broke. 


Currently I have no assets. I rent an apartment.

Married and wife works full time with her own student loans. 

Thankfully no kids yet.

I live relatively frugally, but living costs still eat up a chunk after taxes.

I'm self employed under an S corporation that is in turn independently contracted by the owner of the dental practice, so only a portion of my corporation's income actually makes it to my personal bank account.


My main concerns are:

Is refinancing a good option if it disqualifies me from PAYE? Would refinancing the higher interest loan only be a good compromise?

If I refinance is my wife protected from my debt if I die?

Is there anyway to competitively lower refinancing interest rates between banks? I've gotten a quote from SoFi but it was still pretty high.

I have no car payments, repairs, or large outstanding bills or debts beyond my student loans. According to Credit Karma, my Transunion is 690 and my Equifax is 650, I have not checked my credit any other way and there is nothing in collections minus some report that should be expiring soon.

My long-term goal is repayment within 5-years. I understand this is ambitious, though I firmly believe it is possible so long as no major emergency occurs.

I do plan on contacting my University's finaid office for additional info. Being the weekend I figured I would stop here first.

I am very, *very* new at managing my finances on a larger scale. Through a Series of Unfortunate Events^^^^TM I did not move out of my parent's place until just three years ago. As you may have gathered, my childhood was not exactly overwhelmingly full of positive financial practices.

ANYWAY, I am rambling. Any help, advice, kick in the rears, or questions are welcome. I will answer whatever I can or feel comfortable answering.

Thank you, seriously. With this new job and everything else, including having to look into the mandatory medical insurance, I am beginning to feel overwhelmed.",finance
personalfinance,I'm being taxed up to 30% from my paychecks but I'm supposed to be in the 25% bracket. What am I doing wrong?,"Hello Pf! I hope you're all doing well.

I have recently accepted a job offer paying me 78k/year. 

I recently got my first check for one week's worth and it was at a total of 1500. Around 451 went to taxes - this is around 30% tax.

I have claimed 0 on my federal and illinois w4. I'm also single.

What I noticed is that my previous job (70k/year) the gross was higher.

Any idea on where I can change to make the gross higher? I do not want money back from tax returns. I just want to be even but I always claim 0/0 to be safe. I'm also single.

personalfinance,Freshman in college looking for advice on how to get back on my feet,"I'll try to make this as short and succinct as possible.

I'm a 19 year female college student who's been on the brink of homelessness more times than I can count. For reference sake, I go to Montclair State University, NJ. 

I don't dorm there, I still live with my mother. The grants I received were enough to pay for the entire tuition and a little more. However, I took the two federal loans available to me anyway because I knew I wanted to get an apartment that my boyfriend and I could split. He's from WI, and he's here now, living in the house with me for over 6 months now because we can't find a place to stay. We're both mentally ill. 

My mother has pretty much forced me to give my loan money to her in order for us to not be thrown out, she isn't working so she can't pay the rent and our relationship isn't very good at all (she's very abusive/manipulative). I've given her around $3,050 that she swears she'll give back to me but given her tendency to lie to get what she wants I highly doubt it. It was the only way to avoid homelessness; I only did it so my boyfriend wouldn't have to suffer, I could give less of a shit what happens to her or myself.

But now I have no money at all to try and find an apartment. My boyfriend works but only part-time and makes only around $12,000 per year. We've agreed that once this year is over I need to take a leave of absence so I can work, too. We don't know what else to do. We've thought about moving to WI where his family lives, as it would be cheaper there

The apartments we've been looking at here all require a combined income of at least 3x what we're making. We have no one to cosign for us since my family is not well off at all and his parents are still in WI. I've been looking at other options (i.e. mobile homes, RVs, trailer parks) but I honestly don't even know how to start and what I would need to do once I have it. 

We've considered going back to WI and trying to find an apartment there as it'll be cheaper and his family would be willing to shelter us (plus they're a lot nicer than my family). But I don't know if I could get into the school that fits into the plan (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and I'd want to stay there for a year to apply for the in-state tuition, which is incredibly cheap. But then if I don't get in, I'd have to go back to NJ to those colleges and then I wouldn't apply for the in-state tuition there. 

My mother still isn't working and her landlord is on the brink of bringing her to court. I know she's going to keep asking me for money as she has no other way of paying for the rent. She is quite honestly making my life hell, as well as my boyfriend, who's been nothing but nice to her. I don't know what to do. I need all the advice I can get, it feels like I'm never getting out of here.",finance
personalfinance,Help getting back on track from terrible credit cards.,"Ok - so I recently found out my finances are in a mess. My husband and I were separated for over a year and now are living together again. I just found out he opened 4 (horrible) credit cards and had from $200-$700 on each. Two he ""suspended"" and missed several payments on. I am not happy. These cards have high interest rates, high annual and related fees. What is the best way to tackle this debt - while causing the least amount of destruction to our credit? We have caught up the payments , but I am afraid paying off and canceling them would look bad, but also do not want to keep them open and pay these ridiculous fees just for the privilege. I apologize if this info is already presented somewhere, but if you could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it. Also - we just finished a chapter 13 bankruptcy due to medical bills.

personalfinance,Pay off my auto loan's pay-off quote or spread out payments over time?,"Hey guys,

So 3 months ago I bought a car and financed most of it at an ~11% interest rate (recent college grad with no credit). I have the ability to pay it all off today, however, I would like to keep building credit.

My first car payment was large (like I said, I have the money to pay it down, so I made a large payment to minimize interest payments), and my credit score improved significantly.

If I were to refinance at a lower rate (since I'm at a better credit score now), would it make sense for me spread out my payments over a year to reap the full benefits of credit score improvement?

Or, should I just pay it all of today, which I'm able to do?

I'm a recent college grad, my credit score sits just shy of 700, my original loan was $8500 at 11.54%, ~$3000 of which I paid in one installment.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks.",finance

I'm the primary earner (husband's startup is still pretty new) so it's pretty important to me to have my $hit together.

personalfinance,Negotiating better work/life balance at job,"Hi r/pf--looking for a bit of advice about how best to negotiate for fewer hours at my job. I'm returning to work after maternity leave and would like to start to work part time hours, which my job offers as a general policy, but I don't know anyone that has taken advantage of it. 

My main question is--is it better to ask for the part time work schedule now or later? The situation at work is that I had two members of my team quit while I was out on maternity leave so my team is dangerously low staffed and we're also on a hiring freeze. Knowing that, is it better 1) to ask for the part time work now, knowing they'll be desperate to keep me, and just tell them I'll start the part time schedule once we're fully staff? OR 2) should I wait until the team is back to being fully staffed and things are put back in order and I can make the case by saying, look, I stayed on as a team player while things were tough and now I'd like some accommodation ?

Any other opinions on how to negotiate this?",finance
investing,How to evaluate bond ETFs?,"Looking to add some safer investments to my RH portfolio, so far I've only looked at Vanguard ETFs, which are:

* **$BSV** - Short term bonds

* **$BND** - Total bond market

* **$VCSH** - Short term corporate bonds

* **$VCIT** - Intermediate-Term Corporate Bonds

* **$BIV** - Intermediate-Term Bonds

* **$BNDX** - Total International Bonds

I'm looking at the Vanguard page on each of these bonds and wondering what important metrics are to look for. I swing trade mostly blue-chip or other low-volatility stocks like Amazon, Google, MCD, MSFT, BRK.B, AAPL, BABA if that matters for how I should make my choice.

Fairly aggressive investment strategy at age 23, looking for ~70% stocks and ~15% bonds.

On my own homework, I would say that I would go 40% BND, 30% BSV, 30% VCSH probably because the immediate term bonds have risk if interest rate rise. And if interest rates rise, then the economy is likely doing well so my stocks will be performing well.

Is this a good assessment?",finance

I started adding to the 401k my company had available and it currently has just under $3,000 in it. I recently was offered a position with a new company that I've decided to take and am unsure if I should roll my 401k over to Vanguard or if I should just take the hit and cash it out.

Background: I've been going to school very lightly for the past couple of years, I have finished nearly all of my pre reqs to transfer into a UC or State College AND earn my AA in general education.

I am getting antsy at this point in my life...my goal is to make six figures. I originally wanted to be an engineer but decided the pre-reqs to get into the major was going to take too long.

I started to lean more towards going to a state college and studying computer science...here's where my dilemma comes into play...

I'm working for the county making about 30k a year at the moment. Being a county job, it's not a bad gig, but it's also not where I want to be and I'm 32 so I'm not the newest crayon in the box.

I have been strongly debating quitting my job and just taking out a loan to go to state college full time. This would help me finish school faster....however....I would be in debt and at the mercy of financial aid to make a living.

Should I tough it out and inch my way through school? Or just get it over with already?

She told me they counted my brothers income a few years ago and then shut the discussion down. My brother was expelled for a year in high school and he worked during that, I couldn't find if that effected the household income.

I will be receiving approximately 30k in settlement  money related to a MVA/lawsuit. I'm not sure how timely I will receive this settlement but I'm assuming this year. I will know more at the end of May/beginning of June. This 30k would be my portion after medical bills/lawyer fees are taken out. What do I do with the money? My plan was to pay off my remaining school debt(approx 15k) due to the high interest rates. Save/invest the remaining 15k and throw my old school payments of $260 at my car to pay that off early. 


Bills:
School: $260/month with approx 15k left in total with interest rates ranging from 5-7%. 
Car/insurance: $324 + $88 for insurance= $412. I pay every my insurance 6 months and save around $100 this way. I have 14k left only my car and just refinanced with interest being 2.48%.
Credit cards: $60+$172=$232. $232 divided by 2=$116. Both are 0% interest cards with the $172 being paid off by 11/2018 and the $60 to last approx 2 more years. I divide this in half bc I split them evenly with my SO. 
Health insurance: $130/month. 
Total bills: $918


Other expenses:
Gas: $100/month which depends on where we move.
Food:$200/month with SO spending $200 as well.
Misc/fun: $300 
Total other expenses: $600

Total bills + total other expenses: $918+600=$1518

Savings/emergency funds: I've been pretty terrible at saving but I now use digit (passive savings app with avg of $225/month) and have saved 3k + 2k of active saving. 2k in apple stock. 401k approx 5k.

We moved back in with my SO's parents last year to try to save up to move out of state. That plan has pretty much faded out. Despite wanting to move out of state still I don't think it is a wise financial decision. We didn't budget enough ahead of time and we're fine waiting/possibly changing plans.

Most of the places we find are about $1300/month + $200 utilities for a total of $1500, $750 each.

Total monthly expenses for myself would be $750 rent + $1518 bills/other expenses=$2268/month
My incoming monies: $3140.
Outgoing $ - incoming $ = 872
Is $1500 too much for rent? What should I do with the settlement money? $872 is going to be on the high end, I'm going to up my 401k contribution bc my new job will match at 7%. I've become more frugal the older I get. I could save 1/2 of the $872 and throw the rest at my car bill...  thoughts?

personalfinance,Have I dug myself into a hole? Renting a house starting June and have just started paying student loans (CAN),"Hey guys,

So here's my situation-
I'm 23 years old and have started working my first full-time career job and have been there for 6 months now. I have always lived at home, throughout uni and everything. My 5 year university degree has left me $36k in student loan debt.

For many personal reasons, I have decided to rent a home with a few friends (including cutting commute time, freedom and independence). Our rent will be about ~$750 all in. My student loans are approximately ~$400 per month. Loans and rent together are about 34% of my earnings per month. Plus all other living expenses such as food, I'd be inching closer to 40%-50%. 

Needless to say, after making my first payment towards my student loan, I feel hopeless as each monthly payment doesn't even make a dent with the interest rate of $4 daily -- $140 of my payment literally goes to interest alone.

The reality is, I can afford to do both things. However, I won't be saving loads of money, and I'll be making minimum payments to my loan and elongating it. 

What I thought would be an exciting and fruitful decision has now become daunting and feeling like an instant regret. The costs for living at home are financially null, just some freedom and independence. I live in the city anyway, relationship with parents is great. Moving out will cost financial but gains are the aforementioned, living in the moment and finally doing something I can afford.

My name is not on the lease, and the option to sublet is a possibility in the future; it would be a shitty thing to have to do though. 

What are your thoughts? Am I irresponsible for taking this step right now? Should I have waited some time to be able to pay a lump sum towards my loans? Should I let student loans dictate my life??? Am I limiting myself to working money just to pay off stuff? Will I still be able to enjoy my money and have savings?? HELP - I am too deep in to refuse moving out, but can plan to make it temporary if need be. 

I am having really bad regrets about this all and have lost sleep so I need some insight from similar situations please.

tl;dr - Move out and pay my student loans at a slow pace or plan to move back home in a few months and plan for paying lump sums of school debt? Now vs. planning longterm, potentially compromising some priceless things such as independence.

personalfinance,"23 years old with $30K in debt (student loans and auto loan), wondering about next best steps","Here's a breakdown of my debt:  
Auto Loan: $9,051.71 at 2.9% interest. 48 months to pay off. I pay $66.73 a month to insure the vehicle.  
Student Loans: $21,356.85 total. 5 separate loans with 5 different interest rates. I'm on the standard payment plan so I have 10 years to pay this off, but I want to pay it off sooner than that.  
$5,371.94 at 4.29%  
$1,919.31 at 4.29%  
$5,946.73 at 4.66%  
$4,646.15 at 3.86%  
$3,407.28 at 3.4%  
I graduated in May 2016 so these are in repayment. I have paid off $3,262.83 on my student loans so far. I live at home so I don't have rent and I'm not being forced to move out anytime soon. I'm willing to stay at home to get my finances in better shape.  
I work full-time for $16.10 an hour (since September 2016). I have a 403(b) (I work for a non-profit) where I contribute 3% so I can get the maximum match from my employer. I also have a Roth IRA that I haven't contributed to since I was in college. There's $611.07 in my Roth IRA (I originally put in $500 so there has been slight growth in that). I have $7,719.37 saved up in my checking and savings accounts. I'm not sure if I should keep that where it is or move it elsewhere, given the amount of debt I'm in.  
I have a credit card that I use for daily expenses like gas, food, etc. I use it to take advantage of the rewards program and I never hold a balance month to month. My recurring monthly expenses are:  
$35 for phone  
$20 for gym membership  
I set aside $200 per month into my savings account. I don't touch that money.  
I don't have people in my life that are good with money so everything that I've done with my money up until this point has been based off of information that I read online. I don't have a financial background from college (I have a STEM degree), so I need some guidance. Should I be aggressively paying down my debt or trying to invest or save more of my money? I tried to provide the relevant information that I could think of, but if more information is needed, please let me know.

personalfinance,Is $100k+ in student loan debt worth an undergraduate and graduate degree?,"Hello! I'm a senior in high school about to enroll in college for the 2017 fall season. My top choice is Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, where I would be majoring in Interactive Digital Design (digital media).

If I attend Quinnipiac, I will be apart of the 3+1 accelerated degree program which offers me locked tuition, guaranteed acceptance into their LA internship program, and both my bachelors and masters in four years. Cost of attendance is about $61k; I received a $25k annual scholarship and my parents would pay a minimum of $10k per year, so my loans would be about $26,000 per year. I am unsure if my parents will pay more yet (max would likely only be about $14k though). I would also receive $2k per year in Federal Work Study, but this is paid to me directly, not to my tuition. 

Is the debt I will graduate with worth it because I am receiving two degrees? Or would attending the less financially burdening option, a state school, be wiser in the long run? Thanks in advance!!

**edit:** Thank you everyone so much for your replies!! I've been hesitant to commit because of the stress I'd be under after graduating but you all really put into perspective just how foolish and devastating it would be to take on this much debt. I really appreciate your honest and informative comments!!",finance
personalfinance,Over 100K Student Debt. Consolidate federal good or bad?,"I am mid-30's, single, and employed full-time. I have a bit of credit card debt, but nothing unmanageable. I am posting here to try to see how I can maybe tidy up my budget a bit. I make roughly 50,000 USD a year, have affordable rent, and benefits are provided by my employer. I recently earned a master's degree applicable to my field of work, so I hope that may eventually increase my earning potential in the not-too-distant future. I work for an organization that would qualify me to apply for the Public Service Forgiveness plan, so I wanted to note that in case consolidation would harm that (or would be irrelevant). I made some poor choices when I was younger and am now reaping the fruits of uninformed and over-enthusiastic borrowing from my undergraduate degree in my early 20's. I'm managing payments at the moment, but life would be easier without having to make payments to 5 different companies each month. The average interest for the federal loans seems to be between 5.1-5.3%. My primary target for pay-off has been the Discover loan while I was deferred during my master's program and given the recent increases in interest, remains my main focus. 

I'm getting to an age where I want to build a solid savings account for emergencies, and for possible home ownership in the future. I'm paying off my CC debt and the highest interest loan, but would greatly appreciate some feedback on the pros and cons I might face with consolidating the federal loans. Thank you in advanced for any guidance offered.

personalfinance,[debt] Need help with strategy to pay off two debts.,"I have two loans, a car loan and a school loan that I'm working on paying off. I want to make sure that I'm going about paying it off in the best way possible for my situation. The car loan is at $9,200 and I just got the interest lowered down from 9.3% to 5.2%, making it a monthly payment of $177. My private school loan is $6,200 at an interest rate 7.6%, making a monthly payment of $133. I can currently dedicate $700 a month towards paying off these loans. I feel like I should have a better interest rate with my private school loan, but not sure how I should go about doing that. I haven't considered asking for a lower rate yet because I'd like advice on who to transfer to. I recently paid off a lot of debt after being able to stay with family and now I'm trying to save up to move out. What tips or advice would you give to me in this situation?",finance
personalfinance,Need help! Car lender took my monthly payment but kept about a third and didn't apply it to the balance.,"As the title says, I'm at a bit of a conundrum with my lender. I have a car loan which I've possessed since 2014 and I pay $383.07/month with a 4.99% interest rate. After two and a half years, I've paid off around $14,000 on a $24,000 note and have been, with a few exceptions, on time and pay in full. 

Yesterday though, I looked at my balance and account summary and noticed a little problem. About a month ago I owed ~$10,780 before I paid the $383 amount for April. This should have put me at slightly under $10,400. But, my lender posted that I paid the amount but omitted $166.33 from the payment and did not apply it to the balance, seemingly as though they just pocketed it. 

There is nothing telling me where the money went to, it's just gone. What should I do?",finance
personalfinance,"23 years old, 20k a year, 80k savings, should I put this money anywhere or perhaps invest in very small business prospects (3-5k stuff)","Hi, 

I'm just trying to figure out what to do with this relatively large lump of money I have. EDIT: I got it from not so happy circumstances and was pretty much poor before, but have been good with my money. I don't know if I should just drop it into a bank like Ally or invest in index funds or what. 

Right now it's sitting in like a pitifully low interest rate account (like 0.05% or some shit). Just got the money relatively recently.

My expenses are like 800-900 a month living with roommates. No debt other than technically 2000 of credit card (only card) debt in a 0% APR that I plan to pay off in a week or two with my non-savings money. Credit score is 740.

Any ideas? Trying to maybe make some sort of small passive income so I can commission people like artists for various small projects without thinking about it. 

EDIT: (I honestly just like paying people to make stuff they like. Helping students during summers, etc. Breaking even would even be fine. I just want it to be sustainable to some degree.)",finance

Because the submissions and advice shared on this subreddit have inspired me as well as so many others, I am sharing it with all of you. While it does not contain each and every nuance one might face in retirement planning, it can be tweaked rather easily and is far more elaborate than any other model I have seen online. It might appear a bit daunting at first to anyone inexperienced with excel, but the steps I have included within the model should help each of you in adjusting it to your liking.

**Edit:** 
Major updates made 12+ hours after uploading this post (all times EST time zone): 

1:00PM, May 1st, 2017 - Fixed Local Income Tax formula

6:30PM, May 1st - Added Debt Payments, Other Assets, and Debt columns 

12:00PM, May 2nd - Updated Fed and State tax formulas and multiple instructions in the ""How to Use"" tab

1:45PM, May 2nd - Rather fascinating update actually...I realized the model was assuming all contributions and expenses made throughout the year were accumulating return immediately, but this would not be the case in reality as they would be spread evenly throughout the year. I adjusted the formulas to account for this by multiplying all new contributions by half the return rate for the year added. This dropped the net worth at age 50 in the model from $2.054M to $2.004M, and from $3.503M to $3.420M at age 65, which is a great example of how even minor changes in the length of time one allows their investments to compound can have a material impact on long-term returns.  

4:00PM, May 2nd - **Color-coded cells where user-input is required in yellow** and prettied the model up a bit. **This will likely be the last major update.**

personalfinance,Is there anything I can do as a 20 year old with little credit history to boost my credit score?,"I check my credit score every week through Creditwise and it persistently stays at around 660. I have &lt; 5K in student loans and ~ 13K out in a car loan. I have never missed payments. I have a credit card but because of my lack of credit history it is a wimpy CapitalOne card with an impressive $300 limit (opened it in November). I rarely use it and if I do I pay it off that same month before my statement hits (minus one time). However my overall available credit is literally $300 and is going up to a still unimpressive $500 in June. 

I have bills in my name that I always pay on time (electric, rent, wifi, along w/ my loans). I have good budgeting/spending habits but my credit score doesn't go up and from what I have read it seems the key to having a good score is having a lot of available credit and old credit lines. But I can't really improve either of those things in my life simply because of my age it seems. 

My car loan is at a horrifying 13% interest rate and I am paying it off as quickly as I can but I am very desperate to refinance it and lower that interest rate. However with my damn lack of credit history and low available credit I don't see my score increasing significantly for years. But in years the car loan will be paid off anyways... so my point being is there any way for me to boost my credit score besides maintaining my finances well? 

TL;DR I am young and my lack of credit history causes me to have low available credit which causes my score to remain consistently ""eh"" but I pay all my bills on time and am desperate to boost my score without waiting years.",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth it to pay accrued interest while in grace/deferment when the loans qualify for PSLF?,"I have two plus loans of almost an equal amount (around 12,000) at an equal interest rate.

personalfinance,I screwed up and now I have 120k in student loan debt.,"I'm about to turn 23 years old and I'm sitting on about 120k in student loan debt split between 30k federal unsubsidized and 90k in a parent plus loan in my mothers name. I currently pay about $175 on the federal and $635 on the parent plus per month on a 20 year extended graduated plan (the unsubsidized is not extended and is 10 years). Average interest rate is about 6% between all the loans. 

I currently have an annual salary of 35,000 in the field that I went to school for (entry level position, expect 5% increase annually in current position capping out around 50k). Obviously with promotions and whatnot I have higher income potential up to six figures, but that is years down the road. My question is, is it worth it to live down to the bare bones and pay as much as I can to my debt? Or should I pay minimums until I can realistically afford the extra payments?

Current fixed monthly expenditures;
Rent - $175
Car Insurance - $156
Gym Membership - $65
Pandora - $7
Cell Phone - $63

Is it realistically possible for me to make additional payments on top of my minimums? I appreciate the help guys, feels like I really screwed myself with the student loans.",finance
personalfinance,"My school suddenly dropped my financial aid, how can I manage to continue attending without help from my parents?","Hello, I am a college student who really needs some advice, and I think this may be the right place to ask.      
I had a full scholarship at a great university but as someone working toward an engineering degree I've had a hard time maintaining my GPA above their threshold to retain financial aid (3.5). I was hoping that this semester I would be able to get it back above the threshold and regain my financial aid but I was not able to make it happen. This happened very suddenly and has been severely affecting my mood and motivation for school.        
Now, I owe the school approximately 6k for this semester and will owe them another approximately 6k if I would like to enroll for fall. They have offered me a payment plan where if I can pay half of this semester's balance I can enroll for my fall classes, but I'm not sure I'll even be able to swing that.       
I have about $300 in a savings account, another $400 in a Roth IRA (only mentioning because I'm not entirely sure how they work) and a little bit of money in my checking account. I pay a $100 car payment and a $50 phone bill each month along with another $100 for my car insurance.       
At this point in the year it is too late to apply for federal aid, I believe, and there is absolutely no way I can ask my parents to help me pay the tuition or take out loans. I need to put together a plan to enroll for the fall (make 3k and pay it to the school by July 15th) and a way to pay for the remainder of my time in school. I have a full-time job for the summer so I will be able to make some money but it will certainly not be the $12,000 I need.      
Any advice helps. Thank you.        
TL;DR: I screwed myself over relying on financial aid and now that it's been pulled I have no idea how I will continue my education.",finance
