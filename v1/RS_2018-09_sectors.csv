personalfinance,Lots of debit rolling in and looking for advice on how to deal with it,"Hello, let's get to it.

I'm a recent college grad, working at a job that pays about $858 (after taxes) every two weeks.  My contract expires in November, just as my students loans begin their payback process.  Plus in my never ending wisdom, I racked up a bit of credit card debit in college that I'm trying to pay off.  I'm just looking for some helpful tips on the quickest way to deal with all of this.  It's all laid out below. 

* Student loans: $60,000 (roughly)
   * About $30,000 from the Government in subsidized and unsubsidized 
      * I know that the payments on this can change but the quickest way to pay this off is $300/month payments
   * About $17,000 to one private bank (For the sake of this let's call it Bank A)
      * This bank hasn't told me my monthly payments yet but let's assume $190
   * About $13,000 to another private bank (Bank B)
      * The monthly payments are going to be $158
* Credit Cards: $9,000 (roughly)
   * This is split between 4 cards and I attempt to make $100/month payments on each card, so monthly payment totals to be $400

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.  I've already started a monthly budget and I am trying to reduce my spending as much as a possibly can.  But I'm just slowly freaking out about the hole I've put myself in.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and a side note, the interest rates on my students loans are relatively low between; 4.2% at the lowest and 6% at the highest.

devops,Logging and analytics - open source self hosted options?,"tldr.

 1.) What do you use for centralized logging and parsing said logs?
 2.) What do you do for metrics and general server monitoring?
 3.) Roughly how large?



1.) What are you doing for logging aggregation and analytics in your environment? I don't want logz io or any hosted private solution. As in depth as you're willing to go please. I will do the same and elaborate as much as I can if anyone has any questions. 

I know this topic is explored extensively but I thought I would poll real people instead of sales people and major Corp blogs. 

I work at a small to moderate sized infrastructure place that is mostly if not entirely open source and self hosted. Here we have tried and left multiple solutions in place. None of them fully implemented. 

We have a bunch of hypervisor nodes (~100) per environment, about 5 environments. Logging via rsyslog to a couple central syslog nodes. Separate but together we also have filebeat installed on hundreds of vms and a few hardware nodes logging to an all but abandoned elk stack (going to logstash then to elasticsearch in the default 1 index per day). I created the cluster and it has grown ad-hock for years just accruing more data and creating more indices. I know I goofed. I want to rehaul and fix it. It's about 30 16 core 16gb ram 500gb disk vms for elasticsearch, and 4 logstash vms that are just 4 cores and 4gb of ram. 1 kibana vm. Haproxy sits in front of every elasticsearch instance and does some simple routing and basic auth. Seems to work pretty well.  Iptables blocks anyone not in an ipset from hitting it, while it's not shield and marvel I think it's sectioned off pretty well. 




2.) Metrics. What are you using and how?

Separately but together I set up 12 carbon cache vms, 4 carbon relay vms, and 4 graphite web vms that handle metrics exclusively. Our namespace is polluted far beyond anything I can keep up with. All of our nodes and vms are puking metric data to this cluster in duplicates all over. For graphite clients we have nagios, diamond, collectd, various bash and python scripts, and netdata. All of which log from overlapping hosts and overlapping metrics. The default aggregation I have stores the results for years before dropping them.  I'm using Grafana as a frontend because damn is it pretty and it's so easy. 

I have a 5 node test of opentsdb/bosun that I really like (I can back it up and scale it easily). If all goes well I am planning on querying all of the graphite metrics I care about and barfing the results into bosun via a python proxy I wrote. I like that bosun can do forcasting, alerting, and query multiple sources (graphite, opentsdb, elasticsearch, influxdb etc) out of the box. Anyone (outside of stack exchange) use this? It's pretty slick. 

It's a dumpster fire and I built over years that I want to rehaul.


So tldr.

 2.) What do you do for metrics and general server monitoring?

personalfinance,A few questions about restructuring loans.,"I'm looking for some thoughts on how I should go about trying to save myself some money.

I currently have a car loan of $18,800. I'll soon be at the one year mark for the loan, with either 4 or 5 years left. Interest on this loan is 7.29 %. The car is worth probably around $15000 so I'm a bit upside down on it. 

I also have two student loans (consolidated with Fedloan because I had no idea what I was doing) in total of $9,200 with interest of 6.375%.

My credit score has gone up significantly in the last year due to a few old derogatory marks falling off, plus the year of on time payments for the car.  It's dipped this month due to high utilization, but for reference it was over 700 last month and Creditwise/Vantagescore seems to think it'll be at around 730 when it updates again. 

After reading up on things, I realize these interest rates are pretty bad. Ideally I'd like to refinance them both. 

And if it's practical, I'd also like to open another credit card. My current Capital One has no rewards whatsoever and a paltry $600 limit. This isn't terribly important though. 

So my main question is, does it matter in which order I apply for refinancing? Is applying for refinancing on one going to hurt my chances / interest rate on the other? 

The last thing I should mention is that while I'm doing financially *okay*, I had a lot of crap happen within the last month so I'm a bit low on cash at the moment and I'm not really trying to increase my monthly payment amounts right now. And I might need to move out of this apartment in February, which could be a bit expensive.",finance

personalfinance,Est Fed taxes - W2 and 1099,"Hi

​

Trying to create a quick excel sheet to estimate the taxes I owe.  Have W2 income that will get me above the OSDI limit.

Estimated amounts

1. Business Income = 110,000
2. Expenses - $10,000
3. Simplified home office ($5 per sq foot, 64 sq ft ) $320
4. Net Profit is $110,000 - $10,000 - $320  = $99.680
5. Self employment taxes = $99,680 \* 0.9235 \*0.029) = $2669.58
6. Solo 401k (profit sharing only, 20%) = $99,680 \*0.20 = $19.936
7. Taxable income = $99,680 - $19,936 = $79,744
8. Federal income taxes (going by tax table -- get total income tax owed from both W2 and 1099 sources - taxes already paid through W2 employer -- 1/2 of SE tax of $2669.58
9. Take home pay  is $79,744 - result of #8 (assuming $18,923.51).

Am I missing something?

Thanks

personalfinance,"(USA-KY) Looking to buy a home, trying to get a bit of advice before we go for a loan.","A few months ago the idea of being able to afford a house for my family was so distant as to not even be worth putting a date on it.

I am the sole income provider for a family of 4, my children are special needs and we've determined it's best for one parent to stay at home with them and not worth the cost to pay for child-care. I work for an Automotive Assembly Plant and bring home about $2,400 per month (I will also receive steady raises for the next 5 years and eventually make closer to $3,500 or greater once topped out). I have no debt, I still live mostly check to check (with a small emergency fund of about $1,000) but am frugal enough to avoid it being too close. I manage to save a bit but it's very small, $10 here, $20 there, and at the rate I was able to save the idea of having enough for a home was out of reach.

I rent a decent home, but am unsatisfied with our landlords and do not plan to renew my lease next year when it expires in May.

I have very little in the way of credit history, I have no debt, only one small credit card I opened a year ago for the purposes of building credit which I've used for gas and so on, but unsure if that's really done much to my credit score (I have not checked this year) but I am likely pretty much a ghost.

My mother-in-law also lives with me, she was working up until a couple of months ago and paid for half our rent (which is $1,100 per month, so $550). She will continue to live with us for the foreseeable future and has recently been granted a retroactive disability payment for 3 years in the amount of $45,000, in addition to a monthly ongoing disability check. She has agreed to give my wife and I $20,000 to use as a down payment on a home. Her money should be granted to her at the end of this month.

So now with this new amount, I can begin to look at options for getting a home loan. I've been told that going in with no debt, steady employment, and $20K down that I will most certainly be able to get approved for a loan regardless of my credit score, though that's purely anecdotal.

My wife and I attended a home-buying seminar a few years back so we are already somewhat aware of the many costs of buying a home, so we already know a bit about closing costs, PMI, Property Taxes, Inspections, and so on, some of which I know can be covered by the seller and/or rolled into your mortgage payment (I will likely be doing property taxes via Escrow to avoid large lump sum payments).

So now it comes to what to expect? I know the old wisdom for home loans said you should put down 20% as a down payment, but I also know this isn't required, but not doing that means paying PMI. For $20,000 down I would only be able to get a $100,000 loan at 20% and with the exception of a small handful of foreclosures, houses in this area simply don't go that cheap, at least not ones big enough for 5 people. I will need at least 3 bedrooms with a minimum of 1,500 square feet, and ideally on at least half an acre of land (I prefer rural if possible). In this market these type of homes go for about $120,000 to $175,000, anything over 175K I have determined would simply be too much for me to afford regardless of what I'm approved for.

Now I'm not that picky about interest rates or whether it's fixed or not, or if I have to pay PMI, my main concerns are simply getting a house that I can afford where the costs are lower than what I pay for rent now ($1,100). WIth my mother-in-law gifting this money to us it's unlikely she'll continue contributing the same share of the monthly payment she had before so I can't go above any.

Here's my questions:

* I bank with a local credit union and have been with them for over 5 years. My dad recommends I go through them for getting my loan but others have told me go with a mortgage company, any advice on how to pick?

* I have read that any gift of money for a down payment may need to be accounted for via a note from the gifter indicating it is a gift, but that any gift in excess of 15K is taxable. I've heard tax rates on gifts are very high, how likely is it I would be taxed on the 20K gifted to me and at what rate? Is there a convenient way to avoid having to pay taxes on it?

* I plan on seeking pre-approval for a loan as soon as the money is available and in my savings account, what sort of realistic time-frame from start of the loan application process to getting in a home should I look at? If I start in October of this year are my odds of closing on a home before my lease is up next May good? I don't intend to sit idle but I know there's a lot that involves waiting on other people.

* I know realtors help you find a home, but I feel comfortable in my ability to find one myself, is there any other reason to hire a realtor? I'd prefer to save as much money as I can and skip that part if possible. I've heard some people say you have to have one, but others say you only need a lawyer to close on a property.

* I am still very new to the terminology used in home buying, I know the basics but still feel a bit overwhelmed. It still feels a bit complex to me, so I was curious if there's any good introductory articles or videos aimed for laymen that might help me become better acquainted with the process and it's terms.

Any other advice relevant to home buying in my situation would be appreciated. Feel free to ask questions.",finance

The navient loan was my largest mistake as a teenager. I borrowed $6.7k from them over ten years ago, and barely moves when I make my monthly payment. I feel like this needs to go now.

Since the navient loan is almost half accrued interest can I use that to reduce my taxable income at year end?

I’d really like to own a home. I think my income could fetch me something around $200k comfortably. I’m single, no kids, and unfortunately no SO. I know debt to credit ratio is a thing, and I have $30k in available credit. Currently, my credit score is just shy of 700.

personalfinance,"Newly graduated from private school, landed a full-time RN job, what's my best route for student loan repayment?","Hi Everyone,

I'm a graduate of May 2018. I attended a 4-year private school, which my parents help me out quite a bit with. However, I  have $47k of federal loans, ranging from 3.7-4.6% interest. I landed a job as an RN in a West Coast hospital with a competitive pay rate. I will be getting a base rate in addition to a night differential once I am working on my own. Which will probably yield me about $6k/month without taxes (around \~$500/shift). This is not taking into account any added shifts or overtime, which I plan on doing once I am comfortable.  

I have a $415/month car payment and $1450/month rent. I plan on tackling my credit card debt that I got during my last 3 years of school. I did work while in college but with full-time student status and a per diem job 30 miles from me, it wasn't very easy to pay off my cards (which I know, I shouldn't have got them in the first place). However, with my new, full-time job, I want to pay off my credit card debt ASAP, because I now realize how much it really just eats away at your wallet when interest kicks in. 

I am debating between consolidating my loans, setting up an income-based repayment option, or a revised pay as you earn repayment option. If anyone has any advice on repayment or any action plan that is best for a new graduate in a position such as myself, I'd really appreciate it. 

Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,I [20] have 40k in bonds/CD. Should I cash these in and invest in an index fund?,"My mother passed away 4 years ago and she left me a few accounts of a federal credit union, one with 10k, another with 10k, and one with 20k. The 20k account doesn't have anything saying it is a CD. The other two accounts with ~10k, the first one notes ""renewed at 3%, to mature 8/2022"" and the second one says the same thing, but matures in 2020.  I was thinking of investing the 20k account into an index fund at the moment, since the economy seems to be doing swell, I feel like it would be a better return on investment. 

Currently, I am being paid dividends quarterly of around 70$ on each of the 10k accounts. The 20k account also only pays around 60$ quarterly, which confuses me. Maybe because it isn't a CD? I am not sure, I will call the bank later, it is located in another state.

The index funds I was looking into were the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares and Schwab S&amp;P 500. They seem safe and tend to do better than 70-80% of mutual funds in bull markets, and don't even require a broker.

personalfinance,How long does it take to repair my credit in order to buy a home?,"So my credit is shit. To make a long story short, I was a single mom who racked up some debt when my ex and I broke up. I then got sick and had to take unpaid time off, had no savings, and got way behind on my credit card bills. They wouldn’t accept anything lower than the minimum payment so I told them fine, I’ll wait until it’s in collections and work with them.

Fast forward, my credit score is in the mid 500’s. I have just under 10k in collections, $8500 of which is from the apartment complex I left when I got sick. I need to follow up with them on why this is. I have 8k in student debt that’s currently deferred (have been unemployed for 8 months but start a new job next week). Then I have just over $5400 in charge off accounts on my credit report. 

I’ll be making good money and am currently living with a friend. I am able to stay with my friend while I clean up my credit and save for a down payment. I’ll be able to save about 4k each month for that purpose. 

My question is, if I could pay off the collections accounts in just a few months and possibly get a few original creditors to remove the chargeoffs after requesting a good faith adjustment, how long will it take my credit to improve where I can realistically get a loan without ludicrous interest rates? Once my debt is paid, I could save 20% in 6 months. I should also add that I don’t think I would qualify as a first time buyer. I had bought a place with my SO, moved out and years later, has been sold. This shows on my credit report as a closed account without a single late payment. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Should I take out a Mortgage with interest rates rising in this case?,"#tl;dr - should i take out a mortgage on my property to invest in index funds given interest rates are going up in the US?
---
Situation: 
I have a paid off house and want to take out a mortgage against it purely as a low interest loan to invest in index funds with. I have a steady income through a stable job to afford the mortgage payments. This seems like a great idea to me because:

1. Leverage without margin call - Assuming I can pay off the mortage each month and that amount is fairly constant/decreasing as I pay back principle. The mortgage access to additional funds to invest in index funds with.
2. The interest on the loan is so low that the difference between how much the index funds increase vs how much interest I need to pay back will be profit.

Some potential drawbacks:

1. Is it possible the bank asks for the mortgage back at some point earlier than the mortage term? Will the monthly payment be constant/decreasing?
2. If the stock market goes down a bunch, I lose a lot more. However I am not worried if the term limit on the mortage is sufficiently long since I trust stock indexes to trend upward on average over long periods of time.
3. It could be dangerous if I lose my job and cannot afford the mortgage anymore, but I am willing to take this risk. 
4. The mortgage would be a cash out refinance on a non-owner occupied property. The interest rate would be less favorable.
5. Would the bank allow me to cash out refinance for the intent of investing in index funds? I know its common to do this to purchase more properties, but haven't heard of anyone doing this to invest in index funds.

personalfinance,US Federal taxes and HSAs,"Just started a new job recently, and am trying to figure out if contributing to an HSA is a good option in my situation and if I understand IRS rules with respect to HSAs.  

I was employed with another company from Jan to Apr, took some time off to travel, then started a new job this week.  From Jan-Apr I was covered under a plan that had a deductible of $5000 (the employer had a program to pay for costs over $2000, which was the ""effective"" deductible if that's relevant),  switched to an ACA Silver Plan which had a low deductible from May-Aug (I don't think it was HSA-eligible, which I'm now kicking myself for doing), then switched to a health plan that allows for HSA contributions from Sept-Oct.  I'll be eligible for employer health insurance on Nov 1st, which has an employer HSA: essentially they contribute $1500/yr, not sure if this amount will be prorated for me or what have you.  However, HR did tell me the other day that they are considering switching to another health plan which may have a deductible lower than what is allowed for HSA contributions.  So I'll assume for now that I am HSA eligible for 6 months this year.

My understanding is that if I had an HDHP for all 12 months of the year then I could contribute $3450 pre tax, but for me I assume this amount is prorated ($3450 \* (6 months / 12 months) = $1725 minus any contributions from my employer).  Does this seem right?  If I'm not on an HDHP come December, am I allowed to contribute the aforementioned amount to an HSA?  Alternatively, if my employer decides to stick with their current health insurance or move to another plan which would still allow for the HSA, I assume I could contribute $3450 minus their contribution (which I take carries some risk if they change the plan again sometime in 2019, I'd rather not have to pay taxes and penalty on an excess contribution)?  

I'm already contributing the max to a traditional IRA in order to avoid paying back any subsidy (hopefully enough that I get a credit instead, if my math is right) which I used from May to August.  I also contributed to an FSA from the previous employer, but I could only contribute peanuts since I'm healthy (honestly more trouble than it's worth and I doubt I'll use one again).",finance

personalfinance,Intersection of Tax and PF. Mortgage Interest Tax Credit Question,"Hey I live in Virginia where the state Housing Development Authority has a program called the MCC (Mortgage Credit Certificate). The program, which you apply for, allows first-time or people who haven’t owned a home in the previous 3 years to obtain a tax credit applicable towards their federal income taxes. It is good for the life of the life of the loan. How it works is, in a given year 20% of the interest you paid on the loan, can be used as a tax credit. I checked the income and area restrictions/limits and I check all the boxes. 

Based on the price range of homes I’m looking at, and looking at 30 year amortization schedules at a fixed 4.25% interest rate, This means for me, I would be able to subtract more than $4K a year from my taxes owed straight up. ***Not a deduction, but simply whatever I owe in taxes, subtract $4K from that. For example if I owed $10K in taxes after my deductions and everything, using this would make it less than $6K.*** The only tax credits I’ve ever used have been educational ones years back.

2. Cash. Most mutual funds have some cash. It's been a bull market in a low interest rate environment. So every bit of cash tends to be a drag on performance. In a bear market, it might be helpful to have cash.

3. It's been a narrow advance. A small number of stocks account for the bulk of the gains in SPY. Funds that are underweight the big leading stocks are going to underperform.

personalfinance,Should investments be postponed in favor of debts when the interest rate of the latter is greater than that of the former?,"**The below assumes no employer matches to contributions or anything else fancy like that.**

My current understanding is that if you have the options of putting your expendable income towards either:

* a debt with, say, a 7% annual interest rate, OR 
* an investment with, say, a 6% annual interest rate,

you should allocate as much of your money as possible towards paying off the debt (meaning don't put **any** money towards the investment), because the growth of the cost of the debt is greater than the growth of the value of the investment. **In other words, when considering the net change in your future wealth for each dollar spent on either option, a dollar put towards the (higher-interest-rate) debt is the most efficient/worthwhile option.**

However, I read an article recently [https://www.moneyunder30.com/should-you-delay-retirement-contributions-to-pay-off-debt](https://www.moneyunder30.com/should-you-delay-retirement-contributions-to-pay-off-debt) which claims that you should invest even when you have expenses left to pay. Of course, it doesn't mention any concrete example figures (which seems pointless to me, given that it's a financial advice article), but I've definitely seen the sentiment of ""invest regardless"" from a lot of sources, both in person and online.

**4) Does it make more sense to ride out the public sector thing and get my loans forgiven, or wait a few years and transfer to the private sector and get a higher salary and just pay off the loans fully myself?** The thing is, with my government salary, I expect my interest to accrue almost as fast as I pay the loans off, so I’ll be treading water essentially for 10 years until the government forgives the debt. So even if I move over to private sector after 3 or 4 years, I’ll probably be starting off without having made a dent in the loans.

personalfinance,Please critique my budget,"Hello, PF.  Here is my budget:

https://imgur.com/a/RFAuShG

I am new to the world of personal finance and would like to know if there are any glaring mistakes in my handling of my money.  Budget item Student loan 1 are my private loans and are the first two loans listed at the bottom (with the variable rates).  Student loan 2 are my federal loans.  The minimum payment is $2161 and I am paying 1k more each month (or trying to).  I'm on the level payment plan with my last payment set for the end of 2025, but would love to have these paid off at least 2.5 years early.  I am 31.

I only very recently became eligible to contribute to my employer's 401(k) and have not begun doing so because there is no matching and I figure the money is better spent towards my loans.  The existing retirement balance is from my rolled-over pension from a previous job and contributions to a Roth IRA.

I've made some good progress on my loans but feel I could do better.  I have no car payment because I recently paid off the remainder of my auto loan (went with the snowball method because I needed the psychological boost).  I am putting the extra payments toward the 7.65% student loan token until it's gone.  I am partially tempted to just pay it all off next month, but feel that may leave me with too small of an emergency fund.  I treat my 25k total in my checking and savings as my EF.  I am also thinking of refinancing the federal loans and think I could get a pretty decent rate, as I have a good credit score and have gotten some quotes as low as 4.25%.  I am looking to change jobs now though so I kind of want to wait until I land something new, so I have a better idea of my increased cash flow and whether I could refinance to a 5-year plan or something like that.  I am hoping that a new position could garner an additional 30k gross income/year.

Another question: are my SO and I crazy for considering having kids maybe in 2-3 years?  SO makes more money but maxes out 401(k)/IRA contributions and so nets about the same take home pay as me.  Has no loans so is able to save about 1-3k/month depending on expenses.  We are thinking of perhaps trying to have a kid in two years.  This would be before I am done paying off my student loans, but I figure SO could bear the brunt of child expenses for the first year or so before I pay off my loans and am able to start contributing my fair half.  Once my budget frees up I figure I can start maxing out my 401(k) and we could save maybe $500/month total in a 529 and have at least some money saved for the child's education.  As for other long-term goals, we would like to purchase a home someday but live in a very HCOL area.

So, what would you do differently?  What can I improve on?  And should a kid in the next couple of years be off the table?  Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,How can I afford grad school while supporting my family?,"Throwaway since I would rather my friends not know my salary.

Here's my current situation: 23M, making 45k at my first real job in finance, contributing 10% to 401k and maxing my Roth IRA. My wife (23F) is a SAHM since we had our first baby a few weeks ago. I live in a college town with a major state university.

I'm interested in going back to school for an MS in Data Science. The local university's program is relatively new, so it may or may not provide funding. But, the tuition is very cheap since it's in-state -- it would only be around 12k for the whole program, which I would be fine taking out student loans for (I have no other debt, and my wife's debt is small and at a low interest rate).

My question is, is there any way I can provide for my family's needs (rent, food, and especially health insurance) while I'm doing this? The program is full-time and 95% of the classes are during the day, so I would almost certainly have to quit my job. My wife wants to continue staying home with the baby. Taking out additional loans for living expenses (our annual spend is ~25k) seems like a heavy burden.

I'm at a loss here. I would really like to go back to school, but I just don't see a way that isn't financially unsound. Help?",finance

I have about $1,000 on the stock market with steady growth and I'm studying finance and economics to learn how to potentially make that my career, so the way I figure it is take a strong percentage of the inheritance to an investment banker and put a small amount into my current trades while continuing to work, with the goal of being self sustained on trading and investments.

We're considering trying to max out all three for a couple of years to try to catch up on retirement savings (had relatively late starts at our current careers/income levels).  Is there any reason not to do this?  We do have some student loan debt remaining (about 45k total combined), but via federal loans at 3ish percent, so I'm thinking it doesn't make sense to pay that or pay off our mortgage (also at 3ish percent).

personalfinance,What to do with money that future in-laws gave us for engagement present?,"I recently got engaged, and my fiancé's parents gave us $10,000 as a gift. I think the initial intent was that we could use it toward our wedding. However, they know that we are not going to have a traditional wedding so they said to do with it whatever we want. 

In place of a traditional wedding, we plan to elope next fall and then have a fancy dinner with our family and close friends when we come back. In total, that will probably end up costing us about 10k. So should we hold on to this gift money for over a year in a savings account to use it for this purpose or spend the money on more imminent purchases?

I currently have around 40k in student debt with an average of 3.88% interest rate. I'm currently putting a little over 1k a month toward this debt. My fiancé has no current debt. Putting 10k toward my student debt would help tremendously in shortening the time it would take to pay this all back, but I feel a little weird putting engagement money toward debt. It seems like it makes the most sense financially though.

We have ~6k in current savings, and we can save an average of 2.5k a month. We just recently bought a house which is why our current savings is low. We have numerous home renovations that we want to do (new kitchen cabinets and counters, new laminate flooring for the downstairs) that we could easily use up this 10k on.

What makes the most sense to use this money on? We can easily make up the 10k in a year with our savings every month, which is why I'm leaning toward either using the gift money toward home renovations or attacking my student debt.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my mom's PLUS Loans? First or at all?,"I graduated college with $22,000 of personal federal loans, and my mom took out $26,000 of federal PLUS loans but has no way of paying these back

My personal loans have an interest rate of 5% and the PLUS loans have an interest rate of 7%

When my mom took out her loans, I fully intended to be responsible and was only using it as a way to not have to take out private loans with higher interest rates. 

So, generally I know it's best practice to pay off the high interest rate loans first, but should I be doing that even when it's not in my name? And if I do decide to pay these off first, do I completely ignore the 5% loan, or do I split payments maybe 70/30? 

But one more thing:
My mom's really low income. Already on food stamps herself. I'm not even sure how she was approved for the PLUS loans. But basically she told me that she has no intention of paying them and I shouldn't either because it's not like there's anything they can come after her to take. 

So what's my best option?
1. Pay mom's 26k/7% loan first, then my 22k/5%
2. Pay my 22k/5% loan first, then mom's
3. Pay my loan first, and ignore mom's since there's really nothing that would happen to her if we didn't pay them (or would there?)",finance

My annual is about 42-43 000£ . I currently live with my girlfriend and my part of the rent and bills adds up to about 950-1000 £ monthly.   
I also do own a property outside of the UK which is currently valued at about 55 000£ .

It is also worth mentioning that I have close to no credit history in the UK hence why even with my funds being transferred over here and put on a deposit scheme my bank was reluctant to issue a credit card. 

I'd like to know if it would be reasonable to look in the option of purchasing a place and getting a mortgage with a null credit history or how do I go by increasing my chances of getting a decent interest rate and offer. Also -would using my property outside of the UK as collateral boost my chances?

Any suggestions and tips would be more than welcome as I'm extremely new both to the credit system in the UK and house market in general.",finance

personalfinance,"Fedloan: monthly bills suddenly at $0, strange payment history shown online","Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

Weird things are happening with my husband's student loans.

  
Some background info in case it's needed: My husband has a large student loan with fedloan. We live abroad, so due to different salaries and cost of living here, he's only been paying around $200 a month through IBR. At this point, there's really no other option than to wait for loan forgiveness and continue the monthly payments until then.

&amp;#x200B;

As for what's happening now: For a few months now, he's been receiving bills with $0 listed as the amount due for the month. There's no reason his monthly payment amount should have changed – he's due to reapply for IBR in a few months. So he hasn't been making payments. We recently looked at his online account some more. There, under ""Loan Details"" the large amount due is shown under ""Total Current Balance"" – as it should be. However, his payment history suddenly shows the same amount as ""Amount Paid"" (with the full amounts under ""Principal Paid"" and ""Interest Paid""). So parts of his account make it look like everything has been paid off, other parts show the correct balances. The payment history doesn't show any large payments, though, just the usual monthly ones he paid up until recently.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, we're at a loss and don't know how to go about this. Should we wait for the bills to change to the normal amount again? We don't want to risk the loan forgiveness, but we're also not sure if we should call attention to this by contacting someone. We could also wait for the notification for the IBR reapplication, but aren't even sure he would get that notification with the current status.

More background: Just finished grad school, and taking a new job starting tomorrow. Base annual salary is ~$60k, with a small bonus (and some stock options, which may be worth something someday, but can't rely on those yet). Does have health insurance, and I'm reasonably healthy, but no 401(k) match or other benefits. I have ~$10k in savings, but no retirement accounts or other financial assets. No car or other expensive personal property. I live in a high COL area, but have made a budget and this job is enough to pay the bills given my current living situation, even if not a lot of disposable income left over. I am continuing to search for better paying jobs, but zero guarantee those materialize, so I have to build with what I have.

For debt, I have ~7k in credit card debt (at ~15% APR), and a disgusting amount of student loans. Roughly $40k in private loans, and remainder federal loans under an IBR program. Realistically, unless I get a huge spike in income, I'll never be able to pay off the latter. Now that I'm employed again, though, have been thinking of refinancing the CC debt at a lower rate.

Now, the soon-to-be divorce: My wife makes ~75k/year, has no debt, but does have retirement accounts (worth ~$30k). No pre-nup, at her insistence. She doesn't want to share any assets or take on any debt. Have gone back and forth on whether I should litigate with her, which I can do at a limited cost (I'm a former lawyer so can represent myself reasonably well), but don't know if I can stomach the emotional turmoil of that. My betrayed self wants to fight, but my rational self just wants it over ASAP. No hope, or desire, for reconciliation.

Moving forward, it's all up in the air. Probably staying in our current apt. for another 3 months, then on my own (which will probably require a roommate). Job I have does have room for promotion/growth, and am willing to move if the right opportunity presents. I'm also, again, a licensed lawyer and would like to use that to make side-money to build a safety net and pay down debt, but really don't know how to do that.

I know there are already a billion posts about these, but I have a few questions that I’m hoping to get answered! Hope you don’t mind :)

I currently have all my funds in my checking account through one major bank (Bank of America). In terms of opening a savings account, what should I consider? There are so many factors, from APY/interest rate to fees to withdrawal limits...I’m overwhelmed!

What should I consider non-negotiable factors? I was looking at the American Express since they’re currently offering a 1.8% APY and don’t seem to have any maintenance fees...but a lot of places don’t accept AmEx.

personalfinance,Avalanche vs Snowball for 0% credit cards,"So far I haven't found any posts or articles that address paying off 0% credit cards along with other payments that are accruing interest.

The question becomes what do I pay first. I'm currently using all overtime and extra money toward the private student loan since it would reduce how much interest accrues daily and is my highest monthly expense while paying the minimum on the others or if I should pay off the cards first since the APR will be much higher than the loans at the end of the introductory period.

personalfinance,How should we go about moving from our condo to our first house?,"Hi r/personalfinance, I’m looking for advice about the financially smartest way to move my family from my condo into our first home. Some details:

-I have a wife and infant daughter. We’re dead set on moving out of the condo within the next 12-18mo, because it’s a split level unit with an interior loft/balcony that has widely spaced bannisters and a long, steep staircase - all perfect for a toddler to tumble off and get hurt or worse.

-I co-own the condo with my Dad, and if it sells at the same price as similar units in the complex, my takeaway would be about $30k

-My wife and I have a total of $17k saved for a downpayment, which is currently invested 70/20/10% in a vanguard bond ETF, s&amp;p500 index EFT, and cash settlement fund. We also have an emergency fund, no debts and excellent credit scores

-At our current standard of living, we can comfortably save $1000/mo for a house down payment after bills, daycare fees, retirement savings, etc. Alternately, we haven’t opened a college savings fund for our daughter yet, and I’d love to put the money to this if not needed for the house

-Currently our household income is ~$130k, but In 9 months I will graduate from training and take a new job in town that will increase our household salary to ~$230k. This is reasonably certain to happen; I have an informal offer and should be signing an employment contract within the next 2mo. My wife and I are on the same page about not increasing our standard of living for a while and putting the extra money toward kiddo’s college + house + retirement.

-The amount of house we want to buy in the areas we want to buy (ie great schools) will cost $250k-$300k

We’ve talked about two strategies. One would be to sell the condo, move into a cheap apartment somewhere kinda lousy for a few years (since daughter won’t need to go to school yet), save as much as we can and then buy a house with a bigger down payment. The other would be to buy the house with less favorable mortgage terms now (because we wouldn’t have a 20% downpayment), move in, then sell the condo, apply that money to the mortgage right away and then pay the rest off as fast as possible.

I think the renting idea seems cost-saving in the long run, but recently my wife pointed out that we might end up getting screwed if mortgage interest rates (and/or home values in our area, which are slowly uptrending) spike over the next few years.

My total monthly budget is $485 (student loan included).

This leaves $2,324 remaining. I would like to save $2,100 towards the house down payment. This leaves $224 remaining for savings. I could also put this towards my loan. After reading the wiki &amp; flowchart, I believe I should be putting my last $224 savings into a Roth IRA, but I am unsure due to my current retirement system. Paying off my debt sooner is also possible, but it really doesn't worry me that it is there.

I would like to know if everything is viable/correct up to this point. Also, if this $2,100 should be placed into an ally savings account with 1.85% APY vs my current 0.01%, or should I be investing this money? Could I Have a little guidance?",finance
personalfinance,"Paying off student loans, and keeping Mutual Fund or ETF?","I'm fortunate that my loans were minimized through graduate school and I was (thankfully) given a comfortable college investment account that can fully pay off my unsubsidized loan (6.21%, ~30k). I have a few other smaller loans with much lower interest rates.

The funds are currently held in two mutual funds that have been netting ~6% and ~9% respectively, each with expense ratios of (0.74%).
I have a two part question:
1) Should I pay off my loan in full while I can, or leave some of it to grow in the account, as I should be able to support the payments in the coming years?

personalfinance,Medical bills vs credit card,"Hello all! Was looking for some advice in paying off debt. 

I am 22yo looking to get a hold on my finances. I have 3 credit cards (sears, ashley furniture, and wells fargo). I opened the sears and ashley in order to purchase things that I was “in need” of that I couldn’t pay for all at once (couch and lawn equipment). The wells fargo I did out of my own stupidity as a college student. Anyway all together I owe roughly $1800. I don’t use them at all. I am doing a little more than the minimum payment on each account. 
In addition to these credit card debts I also have substantial medical debt (at least its substantial to me. I have never actually compiled it but its a pretty hefty amount). 
I’d like to achieve debt free living ASAP so my question is whether or not I should pay off the credit cards first, the medical bills first, or just pay off the smaller amounts first. 
My theory/plan is to pay off the CCs first using the snowball method. Then I will start to tackle the medical debt. My theory being that CCs acquire interest and medical doesn’t (I could be wrong). 
Any thoughts, advice, opinions? Everything thanked and appreciated in advance!

Additional question:
What are your opinions/thoughts on using credit cards for rewards? (Of course I would do so knowing that I could pay it off almost immediately)

Edit:
Ok so for credit cards:
Wells Fargo: $825 at 15.90%
Ashley: $470 at 29.99% 
Sears: $460 at 26.99%

personalfinance,In a bad situation with a car finance and wondering what my options are (CAN),"Hi PF,  
So a little over a year ago, I purchased my first car through a notoriously bad finance company based here in Ontario (I didn't do my research and rushed into the decision and now I'm definitely paying for it and regretting it big time).  
  
I have been able to make my car payments no problem and everything has been fine over the past year, however, a good friend of mine just purchased a condo in a big city and wanted me to move in with him. He is charging me an unbelievably cheap price for its location and quality of condo for the city and I just couldn't refuse as it was the perfect opportunity to move out of my parents home and be a short (15-20min) commute to school when I decide to return.  
But, here's my problem, since I'm now living in a big city, there's no need for my car anymore and I'm currently just paying for a car and for the insurance on the car that is just sitting in my parents parking lot. I can't afford to buy out the car as there's still over **$8k on the finance** (bought it for $9k 1 year ago... definitely been getting screwed) and I would really love to save the extra $400/month that's going towards my car payments (**$112 bi-weekly**) and my car insurance (**$178 monthly**) so I can allocate that money into being able to return to school.  
  
I've thought about doing a ""voluntary repossession"" and taking the hit to my credit for now as I have no plans on purchasing another car/home or getting a loan for at least 10 years and trying to rebuild my credit in that time while saving that money so that I can afford to return to school. Is this a possibility or am I being too naive?  
  
I know that it's possible to get someone to take over my finance payments but there's still *5 years left* on the finance with a 21% interest rate for a 2009 vehicle... I really doubt I would be able to find anyone to take it over.
If anyone has any suggestions on what I could possibly do to save that money or if my idea of a voluntary repossession is an okay one, I would love your insight! Thank you

investing,Housing market looking forward: Trend and Cap,"I have for some time thought regarding the rise of the housing prices in the US and also most European countries during last 20-30 years. 

My main concern in that the prices for buying a property is unlikely to exceed a certain cap where people, for example, cannot afford to pay the mortgage during their lifetime. On other hand, this is unlikely to stop the banks from lending. Would you think that there is a cap on how much an average family flat or a house can cost? I feel there could be such limit unlike stocks which more or less can be traded up indefinitely. 

Second part of my thought concerns property value in the years to come. Lending starts to get pricier and the GOV interest rate in the Eurozone could likely follow the US. Do you think this is likely to have an impact of the prices looking several years forward? 
Lastly, a follow-up question for those who invested in housing prior to bull run starting in the 90ies: How did people view house ownership when there was no ""guarantee"" of value rise?",finance

Was thinking of just putting 100% towards down payment fund and be able to get out of renting ASAP (really tired of living with roommates) but then I'd pay more interest on my student loans and would also miss out on stock market gains in my retirement accounts, and would only be earning that measly savings account interest the next two or so years while I saved.",finance

personalfinance,When is the balance I earn interest on calculated?,"So I have a Discover savings account with an APY of 1.80% and an interest rate of 1.78%. I am not sure how often this is compounded as it says daily/monthly on the page I could find. The “Interest paid” transactions show up about on the last day of each month.

I am not sure how exactly I got a 0.94 interest payment for the month of August.

Here are some snapshots of this accounts balance:

7/25/18	       25
7/27/18	       1000
7/31/18 	Interest payment: 0.25 (account balance at 1026 after)

I am very confused on when this interest payment is calculated. Is it a snapshot made at some point in the month or do they look at average balance over the month or have something fancier going on?

Why did I get 95 cents of interest when I only had 2$ in the account?

I may just not understand the math behind all of this period as the math is not working out. Lets say I had 1k in here and it was at the interest rate of 1.78% I would assume that to mean I get 17.8$ monthly adding up to 213.6$ for the year. That is obviously not right as the APY says I should earn  18$ for the full year. What is wrong with my math here?",finance

They loaned her: 502,600 rubles

Minimum monthly payment: 15,151 rubles

It is my understanding that the interest scales from high to low so they can accrue as much interest as possible in case the loan is paid off early. If all minimum payments are made then the average monthly interest rate is 16.90% if that makes sense.

She will continue making the monthly payments until November but will be moving here to the US after that.

personalfinance,Student Loan Question: Government Loan vs Parents,"I'm a very fortunate person. My parents have been able to financially support me until my last two years of medical school. However, I have now used my share of the family's college fund, and I have two options:  
- First, I could take out student loans for the next two years, likely amounting to about $80,000 at ~6%. When I graduate in two years, and for about six years afterward in residency, I expect my salary to be ~$60,000, after which it should increase significantly.  
- Second, I could take a ""loan"" from my family's college fund. I have several younger siblings, so the arrangement my parents have proposed is that they continue taking money out for me, and I will be required to pay an equal amount back into the fund as I am able to (with the understanding that payments may be low until I finish my residency). 
 
I understand that mixing family finances can lead to stressful situations, especially if something were to happen where my parents need more money than I am able to provide. I am considering all this as well, but this post is specifically regarding my own financial security and not any interpersonal relationships.  

The pros of taking my family's ""loan"" (0% interest, flexible payment schedule) seem to outweigh the pros of a federal loan (building credit, possible discharge of part of the loan via PAYE+PSLF). However, I am sure there are other pros/cons I may not be considering. **Given my situation, if everything goes according to plan, will I be better off forgoing a student loan?**

Edit: Thanks for the responses everyone. I'm going to have a conversation with the parents regarding our family's finances, and regarding what would be should something happen to me. If this would not be devastating, I'll likely take the loan from them, and I'll make sure to get expectations in writing to help both sides.",finance

computing,Is my ISP spoofing my DNS?,"For a little preface: I have had this cable provider for a few years and they have a reputation in the area to be one of the best. They offer the fastest speeds for the lowest price, and their customer service has been excellent since I switch to them.

But about 3-4 weeks ago I began having this problem with them. Every 15 minutes (at some times 30) all DNS resolution would halt and I wouldn't be able to say, type in google.com to get to Google, I would instead have to type the IP address to get it to load. This tells me that it was in fact a DNS issue. So naturally I decided to use DNS servers hosted elsewhere because obviously my ISP had been slacking on the whole reliability front. I tried OpenDNS, Cloudflare, Google and all the major free-access DNS servers but the issue persisted. At this point I was getting mildly annoyed that my websites wouldn't load as fast as I wanted, being that I pay for 500Mbps download... I ended up doing a bit of digging and found that whenever I would type in ""google.com"" (or similarly 'nslookup') , my ISP's servers would still filter the request through their DNS! Despite of the fact that I had configured my desktop to use third-party OpenDNS servers.

No matter what server I had used, my ISP tacked their brand name 'shitisp.com' to the end of every domain lookup silently and unnoticed. (for example 'google.com.shitisp.com') Not only did the domain get spoofed but it also got redirected to a privately hosted (or more likely modified) version of the same website. To further my case, I also downloaded a program called DNSCrypt, which encrypts all DNS traffic heading outbound from my computer, and sends it out on port 443 instead of 53. This completely removed the aforementioned issues with resolution errors and downtime (and gave me a fast and redundant local cache too)

​

So following that I have a couple of questions:

​

Is my ISP spoofing my DNS queries?

Is there some alternate explanation to this that I am missing?

Could they be modifying the websites I visit in order to sell ads? or perhaps more devious practices?

​

**TL;DR**

My ISP is possibly spoofing and redirecting traffic from popular websites to possibly modified versions of them.

personalfinance,At what point does it make sense to sell your bad depreciating investment? [Auto],"To rephrase Mitch: I used to be stupid.  I'm still stupid, but I used to be too.  Now though, I am smart enough to ask this community first. 

Beginning of 2017 I was driving a car I bought for $500.  It had lasted 6 months of 2016 and when it broke down, I got $430 for it at the salvage yard.  I considered it a good deal.  I was just starting to get my professional life going again after a hiatus and a divorce, plus everything about my financial situation sucked (credit score was low, salary was low, expenses and debt were higher than ever, etc.), except retirement was ok (on track 401k).   But at the time, I really did need a car because I had just moved further outside the city (to reduce expenses, ironically).  This meant more commute time, and more difficult public transportation options.  

So, I bought a car at a horrible interest rate, at a horrible price.  Here are the numbers for the purchase and where I'm at with it today: 

$3,000 down with Payoff total of $4,700 on the first months loan statement.  So I guess $7,700 is what I paid for it.  It had 110k miles but was in good shape.  Still though, I overpaid.  To add to that I took a 15% interest rate on a 3 year loan from Wells Fargo.  The $175 I pay each month has $50 of it going to interest.  Credit was horrible at the time, and still is although by next year should be worlds better.  Not going to get into more on that but I couldn't get much better tomorrow in the realm of loan terms.  Currently, I have a payoff of $2,400 and the Bluebook is likely to get around $3,400 in a private sale or 2k in a trade-in.  


Now here is the kicker: it's starting to have problems.  I have paid around $1k in the last 5 weeks on 3 different repairs and I have lets say a hunch there is more on the way, certainly for new struts soon.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that my income has more than doubled and I now take home 6k roughly per month as opposed to 2500.  My expenses are mostly the same.  


My question is whether I should sell.  I put it for sale listed at $4100 and 2 people are coming tomorrow to look at it and I don't know what to do.  WWYD and Why?  Please help me as I am really trying to get things on the right track.  Last note, I also have a HD motorcylce thats paid off that I could use for a daily ride till winter (cannot sell this as it holds extreme sentimental value to me and no other replacement bike could be worth as much).  But I still pretty much need a car for my kids whom I get every other weekend  Oh, and I found a deal on housing near work again so I live pretty close compared to last year for the same cost.  1hr vs 20 min drive difference.",finance

personalfinance,[US] [Retirement] My retired dad wants to buy some land for $70K from his Roth. He asked my advice. He meets with the realtor tomorrow. What should I tell him to consider?,"It's a 10 acre forestry plot directly connected to our forestry land. I really want him to buy it, but I think financially it might be a bad idea? So, I told him I thought it was a good idea if he's positive he can spare the money - he says he can. I'm not sure this is true.

What else should I tell him to consider?

**Reasons to buy it**:

- [I made a diagram here of the land](https://imgur.com/a/tBV5GkJ). 

- The last time a plot of forestry went for sale at the other end of our street (2 miles away), a developer scooped it up and put 100 condos. We are very worried the same thing will happen here, and we'll suddenly have 100 new families of neighbors that will walk all through our woods (a big worry because of privacy, liability if they get hurt and sue us, as well as a stray cigarette from a random person burned half the woods down 20 years ago and there is so much drought now), be really loud in the really quiet forest road, add traffic to the road, and when you ice skate, there are houses there.

- Buying this gives him direct access from the forest to the road, so he is free to log. However, most of the trees right now are only worth about $500 - it'd be better to wait 5-10 years when they're all about $1,000. However to that, because of climate change, there are longer and longer periods of drought and the trees are starting to die - in 5-10 years we might have $200K of trees, but we might also have just dead trees.

- Theoretically, it's just moving the money into a land investment, but realistically, he will never sell it, and when I inherit it, I will never sell it. We like trees and dislike development.

- He's planning to take the money out of his Roth IRA. He says his Roth IRA is his emergency fund; it currently has $250K in it. He was saving it to pay for my wedding, house down payment, and adoption fees for my kid (I can't have them), but my boyfriend is taking his damn time and we're 31 and I don't even have a ring on my finger - my dad's given up that any of this will ever happen, so is reallocating the money (sigh).

- The land will be added to our existing forestry land, so taxes won't be that high.

- If he buys this, he will sell a small acre of developable land he has; he thinks this will net him half his money back. Also, if that successfully sells, it will be less taxes per year as developable land is taxed higher, but I don't know the numbers.

- He's 64. My mom just turned 65 and went on medicare last week.

- He is healthy, but my mom's thyroid doesn't work and she has IBS. She also had cancer 20 years ago. So I'm a little worried about her healthcare costs as she ages.

- He has a pension. I don't know his ""income"" - what he's taking out of his investments. *Edit addition* - I would strongly guess that his monthly take home (pension + taking out of investments) is ~$2,350 (after health ins costs, which is ~$1K with a 4K deductible). Next October (2019), when he turns 65, his take home jumps up to $5,450 because of SS and medicare. I think he's pre-emptively paying $3K a quarter for federal and state taxes; he's definitely paying $4,605/year on the existing 28 acres of forestry in taxes.

- He's talking about tapping his social security a year early - he says the amount he loses for this will break even at age 71 (and Social Security's gonna run out in less than 10 years anyway, isn't it? Everyone is talking about medicare in 20 years, but no one talks about social security in 10 years).

- He's insisted that he's run the numbers several times and doesn't need the money until he's 90. I don't know how big his current savings are.

He meets with the realtor tomorrow. We know they turned down an offer of $50k for being far too low, so he's thinking of offering $65K, so we're assuming it'll end up being $70K. What should I tell him to consider before he goes?

CryptoCurrency,Sentinel Chain attempts to Bank the Unbanked,"I was reading recently on the unbanked population in the world and I was shocked to find out that around 2 Billion adults are unbanked worldwide. 

&amp;#x200B;

 To clarify, being unbanked in the 21st century means that you are unable to have credit score or apply for loans or do any other service you expect to do in the modern 21st century world. This means that the old grandma or the farmer living in 3rd world countries are all unaddressed markets. These people depend on microloans which would have to be paid in around a week at 95% interest rate or something ridiculous like that.  

&amp;#x200B;

 Surely I thought, someone is trying to address this market. I was not wrong there. After some research I came through a few projects. I will just be talking about one here as it already has a real world use case agreement with one Government which makes it closer to reality than many other projects.    

&amp;#x200B;

This was when I came across Sentinel Chain and read their recent Medium post explaining the project. Simply stated ""To deliver sustainable win-win scenarios for all our stakeholders by bringing financial inclusion at speed and scale through disruptive technologies""  

&amp;#x200B;

Sentinel Chain addresses the Unbanked by targeting the livestock as collateral for Banking services. The incentivize the unbanked to utilize their current assets which will be labeled and tracked with RFID tags verify ownership and existence of the livestock which is the to be used as collateral. This allows the unbanked to proceed and use banking services (such as Savings, epayments, credit, investments, and insurance).

 A clearer example with the use cases of Sentinel Chain can be seen in their recent Medium Post",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Freaking out and need help. $30,000 student loan, $25,000 credit debt. I have to get out from under this. Income ~$70k, Seattle. Options inside","I can't believe it's come to this. To preface, please refrain from judgement regarding the credit debt. I'm aware at how fucking stupid it is. What matters is that I'm trying to end it and get out, while changing what it is about me that got me here. I've created a budget sheet that summarizes all of my debts, and am exploring options for how to address this. 

Credit: $15,000 between three cards, interest rates vary from 12.75 to 20.99%. 
Personal loan : $10,000 at interest of 9.55%
Student debt: $30,000 at an average interest rate of 5.26; monthly payment of ~$578; payoff in 5 years

Pay: I make $65,000/yr, with occasional work trips that get me extra money when I go out to sea. During these trips, I take the chance to pay down debt. I have practically no life costs during these month long trip. This brings my income to at least $70k/year. Monthly rent and utilities are $900. I live in Seattle, so food costs are high.

Currently, credit rating is between 740-780 (I never know who to use)

Options - The personal loan was my attempt to address the accumulation of my first shit ton of credit debt. It lowered the interest rates overall, but my terrible habits racked up more. That needs to end. 

Step 1 - I just did a balance transfer about approximately $6,000 to my lowest interest credit card (12.74%) and want to pay that down first. 
Step 2 - I'm looking at refinancing my student debt to one lender (SoFi). My thinking is this - if I set it to pay off the debt over a longer period, it will bring down my monthly payment to $200. The extra money goes to the high interest credit. However, it's bad that I'll wind up paying a good chunk more in student debt over the course of my life. 

In summary, my current knowledge of how to tackle this seems to me that I should play some of the balance transfer game with the credit debt, and front load all of my extra money to that. Meanwhile, I'm paying an overall lower monthly cost to my student debt. When I get out from this crippling credit debt, I start pushing everything extra to the student loans. In this way, I can hopefully get everything sorted out in an overall shorter period of time.

Importantly, I'm thinking that the lower student monthly payment will help me change some of my behavior as it relates to debt. Currently, I'm all too often finding myself with too little money between pay periods, so hey, toss it on the card. 

If anyone can give me any wisdom here I'd greatly appreciate it. This is horrible. Thank you very much.

EDIT - First off, thanks everyone. Many people are asking about a budget - part of why I didn't post one is because I know it has been absolutely abysmal. I've been living way beyond my means like an idiot - drinks, eating out, flights to see my now ex-gf, sports equipment, etc. Too much has gone to credit.

 I know I can do it; I was very fiscally responsible when I was supporting myself as an unaccompanied minor from ages 16 to 18. I think the problem started when I got a job that paid lots of cash when I was 18. I only worked there for 10 months because I had to quit to focus on homework when I started university, but my spending habits didn't change fast enough.   I had $5,000 in savings when I started that year of school, but it disappeared quickly when I tried to keep buying lots of shampoo and candles and clothes while I wasn't working. I had no family support either, so I ended up having to do a lot of bad things like using credit card cash advances to pay my rent after my financial aid refund had been blown on food and clothes. In my 4th year of school I finally got my act together and stopped spending money on anything except rent and the bare minimum of car expenses. I ditched my phone plan and got food from the food bank and then food stamps.  Then I got hurt during my final quarter of school so I had to drop out and go back for two final quarters part time. During the summer after I got hurt when I wasn't in school, I really learned some survival skills for living on almost nothing. I found trash like furniture on the street and sold it to make my then-cheap rent every month. I also totally ignored all my other bills. I want to fix that now but I don't have a lot of disposable income to work with.

 **$15,650.92 Student Loan in good standing**. 5 different loans all with interest rates between 3% and 4.6%. Made my first payment of $150 today even though it wasn't due yet. :) 

**$2202.49  Bank of America Credit Card** account is past due and has been closed to Capital Management Services, LP.

I also had an overdrawn checking account with BofA, but it seems to have been closed. Could this hurt me? 

**$555 Target Store Card** account closed and sold to collections. Was originally $300, now with 2 years of interest. I just have the phone number of the collections agency. 

I think the interest rates on both credit cards is around 27%. I don't know how to check without talking to their respective collections agencies. 

**$252 Sprint** phone bill I couldn't pay and opted to not have phone service summer 2017. Transferred to Diversified Consultants in March 2018.

**$283 Verizon** bill I couldn't pay so I switched to Sprint (genius, I know) sometime between 2015 and 2017.  Transferred to Jefferson Capital System in June 2018.

Both of the last 2 are showing up in red on my credit report. I've read here that I should negotiate a pay for delete instead of paying them off, do I just call up the collections agency and ask for a pay for delete? Should I get the agreement in writing before I pay anything? 

BILLS/BUDGET

Our rent and utilities together is $1968 every month for one room with a private bath. That is only a little above market rate in my hometown. We cannot move to a place with lower rent as we were literally unable to qualify for any traditional housing with rental companies or independent landlords, the only place that would take us was this housing co-op. I have been paying $1968 every month for the past 3 months while my fiance recovered from surgery. This amount was actually more than my monthly income which is why I was ignoring all other bills until now. My fiance is doing well and starting a new job this week! So starting with October, I will only have to pay half. 

**Rent + Utilities = $984**

**Student Loan Payments = $165 ish.** I spoke with Nelnet today and they said this is subject to change???

**Food = $0** as long as my fiance's new job doesn't disqualify us for the food stamps we are currently receiving

**Health = $0** as long as I continue to qualify for California's great free health insurance

**Phone = $0** thankfully I have the privilege to have someone who added a line to their phone plan when they realized why they couldn't call me anymore. 

**Car Insurance = $74.28** per month. I will be talking to my partner about splitting this one since I'll be driving both of us to work.

**Gas = $50?** I've been spending about $50 per month on gas lately, but old job and my new job are only 1 mile away. Fiance's job is 10 miles away, so fiance will have to absorb the difference in gas costs.
 
**Car registration = $50 per month** to save $600 per year. I always have some ticket to pay off when my registration is due. I already know I'll have 2 parking tickets to pay when it's due in March but I'll try not to let that happen again. 

**Car Maintenance = $50** per month to save up for when I need it - my car is 10 years old and needs some routine maintenance, but it's not urgent yet. Mechanic said it'd be about $1000 for all of it. I'm going to get a second opinion. 

**Dog Food = $25** per month or so for my half

**Veterinary Care $48** - we've been putting this off because we had no choice. Now that we're both employed, it's time to get our four legged family member the healthcare she needs. She has had a bad cough for over 4 months. We chose a pet insurance plan whose premium is $57.66 per month with 90% reimbursements for everything. It has a $100 deductible and no maximum. If we have a $600 vet visit every 2 months (seems likely), our out of pocket would be $30 per month, not including premium and deductible.
 
Premium = $691.92 per year

Deductible = $100 per year

Out of Pocket = $360 per year 

Total Veterinary Costs = $1151.92 per year so my half would be $575.96 

My monthly veterinary costs = $48 per month

We haven't actually bought this plan yet, but it seems like the best deal. I had to spend $500 out of pocket when our poor girl got an ear infection earlier this year and we didn't have insurance for her. I think all this will have to be in fiance's name with me reimbursing him, because neither of us can afford the out of pocket costs before reimbursement and with my credit history, I can't qualify for an unsecured credit card. And I don't think I can afford to secure a credit card for the amount that our vet bills will be before reimbursement (at least $600). I'd really appreciate any input or advice on financing this. One thing we will NOT consider is rehoming our dog. She is a member of our family. 

**MONTHLY BILLS TOTAL = $1,396.28**

INCOME: 
I just got a new job that pays $16.68 per hour (I was making $16.00 before) but has a weekly maximum of 19.5 hours (I was working 25 hours before). It will be a slight pay cut overall but I took it because at my past job I literally wanted to kill myself, and at the new job I'll be happier plus it will connect me with more independent contracting opportunities. 

**Monthly Paycheck from new job = $1398.62** before taxes assuming I max out my hours every week, which I think I can. I will be a government employee so I think I'll pay less tax than I did before (at my last job I paid 25% tax every paycheck) but I'm not sure by how much. 

Longterm Independent Contracting - I have a steady client who pays me $60 per week for 2 hours. I'm hoping I can start to pick up more of these soon but it will be variable. For now I can only count on that **$258 per month**.

Temporary Independent Contracting - I have a temporary gig for the next 2 months that pays $20 per hour. In the past week I have worked 8.5 hours. I expect the hours per week to slowly increase up to maybe 25 hours per week over the next 2 months after which it will end. Conservatively I will estimate I'll work an average of 8 hours per week for September and 20 hours per week for October for a total of $2408 over the next two months. **Since this is temporary work that cannot continue after two months, I'd like to not include the income in my monthly budget, and apply all of this income to debts.** I'm not sure which debts to apply it to though! I could pay off my BofA credit card in full with it, or I could pay off my Target card in full and part of BofA. Or should I use some of it for my student loans? 

**RELIABLE MONTHLY INCOME = $1656 before taxes**

Should I assume my take home will be 75% of that, $1242? That's $154 less than my monthly bills, but that's not as bad of a hole as I was in when I was paying double rent. 

I'd really appreciate any advice on how to start improving my credit so we can buy a house and have kids as soon as we can. I know that's definitely at least a couple years and a better job (one with real benefits) away, but I want to start now. I need to figure out how to do the pay for delete thing for the cell phone bills in collections. As for the credit cards in collections, should I start making monthly payments, or should I wait until I've saved up enough to pay in full? Can I do a pay for delete on those too? 

Any tips on how to finance veterinary care so it improves my credit would be great too. I've looked into carecredit and I don't think it will work for us as that seems to be for a big proceedure, not just a few hundred bucks every couple months. Should I bite the bullet and get the secured credit card that CreditKarma is recommending to me? I think we'd need like a $1000 limit and I can't just throw that money into the ether right now even if I can get it back at some point.

personalfinance,"Wary/weary of renting and have a plan, but am I house-ready?","I just got notice from my apartment complex management that my rent will be going up about 15% if I re-sign with them.  Granted - and those from HCOL areas prepare to guffaw - paying $891/month isn't crazy for a spacious 1BR but is in indicative that prices are going up in my neighborhood and it's making me wonder if now is a good time to start the ball rolling on buying a place of my own.

Deets:

* Single income, 36 yo
* Location: PHX, AZ
* $67k/yr, or about $5500/mo gross
* 20% goes to 401(k)
* Small Roth IRA
* $10k emergency savings
* no other debt (besides credit cards which are paid monthly)
* Don't know credit score but it should be spotless for at least 7 years back
* Foreclosure on my record from 2007 (yes the great recession was partially my fault sorry guys)

Plan:

* Re-sign apartment lease for 18-month term
* Save $1400/mo in that time to accumulate $25k for down payment/expenses
* Maintain 20% 401(k) contribution but
* Suspend IRA contributions
* Luckily I have a job where it's pretty easy to pick up extra shifts
* Research the market and real estate in general, find a good agent

I'd like to be able to afford a small, older single family home but in my price range most of those are going to be in so-so shape.  I'm mainly interested in SE PHX (Camelback/Arcadia), Tempe, and S. Scottsdale, and it looks like a townhome or condo may be a better option for that area.  I think $250k is the upper limit of what I'm willing to buy.  Of course, it's hard to say what housing prices and interest rates are going to look like in 20 months, but got to start sometime...right?

I want to do this correctly.  Thirteen years ago with a lot less sense and less income I bought a townhome and it ended up a nightmare and financial blight on my life for a few years after.  I'd love to have a fixed housing cost and eventually live in a place that's completely paid off.  I know if I buckle down I can make this happen, but I'm interested in what this sub has to say.

personalfinance,In serious debt for a long time and need some advice paying it off,"Hi Everyone, first post here.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26years old and have been very bad with money for as long as I can remember, never saved a dime and would always spend whatever I had from a very young age. I would really find ways to spend money if I had excess, buying things I didn't need. Well it all was fine, until I got myself a $30,000 credit line and a $5,000 credit card.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I needed around 5,000$ 3 years ago to pay for my school fees as I could not get any OSAP (student load) and went to the bank. I had a good paid internship at that time and the bank offered me a credit line for 30k and also asked to take a 5k credit card. Being stupid as I was, I happily accepted it thinking I would have things in control. The paid internship was of no use, like I said, I had a problem of spending money on whatever shit I could get my hands on. Be it some fancy technology, or clothes or eating out everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, both my credit line and card have maxed out. My pending student loan is $6,000. 

So my debt right now is a total of 30+5+6 = $41,000.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been the case since the last year, and I'm still going pay cheque to pay cheque and just don't know how to pay it off. I'm ready to do all it takes to be debt free as soon as possible so I can start finally for the first time in my life start saving money.

&amp;#x200B;

# Income

I'm making 65,000k a year, in Canada, and so my bi-weekly paycheque is **$1,850** (net pay after deducting taxes and everything).

&amp;#x200B;

# Expenses

\-&gt; Rent = $650 (living with my parents right now but need to contribute towards rent and grocery as they've retired)

\-&gt;Car lease + insurance (320+250) = $570

\-&gt;GYM + Phone = $100

\-&gt; Misc = $200 (just putting number here for the coffee or weekend dinner or something. It usually was over 600-700$, never tracked it)

\-&gt; Payment towards student loan = $200

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing is that I am paying from my checking account over **$350** every month for the interest associated with the credit line! It hurts me really that I have been paying that over 1.5-2 years now. I think the interest rate started at 7% and is now at 11%.

&amp;#x200B;

So expenses = $1,720 plus the credit line interest is $2100. I know misc charges $200 is very very less and usually it is more so lets round it up to **$2,500 per month**.

&amp;#x200B;

So really $**3,600** (monthly net income) - $**2,500** (total monthly expense), I can save a **thousand** dollars a month. By that math, if I am super consistent with everything, don't take any vacations and stuff,  it will take me 41 months to pay all this off? I'd probably be 30 then, and then I would start saving money for marriage and other things? 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know where to begin from. Feeling like shit. Can anyone advice on how to go about tackling this, and how to be debt free in the fastest way possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I have never tracked my expenses or cash flow before, don't know where to even begin from. At times I don't even open my bank account for weeks dreading to see the numbers. I really wanted to have 30-40k in savings when I hit 30 and here I'm going through the opposite. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

\- How do I list my income when applying? I'm nervous about misleading the loan companies on accident. This year I will probably make $36k across my internships from Jan 2018 to Dec 2018 so I put $30k. Also, I have a job offer for $110k for when I graduate, so should I put that instead?

\- I got approved for a 10% interest rate loan through discover, how bad is this? This seems absolutely terrible given compounding interest, but can i get better?

\- Is it going to hurt my credit score to apply for multiple loans from different companies? Im scared to now that I've applied to discover.

\- It says the payment will be $50 a month for 15 years. Am I allowed to pay this faster given my income will be relatively high. Do i pay the preset value with 10% interest? or 10% interest on the time it takes me to pay it?

\- Are there any loan companies that I should look at / should avoid?

personalfinance,"Refinance Student Loans, pay down with legal settlement, keep IBRP?","Hi,

I received confirmation that I will be receiving around 27K from a class action lawsuit around January 2019. I'm in my mid twenties and this is the first time I'll be getting a cash sum of this amount at one time. I believe this amount is before taxes and this settlement is classified as recovered income. I'm expecting a bonus of around 10K from my employer give or take that will pay out around February - it honestly could be more but I'd rather be conservative so I'm for all intents and purposes I use 8K as a baseline. I make 90k base salary.

I currently have a $30,964.07 outstanding balance on my student loans at 4.875% fixed (all consolidated into one loan). I am on an income based repayment plan that is going to be recertified in May 2019; my current monthly payment is ~$426/month. My credit score is around 700-720

I live in NYC my with SO and my fixed expenses (including phone, rent, internet, utilities, employer match to my 401k, and monthly student loan payment) are just under $2000/month. I take home around $3900/month. I'm trying to get my savings back up since I had a family emergency/funeral recently and only have $3000 in savings - would like to get back to 10K and that would probably take at least 6 months.

I understand refinancing with a private lender forces me to relinquish some important protections; however, I feel with my current income and job security it would be worth the lower interest rate.

I was wondering if I should:

A. Pay down my loans completely with my bonus and cash settlement in January 

B. Refinance with a private lender like Sofi to see if I could get around 4% fixed now and then repay  everything at once

C. Pay down like 20K and then finally get my cash savings back to 10K and put it in a high interest rate savings account like capital one or CIT at like 1.6% or more and then just put excess in passive index funds --- investing directly in stocks is too much of a hassle with my current profession. I would also then try to refinance now to get a lower rate.

D. Something else I'm not thinking of?

I bought it  brand new. However due to inflation  I could no longer afford a brand new prius so 6 months ago I bought a used 2017 prius  with 30k on it for 21k (overpriced) even though later I discovered  the used car was actually  17k. My current payment is  330 for 8 years at an  8% interest rate (I've been paying 400).

However due to the accumulation of other debt ( student loans($200), credit card ($200), labtop(30)) I spend way too much a month on debt. All my other debt is manageable  until I got this massive car payment that I didnt realize I couldnt afford until my SO and I split.

Yes I intend on getting a roomate, but even before my SO and I split I was living just to pay bills,  so just having a roomate puts me at break even point. I am at the point now where I would rather take the credit score hit and  walk away than make the payments.

I can't help but think that over the next 3 decades america's taxes will raise considerably and we are heading towards a more socialist democracy like Canada and many EU nations have adopted.  All of whose citizens pay considerably more income taxes.

The masses are not just using it in their day to day affairs/ transactions. Its usage generally falls in the hands of Miners, traders, investors, speculators and digital criminals. For the whole masses to be involved in the crypto space, BITCOIN has to also touch the remainder lives of those who are not technically inclined neither are they online traders or even online savvy, but those who need to have a medium of exchange irrespective of their government for instant and quick payment of whatever goods and services they want in real time on whatever platform, whether offline or online. For BITCOIN to be widely used by all and sundry, real life testimonies have to be recorded , testimonies that change the average life of a layman on the streets.

This is the easiest way to spread the power of BITCOIN as a medium of exchange because immediately the common man who has no access or experience in getting grants from their banks or government who frequently fail them hear that ELITE FISH FARM was established through the benevolence of the BITCOIN community they will be more eager to join the community and spread word about it on every corner of the world hence true adoption of BITCOIN starts. So I implore you to scan my QR CODE and make BITCOIN contributions to make this project work.

**GUARANTEE:**

The pictures above are proof that work has already begun on the Elite Fish Farm project. ELITE FISH FARM is the first of its kind to garner grant help / support from the BITCOIN community to get funds for the growth and development of the farm. We intend to be the largest breeders of catfish in Africa with the whole continent as our target area for a start. There is no law against agro production by private personnel in Africa at the moment. As of present Mr Solomon Chuks and myself Mr Victor Madu are the Administrator and Chief Executive Officer respectively of ELITE FISH FARM. Thank you all for your heartfelt contributions towards this amazing project.

CryptoCurrency,Interview with Promether Founder Eijah About the AACS/Bluray Hack,"[https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/16/](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/16/)

 

Check out this very interesting interview with Promether Founder Eijah about the AACS/Bluray hack. This is the first time he has ever told this story to the public! You can listen to the podcast here:

In 2007, a hacker named Eijah got fed up with the way DRM prevented him from being able to play the content he paid for. He decided to fight back against the AACS and find a way to circumvent the DRM. By the time Eijah was done, his life wasn’t the same.

personalfinance,"Planning to cash out 401k after international move, want to understand tax implications","TL;DR I've just moved from US to Canada for a job and intend to stay.  I have ~80k in a 401k from 6 years of contributing and company match.  The last few years have raked me over the coals financially, and while things are looking up I want to kill all my US based short term debt and start fresh.  I'm not looking for folks to tell me my decision isn't financially optimal (I know it isn't), I just want to know how the taxation will work.

I just got my dream job up in Canada, and I've moved up there from the US with my wife.  This is the best thing that's happened to us financially in a good long time.  Between a complete lack of career advancement in my old job and my wife having trouble finding work in her field, student loans were starting to creep up on us.  Additionally, a totalled car, an extended hospital stay, and having to leave a prior job blew through our emergency fund and then some.  We weathered the storm so far, but the expenses of making a 2000 mile move are proving to be the straw breaking the camel's back.

I have around $80,000 in a 401k from my former job.  I want to draw from it to pay off around $10k of moving expenses, another $12k of credit card debt, $6k off a car loan, and use the rest to build back up our emergency fund and keep things afloat while my wife looks for a job.  These are all debts that we were managing and making payments on, the move just threw it all out of whack.

Now, at this point you may be firing up your keyboards to tell me I'm making a huge mistake, that I should roll it over to a Canadian retirement account, that I'm robbing my future self, that I'm losing so much in taxes and penalties.  I'm painfully aware that I am.  But I have spent way too many sleepless nights doing math in my head and worrying if I'll be able to put food on the table.  For the past two years I've been putting myself through financial contortions not to get to this point.  The level of stress I've been under has noticeably affected my health.  At this point, the conclusion I've come to is that all the taxes in the world are a price I'm willing to pay to be done with that chapter of my life and get rid of all that stress.

So, my question for you, r/personalfinance, is what should I expect to pay in taxes?  All the income would fall in the 25% federal bracket in the US, and I know I'll have to pay the 10% penalty.  Will I have to pay state taxes for my former residence (Missouri)?  Will Canada charge me any additional tax (I'm in British Columbia)?",finance
personalfinance,How to get on the right track to buying a house?,"I'm not exactly sure where to begin with this, but here goes. 

I would like to become a homeowner at some point in the future. My partner and I have discussed this and the idea is appealing to him but he has essentially given up hope because he's in massive debt from student loans. So he would never get approved for a loan, either by himself or with me. I have practically no credit history, aside from a car payment which I started this year. Our combined income is just over $100,000.

So my questions would be: how would we go about getting a loan? How do we set up to start paying off his student loan debt? What kind of credit scores would we need to secure a decent interest rate? And, how much would be recommended to save up before we bought a house?",finance
Economics,Fed's Bullard makes case again for halting interest rate rises,,finance
personalfinance,Student financial aid cancelled in final year,"My fiance just started his final year of his undergrad, BS in engineering. He's got a well paying job lined up for after graduation, but minimal source of income during the last school year, mostly Uber. I've got a well paying job in accounting. We live together and have decided that during the last school year I will handle the majority of our expenses. We laid out a budget - it will be tight, but doable without dipping into savings.

We just found out that he no longer qualifies for financial aid due to the number of credits he's taken already. Poor timing, because his mom, who had previously been paying for his school and saying she would pay his tuition until he graduates, has decided that she will not assist in his final year. Like, it's fine, she has a right to do that, it's just bad timing because now he's so far along in school that he cant get federal financial aid. 

He has a payment of $1900 due in a week, and were expecting books plus tuition to be a little less than $4000 next January. 

My question is what is the best strategy for paying his school fees? We can pay out of pocket, but that plus our wedding costs (which will be between $6-7k) will leave us pretty thin on savings for the next year. We can take out a private loan for about $4-6k and lean on the fact we will be a DINK household after graduation/wedding and hopefully pay off quickly. Or maybe there's another option we're not aware of?

We're in a good position. These are fine problems to have, nothing dire. Just looking for advice on the best way to approach the next year in terms of financial planning. Thank you! :)",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my car to help with saving/managing other debt?,"I couldn't find anything helpful on this subreddit that's at least similar to my scenario. I bought/financed a car in 2015 for 23k. Monthly payments are $382 and I still owe a little more than 8K. I still have roughly 20 more monthly payments at the current rate. I would like to cut this down to assist with paying off credit card debt (roughly 4k), as well as build up my savings account (non existent). I have health insurance but I still have medical bills that are starting to pile up. Would this be advisable? I currently rent with 3 other people but I would like to put some of this towards saving for my own place as well. 

**EDIT: Forgot to mention interest rate. Currently at 4.1%. Just trying to lower monthly payments.",finance
personalfinance,[question][advice]. I am selling my home to purchase a more expensive home. Where would the equity from the sale of my home be most valuable?,"After all fees aside, it seems that I will have $85k in equity from the sale of my current home.  To avoid PMI I will need to put down about $73k in my new home.   I plan on doing just that,  however.   I have a small personal loan with an 8% interest rate at about $3k that I would love to see disappear.   Currently, I am aggressively paying this off,  but it won’t be completely paid off by the time I need to close on the new home.   I would love to have that extra cash flow every month rather than a payment ($200).   Speaking long term though,  would it be advisable to use some of the equity from the sale of my home to erase this debt? Or would it just cost me more from it being rolled into a 30 year term as opposed to being paid off in a year.  

*** interest math is not a strong suit for me***  I’m a self motivated learner, so if anyone can provide a digestible resource to teach me how to figure out something like this, it would be greatly and equally appreciated to an answer.

Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,I got a second job and don't know how to use the money,"So I'm going to be getting a second job that will make me around 800 a month, I want to save that and just use the money from my primary job, I have a savings accounts with a .05% interest rate and was wondering if I should just keep it in a savings account or if there's something I can invest in and keep investing in that will have a better return than my savings account. Any feedback is appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Any US-based Canadians have experience with paying back public Ontario loans?,"My husband is a Canadian citizen/US permanent resident. The interest rate on his Ontario-based public student loan is variable (sitting at 6.2% with $16,600 USD balance). In order to make payments we have to maintain at least one TD Canadian chequing account that also charges a fee if we don’t keep the daily balance at about $2,000 USD which is not happening.

I feel like it would save us money to deal with conversion fees every time we had to make the payments, or better yet, refinance the loan in the US (is that even possible? with the exchange rate that might not be better, but I do have excellent credit and could probably get us a better interest rate). 

Any ideas? I was thinking about heading into a TD branch to figure out a better solution for paying the loans through our US account, but that doesn’t help us with the interest rate. Maybe he could sign up with a Canadian credit Union and use his parents’ permanent address to at least save money on fees? 

This cross-border finance makes my head spin, all advice is appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,"Just starting out, wondering what the best next steps would be.","So like I said in my title, I am just starting off into post college adulthood. I see a lot of people like me posting here and getting great advice so I wanted to test the waters.

For some background: I’m 23, just started working in the software industry as a sales consultant/account manager. Currently making around 45k/yr before commission. Depending on my own performance I can make an additional 750 - 1200 monthly before taxes in commission. I just reached my first 1000 saved, and it’s only been 2 months.

Expenses wise, rent is 490, utilities and insurance are ~300, and car payment is 220 (best I could do on a Harvey relief vehicle). I spend roughly 350 monthly on food and 275 on gas due to a 46 mile commute. 

As far as debt goes I do not have much besides my car payment. I have about 5k in student loans and owe 5k on my car still. 

My question for you guys is what are my next steps? At what point should I look into investing, how much should I save, what would be the best way to minimize my taxes on those savings. I’m currently engaged and will be getting married sometime in the next two years as well. Would it be smart to try and find a small place to buy to build equity instead of dumping into rent? 

I don’t have many financially stable role models so any advice you can offer would be appreciated. Also open to posting more info if needed.

Edit: here is some more information that was requested and forgot to include initially:

My employer offers a 401k and HSA but doesn’t match .

My health insurance is 186 a month, and I pay through my father. 

My car loan has a 6% interest rate and my school loans are still interest free until December, at which time I am not sure what they go to.",finance
personalfinance,FHA Streamline Refinance is Credit Score is up 150 points?,"So my CS has raised almost 150 points to 740 now. When we originally got the loan for our house (We've made around 5-6 payments on it) our CS wasn't as good. Interest rate isn't BAD but we didn't get the ""best"" FHA interest rate.

Is it worth it to refinance? Maybe with a different company? (The current one's internet payment system is down half the time).

Is it worth it to do this?",finance
personalfinance,No Federal Aid. No Access to College Fund. One more year left. Should I take out a loan?,"For a little background, I am accounting major in my senior year with an internship lined up that will be well paying, and will most likely lead to a job offer afterwards. I've got 3 more months till the internship starts and it seems like my finances are not going to last me that long. Bank accounts are getting overdrawn, I am struggling to come up with even gas money and have expended nearly all of my savings.

I've applied for federal aid but am granted absolutely nothing given that my parents have a multi-million dollar savings account and plenty of assets to go along with it, with me listed as a legal dependent. However, my parents are separated, live separately and have only given me money when I come to them *absolutely needing it* (""Hey, my bank account is negative and I need gas to drive to campus today"" type stuff). Recently I've had to quit my job, need to do well in my classes which are becoming extremely difficult and time-consuming. My savings are entirely burned at this point, had to spend around $500 on books and my phone just got stolen so I have to buy a new one too.

My parents have mentioned that there is a college fund set aside for me, which initially had +/- $130k in it when I started school. It has to be in my name. I go to a public University and have only lived on my own for two years now, I'd be surprised if I have even used half of that. However, I don't have access to this account on any level, I don't know any login information, banking information, etc. It has all been kept secret, and until now I have managed my own finances and haven't had too much of an issue.

The main issue/question I have: since my bank accounts are getting overdrawn regularly now, is a student loan a bad idea? Credit score is around 700, could probably qualify pretty easily. Or, is there a way that I could gain access to my college fund account? I know for a fact it is in my name, I just don't have access to it. The stress of having $0 in my bank account is affecting me mentally to where I am stressing out more in a given day than being productive. My parents have put me in a powerless position and I need a way to be financially secure for the next 3 months before I start my internship.",finance
personalfinance,"My student loans are strangling me and my family, what are my options?","I need sound advice on what to do about my student loans. I have procrastinated about this for about 3 years, trying to keep my head above water, because I don’t trust Navient or SallieMae to honestly help me without screwing me. I know there are other payment plans that maybe I should consider, even though the standard plan that I am currently on is the least expensive overall. But I’m also wondering if there are other options I am not aware of. Options that the loan servicer might not tell me about. I’ve been complacent out of fear of making things worse. I don’t want to end up with an even higher student loans bill in a few years in exchange for a short-term reduction.

My wife and I are in our forties. I finished an online bachelors degree in 2014. I had a previous associates degree from 1996 that has been paid off. I am employed full-time currently making \~50k/yr. I am working in my field of study as a front-end web developer. I have a dream job working from home for a wonderful, small web development company. I’m considering looking for more pay at another job, but it will come with a huge quality of life cost.

Since I took a pay cut 3 years ago, when I was terminated from a management position at my previous employer, we have had to use funds from our saving account routinely, which has drained it from \~$30k to $6k. We also have \~$22k in on 4 credit cards. Our mortgage is $1500/month. We bought our home in 2010 when the market was low and interest rate is 5.25%.

My wife works full-time (\~45k/yr) and we have a elementary school-age child in public school.

We have 2012 and 2013 Camrys. Both were bought used at 2-yrs old. The 2012 is paid off. The payment on the 2013 is $250.

The only thing we spend too much money on is eating out. We are working on that. We don’t eat expensive meals, just too frequently. We cook at home a lot, but not enough.

Loan breakdown:- Navient, mix of Stafford/Direct, Federal/DOE Loans (15): $46k- SallieMae, private loans: $10k

Early on when I totaled these up it was \~90k. So it is nice to see I have made good progress, but my total loan payments are $1130/month which is 20% of our net monthly income. In this situation we are unable to pay down the credit cards or save for normal things like vacations, special expenses for our kid, home repairs/improvements, etc.

**Update 1**: Thanks for all the feedback and questions. I'll add the full details later tonight.

**Update 2**: Full details...

I had this in a spreadsheet but I checked it against my bank's online tool and tried updated it to make it a little more accurate. The bank-provided averages may incorporate some erroneous categorization but I went through and fixed any significant errors I could find.

Biggest surprise, our net income is higher than I thought. Because I'm paid hourly and get a check every week, my income fluctuates a little. Because of this I had been trying use a conservative amount for my pay \[x 4 checks per month\] (knowing that I usually make more and sometimes there are five checks). My wife gets paid twice a month in a consistent amount. I was using $5600 but I can't believe we are actually avg. $6700/month. I honestly feel like such shit right now for being in this situation with that much income.

Logistically, we have had a very difficult time sticking to a budget. Between the tedium of logging/categorizing spending - we tried using Every Dollar for a few months - and having it get blown up by unexpected expenses, we just can't seem to do it.

personalfinance,"Hello, Personal Finance, do I need to file a bankruptcy because of 2 maxed out credit cards?","I live in Los Angeles,  California 

I owe  $30k on Amex, $15K on Discover and $6.5K on Capital One MC.
Also I just got a secured Mastercard from my bank with zero balance because I'm playing on declaring bankruptcy chapter 7.

Beside that I have $3.2K student loan with a  $90 monthly payment and a car loan with a balance of $6K.

I rent for $1K a month and use the car to drive for uber with $3K a month income. 
I also do occasional house repairs for extra cash, but that's random inconsistent income, which distracts me from uber, giving a zero net, considering loss of uber time.
I took my car to Carmax and they evaluated it in $8K.
Also I have an old van with some tools, which i use for occasional handyman jobs.

Interest rates on CCs is from 22% to 29%, no missing payments for 15 years.
My FICO is 723 -724, but I can't get any balance transfer cards because of my current revolving accounts are 95% maxed out.

I have a hard time paying the interest and have only $1k on my checking account. 

I am 50 y.o. and don't plan on buying any homes, because it's  super expensive here in Los Angeles. 

I thought of declaring  a chapter 7, it would dunk my FICO a little bit for 10 years, considering there is no other negative points, then I thought, WHAT IF I JUST STOP PAYING  and default on Amrx and Discover and ignore the collection mails?

I unders6that my FICO would go down for 7 years and I have a chance of being sued by those cc companies. 

Considering that I don't own any  property. I think I am judgement  proof.

personalfinance,What to pay first - Loans or Retirement?,"I've lurked here for a long time and something has bugged me for a while. In a lot of these threads where people ask how to invest or what to pay off first, many people suggest student loans/debt.  I'm probably missing something easy here so I'm more or less just curious. 
  
Wouldn't it make far more sense to invest that money into your retirement accounts first? Even if the interest rate is 7% on the student loan and you can only reasonably expect 5-6% return on a safe retirement investment... doesn't the length of the investment make the retirement account the better play while making minimum payments on the student loan to pay it off in the typical 10 year term?  
  
i.e. 7% for 10 years vs 4-5% for 30+ years... doesn't the latter make more sense?  
  
EDIT: This has bugged me because I'm 26 with quite a few student loans in the 6-7% range that I'm not paying off in favor of investing heavily in my retirement accounts so I'm genuinely curious if I'm making a bad move.",finance
personalfinance,Way over my head.,"So you guys probably hear some type of story constantly. But alas. I'm there and could use some insight.

Skip this paragraph if the story is irrelevant to you and just want the cold hard facts and numbers.  I used to be homeless. Had nothing. Slowly worked myself up to where I am now, me and my fiance make a little under 100k a year now. On the climb up, making about 30k a year, single  and trying to make it work, Ibought myself a little first brand new car. Cheapest I could find, but with a high interest rate because I was such a risk. Just needed something that would stop breaking down and nickle and diming me to death, and would last forever. Lost my job and went deliquent for months while hiding my car and beating off repo guys in my garage. Then it happened. Within a year I had a condo, a new job, a relationship, and starting  the 100k trajectory. I'd never had anything before. So I wanted everything. And I got it . 

Or so I thought. Now I have 2 car loans just for me, at ridiculous rates, both upside down. 80% usage on my credit cards, hovering a 625 credit score, and just always living down to the last time of my money. 

I don't know what to do. I want to buy a house. I want to save. I want to do all these things but my dumb decisions have handicapped me into paycheck to paycheck living.

personalfinance,My fiance and I are trying to get to debt free* and save enough to purchase a home. I have some questions about good approaches to this.,"As I stated in the title, my fiance and I have credit card debt we are wanting to pay down.  We are both 25 and have been in the work force for about 2 years now.  We have made some mistakes that were pretty bad for our shorter term goals but are stuck with that now.  

My CC debt - $2600 @ 0% until June (promotional rate for credit transfers), $1900 @24.74%
Her CC debt - $8400 across several cards, unsure of interest rates

I am trying to pay around $1500 a month to mine, and she is paying around $900 to hers.  We are not living poor to do this but we are being fairly responsible with our money now.

So my plan for now is to keep paying off mine, pay off the $1900 first while paying the minimum on the other card.  Then, in 4 months after I am paid off (4 months is counting for the holiday season coming up), I was planning on saving up two months, and then putting everything I can towards hers.

I realize there are a couple options that we have and even though it will cost more money, I feel like it is going to be good to get mine paid off instead of me paying on both together, so that I can get my credit score up faster for a better mortgage rate.  I am pretty much just guessing though and am not even sure that it will change my credit score very much since my credit utilization is around 23% and I have no derogatory marks.

In summary, we want to buy a house, to do that we need a down payment, to get a down payment we need to pay off credit cards.  How would you handle this?

personalfinance,Inheritance and Student Loan/CC Debt Repayment Question,"Hello Personal Finance Community,

Am a lurker with some quick questions about repaying my student loans/CC debt. I read the wiki on windfalls but wanted to clarify a question on Avalanche vs Snowball payment methodology.

I have received about 100K in inheritance from my grandmothers estate when she passed. I have student loan balance of $18,035.03, spread out between 6 loans. I currently pay $320.00/month. . Interest rates vary from 5.7 to 6.55.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have credit card debt of 7k, at about 10% interest, which I pay about $200-500 month (extra to principle) depending on how well I did the previous month. (Sales professional)

When I get the windfall, I was planning on just paying off the remainder of the principals. Is this the best idea? Or would an aggressive payment plan following Avalanche or Snowball work better for my credit/etc.

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Question about reducing credit card debt.,"I know this is a far shot but I had some people recently tell me to call my credit card companies and try to negotiate down either my total balance or my interest rate/monthly payment. They said to let them know I was considering bankruptcy and that my funds had been tight due to a lost job and different employment. I have never missed a payment on anything, my cards are at about 95% capacity totaling about 10k worth of debt. 

Again, I know this must sound silly but figured I would ask if anyone had ever heard of anything like this or if they still did it.

personalfinance,Loan Advice - large loan w/high interest rate vs small loans small rate,"My wife and I currently have 3 loans from school and it's our only debt. We each have about $5000 left on government student loans with an interest rate in the neighborhood of 4% each. I also have another student loan (private) with about $17,000 left, but with a 14% rate. The minimum monthly payments for the two small loans total to about $200, but the large loan's monthly minimum is about $420 (fluctuates a bit monthly, but it's usually around $420). 

We are in a rental home paying $800 (property is cheap where we live) and we're comfortable, but we're considering purchasing a home, and we'd like to be able to do it sooner than later. 

My question is whether we should a) pay off some or all of our student loans first, or b) try for a mortgage as-is. We just redid our budget and we have an extra $500 monthly that we plan to contribute to the loans (or to a mortgage) and an additional $500 we plan to put in savings each month (currently $5000 in savings). 

If you advise paying off some or all of the loans first, which one(s) should we do? My instinct is to focus on the small ones and be done with it, but the big loan's interest rate is awful, and I'll be paying more money the longer I let that simmer. 

What do you all think? Thanks in advance.",finance
cardano,"Cardano: Project Shelley Update, Aug 2018","This is a summary of the content presented by IOHK’s project manager, Liz Bancroft-Turner in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GVwDqIwthk

The goal of project “Shelley” is to make Cardano decentralized. Three main workstreams:

Incentives — encourage stakeholders to follow the protocol.
Delegation — allow users to delegate their right to create blocks to a 3rd party.

Networking — enable infrastructure to support decentralization.
The project is divided into three main stages:

#Research

Done. Two research papers are published:

Incentives: https://iohk.io/research/papers/#VFIE24Y3
Delegation: https://iohk.io/research/papers/#PJG2H7TQ

#Design

Delegation specification is almost finished. One of the latest changes in the system is the gradual shift from the federation to a decentralized state. IOHK has to make sure that a sufficient amount of blocks gets produced in a decentralized mode so that the security of the system is not compromised. The core cluster will gradually “open up” more, so more slots can be won by independent nodes/pools and monitor the overall performance. If the number of created blocks is sufficient — more slots will be open in the next epoch; on the other hand, if there’re too many missed blocks — the number of available slots will stay the same or even go down for the next epoch.

The technical implementation plan is expected to be finished in a week or so, this will allow to create specific tasks for developers to work on.

Delta-Q measurements. In July design assumptions for ΔQ were validated by running a series of global network experiments between AWS data-centers across the globe. Experiment results had shown that selected system design supports high performance at world scale.

More info about the ΔQ research:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UY51U2ur3g
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DF1v-hoAs0
Testnet is still in design, but progress has been made. Currently, the main focus is on the deployment plan of how Shelley testnet should take over the Byron testnet.

Devops are working on designing concrete deployment solutions (scripts) for pools’ infrastructure. They need to work closely with the network architecture team to see the concrete use-cases more clearly. Most of the progress of this workstream is expected toward the end of this month.


#Implementation

Peer discovery system is finished.

Most important tasks of delegation/incentives development are awaiting on specs implementation plans to be finished.

personalfinance,"Having trouble getting off the ground after college. Feels like I'm stuck. Know what I want to do, but don't know how to get started.","I just finished schooling for my BS in Accounting in May, but my university requires a 3 month internship to be able to graduate, and I have been unable to secure one. I am now living at home, and have no idea how to get started. Just to clarify it: I need one semester worth of paid work experience in my field to be allowed to ""graduate"" - I am not able to apply to grad school or receive my degree until this is complete.

I would like to return to my college city (roughly an hour and a half from home) because of the number of opportunities there, and because I would like to continue my education for an MBA once the university will allow me to.

Home town never recovered from the 2008 recession; there are roughly 3-4x more jobs in college city than there are at home, and they all pay close to twice as much even though the cost of living is about the same.

The issues I've run into:

* I have a license, but no vehicle. No one in my family has a vehicle that I can use.
* I live in Central New York, so biking is out of the question 6-7 months of the year.
* Our public transportation is rudimentary at best. It would take approximately an hour and a half to get downtown from where I am by using the bus system.
* At home, most of the available jobs in my field want to pay minimum wage, or require an MBA/CPA.
* I do not know anybody who would be able to co-sign a loan. Additionally, my credit is too low to be able to secure a decent loan if I were to have income. All payments have been 100% on time, and this would change once my credit card is fully paid off.

I know what I want to do, but the issue is being able to make it happen. My student loans total about $64,000 -- 52,000 in Federal loans with mandatory repayment starting in March 2019, and a high-interest private loan of 12,000 with mandatory repayment starting in November. Once repayment starts, the minimum on the Federal loans will be $461 a month, and the private will be $150 a month. I also have a credit card at its $2,000 limit due to textbooks.

As a result, I have no savings and have been relying on family being able to make the minimum card payment while I search for something. I worked on campus for 20 hours a week while I was a student, but book costs (or, more specifically, online access codes) made those jobs more of a necessity instead of being able to contribute to savings.

Ideally, I'd return to my college city. The job offers there would meet the income requirements for the apartments close to the university; the reason I'm looking there is because I know the bus line.

What is the best way to get off the ground? It seems like I'd be okay once I have my own reliable transportation, but that seems to be the hardest thing to nail down.",finance

personalfinance,Pay off car before full emergency fund?,"I'm active duty commissioned military, with 2 years left of my service commitment. This means my employment/income is extremely secure, I have virtually no risk of out-of-pocket medical expenses for an emergency (hooray Tricare), I have a relatively new car with an insanely good consumer reliability rating I take great care of mechanically (very low chance of large repair).

What this boils down to is that I am considering building a (relatively) small E-fund of not 6+ months but of 1/2 months (~$4,000, w/ $1K in a HYSA and the rest in VMMXX) and then paying off my remaining ~$13.5K/3.87% auto loan over the next 12 months.

My rationale is that I can't justify needing a large E-fund, and putting the rest of the money I would have contributed to it towards something that I can turn into pure asset (the car, valued @ ~$18K) seems to make sense. After paying off the car, I would then proceed to expand the E-fund to the full 6 or so months.

I am already contributing the maximum to my Roth IRA, receiving the max 401(k) (really the Federal TSP) matching, paying off the rest of my ~$24K/4% avg. student loan debt off at a rate to be free from them in 36 months, and have no other debts.

Is paying this car off aggressively in the next year sensible in my situation? I feel like the benefits of having a paid-off card should go beyond the psychological, but I have elementary finance education/experience so I could imagine there being something obvious I'm missing.

Bitcoin,"Post-bitcoinization, a few concerns","These concerns were put forth to me not as a concern about bitcoin, but the issues which led to the ending of the gold-backed currency era in 1971.  I have rephrased these and put them into a future tense to describe the challenges a ""fully bitcoin economy"" might again face.  Keep in mind, this is in a post-fiat collapse scenario. Bitcoin has already won.

I'd be curious to hear the thoughts and opinions of fellow bitcoiners on how we might mitigate these similar issues (or why these are non-issues in the first place, or are only limited to Gold and not crypto).  

&gt;1. Bitcoin will become more scarce when its most needed - during a crisis, people will hodl on to their bits in fear of losing their wealth. In crisis, we _should_ encourage spending to encourage growth (as in many growth models), so having monetary flows slow down is the last thing we want. As an example, see 1847 crisis.

&gt;2. The bitcoin emission rate is deflationary, will lead to deflation, and amplifies macroeconomic disturbance.  In order to preserve bitcoin, interest rates will have to be set high - making borrowing more expensive and hence limiting investment, again slowing growth.

&gt;3. It restricts the use of expansionary monetary policy, as this would lead to an outflow of bitcoin. It therefore will cause deflationary shocks.  Governments will try to maintain their bitcoin reserves no matter the cost - usually at the expense of increased unemployment. Again, higher unemployment leads to slower growth and deflation, and low aggregate demand led to even further upward pressure on unemployment.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Is It Too Soon To Ask For A Raise?,"Hey everyone,

I work for a financial company and was recently promoted into the Legal/Compliance department back in June. I’ve been with the company since I relocated earlier this year in March. 

A brief history of my background, I’ve spent the last 4 years working for a payment processor—the last 2 years working in compliance. My compliance background involves AML, SARS, Regulatory, and OFAC. 

I eventually left the company and moved to be closer to my girlfriend and her family. Following my move, I quickly picked up a job working an entry level position for this financial company. I figured it’d be a good temporary job while I search for one that related to my professional experience. 

After several months of working this job, eventually a listing came up on the company site for a Compliance position and I went ahead applied and ended up getting the position. I would soon be taking over for another individual whom had been working this position for a good 6 years. So I started this position officially mid-June and I’ve been doing on the job training over the last few months, learning the different responsibilities, taking on new projects week by week, and ultimately learning the nuances with the tasks. There’s a lot my job entails such as licensing, employee compensation, and handling any received complaints or lawsuits, and overall, ensuring the company is within the laws of the state and federal government. 

So the person I will be replacing will be leaving by the end of the week and once they’re gone, I will be assuming the full role of the position and taking on a larger workload. On top of that, my manager, whom is the company lawyer just received a better opportunity elsewhere and put in his 2 weeks notice as of Monday and will be leaving by the end of next week. This makes things a little more interesting on my end, as he would have been my go to for any sort of counsel. 

Prior to him leaving, I would like to sit down and have a final one-on-one and go over what my future is going to look like in this position. My question is, is it too soon to ask for an increase in my compensation?

When I was first promoted, I wasn’t given much of raise and I figured that was mainly due to myself being new to the company and working about half the workload of the position. I would like to see a raise, currently I’m making substantially less than I was with the previous company, while taking on more responsibilities. 

Any thoughts on how I should handle this?

I majored in chemistry and am currently in graduate school for master in immunobiology, so my job prospects and income are looking good when I am finished in about a year from now.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I basically have...

47K in public student loans on forbearance 

10K in student loans to my parents for graduate school

\~22K in credit card debt, most of which has or will go to collection because I have ignored it. When I tried to resolve the matter with the companies they wanted me to pay what I can, but I have nothing to pay to them at all. I barely have money for milk as it is. 

The worse part is that I want to start taking out loans for my second year of graduate studies as well, if I can. Since I am in Germany, they wont know how bad my credit is in the states and they will probably give it to me.

Look, I don't want to be this irresponsible, but I have had nothing but extremely minor income from the last  years- but upwards of needing at least 12k a year to live... so that's what has happened.

* CCNP, CAP, CASP, GSLC, CISSP (or associate), CISM, PMP within 6 months of hire. For my team specifically, the 3's had to get CISSP w/in 6 months. This wasn't given to me as a requirement for accepting the promotion.

**TLDR - After this was posted, we financed the repair after getting the price lowered somewhat, vehicle is back on the road, and we are planning to pay the cost off within 6 months.**


My husband financed a 2012 Nissan Rogue a little over year ago. We have about 3 years left with the payments, and we have been extremely happy with the vehicle. This weekend, the transmission went tits up. $4200 repair estimate from the dealer, and I am having difficulty finding any independent shop in the area who will even quote me on replacing a CVT transmission. There’s no warranty, as we have over 120,000 miles on it. Since we owe $9000 on the car, I don’t know what to do, except trade it in and go upside down into a new loan on something else. We have zero cash to throw at this at all. 

I am really upset because I really don’t see a way out of this. Is trading it in and going upside down the only option for us, or am I missing something obvious?

Would it even be possible to hide that much negative equity and be able to keep our payments at the current level of around $300/month? Credit score is good, but not great. High utilization (credit cards) is deflating things but no other negatives present on the report. 

I don’t want another transmission of this type (I’m kind of over it right now!) but I do want a reliable SUV of about the same size. Will other dealers even look at my current vehicle since it has a blown CVT transmission and let us trade it in for a decent price? Or am I stuck with getting another Nissan?

What kind of trade in value is this even going to have?

I have never had something hit with no warning and I am beyond anxious. I feel like our finances are going to be in long-term ruin. A 6-7 year car loan is the only thing I can see as even an option and my stomach is absolutely sick over it.

Thanks for any advice in advance.

UPDATE:

So my 2012 Nissan Rogue has had its transmission replaced and it’s back in my driveway and usable once again. I really appreciate all of the comments and advice - I read and considered each and every one. 

The CVT in my vehicle was not repairable - it wasn’t able to be rebuilt. No transmission shop in my area would even quote me a price to replace it, save one, and they came back more expensive than the dealer! Since it’s a specialty thing, I was kinda stuck with begging for assistance from both Nissan Corporate and the dealer. A CVT is not something a novice can pull and repair themselves, and Nissans in junkyards are mostly there for having blown transmissions. They’re closed units. Also, I am the furthest thing from being a mechanic that exists on this planet.

Anyway, our original quote came back at $4200 but when pressed, the dealer “took a second look” and offered the replacement at $3600. They called back later and agreed to also include an oil change and tire rotation - both which were currently due. This wasn’t much, but it was something.

I carpet-bombed Nissan with an email sent to 6 different people, and received 4 calls within 24 hours. The response time was great, but the end result was that they refused to extend the warranty on the work and transmission (12 months/12,000 miles) and also would not assist with the price. I spoke with an entry-level call center rep first, who called to say they were immediately escalating me to a contact who dealt with the dealerships in my area. That person then called to get more information, and then got back to me again to say there was nothing they were willing to do - my 2012 was not part of the Nissan vehicle group which were having all of the issues, nor was it involved in the lawsuits that had been filed and settled previously. The rep did not appreciate me asking to escalate further, but later that day I received a call from someone saying they were a Vice President (I forget the division) but that their word was final and I would not be receiving assistance on this repair.

So. We ended up financing most of the work at a high interest rate, but since this is now our shittiest debt, we are going to be as aggressive as possible with paying it off. I also hope to get rid of the remaining car loan on an accelerated plan by cutting some extras out of our budget, once the repair loan is gone. 

Before buying the Rogue, we always paid cash for vehicles, but when my adult son totaled his car in an accident last year, I gave him my paid-off Toyota and got financed for the Nissan, since we had good credit whereas he had none at all. I feel like the car crisis is still ongoing, but I am calmer knowing it won’t last forever - we will definitely be selling the Rogue as soon as it’s paid off and we can build up enough cash to buy another vehicle (not a Nissan) outright. 

To expand on the story, this past weekend my son totaled the Toyota that we gifted him a year ago (he hydroplaned on a highway - completely weather related) and now he’s using the bus. We are all done with helping out. I don’t like being in a bad financial position, and assisting him last time is what maneuvered us into where we are now.

personalfinance,"Best way to pay off student loans? Please help, I'm a 1st gen grad who has no idea what to do...","Hi Reddit,

I'm a recent college graduate who very luckily got an ok paying job right after graduation. Salary of 45k. Making around $2,800 monthly w/ taxes deducted, have been religiously saving 2k every month since May. 

I still live at home with the birthgivers, so I am very lucky regarding the rest of my finances. I'm trying to hoard my money for the time being.

My loans are currently around 22k, with $1,300 already accrued. My interest accumulates daily. Interest rate is around 4.5%.

My first loan payment is due this January and the minimum payment for me to pay it off in 10 years is around $260 monthly. This is doable but I do not want to spend the next 10 years paying off my loans.

By December (accounting for Christmas gifts, possible unforeseen car issues, etc), I should have about 14k in my savings.

Should I bite the bullet and put anywhere between 5-7k to my loans *or* up my monthly payment by $350-$450? I'm the first to graduate in my family, and the first to acquire student loans. Neither my family or friends have any experience in what to do...I would really appreciate any kind of advice.

Thank you in advance! So nervous/excited.

Edit: Forgot ""or"" 

Edit: Jesus, I didnt expect this many responses! Thank you so much you guys, I'll try to respond to as many comments as I can. You've all given me a well-rounded explanation and mentality toward paying my loans. Thank you x100!",finance
personalfinance,What is the best savings approach after dealing with a financial emergency?,"I have recently hit my goal for an emergency fund. From what I have learned, the next steps would be to increase employer matching accounts (401k, HSA, etc.), pay off lower interest debts (high interest have been paid off), and then invest in riskier funds. 

My question is - what are the best next steps if my emergency fund needs to be used after I put my money in other accounts?

For example, if after some time, I have $5k in 401k, $3k in HSA, and another $5k in investments (ETFs, stocks, etc.), then my emergency fund depletes to $0, is the best approach to sell my riskiest funds to replenish the emergency fund quickly? Or do I simply reduce my employee contributions and slowly save up again? 

General details: single, no kids, $20k in student loans (4% highest interest rate), about $1600 in expenses/month, no credit card debt.

I can provide more details if needed. Any tips/tricks/advice would be appreciated.

personalfinance,Debt well above my pay at new job. How do I deal with getting it under control.,"TL:DR After a tough divorce I let bad selfesteem and horrible spending habits launch me into debt that is well beyond my means. Need advice on how to to proceed. My wake up call has occurred. My car was broken into over the labor day weekend and its costing me $312.00 to fix the damage. Its below my deductable I have basically no savings now and I realize if I put it on CC again it's continuing to magnify the issue.

These are my numbers: 

Money coming in:

Current take home pay bi-weekly after state and fed tax: 941.96 (a little over 33,000 before taxes a year)
Payment from ex wife for debts after divorce 150.00 monthly
Monthly Necessary Bills:

$620.00 Rent and Utilities
$42.00 Eletric average
$251.56 Car Payment
$238.00 Car Insurance
$240.00 ish for food/dog food and necessities/hygiene
$65.00 Cellphone
$42.00 Internet
School and CC Debts:

CC 1 VISA 9880.56 min payment 225.00 Interest 16.74% (can't afford to pay this today)
CC 2 AMEX 9997.97 min payment 263.00 19.74% interest
Gov student loans 58,080 payment 160.00 (income driven payment plan)
Private School Loans 11934.53 payment 265.90 various interest rates.

I'm working on finding a secondary part time income, but it's tough as my government job is flex hours so my only availability is weekends and I can't commit to evenings during the week because I never know when I will have a necessary really late day. I'm trying to avoid uber and other driving jobs because I dont want to risk wear and tear and maintenance I can't afford on my vehicle. So trying online side hustles like Mturk and Clickworker while I try to find something more practical. Right now I'm looking at basically no longer being able to keep up with paying debts this month. My silver lining is that my boss has put me in to get my promotion early because of my work ethic. This would generate about 200 dollars more biweekly but no garrantee it will happen and it will still likely take a year. I'm stressed and lost. Advice?

personalfinance,Where to invest,"Hi r/personalfinace! I've been trying to figure out how to invest \~$35k. The money has been sitting in the bank being eroded by inflation for almost a year.

I know that the standard advice in my case is to invest in a low cost, diversified stock index fund or ETF, but I'm reluctant to do that for two reasons. First, I already have a lot of exposure to stock market risk with other investments and my 401k, and second, I believe the stock market is over valued and will be falling soon (but I'm not sure).

I've thought about investing in bonds (or bond ETFs), but with interest rates expected to go up, this doesn't seem like a good strategy. (Bond values go down when interest rates go up unless you are willing to wait for maturity, which I'm not sure that I am).

I also thought about REITs but as a homeowner, I already have a lot of exposure to real estate risk.

I'm also not interested in futures or other investments that only grow when markets fall. I don't know that the market will fall, and if the market stays put, I don't want to lose money.

Finally, I thought about putting the money into my mortgage (4% interest rate), but then I loose out on tax benefits and the 'investment' isn't exactly liquid.

Ultimately, I just don't know what kind of investments are out there (except what I have mentioned already), and none of them fit the bill.

I want a liquid investment with little or no correlation with the stock market or real estate. Ideally the investment can be expected to outpace inflation (but it doesn't need to do much more than that). It'd be nice if the money was out there doing something with the expectation that it will grow, and I want to be able to set it and forget it with a horizon of maybe 2-12 years.

Any help or even just ideas would be very much appreciated!

EDIT: I'm willing to tolerate substantial risk, but I don't want the risk to be correlated with stocks or real estate.

EDIT2: I feel like people are treating me like an idiot. This is unfair. I just wanted to know what investment vehicles were out there that I didn't already consider.",finance

personalfinance,Parent nearing retirement (early 50's) with little savings. Should they go traditional or Roth?,"Sorry for yet another one of these questions, I searched the subreddit and read https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional, but I'm still unsure since there are some parts of this situation that appear in both of those lists.

* Parent in early 50's with little established retirement savings
* Probably not expecting much income from social security/pension/etc (I don't know the complete details, but I'm trying to find out)
* 22% federal tax bracket as an individual
* Currently living in and most likely retiring in a state with no income tax.

I'm thinking Traditional because:

* I'm guessing their retirement income probably isn't going to be high enough to be taxed more than what they're currently at? I'm waiting to confirm this though.
* Won't need to worry about state income tax when withdrawing

Though at this point, maybe it doesn't matter too much?

Does my reasoning here sound valid? Is there anything else I should be considering that I'm currently not?",finance
personalfinance,Need help with setting up Payment Schedule to re-pay debt,"I have 5.5K in Student Loans left and another 1.5K left over in the form of a personal loan. I want to be able to pay both. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I live with my parents. I'm making anywhere between $1.6K - 3K a month, but that's through an internship where I have to pay taxes in the form of a 1099. There is currently no interest on the student loan, but my grace period will end by January and from there, I'll have to add interest on top of it. I do not want to pay the interest, and would rather pay it off entirely now. I make closer to $2K-3K right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought was to work as many hours as I could to pay off my student loan within the next two months, but I don't think that's feasible. Since I got the loan from my University, I cannot get my transcript or diploma until I pay off the entire amount. I really need the transcript to apply to a Master's Program, but they will not let me. I also can't refinance it through the Federal government, nor can I get a private loan to cover it due to being late to build up credit. The issue is that I need my transcript for employers. I can't verify my GPA, because the University will not let ANYONE see this data until I pay the amount off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't know what spending all of my money on that loan would look to the IRS, either. I don't know how long the internship will last for, so I'm reticent on spending all of my income on that and have nothing left over for taxes. I would have to pay that by January 15th. A friend of mine has offered to pay for half of my student loan debt, but I'm unsure on what a payment schedule would look like, mostly because I'd still have to factor in paying for the other half of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What would be a good payment schedule to pay off my debt? The internship I'm doing is not even in the field I want to get into, but it's the highest paying job I can get right now. I've put off applying to my actual field by a year for this, because there's NO way I can apply to any University without even an unofficial transcript.",finance
financialindependence,The struggle to break away from the multigenerational wealth accumulation failure cycle. . .,"I was 5 when my parents divorced. My mother raised me for about a year after that, before losing custody because she is mentally unstable. 

My mom is now 54 years old. She hasn’t held a job for longer than a year or two and she always spent every penny as soon as it hit her bank account. These days, she lives with a physically abusive often-unemployed husband, in a dilapidated house he recently inherited from his mother. They scrape by on my mom’s disability checks. 

My maternal grandmother lived in a small apartment with no savings, scraping by on social security until she died of cancer.

My father raised me. Like my mother, he has always been a low wage worker. Making matters worse, we live in a pretty HCOL area. Despite that, he squandered most of the money he earned. He remarried when I was 9. His new wife was also a low wage worker and a big spender. In my final 9 years of childhood, I watched my dad buy a new vehicle, new computers, video games, a new TV, PPV wrestling events, and hundreds of worthless trinkets.

When I became a young adult, not much had changed. My dad bought another brand new car. He continued buying worthless trinkets they set on their shelves to never look at again until it’s time to dust them off once in a while. He began getting hooked on Facebook games with micro transactions. At one point, he confessed to me that he spent over $4,000 on one Facebook game over the course of four or five years.  

Fast forward. My dad is now 51 years old. About five years ago, his wife was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. A year or two after that, her employer was tired of accommodating her inability to stay on her feet, so she was let go. They went to apply for disability but they were denied. A lawyer began assisting them with the process. About a year ago, his wife needed multiple surgeries due to complications from the MS. Down to one insurance and one job, the medical bills piled up. 

Months ago, he confessed to me that he was going to lose his house to foreclosure and his life was falling apart. I was compassionate. They moved into an apartment and continue to spend money on unnecessary things like fast food and big car payments. He has 70k in retirement. 

Now to me. I was raised watching such frivolous spending, so a budget was pretty much foreign to me. I joined the military out of high school and lived paycheck to paycheck. I got married and bought a house at my duty station about two years before the housing market collapsed. The collapse coincided with my honorable discharge, and I returned to my home state with a house on the market that wasn’t getting any bites. With no savings, I couldn’t afford to lower the price or to keep paying the payments, and I lost the house to foreclosure. 

I began civilian life with a very low paying job, but I used my GI bill to get an undergraduate degree. As graduation neared, I divorced and began dating my best friend I’ve known since childhood. Soon after graduating, I got married and I moved into a townhouse she purchased from her mother years prior. We decided to sell that to move into a small home. That was fine until I landed a new job out of town that paid a little more. 

So, we moved out there while renting out the other house. That was fine until my wife got pregnant and she wanted to live closer to family. So we rented out the second house as well, and bought a house with the in-laws. My MIL became our child’s full-time nanny while we worked. We had to subsidize my MIL’s early retirement because she, too, was terrible with money and had virtually zero dollars in retirement at age 55. 

I landed a job that paid even more. Our two rental properties are older and began having problems, causing us to rack up credit card debt. That’s on top of older debt from remodeling a portion of one of the homes to make it more likely to attract renters. 

Here I am at 31 years of age with about $100k in retirement (between my wife and I) and a -$900k net worth. $48k is a debt consolidation loan that slightly reduced our interest rate. $16k is credit card debt from repairs to get the rentals in selling condition. $11k is a car loan. $3k is another car loan. The rest... three mortgages. 

I posted on here a while back but I had too much shame to admit we actually had TWO rentals with our completely dumpster fire finances. But we took the criticism to heart and we’re selling both rentals, aggressively paying down debt, and then saving for retirement at a savings rate of about 50% ($50,000/yr). We really don’t want to repeat the mistakes of our parents and grandparents, and so we won’t. A little over a year ago, I knew very little about retirement investments. Thanks to FI blogs and this subreddit, I have a very good grasp on the basics. It’s surprisingly simple and I now know the path to retiring wealthy by our early 50s. 

We are making nearly $100k/yr net now. We should be making $20k-40k  from our rental sales, which can knock out a lot of our debt. We expect to have our debt paid off no later than 2020 and potentially before the end of 2019, at which point we can really ramp up our savings. With each raise, we’ll throw more into investments, eventually increasing our savings rate to 60-70%. We will teach our kids the value of saving... and they’ll learn by our example.

I just wanted to share my story of breaking away from the cycle (I haven’t yet but I’m sure on the right track). And I wanted to thank those of you whom I have learned from as I lurk this sub almost every day. Thanks for the learning moments and the laughs, and more importantly, thanks for the tough love in my previous FI post. I’ll give another update in a year or two, perhaps. 

TL;DR - our families never saved a dime as we grew up and neither did their parents . . . We began making the same errors in life but we are finally breaking the cycle thanks in part to this sub and informative FI blogs. 

Edit: Grammar and spelling corrections. 

Edit 2: Daaang. This really blew up. Thanks very much for all the kind words (and the gold). And yes, I screwed up my net worth calculation again. I will remember how to calculate it next time. Always learning. I’m glad some of you can relate with my story. I look forward to telling you all to go fuck yourselves over the coming years. Cheers.",finance
personalfinance,"23 years old. Very low debt but will be accruing more, need to make sure I'm on the right track.","Hello PersonalFinance. I apologize for the wall of text you're about to encounter but for those who are willing to read it and provide any advice, I thank you.

I am currently 23 years old and have always been pretty good with my finances, but need to make sure I'm on the right track as far as savings/investing goes.

As of currently I have three credit cards with no debt on any, besides this month's payments. In total I have about $1,300 in traditional checking and savings accounts.

Aside from that I have also been using Acorns to invest the equivalent of 5 dollars a day, so around $150 each month, on top of using their round up feature to kind of stash some money there. I know most users here aren't fans of them because of fees, but I am a college student, so no fees at all, but I am open to doing something else with that account, as it was really just set up as a way to get more money out of my normal spending accounts. Total in Acorns I have about $1,700.

I also knew I needed to start taking my retirement stuff into account, so at the second quarter of the year I started taking $100 from each bi-weekly paycheck and putting it into a Betterment Roth IRA, and so far have about $1,400 in there. This was one of the things I notice, is that the recommendation from a lot of people here for people my age was to try putting maybe 25-50 a month in there, and I feel I may be ""overspending"" in a sense for my age.

I also work for a certain trillion dollar company and have been putting a full 6% from my paycheck into a 401k, of which I am getting 75% match for how long I have been here, which I now have almost $10,000 in after four years. I have also been putting 10% of my paycheck into the ESPP and have a bit over $21,000 of sellable stock. These are the only stocks I own and I have not sold any shares. 

Other than that, for ""investing"", I have a bit (&lt;$2000) in crypto currency I bought late last year which I'm down on, but that money is already gone in my mind and I'm okay with just letting it sit and seeing if it does something in the next few years.

I also have $435 in dividends that I foolishly have done nothing with and don't know what best to do with it, but at most I will move that into my savings account.

So running total here is:

$1,300 Cash
$1,700 Acorns (I consider this basically like another savings account at this point)
$1,400 Roth IRA
$10,000 401k
$21,000 stock in one single company (what a risky idiot?)

I have recently opened an American Express savings account with 1.8% interest and am starting to move my savings into that, since the savings account I had all my life up until this point gave me diddly squat. I'd like to put away around $125 a check into this account.

I did buy a car in January and put about $7,000 down on it, and only had to finance around $4,200, and with interest I'll end up paying about $5,000 over the next 5 1/2 years. My monthly payment is $72 so not bad. My car insurance is around $170, I live at home and pay my mom $270 for rent every month and my phone bill is also $72. On top of a few luxuries (video and streaming services and the like) which are only around $50 a month total, I end up having $650 a month worth of payments for things. And mentally I add the $200 for Roth IRA and $150-170ish for the Acorns deductions, putting me around $1,000 every month.

I make around $1,200 a month or so and the rest of my money usually goes to food (which I need to start spending less on, because I overspend on food a lot.)

The real issue is that I am going to be taking on more debt, but in the form of student debt mostly.

As of now the only debt I have is my car, which is manageable. I have been able to pay my way through community college with the help of my company, and I get up to $5,250 per calendar year for reimbursement for school.

I am going into my junior year at a university and am getting the max of $12,500 for federal student loans and am taking out $8,000 in private loans from Discover. I chose to make payments while in school this semester as the amount was about $60 a month which I think is reasonable, and I plan on getting the $5,250 reimbursed in January for which I will immediately pay back onto the Discover loan. I plan on doing this same thing for the following senior year at all the same amounts.

Leaving school I am probably looking about around $30,000 of school loans plus interest, but I am going to school for electrical engineering, so hope to have a good paying job by the time I get out of school.

I pray that these will be really the only loans I have to deal with in the next few years, barring any unexpected situations.

I would ideally like to live in Silicon Valley after graduating, as I live in New England and many of the jobs I want are either there or in Texas, and I don't wish to live in Texas. I realize the Bay Area is expensive, but hey, hopefully that's what the degree is for. However I realize some expectations may have to be reset based on situations.

So that's the whole story. The main thing is I feel like I haven't been increasing my savings outside of what's being deducted from my paycheck into investing accounts really, and am just wondering if there's anything I'm missing or could be doing better with my money that I'm not already doing, or if I'm worrying too much about a Roth IRA amounts and such. Any and all advice is welcome.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Best way to save money and pay off credit cards?,"Hello,

I am a 22 year old, fresh out of College graduate; ready to take on the world. Currently, I am working as a server at Not Your Average Joe's and make fairly decent money, in cash every week. I just bought a new car secondhand and I am trying to save up and hopefully move out with my friends at the beginning of next summer.

Now, I have about 1,000 currently to pay on my credit card which I am trying to pay off very quickly. I also have about 55k in student loans, where I don'y have to start paying on until March of 2020. I know I have some work to do in regards to reconsolidating my loans and getting one fixed rate, and we are planning on doing that soon. I also have to worry about the interest I have had building up as well.

I need to know what the best way to go about saving my money working as a server. Every day, I put between 10-15% of what I made in my savings and so far for this month alone I'm almost at $300! Last month, I did this strategy and I was able to save about $900, in which I used it all towards my credit card.

My question is should I do this again and take the money from my savings and use that to pay off my card, or just throw whatever I have left  in my checking at the end of the month after my big expenses (car insurance, car payment -  $300)

on the card and keep letting my savings account stack up?

I need to start putting something towards my loans now, as I have a year and a half to start taking care of that before I have to pay them, but also with interest each month, I am aware it wouldn't hurt to start putting something on them now.  I also would like to start saving for when I want to move out with my friends and at the same time I am trying my hardest to pay off my credit cards as fast as I can now.

I am also considering opening up a separate savings account with a good interest rate to maximize my savings/ put it into my Robinhood investing app. 

I look forward to hearing your responses and appreciate any help!

Thank you

investing,Noob question about bonds,"I'm reading the yield on bonds goes up when interest rates go up because people sell the bonds as they're interest rate is less than the latest bonds.

So am I right in saying it's a good time to buy bonds when an increase in interest rates is announced?

Should you wait until the interest rate is ""high"" before buying them? What is a ""high"" interest rate?

Now would be a bad time to buy bonds right?

How do the interest rates apply to them? Is it a good idea to use it as your main card? How do you get a good credit score? What forms part of a good credit score? Between the debit and credit what’s your suggested % breakdown? 

Honestly, I got one maybe 6 months ago, and I’m trying to take better control/understanding of my finances, so please don’t be condescending towards this. I genuinely want to understand how they work, how to work with one for the best outcome, what to keep in mind and so on.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Survey Suggests Bright Future For Cryptocurrency,"Bitcoin’s price could be about to experience a boost after it was discovered that American students are twice as likely as the country’s average to own the cryptocurrency. This discovery was made after a survey which was made and carried out by Coinbase and Qriously.

Close to one in five students in America who responded to the survey said that they own or have at some point owned bitcoin or another digital asset. This is twice as much as that of the general population which suggests that the ownership and adoption of bitcoin could be about to increase.
Students have proven to be good indicators of cultural and technological change. Facebook which is now the world’s biggest social network was only open to students in its early phase and found mass adoption among the younger population before experiencing the same in the older segments.

Another example can be taken by observing how the internet was used back in the 80s. It was predominantly used by students and universities to share research before being commercialized. Of all the students who took part in the survey, 17% said they think their knowledge of cryptocurrency and blockchain was very good compared to 9% of the general population who were asked the same question at the same time. However, the survey comes on the back of Coinbase’s CEO suggesting just earlier this month that commercial adoption of bitcoin for payments could end up taking quite some time.
This survey does, however, fall in line with a paper written by researchers at Imperial College London in July who predicted that digital currencies are set to be adopted by masses.

According to this report, bitcoin and other digital assets will hit the mainstream as a means for paying for goods and services inside the next ten years, just as many of those who were surveyed by Coinbase enter the working world.

One in four who were surveyed by Coinbase said that they would certainly take a course on blockchain or cryptocurrency. Universities are moving fast to satisfy this demand.

According to Coinbase, when David Yermack, the finance department chair at NYU’s Stern School of Business, initially offered his course on blockchain and financial services four years ago, 35 students enrolled, 8 fewer than the school’s typical elective.
By Spring of this year, the number of students who had signed up for the same course had jumped up to 230 and this forced Stern to move the class to its biggest auditorium. Coinbase found that over 40% of the best 50 universities around the world offer at least one class on cryptocurrency or blockchain and over 20% offer more than just one.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency classes are more popular and present in the US, it must be noted. Less than 30% of the 18 international universities on the list offers at least one class on the topic. Only two – the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and the National University of Singapore – offer in addition to one.

Coinbase reviewed course catalogs at the best 50 universities in the world and found classes in cryptocurrency across various departments including finance and anthropology, thereby proving that the courses were not limited to computer science.
In fact, the increase in offerings across disciplines can be mapped to student interest: students with a varying set of majors said they would be inclined to taking cryptocurrency classes. Almost 50% of all social science majors said they’d be open to signing up for a crypto class. Meanwhile, the bitcoin price made a recovery this week by climbing above the all-important $7,000 mark.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Centurylink sending returned modem to collections,"Hi everybody! Long time browser here that thought the good people of Reddit might have answers I didn't think of. 

Basically, when I terminated my Centurylink service in September of 2017, I payed off everything, packed up the modem and sent it back. I moved to a different state, forwarded my mail to my new address, and lived happily for 10 months.  We started looking at houses and I applied to get pre approved through a mortgage loan company.  When they ran my credit they said my current credit was about 100 points lower than I expected and what I see when I use Mint. They said Centurylink had sent a balance to collections that I knew nothing about. I called Centurylink and they said I never returned the modem. I know for a fact I returned the modem because I remember packing it up and thinking how well it fit in the box. They asked for me to provide the tracking number from almost a year ago which I did not keep track of. I called UPS and they said because Centurylink uses their preprinted labels, the tracking number is in their account and cannot be accessed. Centurylink says they do not keep track of the tracking number as they ONLY mail out a preprinted label when service is terminated. A practice which is now changed, as you can get an electronic version now. I've spoke with 30+ people in Centurylink trying to convince them that I know I sent the modem back and it simply wasn't scanned in when they received it. Which I 100% know I sent it back. One nice lady agreed that was a possibility and it was ridiculous to hurt my credit that much over such a small thing and attempted to credit my account. They said it takes a few days to process and when I called back a few days later, the credit was apparently rejected by the crediting department citing the reason for rejection as ""how did she know I returned the equipment.""

I really don't know what to do. I never received a notification whether it be email/letter/phone call prior to this going to collections and it's really not about the $105 they're asking for the modem. If I would had known in January I would have simply paid it. It's about that now it's gone to collections and hurt my credit score, that even a 0.25% increase in interest rate on a $200k loan is $13,000 over 30 years. It's coming down to the fact that this simple tracking number is worth thousands of dollars it seems. 

The mortgage loan advisor said to get a letter that said the balance was reported in error to the credit companies since I actually sent it back. But at this point it seems impossible to do that. Do I simply pay it off and ask for a zero balance letter? Is that equal or different to a letter saying they reported it in error? Am I overreacting and it won't hurt my credit as bad as I think? Also everybody I've talked to about this in real life has said ""Oh, you don't know how many times Centurylink has tried to do that to me."" Apparently I missed the memo that Centurylink loves to send people to collections over returned modems. Otherwise I would have framed my tracking number and called in months after to make sure everything was closed. Also, I apologize if this has been asked before, I couldn't figure out how to search the subreddit on mobile. Thank you to everyone who takes the time to help :)",finance

personalfinance,Old to new credit card,"I have a credit card with a bank called PNC. I've been with them since they were national city in my town and I was 16. I got a credit card through them and have always been good about either not using it or paying off the balance. Well since getting married and getting a house charges have of course racked up. When PNC got national city I was given a points credit card which was alright at the time, but now as I look to try and pay things down I thought of switching my credit card to a different one. 

The points card I have seems like its generally for people who travel and use it in a variety of places. Whereas the card I want is a core credit card. The core is mainly for lower interest rates. I was also looking at capital ones credit cards as well but I'm trying to keep everything through the same bank if possible to make things easier, but if I pay more in the long run I'd be willing to switch. 

So I'm wondering should I open up another card the core, transfer the balance of my remaining to it and close out the first credit card I got? I'd also like to state that this would be my first time doing this so it shouldn't hurt my score too much I hope. Thank you for any assistance!",finance
personalfinance,Debt getting out of control- should I refinance my home?,"TL;DR- debt bad, maybe new mortgage help?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I promised myself I'd never get into this mess- but I'm in it, and I need help getting out.  


I have $8,900 in CC debt and approx. $6k remaining on a private loan. All in all, about 15k in debt. interest rates on the cards are around 29%, the loan is about 12%. I can only afford minimum payments for an indefinite amount of time- so the total amount on those debts isn't getting any lower and those minimum payment amounts are slowly climbing...   


My question is- should I refinance and consolidate this debt? My idea is that if we're paying about $300/month in minimum payments, and our mortgage (including insurance/taxes) is about $650, even if our mortgage payment went up to as much as $750, we'd still be saving $200/month.  


My current mortgage principal balance is about 85k, and my home value has gone up since we've purchased it. It's around 110k according to all the free estimates (obviously the appraisal will determine the accurate amount). So I might have a tiny bit of equity I can work with to pay off that debt... I could also theoretically switch from FHA to Conventional and get rid of PMI.  


The problem is that my current mortgage rate is SOOO nice- it's 3.2%. Current mortgage rates for a 30 year fixed are about 4.5%.   


Would I be saving money by consolidating this debt into my mortgage? Or losing money?  


I have an appointment to talk to a banker on Monday, but I want to be prepared- I don't want to sign up for something that looks good on paper but is going to kill me in the long run.  


&amp;#x200B;

Any advise is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Ideas to Lower Finances?,"Hello,

Here is my current layout of my finances: [Current Bills](https://imgur.com/a/VqtG9nT) **Note:** I forgot to divide the DirecTV and AT&amp;amp;T bills by 2 as I split it with my sister.

I have a 2017 Kia Forte. Payments are high because I traded in an ‘18 Chevy Volt which has $100 higher of payments. So this is as low as I can go. Friend near me doesn’t have a car and I see what he goes through just *trying* use use mass transit and he ends up spending more money on Uber’s than I would on a car payment + gas. I have thought over selling the car but it doesn’t work out financially.

I have eliminated all extra curricular payments (YouTube, Spotify, Hulu, etc.) except Amazon Prime as we use Amazon enough that the $120 payment is 100% worth the money.

I currently make $13.26/hr but I just finished my IT Degree and I’ve got a job prospect of $14/hr and another one at $18/hr (interviews are early next week). I will take $18/hr if I’m offered it BUT I’m going to assume I don’t so that I can plan for current pay or even $14/hr. I work full time (32-36/week) and I have $100 healthcare come out each check. Generally they range about $600-800 bi-weekly.

Right now, my student loans aren’t ‘due’ but i want to pay them down as much as possible within the next 6 months so that when they are due I don’t have as much to pay. They are at just over 3% interest and I owe $7800 right now.

Rest of my debt is credit cards.

Navy Federal (highest balance) is at $8200 at 16.74% interest.

Best Buy Credit Card (next highest and now closed) is at $4900 with $2k at 0% interest until May 2019 (will be fine paying it off by then). Other $2900 is 0% interest til June 2019 &amp;amp; another in December 2019.

Chase Credit Card is at $2800 at 14.74% interest

Amazon Credit Card is at $2000 at 20.99% interest

I have 2 Google Store Cards (both closed and at 0% interest for 24 months) one is at $1100 (this one should be paid off with a refund soon; should also have $50 credit) and the other is at $800 and my friend pays me $50/month for that phone. So it is free for me.

———————————————————————

I have a 4K check coming from selling my Chevy Volt (refund on insurance) plus a possible raise from a new job.

What I was thinking about doing is using the check to pay off the Chase &amp;amp; Amazon cards to free up ~$130 for the Navy Federal &amp;amp; Best Buy cards but friends and family think I should use it to pay down the Navy Federal Card instead.

I’m just not sure what is the best route and how I can get my bills to a lower rate that I can afford.... also, I won’t get approved for a loan to consolidate my bills. I checked. :(

TIA!

financialindependence,"Heavy Student Loan Debt, Help with FIRE strategy?","This community has been so awesome and inspiring to watch. I mainly lurk, but am posting today via a throwaway. I’m hoping to get a ‘second set of eyes’ on my wife and I’s situation to see if people have thoughts on how to optimize our situation. While I’ve been interested in FIRE for a while (but ruled it out because I thought we were in too deep with student loans), we are newly committed to it – so we’re at the point of hammering down our expenses (stop eating out, leaning out our expenses however we can, etc).  

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of background: My wife and I graduated with $380k student loan debt 10 years ago (270k hers, a pharmacist, and 110k mine – a school counselor). Our initial income was around $170k, and we tried to attack our student loans pretty hard – but just the monthly payments were oppressive, and so we used a debt snowball method so that our monthly finances weren’t so rigid. In 10 years, we’ve paid that down to $219k. We’ve consolidated many of our loans, and there are few ‘easy wins’ left (some consolidated loans are 70k+). We admittedly fell off the track of paying aggressively toward these loans due to some other factors (kids, life).

&amp;#x200B;

Right out of the gate, we bought a 2 family house for $232k with an FHA loan (3% down) which allowed us to live in a 3 bedroom apartment for \~$650 a month – which saved us around 500/month in our area. Over time, we’ve had 3 kids and we moved out of our 2 family (but kept it as a rental) into a bigger house with an in-law apartment ($335k) which we again bought with a low downpayment mortgage. Our in-laws contribute $900/month in rent.

&amp;#x200B;

Just by the numbers, here is where we are at:

&amp;#x200B;

Income and investments

Income from jobs: Me $65k + Her $135k = 200k

Income from rental property (not including in-law): 2350/ month – expenses = 600 month, or 7200 a year.

Investments:

Her

401k: $67k

Me

457: $45k

403b: $15k

Pension: \~$45k contributed – I cannot access this unless I sever employment, and I could not access employer contributions which dwarf my contributions. I am vested at this point.

College savings: $22k between a custodial account, and 3 529s.

&amp;#x200B;

Debt

Student Loans: $219k – various interest rates, mostly 5% or under.  

Real Estate:

2 Family we owe $190k on it (3.25% interest rate). We paid $230k, it is worth around $260k currently.

Current house we owe $307k (4% Interest rate), paid $335k and it is worth around $360k.

Automobile: $10k (we own one car outright, and owe on the other)

Credit Card Debt: $12k (0% until May)

There are some other costs, such as day care and after school programs, that take a small bite out of our budget

&amp;#x200B;

We are at a crossroads with regard to strategy and are interested in others thoughts. We are 35 and are concerned about the amount we’ve saved for retirement – I’m not sure we’d be on pace for a standard retirement, nevermind FIRE.  We’d like to try to fully retire by the time our youngest goes to college – so \~15 years. We’d like to start taking better advantage of our tax advantaged accounts – max her 401k + her employer match, max my 457 (and I get a 6.2% employer match into the 403b because my employer does not pay social security), and possibly max the 403b (though I’m stuck at Edward Jones with that and don’t have access to good funds). If we hit a recession, we might shift back to going hard on the student loans if the \~5% guaranteed gain seemed better than what we could earn from pouring that money into our retirement accounts). I also plan to refinance 2 student loans that are at a 6.7% interest rate, I believe I can get that to 6% fixed through SoFi.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated. Specifically interested in strategy to invest/max our retirement accounts vs. recommitting to aggressively paying down debt. Also curious about thoughts on variable vs. fixed rate student loans, and if we should prioritize one vs. the other. Should I refinance student loans – and if so, should I go with a variable rate that seems lower? Should I be worried about the fees in my 403b account – I think I’m in the lowest cost funds available to me, but they’re still pretty high (.47 I believe) compared to a passively managed index.

personalfinance,Wife started working a part time job and we're unsure of how to handle taxes.,"We have two kids - this is my wifes first paycheck in a long time and they didn't take out state or federal taxes and we're unsure as to why so far but would like to figure it out.

If my understanding is correct this makes her income taxable at the 22% federal rate since we file jointly and our income gets combined for tax purposes. State for us at our combined salaries is around 7%.

Because of this I need to bank roughly 30% of her earnings to offset taxes - is this correct? Her company did take out money for social security and medicare. Anything else we should be worried about?

personalfinance,What do with excess cash?,"I have a balanced portfolio of stocks/bonds/RE/cash that is sufficient to meet my retirement needs.

I just collected a significant amount (for me) of cash by selling a shares in a private company.

I have no debt to pay off and no need for the cash other adding to my retirement fund, which I won't touch for another 5 to 8 years.

I used the cash to purchase treasuries using my TreasuryDirect account to avoid commissions.  However, it bugs me that I am collecting an after-tax yield that is about 1.2 percent lower than current inflation.   

With this strategy, I should lose about 10 percent of the cash over the next 8 years.  I don't expect that yields on Treasuries will go up because the Fed policy is to ""inflate us out"" of our national debt by keeping rates low.

I have been reading and folks suggest two alternatives: blue chip stock with high dividend yields and munis.

However, I find these solutions too risky.  Stock valuations are sky high.  I could lose ten percent in the next month.  Munis are hard.   Diversification is required in munis, but mutual funds are expensive.  There are a few ETFs with fees below 10 bps, but their yield is about 2.2 percent and they are subject to interest rate risk with a duration of 5 or so years.

I can't think of a solution.   Does anyone have any ideas?

gaming,The new Spider-Man game is one of the best superhero games I've ever played (Semi-review),"I just finished the main story. While the credits role I write this. I'll try to go without spoilers. It has to be top 3 maybe even top 2 superhero games I've ever played, only being passed by maybe Arkham City or Asylum.

GAMEPLAY:

From a gameplay standpoint, the Arkham games are the only thing that surpass it and so that's really all I'll compare it to. The combat is similar to Arkham in it's movesets and buttons but unlike Arkham in which you don't just stand around waiting for people to attack you so you can backhand them like Batman would. Instead there is no counter, only a dodge. It makes the gameplay a little more difficult for seasoned vets of Arkham or Shadow of Mordor games.

The enemies don't differ too much, but just enough so the game doesn't get boring and they keep adding new gameplay into the mix all throughout the story. One enemy type I didn't even get to fight until roughly 80% of my way through the game.

The stealth gameplay is as expected, simple, easy to use, not as complex as the Arkham games. But I seemed to keep forgetting that this Spider-Man has gadgets as well and I don't have to just stealth takedown everyone like I would in previous Spider-Man stealth missions. It isn't a wide variety because he doesn't have a whole armory around his waist like Batman, but enough gadgets to make things fun during stealth.

Swinging through New York is the best it has ever felt in any game. Only things close is maybe Web of Shadows and Spider-Man 2. But I would say this is better. Not much to explain here, just got to experience it.

Also there are some moments in the story where you're stripped of your super-powers and given a chance to breathe which is nice. It gives you time to appreciate the story and characters and also just how powerful Spider-Man is in this game.

STORY (I will warn when spoilers start):

The Arkham games combat was revolutionary and the story made you feel like Batman and the world's greatest detective. But only after playing this game do I see a slight flaw in that... He's Batman. He's god-damned Batman, the ultimate badass. It's hard to relate with him as a character. I can say that Arkham City maybe had the most entertaining story because of all the supervillains colliding in one place with Batman. But without a doubt, it may be more entertaining but Spider-Man's execution of the story was better if that makes sense.

It's easier to connect with Peter and the problems he has. I think maybe I teared up a little when Joker died, but there were points in this game that had me full on wiping a few drops from my cheeks dudes and girls. And I also found the humor pretty good in this. It's not Deadpool so you won't be rolling on the floor but he has a lot of occasional quips and you'll find yourself laughing just as much. There's a particular bit with Yuri I found hilarious and a few other moments that had me cracking up.

In short, Arkham City's story was amazing, but it didn't get me to laugh and cry as I did playing this game.

VILLAINS AND MOVING FORWARD (slight SPOILERS)

They did a fairly good job hiding the villain I'd say. Mr. Negative was not the main antagonist. I expected he wouldn't. Very few good games advertise their lead antagonist that heavily especially when he's not that well known. Just look at Black Mask and Arkham Origins.

With that said, I've always enjoyed villain origin stories because we aren't spoon-fed them every time a piece of media comes out like we are the heroes. It's very entertaining to see the characters you know and seeing their path knowing what their destination will be and as always almost all the characters or at least main villains have a sympathetic side to their story and that's especially true for the main antagonist in this game.

With all that said, they still haven't used two major villains that can be sequels easily because this game will obviously warrant a few. 

(SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS) 

With the sinister six out of the way, I expect the next games villains to feature Venom and Green Goblin in their main ensemble with maybe a few of the six cameoing as bosses especially after them both being teased in the end credits. Also they haven't used Miles Morales for anymore than an after credit scene for now so I'm looking forward to seeing what he does in upcoming games. Hopefully they will also introduce some hero cameos like Web of Shadows had in future games, especially with all the Easter eggs.

Now. Credits are over. If you'll excuse me, Tombstone has just been chilling for like 3 days waiting for Spider-Man to do something and I hate to disappoint.

All in all, game was amazing, one of the best stories I've ever played in a game and one of the best games I've played period 9/10. Highly recommend anyone who doesn't have a PS4, try to play this game somehow.

Looking forward to Spider-Man 2... That feels strange to say...",technology

MachineLearning,[D] Q-Learning works while DQN fails. Any suggestions?,"I have this gridworld problem in which each cell has its own reward. The agent could move up/down, or right/left to get -1 reward. If it chooses to terminate, it would get the reward of that cell, which is number varying from 200 to 250 (good cell), or -50 (bad cell).

I fed in the position on the grid (x,y) and wanted to predict the future reward for each movement taken. For a 70x80 grid, a Q-learning agent learnt how to navigate the grid seamlessly but took a while. When I tried to use neural networks instead of tables, things stopped working.

For my DQN setup, I started with a vanilla DQN that had 2 layers and 200 neurons. I kept increasing the network until I found 4X1000 was a good setup. The network still failed, so I introduced double DQN, dueling architecture, PER, and some form of curriculum learning that does not allow the agent to learn from predictions that are greater than 260. The network still does not perform any better than random behavior after 2M training steps. Any suggestions on what I might be doing wrong, or if someone had a similar experience?

Edit: There is a relationship between the input position and the reward output. Across the x axis the values are the same, and across the y axis the values increase nonlinearly.

Edit 2: my update rule is: Q(s,a) = r + max(Q(s',a')) in which gamma is 1 and -1 is the reward for each step taken.",technology

6: Long term interest rates are monetary policy of their own type and can change aggregate demand in the economy (proven? during QE)

7: The yield curve does not just have a single neutral rate, but an entire neutral curve (NEW? NOVEL! OMG OMG OMG FREAKOUT?!)

&amp;#x200B;

So you ask: How does it all work? The Fed can reduce aggregate demand by raising either short term or long term interest rates (4). However, this dampens inflation expectations and prevents long term interest rates from rising (5). Therefore I propose letting short-term interest rates stay below the neutral rate for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

But David, wouldn't this lead to extreme inflation???

A: I don't think so! Long term interest rates will adjust upwards alongside higher inflation expectations (5). While this won't stop rising inflation I believe it is a strong self-corrective mechanism - especially if long term interest rates are below the neutral curve (6, 7). 

&amp;#x200B;

To emphasize why I think this is the best course of action lets dive into scenarios we will be making this assumption:

8: All interest rates are below the neutral curve 

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 1: The Fed Raises Interest Rates

Raising short-term interest rates while long term interest rates are still accommodative (below neutral) will prevent long term interest rates from rising (5 - via inflation expectations). This means that long term interest rates will be accomodative, and short term interest rates will be contractionary. Because the two effects end up fighting each other, the Fed is forced to raise short term interest rates even further as they are ineffective in fighting inflation.  This leads to a flat yield curve and recession (BOOM! We figured it out boys!). 

&amp;#x200B;

1a: Raising rates but too slowly

Both the long term rates and short term rates will rise at the same time, making a dangerous combo attack against aggregate demand

&amp;#x200B;

1b: Raising rates but too quickly

Scenario 1 happens but much sooner

&amp;#x200B;

SO. If you're still reading at this point: You're a champion

Every theory would be incomplete without the SPECIAL SAUCE: 

&amp;#x200B;

The Fed needs to get interest rates away from the Zero-Lower Bound (ZLB). But! Remember this now includes both the short and long term rates (7). We end up in these scenarios above

1a: Short term rates away from ZLB, long term rates maintain low

1b: Short term rates away from ZLB, long term rates even lower

&amp;#x200B;

This means in the next recession we will be extremely limited on monetary policy tools - as QE will not be as effective as last time! (Due to ZLB limits on long term rates)

&amp;#x200B;

The only way to ensure rates move away from the Zero Lower Curve is to first raise long term rates above neutral, and then raise short term rates to get the yield curve to equal the neutral yield curve. Therefore: The fed should keep short-rates slightly accommodative until this happens. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Uhhh something something a good argument for keeping rates slightly below neutral for a while

financialindependence,Looking to make a plan to begin my journey,"This is a really long post I went into the FAQ's and it said to copy paste this. So here it is, with as much information as I can give. 

Life Situation: Currently I am a single 24(f). I will be starting graduate school thing month as well as working full time. I live in Washington state. Going to school to be a teacher. 

FIRE Progress: I am absolutely nowhere. I have no idea where to begin but I know my current spending and way of life is not sustainable. I'd really like to get better with my money and eventually have financial Independence. 

Gross Salary/Wages: $37,826

Yearly Savings Amounts: So I have a pension which I am not quite sure what it means. I also contribute to my account each month, yearly it looks like I put in about $1,500 a year of money through my own contributions. I am enrolled in SERS Plan 3. I do not understand this plan I do not understand what I need to do with it. This is something I desperately need help with understanding. 

Other Ordinary Income: Summer employment generally gets me $4k. I also do odd jobs such as babysitting and such and I'd say that adds another $1,500 per year. 

Current expenses: Rent: $730 
Car: $320 
Car Insurance: $140 
Pet Care: $100 
Food: $150 
Gym: $90.00 
Netflix: $13 
Transportation (maintenance, gas, bussing): $75
Medical expenses: $100
Miscellaneous extras take up the rest of my income. I don't save a dime which I would really like to change. 


Assets: Is my car an asset? I have a 2017 Honda Fit. 

Liabilities: 
Car Loan-
        Original amount: $20,269
        Interest rate: 4.24%
        Term: 72 months 
        Loan Payment: $320.15
Student Loans: Currently sitting at $13,115.71 with varying interest rates the highest of the rates is 4.45% lowest is 3.76%. 
I have just accepted $37,098 in student loans for graduate school. $20,500 is at 6.6% and $16,598 is at 7.6%. 
Credit card debt: currently sitting at about 5k due to a bad breakup and it being summer break so I spent a little extravagantly on things that I was eventually going to need. 
        

Specific Question(s): Alright so questions where do I begin? How can I go about setting myself up for my future after grad school? Being a teacher isn't the biggest money generator. Should I be trying to contribute to a Roth? Also, for anyone who might know anything about student loans. I am in a public servant position currently and after 10 years of qualifying payments you can have your loans forgiven. Should I start paying them off now to get a jumpstart on those 10 years? Or if I do that will my grad school loans not be counted in with the forgiveness. Finally, for people who enjoy spending money how did you create and stick to a budget? I am also open to any feedback, I know I have made some pretty poor financial decisions in the last little bit but I'm still young, my credit is good, and I am ready and willing to learn.",finance

When/if I pay that back, do I get any tax benefits from it since it is an education expense or not? I'm not sure how it works since the education was received in a different year than the expense was paid for and it is now technically a loan from the school.

Side note: I am looking into whether I actually fell out of eligibility and can apply federal aid to pay for it. I don't remember withdrawing from classes 2 semesters in a row but that is a different situation. I have already applied for paperwork proving that it was legitimate.

personalfinance,Student Loan alternatives/advice,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a bit of a pickle and looking for some guidance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a senior at a public uni. with less than 2k in debt (mismanaged my accounts my first semester of school and had to take out a subsidized loan. Not paying it back until I graduate because no interest is accruing right now.) I've managed to get an academic full ride. However, my university scholarship requires me to maintain at least 15 credit hours per semester. This university scholarship account for about 40% of my aid.

&amp;#x200B;

I am finishing a nursing degree that is only 12 credit hours per semester, have finished all of my general education requirements, and am now forced to take an extra 3 credits in order to maintain my academic scholarship. I've requested a waiver for my final year to reduce my credit hours to 12/semester without impacting my academic scholarship that was turned down, but an alternative was offered that would cover closer to 30-35% of my financial aid.

&amp;#x200B;

I receive about 4k per semester in a student refund because my scholarships exceed my student bill. Absolutely all of the money goes towards rent, utilities, food, gas, books, and other required nursing items that add up quickly. I occasionally enjoy a night out with my girlfriend (1x/2 weeks or so), but we both take pride on keeping our overhead low and are drawn towards low cost activities like visiting arboretums and such. In short, we are allergic to debt and try to avoid it at all costs (we both come from families with tremendous CC debt).

&amp;#x200B;

Nursing school can be very taxing, so taking a non-required 3 credit course on top of it all can be irking to say the least. My days are long at the hospital clinical hours, so it is hard to find a course that fits into my schedule well. I'm sacrificing sleep and potentially a competitive GPA for grad school to take an unnecessary class. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've crunched the numbers, and my alternative would require me to send back approx. 1k of my refund for the final two semesters if I dropped to 12 credits, leaving me with approx. 3k of expenses. Without breaking down absolutely every cost for you, I am left with about 150$ weekly after rent and utilities. That's an extremely tight budget when factoring in gas (1 hour commute to hospital clinicals), food, and nursing expenses that often come out of left field. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... my two options are to tough it out and maintain my 15 credit hour schedule or borrow money. I am not qualified to take out a subsidized loan because I receive a student refund, and taking out any loan at all may effect the private scholarships I get, as their are certain stipulations regarding them being disbursed to me if I am also getting loans. It gets really tricky, and it's not exactly monitored... like at all... but it is something that I am expected to report to my private scholarship committee. I don't exactly want to walk that line of not being 100% transparent especially when it comes to federally regulated aid (even though its private).

&amp;#x200B;

There are two more options, however. I have managed to put a good chunk of money i've earned thru summers away into long-term investment accounts (approx. 4k) and its not exactly easy to liquidate it. I really really really don't want to have to let go of these investments because of what I think they can return in the next 7-10 years... 

&amp;#x200B;

... So my last option it to talk with my brother and request that he lend me the money I think I will need. He is pretty well-off and has mainly provided for me financially, but after going off to college I began assuming responsibility over myself. My parents don't really have much to offer at the moment. I am just nervous of asking my brother for the money. It's likely that he'll gift me the money without any expectation of return, however, a part of me feels guilt from the fact that I have all of this money squared away in investments but I'm now asking for handouts. A majority of that 4k investment was made this summer, and I don't think I would have made it knowing that balancing my nursing classes by themselves would be difficult, let alone with another 3 credit class that takes up my time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked with my sister about it, and she feels that its irresponsible of me to have an investment account while I am now asking for money from my brother. I think it's best for me to ask for the loan, and stick to paying it back regardless of him needing the money or not. I know a couple grand over the next couple of semesters is pennies to him, but the principle of it is important.

financialindependence,"FedFIRE, or, How a US Foreign Service Officer Can Retire at 50","Hey, yinz...long-time lurker, first-time poster, but I thought you might like to hear about my sort-of alternative path to FIRE.  FedFIRE!

Prepare yourself for one heckuva ramble.

**A little background…**

For those who are interested, I’ve posted two extensive “Ask Me Anythings” 7 and 4 years ago look at the posts I’ve submitted, I’m not active in this username otherwise).  I am an edge-case, in that both my wife and I work as Foreign Service Officers (FSOs), which referred to as being a tandem couple.  As such, we have not spent *all* of our careers overseas.  In the end, I do believe we will come out ahead, as we’ve made the “sacrifice” to work in the DC region when both of us can’t get jobs in the same embassy.  This has basically meant we passed up one 3-year tour (so far) in order to keep us both working at full-salary.  We have friends and colleagues who are also tandem couple who have chosen *not* to do this.  They invariably choose to go to low-cost of living (LCOL) posts, so one salary can take them much further.

**The Perks of Being a ~~Wallflower~~ FSO**

So, FedFIRE?  Well, if you’re a federal employee, there are a couple of ways to retire early, and plenty of routes to financial independence, but I happen to be in the unusual (in a good way) position of being able to retire as early as 50 under the Foreign Service (Dept. of State, if unclear).

This special retirement provision applies to State, federal law enforcement, and I think a few other random federal jobs (maybe nuclear inspectors...I’ve never been able to get a clear answer).  If you have 20+ years of service *and* you’re 50, you can retire with a “pension” of 1.7% times your years of service.  The actual value of your pension is based off the average of your three highest annual salaries.  For each year worked *after* 20 years, you only get an additional 1% (not 1.7%).  You can also draw down your TSP / 401k with *no* penalty.  This is basically known as FERS Special (or Special FERS, if you nasty).

To keep the numbers simple, if someone with an average high-3 salary of $100,000 retired exactly at 50 with exactly 20 years of service, they’d get (1.7 x 20) 34% of $100,000 — $34,000 a year, paid out monthly.  To further clarify, if you worked 21 years, you get 35%, not 35.7%.  The government *does* provide COLA (cost of living adjustments)...most of the time, and there is a formula they use to keep it in line with (but technically less than) inflation.  

Additionally, because you can retire early, you also get supplemental payments to make up for Social Security eligibility until age 62 (this supplement gets diminished / goes away if you earn wages in excess of about $15,000, so careful with that side-hustle, I guess).  The supplement is calculated by taking your years of service divided by 40 times your estimated minimum social security payment.  At 50 years, this would be in the $1000-$1300 range for most people.  So, without saving a dime, the hypothetical $100,000 foreign service officer can pull down $46,000 a year.  To be clear, we are fully eligible for social security from the minimum age onward, so that income would technically increase even if taken immediately at 62.

Now we have the other leg, TSP...the government’s 401k.  Most government agencies match up to 5%, and with 20 years of service, it’s entirely reasonable (at full IRS limits) to put away $400,000, assuming minimal to no growth.  A 4% SWR gives you about $1300 a month, or $15,500 a year.

So, boom, over $61,000 of income a year.

Then there’s healthcare...which you get to keep after retirement, and the government still pays their share.  I considered this to be *the* key element of my retirement, as it diminishes an otherwise significant expense.  Finally, you also can maintain your life / disability insurance at a discount (though most reduce the coverage).

Oh, and by the way, my wife gets the same benefits (humble brag).

So, boom x 2, over $122,000 per year, assuming we both only make $100k as our high-3 salaries (we actually have made more due to occasional warzone compensation and such), and our TSP accounts have been doing much better.  Pretty darned sweet.

**Fallout 3: The Realities of Living in the DC Wasteland**

It is not all wine and roses (well, there *always* wine...and liquor, and beer), but not all roses, at least.

When I started in the federal government, and not as an FSO, my salary was about $28,000...GS-07 in the early 2000s, for those wondering.  I worked my way up in my career and made some not-great financial decisions like taking on too much student debt, and buying a condo/townhome at the absolute height of the market pre-housing crisis — an ARM too.

Additionally, and this pains me to this day...I was advised by my HR in my first government job to cash out my TSP because I was going back to grad school and I only had a couple thousand in the account. Boo!

Even so, my career hasn’t been $100k+ a year since day one, but a steady slog of promotions, cost-of-living adjustments, and time-in-grade increases.  I *haven’t* been able to contribute the IRS max to my TSP for my entire career, though I have taken advantage of max employer matching since entering federal service.

Both my wife and I had student loans, and they are now paid off in our early 40s.

We *still* own our underwater condo/townhome, though we are renting it out.  Within six months of buying the property, we were almost $100k underwater.  This has never recovered, and the neighborhood has gone downhill due to multiple foreclosures and short-sales over the past decade.  We have taken a loss on this property, rent-wise, every time we rented it out while overseas (though only a couple hundred a month, so 90%+ of the mortgage was covered.  This isn’t *so* dire, because while overseas, your housing in the host country is paid for, so it was kind of like maintaining a $200 mortgage for X number of years.  We intend to sell the townhome next summer once our tenants’ lease is up, likely at a break-even point.

From a real estate perspective, this property has kicked our butts, as the ARM was okay for a few years, but now with rising rates, the rental loss is going up every year, especially as HOA fees have risen with no improvement in services.  Contrary to what many claim, it is entirely possible to not “win” in real estate in Northern Virginia (and no, I’m not discounting the reality of the ARM or the housing crisis).  I would not have predicted the neighborhood we were in to turn to low-income in less than five years, but it did.  To be clear, the neighborhood is still perfectly safe, as ethnically diverse as it ever was, but the schools went downhill due to the tax base, and the property values never recovered post-crash.  We have a secondary e-fund set up to cover paying the mortgage for up to a year, in the event it doesn’t sell in the first few months.  By that point, we might consider refinancing (assuming we have enough equity to satisfy investment property re-fi requirements), and renting it out again (though I *really* loathe being a landlord).

Living in the DC region as a whole is expensive and difficult...groceries, commutes, high cost of living for everything else.  This isn’t uncommon for *any* metro area, but it’s a constant reminder of what we’re missing overseas.  We made a decision to move farther out into Loudoun County and bought a second giant house (cliche), but now we have a kid, and we expect to be a multi-generational family, with (hopefully) grandparents moving in very soon.  We want this for the kid, and difference in mortgage between our crappy townhome and the new place is only $900, but a difference of 1200 to 4200 sq ft (I imagine some people choking at this on this sub!).  We also moved strategically within a few miles of the future Ashburn and Dulles metro stations, but for now the commutes are an hour-plus via bus.  That said, our property values have increased by 10%+ over the past year, and the metro won’t even be here for two years or so, so we’re doing waaay better than our last attempt at real estate (and to be honest, if it never went up, I’d still be totally cool with that).

We would like to go overseas at least one more time, though the realities of grandparents in their late 60s / early 70s and a kindergarten-aged child mean we need to be very strategic about that.  We took the kid with us to our last post in Brussels, but they don’t remember any of it, as they were 1.5 to 4.5 during that time frame (the kid spoke French first, but doesn’t remember a word now that we’ve been back for a year).

Regardless, we have planned for the “worst” case (really not *that* bad, just not ideal) of continuing to live and work in the DC-region until retirement eligibility as early as 7 years from now.

**What RE means to ME**

Okay, so here’s some real numbers…

We are 42 and 43.

Kid is 5.

Our expenses are $90k a year.  (Shock!  Horror!)  This includes a rental property (and associated expenses) losing us money *and* childcare (technically *also* losing us money...darned unemployed 5 year old!), which is about 18% of that total.  Both of these expenses will go away before retirement.

Our only liabilities are a $500k mortgage (new house) and the remaining $250k mortgage on old townhome.  That seems like a lot of money, but not really for NoVA.  We got rid of student loans, cars are paid off, and have no credit card debt.

We have about $600k in our TSP.  Assuming literally no growth, just base contributions, we will have $900k by the earlier eligible retirement date.

We have about $100k in stock investments.  We contribute about $10k a year to that, so, again, assuming no growth, about $170k by minimum retirement.  I view this as the kid’s college fund, assuming they want to go to college, or college exists in its current form.

Running out the retirement benefits, our pensions alone will cover 90% of our current expenses.  The social security “supplement” will cover the rest with room to spare.  This ignores drawing down on the TSP funds.

Our annual pre-tax income would be about $140,000.  After taxes (effectively in the high teens, likely), probably about $118,000.  That leaves us with about $2300 of “whatever” money per month.  This is all based on current salary, no expectation of real retirement fund growth, and the assumption of our current expenses of $90k.

**Man Plans and Spouse Laughs**

“You want to retire at *fifty*?  You’re crazy.  The kid will be 13!  What will you do?  We can’t afford that!”

Technically, in the government, there’s no real “FU” money point.  I mean, even if I had a significant windfall (let’s say $1 million, though I have no wealthy relatives), I would not give up my pension or health care.  I *will* work until at least 50...I kind of want to, so I have that going for me.  That said, I’m technically eligible to retire *before* then, I just wouldn’t be able to collect a pension or anything until 50.

I am in the slow and steady process of convincing my wife that the numbers associated with our finances are, you know, *real*.  She handles the budget (daily expenses), but I handle the big picture / retirement.  Other than an actual 4% SWR, my numbers are crazy conservative.  I assume *no* gains in any of our current accounts.  I’m not Warren Buffett (or Jimmy, for that matter), but even if all our money was just in the G Fund under the TSP, we’d be guaranteed bond-level rates of returns.  In reality, the bulk of our money is in the C, S, and I Funds (Large Cap, Small Cap, and International stocks).

My plans include leaving NoVA, possibly to the Carolinas, Georgia, or Florida near (but not on) the beach to a single-level, single-family home.  I’ve been watching a lot of *Island Life* on HGTV, and it is probably detrimental…  ;)

The going rate for these places right now is anywhere from $200-400k, which seems crazy cheap to me coming from DC area (we’d be able to buy in cash if we wanted).  We plan to spend about 90 days (max no-visa required in most countries) a year overseas in short-term rentals, maybe not every year, but close to it in the first decade or so.  We’ve traveled a ton, so our vision is basically enjoying the day-to-day life overseas without having the hassle of real ex-pat issues (having worked American Citizen Services, I have no desire for the type of troubles real ex-pats run into).

**Random Considerations, Questions, and Miscellania**

* If we retire at 50-ish the kid will still be in middle school / high school.  Should we move to warmer climes at that point or stick it out until graduation (could still be retired, just living in crappy NoVA)?

* We don’t *have* to retire at 50, but there is max date in FERS Special.  There is *some* flexibility in the event the market goes kablooey (sorry for using technical terms).

* Retiring *before* the kid is in college means we can’t sneak her in the back door at State (or not as easily).  Passing up a possible “easy” career entry for the kid is significant concern (for me, at least; who knows, the kid may be a libertarian and hate the government / civil society).  First world problems, I guess.

**EDIT EDIT EDIT**  There is no backdoor to be an FSO.  Did not mean to imply it.  There are internal nominations for civil service and internships, though.  **END EDIT**

* People talk about “side-hustles”, but I have no freaking clue if there’s something I want to do.  I can’t really blog about State stuff, which seems to be the default thing, but I really do need to spend some time thinking about *what* real retirement would look like.

**What Motivates You to Be a Lazy Bum?**

Why retire so early, when the life of a diplomat is so totes awesome?  It is and it isn’t.  My wife and I both had an involuntary “come to Jesus” (the hard way) moment during the metro bombing in Brussels.  I had just exited the metro in Arts-Loi  and was entering the US Embassy when the bomb went off.  My wife was exiting at Schumann.  These stops are at either side of the Maelbeek explosion.  If I hadn’t skipped a coffee that morning and my wife hadn't had an appointment at the EU, well…my username is unintentionally ironic.  

The thing is, I’ve been shot at in a warzone, been in a pretty bad car accident, was accidentally driven into a minefield (got out safely, though), all with work, but you don’t expect this stuff in the “easy” posts.  The things that seemed “part of the job” a few years ago don’t necessarily seem worth it these days.  A good friend of mine lost his arm a month ago to infection while serving in Africa.  It was from a scratch, not a severe injury.  Another colleague of mine was stabbed repeatedly in Latin America for trying to escape an extortionate cab driver.  Dead now.  A classmate of mine from my early FSO training was assaulted when she decided to come home early from work and walked in on her house being burglarized.  She was beat up, but otherwise okay.

personalfinance,First Job - Cannot figure out how much my employer is matching my 401K contributions?,"I recently got hired at a very large company in the US. This is my first job straight out of undergrad. I've never enrolled in 401K retirement plan and I've read the FAQ's on this subreddit but I can't seem to understand how much my employer will match.

&amp;#x200B;

On the Company 401K Highlights Handbook, it says:   

&gt;**YOUR EMPLOYERS CONTRIBUTIONS**   
&gt;  
&gt;The employer may make contributions to your account; this amount may vary from year to year.   
&gt;  
&gt;In 2018, federal tax law allows employee and employer contributions up to a combined total of $55,000 or 100% of compensation, whichever is less.   
&gt;  
&gt;You can direct employer contributions to any investment in your plan.   
&gt;  
&gt;**WHAT IS VESTING?**   
&gt;  
&gt;""Vesting"" refers to your ownership of the money in your account. You are always 100% vested in your own contributions, but it may take longer to become vested in your employer’s contributions. Refer to the vesting schedule for details about your employer contributions.   
&gt;  
&gt;The vesting schedule below applies to the following source:   
&gt;  
&gt;COMPANY MATCH 

You will be vested in your employer contributions based on the following vesting schedule: 

|Years of Service|Percentage Vested|
|:-|:-|
|After 2 Years|20%|
|After 3 Years|40%|
|After 4 Years|60%|
|After 5 Years|100%|

&amp;#x200B;

In the Salary Savings Plan Handbook, it says:



&gt;**EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS**   
&gt;  
&gt;**Matching Contributions**   
&gt;  
&gt;Once you have met the requirements to participate in the Plan with respect to Matching Contributions, as described in **ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE: ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS** above, you may receive Matching Contributions for a Plan Year only if you are employed as a Covered Employee on the last day of the Plan Year.   
&gt;  
&gt;If you are eligible, each Plan Year your Employer, in its discretion, may make a Matching Contribution to your Account equal to a percentage, determined by your Employer, of your 401(k) Contributions to the Plan for the Plan Year.   
&gt;  
&gt;Your Employer will match your Catch-Up 401(k) Contributions to the Plan. 

And the rest is the same Vesting Schedule explained above.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I just illiterate and it's right there in the writing or do I have to contact HR to explain?

&amp;#x200B;

Another question: In the Company 401K Highlights Handbook it also gives me 30 different investment options. Are these types of 401K Investment options or just other options that the company can provide as well?

personalfinance,Recently graduated - I want to pay off my debt,"Hi there guys! Thanks in advance for any advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've just graduated and got a new job at an investment firm. I make around $40K/year. I want to figure out the best way to pay off any debt that I have. I'm in the grace period for my student loans until November.  I allocate 5% of my pay to savings, 5% to a money market fund/Roth IRA, and 10% to charity. I pay \~$50/mo for medical/dental/vision through an employer plan and they take 4% out of my pay towards a Roth 401(k). I'm over my credit limit for both cards but haven't made any purchases in over 2 months. Never miss a payment on anything. It's hard to get back to my credit limit because the monthly interest charges are taking up most of my minimum payment amount. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Monthly Pay: \~$2,200*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Monthly Expenses: \~$1,400*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Savings: $2,100*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Debt***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Phone: $460 at 0%*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Car Loan - $4,200 at 3.24%*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Credit Card 1: $4,300 at 20.74%*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Credit Card 2: $2,865 at 21.74%*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Student Loan: $22,000*

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my current plan of paying it all off: 

1. Freeze my credit cards to stop me from making any purchases.
2. Use Homebudget to track my spending.
3. Use any bonuses or additional income towards paying off my credit cards first. 
4. I'm considering a second job as an Amazon Flex or Lyft driver to further pay it off. Would this be a good idea? What other lines of work would you suggest in addition to a full-time job? 
5. The credit card interest rates are *killing* me. My credit score keeps going down and interest rates going slightly up. I have no interest in getting another credit card to transfer the balance, but I'm considering a personal loan company like Avant, Upstart, etc. to pay off my credit cards and get a better interest rate. What do you think? Is this a good idea?

personalfinance,Large amount of CC debt. What can I do to qualify for a personal loan or balance transfer?,"I own a house with a mortgage in State A and moved to State B for graduate school. It took some time for my husband to find a job in state B, so we had to pay both a mortgage, rent, and utilities for both places for a while, and ended up with a lot of credit card debt. After he got a job here, we then needed to spend a lot of money to renovate the house in order to rent it out. As our utilization was already high at this point, we didn't manage to qualify for additional credit, so we had to increase our utilization even higher. 

The good news is that we now have a tenant and more than enough income to cover our daily expenses. The problem is that we now have a lot of credit card debt. Our combined CC debt is about $50k, with some of this being in my name only, some of it in his name only, and some joint. A lot of our cards have low limits, so this debt is currently scattered on 18 different cards, which are all basically maxed out. About $20k of this debt is on cards with an interest rate above 20%! I also have one CC with a zero balance and a $5500 limit. 

We are currently able to pay the minimum on everything plus several hundred extra, which we are throwing at the highest interest debt. The problem is that we are paying so much in interest that we are barely making any progress on the principal! I'm also particularly concerned that about $15k of this is on cards that have promotional rates that end in the spring or early summer.

We really want to be able to get a personal loan with a decent rate (at this point that is anything below 20%) or a balance transfer offer, but due to my high utilization, my credit score is in the low 600s. This is basically only due to the utilization--my last late payment was five years ago. My husband's credit score is similar. 

In particular, I will be getting a lump sum payment of $8k in January, and it would be great if we can qualify for a balance transfer or personal loan. Would it be more helpful in terms of credit score to pay off some of the low balance cards completely (and add the other spouse as an authorized user if not one already), or to just keep doing what we are doing and pay down the highest interest ones?

Alternatively, does anyone know of lenders who will lend to people with high utilization but a strong history of on-time payments?",finance

personalfinance,Aetna HealthFund HDHP with HSA -- Questions about 2018 contributions and type of HSA used.,"I had a few questions about the federal employee HDHP plan by Aetna.

* What HSA account is used?

I could not find this anywhere and maybe I was not looking in the right location... Does Aetna require the use of a specific HSA account or do you bring your own HSA account to the plan and give them the information so they can deposit their $62.50 monthly into the account? I want to know this so I can research the required HSA or research a good one that I can bring to the plan. For that matter, if anyone here has recommendations on an HSA to bring to this plan, I am all ears.

* If I transfer to this health insurance in the second week of December 2018, can I somehow maximize my contribution for 2018? If so, how do I go about calculating and doing this?

I read up a bit on this and it seems like as long as I am eligible for my HSA through 2019, I can make the contribution for 2018. However I do not know how to calculate how much I should contribute. Wouldn't Aetna be contributing 62.50 in December of 2018? So I would have to take this into consideration right? I will be honest, this process is very confusing to me, so a thorough run through of this process would be helpful for me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It would be awesome if a current federal employee or someone using this plan could chime in.

personalfinance,When should I try to refinance my auto loan?,"The extremely long story short is that I was desperate, basically had no credit score, and made every mistake in the book when it comes to buying a new car.

I now have a better income, my credit score is 720+, but I only have 9 months worth of car credit history.

I got pre-approved through Navy Fed and got a great deal on a new car (20k out the door on a 28k MSRP) so I figured why not.  I make 85k currently (65k salary plus ~20k tax free from the VA) so affordability is not an issue.

My problem is that I am (was?) gearing up to buy a house this Spring using a VA loan.  I timed my new apartment lease to end at the end of my son's current school year/have already talked to the bank about timelines/when to apply for the mortgage/etc...I knew adding a loan would temporarily hit my credit and even asked the bank *before* I applied for the loan how it would impact my score and they said usually it drops 20, maaaaybe 30 points so I went ahead and got the loan.

Now I used Navy Fed's credit tool and got my FICO9 score and it's 578 down from 661 immediately before the loan.  My concern is that now it won't recover in time to qualify for the mortgage.  My recent credit history is perfect (student loans, low limit CC that gets paid off after each use and now a car loan) but my more distant history is garbage (3 or 4 negatives that drop off next year, plus 1 that is NOT me from 2015 but despite it not being me, credit reports claim the dispute was finished and debt is valid.  I haven't opened any new lines since 2012 and was in school in 2015).

personalfinance,"Signed a student loan with a private bank when I was 18, need advice with refinancing","I currently have about 60k in student loans, 22 of which is with a terrible bank that rhymes with Ballie Hae. It turns out, what I signed for when I was 18 was a variable interest rate. Rates started at 9%, and have slowly crept up to 12% over the past couple years. The rest are with government loans which I am less worried about, as they have much lower interest rates and flexible financing options. 

&amp;#x200B;

I currently only make around 20k a year (possible pay increase with new job soon), so every student loan payment is costing me almost an entire paycheck, over half of which is purely interest (\~220 on interest alone). And interest rate keeps on rising to the point I won't even finish paying down by the loan agreement period of 12 years. I can't even think of getting started on the government loans until I get these private loans under control.

&amp;#x200B;

I have spoken with a credit union that said neither my income nor my credit (I have great credit, funnily enough) is an issue, but that I don't have sufficient collateral to justify the unsecured funds.  I have heard of banks like Citizens Bank or SoFi that offer refinancing options.  I also have a friend that may be willing to cosign if I get the better paying job and find someone legitimate willing to refinance, but I am a bit nervous to go signing anymore contracts without being fully informed. My current bank does not offer student loan refinancing.

The options are: 

Pay down the principle of the above mentioned rental property.  Its a 30 year 4% loan about 3 years in. 

Pay down the loan on our travel trailer. 10 year ~5% loan, 1 year in

Pay down my car payment.  3 years left, 3.3% APR. 

Pay down the principle our duplex (currently living in 1/2 and renting the other) and thus reduce our mortgage payment. 30 year @ 4.25%, less than 1 year in. 

Pay down my partner's CC debt (we are not married but own the property equally/jointly).  Varying interest rates from 8-15% (estimating here).

Piggy-banks should be interactive, useful and safe — which is why we made a piggy-wallet instead of just another “digital piggy-bank”.

1. Future-proofing financial education  
People teach their children about finance, earning, saving, modelling and spending, a few cents and dollars at a time , something normally done with physical money and 1 pocket change. Our ambition is to establish a new standard in financial education for children, and a system designed not only to survive the demise of physical money, but also to embrace the realities of a rising token economy, thus future-proofing the piggy-bank by combining the best in blockchain technology, digital banking and IoT technology.
2. Empowering families as microfinancing networks  
The financial education of child is, at its core, a micro-financing activity. It begins in early years, with small amounts of physical money drip-fed into a physical receptacle as rewards for good behaviour, and, once accumulated, used to purchase a desired good or service. This usually involves the entire family, making the family by default a micro-financing network. Accelerating cryptocurrency uptake  
It is believe that a generation of children growing up with cryptocurrencies can be an enormously powerful force for change. Pigzbe doesn’t just aim at empowering families and children financially, but also at educating them about modern programmable money. Pigzbe and Wollo also possess the potential to provide unprecedented access to the cryptocurrency ecosystem for entire families.

# **WEEK AHEAD: Tech in trade crosshairs after its worst week since March** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/07/tech-in-cross-hairs-after-its-worst-week-since-march.html)*

* Trade issues and inflation data are the big events for markets in the week ahead, as investors await President Trump's next move on tariffs on China.
* Technology stocks had their worst week since March amid a variety of issues, and some key companies, like Apple and Intel, are warning the government that proposed tariffs will hurt their businesses and consumers.
* CPI inflation data Thursday and PPI Wednesday could be a big focus after a surprise jump in wages in August.

*****

&gt; Technology stocks had their worst week since March, and they could remain in the crosshairs, particularly if the Trump administration unveils new tariffs on China.
*****
&gt; Strategists say inflation and trade are two major themes markets will have to navigate in the week ahead, after August's surprise jump in wage growth and as investors await the next move from Washington on the trade front.
*****
&gt; At any time, President Donald Trump could announce tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, and he threatened Friday that he has plans for tariffs on another $267 billion ready to go. A late Friday afternoon news report that Apple warned the government that many of its products would be affected by tariffs hit that stock and sent ripples across the tech sector.
*****
&gt; The market Friday was already weak as investors considered the prospect of higher inflation. Average hourly wages, up nearly 2.9 percent, put markets on notice that more normal income growth — and therefore inflation — could be at hand.
*****
&gt; Consistently higher inflation could help reinforce the Fed's rate-hiking plans, and markets will be particularly alert to both producer and consumer inflation reports in the week ahead. ""I think it kind of reminds the markets that we could very quickly get back to February in a hurry, in the sense we've had this calm period here where inflation was dormant,"" said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group.
*****
&gt; The Apple report came at the end of a bad week for technology, with the S&amp;P sector down nearly 3 percent. First, there was the specter of more regulation for social media stocks and Google, as Facebook and Twitter executives testified before Congress Wednesday. On Thursday, chip stocks were hit by signs of a slowdown in orders, which some analysts blamed in part on trade. The chip selloff also raised concerns for the sector as a whole, since chip weakness is sometimes seen as an early warning for computer makers and others.
*****
&gt; ""To me, it's the piling on of information coming out of the technology sector,"" said Paulsen. ""It's something that everyone owns. It's been leading the stock market for the last three years and it's going to make you [wonder] through the weekend [whether] that's ending…People did think Apple was immune from this.""
*****
&gt; Apple, in a letter to the government, said the tariffs could result in higher prices for consumers and slower U.S. growth. It said products from the Apple Watch to MacMini would be affected by the proposed tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. But there could also be positives for Apple in the week ahead, since it is unveiling new iPhone models and other products Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Other tech companies also warned the U.S. Trade Representative that the tariffs would have negative consequences, in reports after Friday's close. Agilent said the duties would financially impede its U.S. operations and end customers in the U.S. Intel said they would hurt advancements in telecommunications infrastructure, including next generation technologies, like 5G. Dell said tariffs, including on computer parts and switches, could do ""serious damage"" to the company and its employees.

# Typical September Trading: Another Historically Challenging Month

&gt; Although August is the worst month of the year for the market since 1987 (recent 31-year period), September is the worst month going back to 1950 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500. It is also the worst month for NASDAQ since 1971 and the worst for Russell 1000 and 2000 since 1979. Looking at the full month of September one day at a time, just before mid-month has offered the bulls the best opportunity with the chart exhibiting strength from around the close of the sixth trading day to the close of the thirteenth trading day. The tenth and twelfth trading days briefly interrupt the trend. After this stretch, the final third of the month is generally weak with all five indexes quickly surrendering earlier month gains.

# Why the S&amp;P 500 Monthly Win Streak Could Have Bulls Smiling

&gt; After gaining 19.4% last year, the S&amp;P 500 is once again surging in 2018—up nearly 8.0%, with the Nasdaq 14.8% and Russell 2000 11.7% up even more as of 09/06/18. Could there be even more gains in store over the coming year? We think so.

&gt; With a 14-year high in manufacturing, consumer spending at its best pace in four years, contained inflation, and 20% earnings expected in 2018 and another 10% next year, the economy continues to be in very solid shape. Not to mention the S&amp;P 500 recently broke out to new all-time highs for the first time in nearly seven months, which historically has been followed by stronger than average returns in the coming year.

&gt; One more thing: A little-followed event just took place that has a solid track record for indicating potentially continued equity strength.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 just closed higher for the fifth consecutive month in August. Well, would you believe that the past 25 times that has happened, it was higher a year later 24 of those times?” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, a five-month win streak may be a great signal for continued strength. Take note that this time last year, the S&amp;P 500 was up five months in a row and many were concerned it had gone “too far too fast.” Twelve months later, it had added another 17.4%.

personalfinance,"Planning on buying a new car valued about 21-19k, if I place half a downpayment would it be better ?","Reason being a lot of people have told me to don’t do it. That you will not end up saving money. “ They will still get you in high interests.” I’m thinking of either putting down 11,000$ so I’ll just finance about 9,000$. 

Planning on doing a 48 m payment and worse case I’ll pay 5% interest rate. Which would be make monthly payments should be about 207.26 a month. I’ll just pay about 948$ in interest. This is my first time buying a car. 

I did my car and finance research already. However, I’m I understanding the process correctly, of how financing automobiles work? Would I be able to put half a down payment and expect to pay in 4 years with the most being 5% interest rate ? Or does the dealership set up the guidelines? 

Planning on buying my car at a Honda dealership.

Thank you for any advice",finance
BlockChain,Pharmaceutical Drugs and the Blockchain: Ensuring the Drugs you need are the Drugs you get.,"From HIPAA Regulations to the seemingly endless maze that is health insurance and health savings, the healthcare industry in America is filled with processes, forms, and procedures that can seem confusing and arbitrary to medical professionals and patients alike. As people grow older, require medical attention, and relocate, the dynamic nature of their health and insurance records leads many toward feelings of doubt and insecurity. Furthermore, as patients are required to remember the aspects of their medical records when moving to new doctors there are often key attributes and pieces of information that can be lost or forgotten — leading to lesser overall quality of care. While these issues, whose origins can implicate everyone from the government to the patients themselves, may seem innate and unrepairable, new and developing technologies — and more specifically, Blockchain technology — may be the solution.

While many of you have probably heard of “The Blockchain” about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Ripple, Blockchain technology is wondrously powerful and immensely beneficial for many industries — including healthcare. A Blockchain is a distributed, append-only, ledger in which immutable (unchangeable) data can be stored and audited. Although this ledger can be ‘changed’, nothing that is put on it will ever disappear. Furthermore, since the ledger is distributed amongst all the peers (nodes) on the network, the ledger can never be taken down, ‘hacked’, or censored. In addition — since I know many of you (especially those of you who are familiar with HIPAA law) are already wondering — the ledger can be completely private and the information on the ledger is not readable unless access is granted, as such, it’s perfect for the long-term storage, transportation, and versioning of healthcare information.

One major aspect of the healthcare industry that the Blockchain can improve is the supply chain of pharmaceuticals. [Title II of DQSA, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugIntegrityandSupplyChainSecurity/DrugSupplyChainSecurityAct/ucm376829.htm) which was enacted by Congress on November 27, 2013, outlines steps to build an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. In an interview on this subject, Dr. Ilisa Bernstein, the Deputy Director of the Office of Compliance at the Federal Drug Administration, stated that one of the major challenges of establishing an electronic system for the identification and tracking of the distribution of prescription drugs is the rapid and highly accurate verification of individual drug packages as they are transported throughout the nation. As drug legitimacy is a major issue that the FDA faces, the need for a system that can identify legitimate packages from counterfeit packages and track their movements throughout the entire supply chain is immense.

In an ideal world, consumers wouldn’t have to worry about whether the prescription drugs they were taking were counterfeited or not. However, when so much trust and money is put into the hands of human beings, rather than carefully calibrated, unbiased, computers, one would be foolish to think no illicit activity was taking place. With the implementation of Blockchain technology, consumers wouldn’t have to worry — as they could rest assured in the knowledge that every point in the supply chain was carefully tracked and logged and that every bit of information relating to the drugs they’re taking is accurate and legitimate.

Now, I understand that while this may sound fantastic, many people require a little more convincing when it comes to the implementation of new technologies — especially in industries like healthcare and pharmaceuticals. Let’s first map out the general steps a drug goes through:

1. Verification/certification of the manufacturing environment

2. Sourcing of the components that make up the drug

3. Transportation of the original components to the manufacturing environment

4. Manufacturing of the drug

5. Transportation of the drug to the wholesaler

6. Individual packaging of the drugs

7. Distribution of the drug to medical professionals or pharmacies

8. Distribution of the drug to consumers

Throughout the process described above there are many chances for malicious entities to alter, switch, or steal drugs intended for the end-consumer. Furthermore, while current quality assurance and supply chain accountability processes ensure some level of authenticity and accountability, the trustful nature of these systems still lead to a much larger amount of illicit activity than consumers, medical professionals, and regulatory agencies would like. This epidemic is so wide spread that the Federal Drug Administration established a “Counterfeit Alert Network” with 17 participating organizations currently partnering with the agency. 

Accordingly, through the implementation of blockchain technology, any minor change that is processed by the system could be instantly recognized and flagged. Furthermore, ‘weak links’ in the chain (untrustworthy suppliers, over-prescribing medical professionals, etc.) could be identified and remedied before they cause major societal issues such as illicit drug sale or waves of overdoses like those recently seen in towns of West Virginia.

To conclude, Blockchain technology — which would help lower the amount of HIPAA breaches or violations that occur every year and could help slow or even stop the opioid epidemic plaguing our nation — is a system that can be quickly and easily implemented into the pharmaceutical supply chain process as well as countless other aspects and niches of the healthcare industry. Gone is the world of confusion and misguided trust.

economy,Long term stock market indicators- weird. (x/post r/stockmarket),"So many indicators are at/near record highs.

CAPE is 31, but still somewhat artificially high due to great recession.

Investor allocation to stocks (possibly most accurate indicator ever) is way high.

S&amp;P Price to Sales is 50% higher than long term mean.

Market Cap to GDP (Buffet's favorite) is 50-100% higher than mean depending on whether you detrend it.

*But here's the thing...the original and most commonly considered indicator, good old 1 year forward S&amp;P PE, is quite reasonable at 17.3*

One other hugely important note is that profit margin ratios are double long term mean....which is jaw dropping to me. But before I just consider that a for-sure indicator of a big drop, I also consider what some big name pointed out (Grantham?) that high margins may be a thing of future due to many tech stocks having giant margins, and their growing cap influencing margin of overall market.

The point is- I don't even know what the point is.

Yeah, I didn't mention interest rates- they will go up and hurt stocks since stocks returns must compete which will shrink multiples, and interest costs to corporations.

Just venting...no opinion on where things going. I'm at 30% stock now and obviously annoyed I wasn't higher for last year.",finance

personalfinance,Bought a Used Car and was charged 4000 dollars more than the listed price,"Hey everyone, yesterday I bought a 2010 Ford Taurus SEL, The vehicle was listed on their website for 8.6 thousand dollars which was affordable for me. I went in, drove it around, and loved it, and so I started to go through the paperwork. This was my first time ever buying a vehicle and I definitely got screwed.

&amp;#x200B;

He gave me a paper with the cost of the vehicle and it said 12,250 dollars. I told him that wasnt right and it was listed for 8600 on the website and he responded, ""The reason it says 12,250 is because of the interest and the fees being added to the listed price"". This made sense as I was taking out a loan for it and put 3000 down. (I think it made sense). So i continued through the paperwork and they had me sign some papers digitally and on of the papers I saw that with interest i was paying 21,000 dollars for this car, so I once again asked him why the price of the car was 12,000 dollars and he told me, ""8600 Dollars is for the walkin cash people. Because you're financing, the bank is going to sell you the car for what it wants to sell it for""

&amp;#x200B;

I believed him stupidly, soooo stupidly, I was desperate for a car because mine broke down earlier yesterday and I needed something to get to work. As it turns out, they charged me 4000 dollars more for the vehicle than the listed price, they charged me 2000 dollars for a warranty while telling me it was free. They stuck me with a 23% interest rate with a 650 Credit Score, and said it's because i've never taken a loan out before.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I made the deal regardless of the red flags is because they gave me 1500 dollars for a truck that didn't even work, nor would ever work or sell. They told me that they would hook me up with a 14 week plan, make weekly payments of 90 dollars each for 14 weeks, so that at the end of the 14 weeks I'll be able to refinance for much lower interest rate, and they told me everyone who had done this it worked out for. So I figured I could stick out the 400 dollar a month payments for 3.5 months and then be alright afterwards. But I'm realizing that if they straight up added 4000 dollars to the price of the car, and lied to my face about it, im royally fucked. Is there anythign I can do to get out of this deal, anything please.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Forgot to say I'm in Michigan

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: Is it at all possible for me to pay off the complete principal before any interest accrues, or am I stuck paying the interest first?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 3: I'll be going in to the dealership in a few hours, I found a few errors on the contract, the salesperson signed a paper that said I was financing for 2 different amounts, and also they gave me documents that had different monthly payment amounts. I'm hoping I can use this to void the contract. If not I'm just going to tell them I do not want the car and hope for the best. I'll let you all know what happens later tonight.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 4: after talking to them for about an hour we’ve all agreed that I will come in tomorrow and talk to the owner because they themselves can’t unwind the deal, hopefully the owner will see that his GM is an asshole and let me out of it!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 5: I forgot to mention, I confronted the salesman about selling me the vehicle for 12250 dollars instead of the advertised 8600. He told me, ""12,250 dollars is what Credit Acceptance wants to charge you for the car, I dont decide that number, it's how they make their money."" I told him that he was lying to my face because they make their money off of the interest of the loan. Why would they give me a loan for 4000 dollars more than I needed.

They also have not even asked me for the down payment yet. And also said that the warranty is required for me to have by Credit Acceptance.


FINAL EDIT: thank you all for your help! I went in today and the owner told me he doesn’t want any bad blood and so he’s unwinding the deal!",finance

I’ve so far been on time while paying extra for interest - I have a good standing with Navy Federal, but my personal credit score is being rebuilt after some seriously stupid decisions to co-sign a lease agreement with someone I shouldn’t have - leading to collections, etc.  I’m currently sitting right under 600. 

What are my options before I make any decisions regarding the car? 

Although my situation is completely shitty, I do have the option of prolonging my living situation a few more months to save up enough to have about 3-4 months payments on hand before I find another source of income. 

What kind of damage is done to your lending and credit history when you give up on a loan? What is the best option?

Thank you- and again I’ll delete if this is an answer I can find somewhere else.",finance
personalfinance,"Stocks through Computershare, how to move them with lowest tax consequences","I have tried searching through the other posts on this, but cannot specifically find what I am wondering. I was gifted stocks in Eversource through Computershare about 6 years ago at this point. As I only recently started to take an interest in my financial future, I did not have dividend reinvestment turned on all that time (its killing me thinking about how much more money I could have made, oh well). I have been trying to figure out the best thing to do with this money. My husband and I have student loans with interest rates ranging from 6.55% to 3.98%, which we are working on paying down via the ""debt avalanche"" method. I was struggling to figure out any possible ""gains"" on the stocks now that I have turned on dividend reinvestment, and whether it would be more worthwhile to put it towards the student loans, even with the taxes we will pay on them. The calculations were getting a little beyond me (we are in the 24% tax bracket, although I think these would be taxed as long-term capital gains). 

Another option would be to sell the stocks and get invested in some low index funds through Vanguard. We are already currently maxing out retirement options (401K employee match, and two Roth IRAs). My one other concern is that we are near the cut-off for contributing to a ROTH, and also started making rental income this year, so do not want to push us over the edge by selling any stocks and not be able to contribute to our ROTHs this year. I was also struggling to find a good calculator to figure out our MAGI this year, as we had several changes from last year (raise, new job, child on the way, new rental income). 

I guess one other idea would be to superfund a 529 with some of it (we are expecting)? Just cannot figure out all the detailed pros/cons of the options.

Thank you for any suggestions. I realize there are probably a lot of things in the above that show you I am a newbie. Just trying to learn as much as possible.",finance
personalfinance,"Delayed Transit Benefits, spending quite a bit out of pocket waiting on paycard","Hey r/personalfinance, I've got a bit of a problem regarding my job and the transit benefit program.

I enrolled in the benefits for the month of September, asking for the full $255 to go toward my public transit costs. I spend around $300 in public transit costs, using the monthly passes that the two public transit options offer. My company however only provides these benefits through a pay card,  that I received yesterday (after many emails asking where it was). Waiting on this pay card I have already spend about $45 out of pocket to get to work which is approaching how much I would have saved in enrolling in this program. On top of that, when I went to activate the card, I was unable to do so through the online portal, and calling only gives me an automated system, telling me my employer has not submitted the required information for me to activate my card. 

I'm quite fed up with having to spend so much money waiting on a card to pay for my transit costs, and I want to know if there is anything i can do about this. I feel like the company I work for has failed to deliver on the benefits offered.

financialindependence,Goal of part-time?,"Hi ya'll.
I'm 31 and employed full time in medicine. While I love the idea of retiring early and doing just fun things I like, I feel that I've acquired lots of good helpful skills and that I should stay working in this field a while. Is part time employment a reasonable thing to do? I do think it would make me happier. Let me know what you think of this plan.


Current salary: 115k. No debt and around 200k in retirement money. Overall savings rate now is 50%. I have not fully embraced a lot of what I could be doing- I eat out a lot, etc. (I think if I had more time because of working less, I could more happily grocery shop and meal plan more instead of eating out, things like that)


I was thinking if I work as a part time employee in the 0.6-0.75 range, meaning about 3 days per week, I can still make around 70k, and if I continue to max out 403b and things, I could maybe even get myself down to the 12% federal tax bracket. It's hard for me to calculate in my head but I think I would be having take home cash of about 40k per year which would probably doable if I try, with my current spending of 3200/month.


I guess it would be a dream come true for an employer to agree to the part time plan I request, but jut wondering what everyone's thoughts are and if anyone has done this.
It's not at all realistic for me to have alternating time of working full time - then time totally off- then full time again. Getting hired at most large hospitals is a 3-4 month credentialing process and it's a PITA and painful.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin will not stop inflation,"While the method of how BTC is independent of a 'Board' or controlling party (Fed, IMF, etc.) and eventually will be capped at the 21 mark that will not stop inflation. I agree however it will limit inflation to a significant degree by removing those manipulative factors. It will be a market driven inflation, as it should be.
A key factor in inflation is the age old proven supply and demand principle.  Proverbial example would be if there is only one loaf of bread left on the shelf then the person with more BTC will pay a higher price for that loaf raising the price of bread.  Likewise if everyone is looking for a house but there are only a few homes for sale. The price of these homes will increase.

personalfinance,"Live with Parent who is passing, not sure if i can manage it all, looking for advice","Im 34yo, I live with my mom (no dad) and we share bills as it reduced my cost of living allowing me to pay for my Student Loans.

This week has been a Cluster as I was in an accident on Tuesday which from the damage, although car is drive-able it will probably be totaled by insurance (other driver at fault their insurance will be covering everything)

Then after this my mom's condition went fast (has liver cancer, was being treated but now we only will probably have a few days left with her)

So this leaves me with only a few days to get things in order so far.

1st and foremost, I would like to stay living where I am right now, we have a Mobile Home that is mostly payed for and after all bills are included it is about the same as an apartment around where i live.

That being said, this is how my my financials Look

I make around $2200 a month doing 40hrs a week, currently have no savings and $230 in the bank for bills/food before my next paycheck ($1100 every two weeks, next payday is 9/19)

    Bills that I Need to Pay    
    Electric+Water: ~200$ a month in summer, ~130$ in Winter    
    Gas: 5$ in Summer 50$ in Winter based on use    
    Car Loan: 422$ a month 24% and about $10,000 left    
    Car Insurance: 130$ a month, at minimal full coverage    
    Care Credit: 35$ a month, 24% at $1,000 left to pay
    PayPal: 50$ a month, 24% at $1,000 left to pay
    Cell Phone: 100$ a month under contract, will reduce after phone is payed for    
    Cable internet: 70$ a month
    Sling: 25$ a month
    Nelnet Student Loan: 405$ a month 6%, $40,600 left
    Navient: 122$ a month, Mom payed another 185$ for me, %7-11, around $28,500 left
    
I have other bills like other streaming services, but those I can cut (sirriusXM, CrunchyRoll, Netflix)

As far as what I need to pay on my Moms side

    Mortgage: 220$
    Lot Rent:  317$
    Loan for Home improvment: $297, not sure how much is left if i were to guess ~$15,000 however i dont know the interest

This leads down to my summary 

If I dont pay for student loans, My bills +hers will be around $1900 a month. 

I'm an ITT Graduate and I know some people had their loans forgiven due to their downfall so im not sure if that could be an option to reduce some of my debt

So far if I tally my debt I have around $82,000 combined and my moms is another, $25,000 for the home and home improvement loans

This covers known expenses however I also will have unknown expenses

Funeral, she wished to be cremated which is $3,000 and we would hold the funeral at church. She has $1,000 in life through her bank and another policy she just got a few months ago so we do not know if that one will take effect or how much its worth. (we should find out soon)

I might be able to get a roommate to help with bills as the Home is big enough for multiple people.

Lastly I also have about $1,000 in medical bills and co-pays that are not payed, but I am least worried about these as all the providers are usually good on not forcing the lack of payments.

NOTE: For my car, even if it wasn't totaled the vehicle value is a few thousand less than the remaining loan, so selling it is a no go as I would need to pay a few thousand to get the title released. Might not be an issue now but past advice this was the biggest thing noted. I also have tried for a lower interest rate loan but have been denied do to past non payments of student loans

38F, Married RN, 2 small kids. I make more than my husband (me approx $105K/year, him approx $55K).

I owe the following:

$21K in student loan debt at 3.1% interest

$5K in credit card debt at 0% interest

$3K in car loan debt at 3.1% interest

We have a mortgage, but payments are manageable and not too relevant here.

I have $9,000 saved at Ally and have retirement savings and college plans going. With the savings at Ally, I could pay off all my credit card and all my car loan today and roll that money into a student loan payment that would have me debt-free in 25 months. Doing so, I'd still be able to save about $1000/month back at Ally. After the 25 months--given that no major new expenses arise--I'd be able to save $1810 (total) monthly at Ally.

However! Since the loan interest rates are so low, wiping out my emergency savings to pay them off seems irresponsible, especially with kiddos on hand. I'm really, really tempted to just hit the ""pay off"" button.

BlockChain,Blockchain Technology in Supplychain,"# Blockchain for Drug Supply Chain and Its Application to DSCSA

by [Athena Team](http://www.athenagt.com/) under [**Blockchain Technology**](http://blog.athenagt.com/category/blockchain-technology/)

&amp;#x200B;

In  this post, we are going to share blockchain for drug supply chain use  case in length. This exclusive post will help you realize how blockchain  has injected not only financial and enterprise-data applications but  also supply chain industry as well.

As per a recent survey, 64% of the pharmaceutical companies have  either integrated or planning to integrate blockchain in various  applications. And this includes collecting clinical research data,  managing logistics and trading-partner transactions in pharma supply  chains. They have certainly ascertained the potential of blockchain in  the supply chain sphere.

&gt;“Within one value chain – the pharmaceutical supply chain  for drug products – many use cases exist across the board where there’s  an opportunity to leverage blockchain technology. Why? Because in this  value chain there are many points where processes break down due to a  lack of transparency and coordination.”

The rapidly changing environment in the  supply chain industry demands a quicker response to the drastic changes.  Blockchain service providers like [Athena](http://www.athenagt.com/)  are offering specially designed solutioning in blockchain for drug  supply chain. Their solutions add greater visibility and efficiency to  the pharmaceutical companies. Integration of this advanced technology  also helps them deliver deeper impact and obtain optimum customer  satisfaction at the end. The healthcare entities, for instance, have  access to a shared ledger that is frequently updated and assessed in  real time with each network participant. By doing so, the healthcare  companies achieve greater visibility of activities. They get clarity on  where an asset is at any point in time, who owns it and what condition  it’s in.

Before proceeding with the application of blockchain to DSCSA, let’s first have a quick sneak peek on **what is DSCSA** –

📷

Here’s an excerpt from FDA,

&gt;The Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA), was enacted by  Congress on November 27, 2013. Title II of DQSA, the Drug Supply Chain  Security Act (DSCSA), outlines steps to build an electronic,  interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as  they are distributed in the United States. This will enhance FDA’s  ability to help protect consumers from exposure to drugs that may be  counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful. The system will  also improve detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from  the drug supply chain to protect U.S. consumers.  
 Additionally, the DSCSA directs FDA to establish national licensure  standards for wholesale distributors and third-party logistics  providers, and requires these entities report licensure and other  information to FDA annually.

## Introduction

As with most new inventions, blockchain has also experienced its fair  share of speculation, hype, myth, and curiosity by the public. While  blockchain technology is lauded by the tech lovers and development  community; it is also scrutinized by a highly regulated industry in need  of responsive, secure, stable and risk-free systems. History proves  that there is usually a wide gap between the futuristic inventions and  the ground reality of business and regulatory requirement.

Blockchain for drug supply chain is nothing but a distributed ledger,  where every member would have a copy of the ledger. And whenever  someone makes a purchase, every other member gets notified. Each member  would then verify the transaction and add it to the ledger. The added  record is called a “block”. These blocks get added forming a chain – a  logical sequence of transactions. Blockchain ensures complete  surveillance, as there’s no centralized authority that could manipulate  the record. Therefore, whenever a ledger is hacked, the other ledgers  can easily verify it.

**The purpose of this brief is two-fold:**

1. To educate non-technical readers about blockchain technology and its  unprecedented potential in drug supply chain. Readers will also learn  about its compliance with the DSCSA, new business opportunities, etc.
2. To help readers explore blockchain options with this knowledge in hand

### The challenge for pharmaceutical companies

The 2013 DSCSA has imposed a set of compliance requirements for drug  supply chain participants over a 10-year period i.e. 2013-2023. The  manufactures of drugs sold in the U.S. are required to serialize, or  uniquely identify the products at the lowest saleable level. Besides,  they all must share data in regards to certain medicines, manufacturing,  trading partner and change of the ownership if any. The supply chain  participants are furthermore required to integrate an electronic system  so as to facilitate the data for all current and previous changes of  ownership (tracing back to the original manufacturer/relabler).

This regulated process could result in piling up of thousands of  electronic connections between previously “unknown” entities thereby  creating chaos. Since most of the transactions are typically between the  known trading partner pairs, the new challenge of “instant trust” has  emerged thus demanding for a technology that can authenticate records  and data.

### Can blockchain for drug supply chain be the solution?

📷

As we have already stated how blockchain can be leveraged upon to  provide clarity on transactions and every other data that is being put  in blocks; in the context of a supply chain, blockchain technology can  be used to track the flow of drugs and supply chain operations across  borders. This means that, at each step of the drug distribution process,  blockchain applications can vouch for the authenticity of a shipment,  thus making it nearly impossible for any kind of fraudulent activity.

Blockchain and its platforms including Ethereum, Hyperledger and Web  Three JS etc. have successfully demonstrated the ability to establish a  trusted, secure exchange of currency/data between unknown parties.  Furthermore, by implementing blockchain, drug companies can now  seamlessly address the challenge of an “interconnected system” called  for by the DSCSA.

### DSCSA Requirements

**Setting the Groundwork**

All trading partners in the supply chain must:

* Engage in sales transactions with only appropriately licensed and registered trading partners
* Have systems in place to investigate, identify, and remove product  suspected of being counterfeit, diverted, or otherwise unsafe Pass and  accept Transaction Information (TI), Transaction Statements (TS), and  Transaction History (TH) with all sales.

**Serialization**

Supply Chain trading partners must only engage in transactions of  products which are encoded with a unique product identifier and be able  to verify the legitimacy of the product by:

* Manufacturers
* Repackagers
* Wholesale Distributors
* Dispensers (Clinics, Retail)

**Unique Identifiers**

Supply chain participants must be able to uniquely identify the products.

As per GS1 Standard, data carriers are provided with a Global Trade  Item Number (GTIN) – It uniquely identifies products that are traded.  This unique number can be combined with extended data such as serial  numbers, lot numbers, and expiration dates at all packaging levels.

**Data Carriers**

Data carriers must be present at all packaging levels and the supply  chain participants must ensure that they can be universally interpreted.

GSI data carriers capture the huge amounts of data about different  business requisites including DSCSA lot number, serial number, and  expiration date. They also include linear and 2D data matrix barcodes  and EPC-enabled radio frequency identification (RFID).

### How blockchain can solve the DSCSA problem much before 2023

📷

As per the DSCSA regulations, post-November 27, 2023, pharma supply  chain companies in the U.S. will no longer have to pass the transaction  histories to their customers. However, they are required to be equipped  with the necessary systems and processes to promptly facilitate the  collected data required to produce the history of all the transaction  made so far leading back to the manufacturer.  The act of gathering the  transaction history would only be necessary, provided there is a  situation when an investigation is required on account of an  illegitimate product. When something so crucial is needed, its  complexity is actually compounded and this is where blockchain can play a  pivotal role in delivering the authenticating information.

Upon being contacted by a federal agency, the healthcare institutions  will be asked to produce their transaction details for a given set of  the product leading back to the manufacturer. This will alert the  manufacturer and he might legitimately ask a couple of questions like, *“Who  are you?”, “Are you a legitimate member of the supply chain?”, and “How  do I know that you own the drug you requested information about?*”

📷

Blockchain eliminates the necessity of raising such questions of  trust. Without blockchain for drug supply chain, the healthcare  managers, and the manufacturer, who have no direct business  relationship, can take more time than the regulated timeline to  establish the trust by responding to each other’s queries.

Blockchain for supply chain introduces a viable way of maintaining  transparency and easy access to the data related to ownership, quality  or shipment of the drugs. This state-of-the-art technology eliminates  the need for a central repository.

cybersecurity,The Excalibur Sword for Midsize Organization IAM (Complete IAM Needs Fulfillment),"Hi Reddit Cybersecurity freaks!

&amp;#x200B;

ILANTUS Technologies, an IAM vendor that has been around since the birth of the domain (one of the very few that are still alive!), has released the latest version of its pocket-friendly and engineered-for-SMEs ***Compact Identity*** all-in-one IAM solution (public and private cloud.) (One of the) most unique features of this product is its patented ability to SSO to thick-client apps. You know all those desktop apps like Skype, MS Outlook, SAP, Putty and Evernote that other vendors shy away from discussing because they just don't have the technology for SSO to these apps? With ILANTUS Compact Identity, you can SSO to all federated and web-based apps - as well as to your thick client apps! An industry first!

&amp;#x200B;

The solution fulfills Gartner's recommendations for midsize organization IAM needs. Gartner says that ""Midsize IAM needs are not a simplified variant of large enterprises. They need most, if not all,  of the IT capabilities a large enterprise needs, just at a lesser scale."" These needs are currently unfulfilled in the industry.

investing,Why invest if my bank's interest rate is competitive?,"If some think that bank rates are unrealistic, please indulge me in this exercise, I have found banks with good interest rates. 
I read Smarter Investing (Tim Hale) and Investing Demystified, and it is suggested that a realistic return from a broad portfolio of global index funds + some bonds over 20-30 years is ~4%. 
If my bank has an interest rate of 2-3% in various products, why would I still want to invest in fund s? Considering that I'm ok about the difference in gain and there are costs involved in fees.

Is it because the real return they talk of, is based on passive index funds? 
Is there a chance of higher returns when investing in ETFs? 
What about the 20% return of those ARK ETFs?

personalfinance,Renting an apartment while paying student loans,"Since graduation (4 years) I've been staying at home, working, and saving money which has worked out great. Unfortunately my mom abruptly moved out and is selling our house, forcing both my brother and I to move out. I'm in the NJ/NY area where the average rent ~$2K-$3,500K. My brother's a recent graduate (as of May) and still hasn't managed to find a full time job, though working part-time. For the past year and a half my parents have not offered any financial assistance towards my brother, and I've had to shoulder the burden for food and household supplies (for him). On top of this my parents have decided to stop helping me pay my student loans which are currently at $85K ($1,037/mo @ 8.75%). There's a bit of a back story to that but in short before I completely took over, the payments weren't made on time frequently, caused my credit to plunge, and got into a high interest rate car lease. A year prior to this when money wasn't an issue the car I leased was an entry level sports car but even with the spike in interest I was able to manage it fine. Combined with insurance it comes to about $759.

Right now my take home is pretty good (around $5,800/mo after taxes) but with the above factored in as well as living expenses my take home is around $1,100/mo. My initial strategy before this whole thing was to get out of student loan debt as quick as possible. I was able to knock off $50K on my own but this just doesn't seem possible now with all these payments I have to bear. Not gonna lie, I'm pretty worried and my overall life's plan has been thrown a little outta wack. What should be my strategy from here on out to improvement my situation? No judgment about any of the above would be appreciated.

**Monthly Budget (pre apartment):**
- Student Loan Total: $1,040
- Lease/Car Insurance: $760
- Dinner/Groceries: $400
- Commuting: $80
- Travel/Gas: $120

I am overseas with my military spouse working at a non profit on the base. I am currently saving 20% into a Roth and standard 401k. If I am not paying federal tax is there something I should be doing instead? I currently have 10% going into each of the two. Thank you.,finance
personalfinance,"New to the working world, lots of student loan debt, how am I doing?","Hey everyone, throwaway for privacy, but a long time subscriber.  

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got my master's degree is statistics (May 2018) and started working for a company near my hometown (low cost of living area).  I make 65k a year plus bonuses (expected to be around 4k).  Take home pay is \~3200/month.  The problem is the large amount of student loans I'm paying off. Currently putting 6% into my 401k to get my company match (currently has 1k after 2 months of working).  So here are my expenses:

&amp;#x200B;

Housing: I live with my mom right now, so maybe 100/month for things here and there

Gas/car: 100-140 because I drive a lot ( I have never financed a car, and this one has 140k miles so it's got time)

Gym: 70/month (mma gym so planet fitness at $10 isn't an option)

Internet: 60/month

Transfer into savings: 500/month (my costs are low right now so I'm building my emerg. fund a little slower)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And honestly that's about it.  So now for debts and investments.  I've been working since the end of June so here's where I""m at:

&amp;#x200B;

Debt: 

\-53k in Feds, some around 4%,  42k 6%

\-2 private loans totaling 12000 , one at 4%, one at 11.25% with 5700 left (It was 9000 back in June, variable interest, I know)

&amp;#x200B;

So the reason I'm here is to check with you all about my payoff strategy.  All my feds are in grace until November, which let's me pay extra to my privates.  I'm trying to be super aggressive about this.  Each month I pay the $100 minimum on the lower interest loan.  Every PAYCHECK, I drop $1000 into the higher interest loan.  I think it's pretty clear that's the first step, but what should I do after I kill that 11 percenter?   I'm open to all options, but currently considering refinancing just the 42k at 6% and getting an extended payoff option on the lower interest loans so I can throw more at the highest interest ones.  The big thing here is that I obviously can't pay this much into loans forever, and I want to start planning for  my future.  So to you gurus I ask:

&amp;#x200B;

\-once the bad loan is gone, should I increase my payment into savings?

\-at what point in this journey should I allocate more money into 401k/Roth IRA instead of loans?

\-I would like to buy a house eventually.  In my area you can find single family homes for 40k-60k, should I do anything special for that?  My credit is 740, I never carry a balance, and my score is steadily increasing with age and my loan payoffs.

personalfinance,Need some advice on a HELOC and general debt consolidation,"Hello!

My wife and I have acquired roughly $40k in credit card debt over the last few years. She was out of work for a while and our home has needed a lot of renovations. We want to consolidate our debts to lower the overall interest rate (most credit cards are between 15-22%). I suspect refinancing our home is not the best move as our current interest rate is  3.5% and rates are now around 5.15%-5.25% (based on our credit scores).

personalfinance,Cash or loan for Tesla?,"Hey all, I’m trying to figure out the best way to pay for my Tesla. Before anyone says anything, I’m aware this isn’t a great financial investment but it’s something I’m splurging on.

Here’s the situation:

Two cars currently, both with loans on them. 
* Car a has about 19k left on it and trade in value is 22,5000
* car b has about 37k left on it with an interest rate of 3.49%

The total amount for the Tesla is going to be about 115k after taxes and all that Jazz. I have the cash available to buy it outright but I’m not sure that’s the best use of my money.

Some background:

* make about 300k/year in base plus I get RSUs every year
* max out 401k, Roth, etc. also put a bunch into a 529 for my daughter 
* currently just dabble in stocks but have about 550k in RSUs at work that are vesting over the next couple of years
* been putting a bunch of money into home improvements so don’t have a ton invested in bonds, etc but will be doing more of that starting next year after we’re out of the home improvement dance 
* just cashed out 140k in vested RSUs and currently sitting on the cash (for about a week).
* the loan for the Tesla would be between 3 and 3.5% (interest rates have really gone up in the past few months)

Here are my options that I’m considering:

* A) buy the Tesla outright for cash while trading in car a
* B) put 20k down on the Tesla and invest the rest 
* C) put 50k down on the Tesla and invest the rest
* D) pay off car b, put 20k down on the Tesla and invest the rest

The initial reason I cashed out the RSUs was to diversify my portfolio but I’m leaning towards option A just to avoid the massive payment that comes with a 100k car loan.

So, finance gurus, which path would you pick? 

P.s. “not getting a Tesla” is not an option, I am picking up the car in a couple of weeks and it’s something I’ve been thinking about for years so I’m going to live a little and splurge.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off Car vs. Student Loans,"I am trying to debate the best method moving forward.

I have the following loans:

Car Loan: \~$16,580 at 3.9% with a monthly minimum of 350 a month. 

Student Loan: \~25,600 (interest rates ranging from 3.76% to 4.66%) that is in grace until November. After the grace period, I expect the minimum to be around $200.

Here is what I have been doing:

Car: $400 a month

Loans: $650 a month

What I am currently doing puts me debt free in about 4 years (assuming current rates don’t change at all)

The pragmatic part of me thinks I should do the Avalanche method moving my car to $350 a month, and putting the extra $50 towards loans, until the loans with interest rates above 3.9% are paid off, and once all loans above 3.9% are paid off, paying \~$850 towards my car. Once my car is paid off, putting all effort into the loans.

There is also the argument of paying the bare minimum to my student loans, and putting about $850 a month towards my car to pay it off in just under 2 years rather than 4. My car is a depreciating asset, so paying it off early makes sense to me if I need to sell it, but at the cost of extra interest and a longer payoff period for my student loans.

I am not sure what to do; go full avalanche, go full car, or maintain current course

At that time my credit was garbage, but without a co-signer I didn't have many options. The truck is a 2005 but had extremely low miles(118k) and blue booked at $12,500.00... definitely a good deal. Credit was high 590's according to Credit Karma.  

Early in 2018, I went in and settled all of my out standing debts and bought a house with my wife. My credit has shot up over 100 points, averaging about 710 now. 

Today, pay off on the truck is $4,859.15 at 11.09% interest. Would it be worth it for me to try and refinance this money? If I had the money I'd pay it off and get out of it but I'd rather hold on to what we have in savings for now. Would a bank be willing to refinance this loan on a 13  year old vehicle?

personalfinance,Car Buying - Sanity check,"Hi all,

Here's the story. Wife (30) and I (29) have an infant (with plans for more cherubs in the next couple years) and two cars (Honda Civic sedan and Mazda3 hatchback), and having only cars is becoming increasingly challenging. I am not planning on getting rid of my Mazda anytime soon, but my wife is interested in trading her sedan for a crossover/SUV. She has only ever had used cars and now wants to buy or lease a new car. I'm looking for a sanity check on whether this is a responsible idea.

I recognize that buying a brand new car is less fiscally responsible than buying a used or CPO car; I also recognize that it is better (right now) to pay in cash than to finance, given that interest rates have risen above the inflation rate. That said, my wife is interested in the newest safety features (and improvements on existing features) released with 2018 models and wants to be the first owner of her car; she also wants to have an AWD vehicle before winter (we live in an area that gets some significant winter weather). We live in the suburbs and frequently drive 40+ miles to visit family and friends; we also both work, roughly 20 miles from home, where driving is the only option. 

We are looking in the $27-33k range for a new car; we should be able to get $7,000 for the old car (private party sale instead of trade-in), and we'll put down another $3,000. 

Assuming \~3.35% APR for 5 years, this will mean that we are looking at $340-$450/mo.

Our projected budget will look like this:

**Income and Deductions**

* **Gross Income: $15,833**
* Roth 401k - $430 (employer contributes $322)
* Traditional 401k - $1,042 (employer contributes $469)
* Dependent care FSA - $417 (max out FSA)
* HSA - $282 (combined with employer contribution, this maxes out HSA)
* Taxes - $3,940
* **Take-home pay - \~$9,700**

**Expenses**

* **Debt - $610**
   * Student loan (originally $33k at 3.75% for 60 months) - $610
* **Housing - $2,200**
   * Mortgage: $1,500
   * Electric - $150
   * Miscellaneous home stuff - $150
   * House cleaning - $180
   * Lawn mowing - $220
* **Auto - $1,106**
   * Existing car payment - $226
   * New car payment - $450
   * Insurance - $160
   * Gas - $220
   * Maintenance - $50
* **Child - $1,200**
   * Formula - $100
   * Diapers - $50
   * Miscellaneous - $50
   * Child care (out-of-pocket, pulling out FSA reimbursements) - $1,000
* **Fitness - $244**
   * Gym membership (wife) - $39
   * Gym membership (me) - $25
   * Personal training (trying to get healthy for long term financial stability and I have no self control) - $180
* **Entertainment - $252**
   * Cable - $37
   * Internet - $60
   * Cell phone service - $130
   * Streaming services - $25
* **Food &amp; Beverage - $600**
   * Groceries - $400
   * Restaurant/Bar - $100
   * Takeout - $100
* **Other Expenses - $900**
   * Dog expenses - $100
   * Shoes &amp; clothing - $200
   * Beauty (haircuts, makeup, etc.) - $150
   * Utilities - $200
   * Personal funds (we give ourselves an ""allowance"" that we can spend on anything we want without talking to each other about it) - $200
   * Life insurance - $50
* **Saving (for things like vacations, home repairs, minor home improvements, or any other irregular expenses we face)- $1,000**
* **Investment (we have a plan to buy a bigger home or improve our current home) - $1,500**

**Savings**

* Retirement balances - $140,000-ish, aggressively invested 
* Emergency fund - $19,000 (we do not touch this unless we face an actual emergency)
* Savings (for things like down payment on a car) - $3,000

**Summary**

Take-home pay - $9,700

Expenses - $9,612

Now, we could wait until next year and put down around $15,000 (plus whatever we get for the current car), but I did the math and, assuming that her current car continues to lose value (it is a 2011 model) such that it is only worth $5,000 AND that interest rates continue to rise such that the best we could do is 3.85%, we would wind up either even or paying more if we wait. It is for this reason (and that my wife really does want an AWD vehicle before winter) that we are not waiting to save more. 

**tl;dr** \- $9,700 in take-home income; $6,662 in monthly expenses; $2,500/mo saved for non-retirement purposes; looking to take on a \~$450/mo car payment. Responsible? Irresponsible? Why?",finance

I understand we can file separately for state, I’m simply wondering how I should go about this initial filling out of the W-4.


Along with this, if we do file jointly it prompts me to go to married and two earners.  It then says I should divide the annual amount withholding by the number of pay periods remaining.

personalfinance,Extremely frustrated and still not understanding student loan repayment allocation,"I recently posted [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9ehsto/not_clear_on_how_monthly_payments_are_allocated/) questioning payment allocation on my loans, and while the responses were helpful, I now have even MORE questions. u/DeluxeXL mentioned [prepaying](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9ehsto/not_clear_on_how_monthly_payments_are_allocated/e5pbauf/?context=3), a term I had never heard of up until last night, and now I'm worried that I've been messing up my extra payments for an entire year.

**Some background:** I have an account with MGL for 9 loans and an account with Nelnet for 3 loans. Both total balances exceed 20K and have suggested monthly minimums of around $200 each. I have been paying $400 to each service monthly, totaling $800/month, under the ""standard allocation"".

MGL defines Standard Allocation as: *(Most common)*

&gt; * Once scheduled monthly payment and all outstanding interest has been paid, excess will be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate, thus costing you less interest over time.
&gt; * Done automatically.

Nelnet's Standard Allocation is: **Paying More Than Your Current Amount Due:** 

&gt; * Unless you direct your payment to an individual loan or group, the standard allocation method is as follows. After your current amount due is paid, payments are allocated across loans in repayment status starting with the highest interest rate. Once the loans in repayment status with the highest interest rate are paid in full, any remaining payment amount will be allocated across the loans with the next highest interest rate. If two or more loans in repayment status have the same highest interest rate, the payment will be allocated first to the unsubsidized loans and then to the subsidized loans, in proportion to each loan’s regular monthly payment amount.
&gt; * When you pay more than your current amount due, your due date on loan groups in repayment status will advance by one month each time you satisfy the regular monthly payment amount for that group. Your monthly billing statement will show $0 due for that loan group.
&gt; * Since your excess payment will continue to be applied to the loan group starting with the highest interest rate, you will continue to have an amount due for loan groups with lower interest rates.
&gt; * You have the option to request that we not advance your due date when you pay more than your current amount due.
&gt; * If you want your excess payment to continue to advance the due date of all of your loan groups in repayment status, you can direct your excess payments to all loan groups in repayment status, instead of targeting the loan group(s) with the highest interest rate, as a one-time or recurring special payment instruction. This will help keep the due dates for all loan groups aligned.

I thought that simply ""paying more than the monthly minimum"" was good enough, but now I'm thinking I've fucked it up somehow. I feel stupid and lost in terminology, when all I want to be doing is getting out of debt as quickly as possible. I'm looking to increase my monthly payments to $500 to each service ($1000/month total) but I want to make sure it's to my advantage and I want to know exactly how to proceed. I understand that you are supposed to pay the minimum and then direct the excess to the highest interest loan, and thought that's what I've been doing this whole time, but now I have no idea.

Am I worrying for no reason? Is there a better option for me? What should I be doing? I feel like I'm drowning under this debt and I want to get out of it as soon as possible, but I just don't think I really get what's going on at all and feel more lost every time it's explained to me. I feel like I've blindly thrown upwards of 10K to these loans and it's done nothing to reduce my balances or benefit me, and it's really getting me down. Please advise!",finance

Additionally, I have 40k worth of RSU of my company (Major tech company) that vests over the next 4 years

I have about ~28k worth of private student loans still left to pay off, which i just refinanced to about a 4.3% fixed rate. (Payoff is ~$520 a month for 5 years). Additionally, I just leased a car for $220/month, with a down payment of $2000 that I already paid. 


I am looking for advice on how to best manage my salary, and the signing bonus (of which I have about 9k left after the car down payment). Should i sink the majority of it into my student loans, to pay that off quicker?

That being said my closing costs came out to $15k. This seems high to me (especially AFTER rolling the funding fee into my loan). I think the biggest expense is upfront property taxes, which I assume is payment into escrow for 11 months (still not sure where 11 months comes from).

I don't have too much of a problem with $15k, however it is more than what I was planning for (new couch is going to have to wait a bit). Seller isn't covering anything since I didn't finance through their company. Is it around the ballpark as far as VA closing costs go?

&gt; The NYS Get on Your Feet Loan Forgiveness Program provides up to 24 months of federal student loan debt relief to recent NYS college graduates who are participating in a federal income-driven repayment plan whose payments are generally capped at 10 percent of their discretionary income.

Currently, I am not enrolled in any income-based plan, but I'm interested because it would allow me to qualify for GOYF. I make just over $42K/year, single, and live at home with minimal expenses. The loans that would be affected have a total current balance of $23,492.43 with a 3.8% interest rate (weighted average) under My Great Lakes. I'm having trouble figuring out which repayment plan ([IBR, PAYE, REPAYE](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/node/594)) to apply for.

Under Standard Repayment, my min. monthly payments are $274.61, and I've tacked an additional $125.39 onto that to make it an even $400 a month. This is how it's been for the past year. I have loans with another servicer with higher interest rates, and this sub has [taught me](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9epws1/extremely_frustrated_and_still_not_understanding/) that I should put all excess payments towards those after meeting the minimum on these to save overall.

Regardless of what my new monthly minimum would be under a repayment plan, I still want to pay at least $274.61 a month (what it is currently). Can I do this? Will my balance or interest change? Do extra payments look suspicious or harm me in any way?

Regarding GOYF: The program matches 24 months of payments equal to what you owe monthly according to your repayment plan as long as that number is more than $0. My payments would be $0 on IBR based on my AGI from last year, which is low because I graduated and then didn't start working until Sept. How can I figure out what my monthly payments would be? You have two years from graduation to apply, so I have to figure this out before May 2019. EDIT: I usually file my taxes in Jan/Feb. Should I wait until after I do that for my new AGI?

TLDR: Can I make extra payments on an income-driven repayment plan? Will that, plus GOYF get me out of debt faster? Is changing my payments around worth it?",finance
personalfinance,Young person debating between contribution amounts and account type for 401k.,"Hi guys, 

So I am planning on rapidly increasing the size of my 401k. I am 22 years old so I figure front loading my money into it now, while I am young, will be the best option for building it up over the long term. 

With that in mind, I want to reach $18,500 by the end of this tax year, and front load it in the earlier half of the year if possible. 

I have pretty low living expenses right now, and I should be able to preserve most of my money. 

With that in mind, I currently live in a pretty high income tax state, and make about an average salary for a entry level software developer (in the 60k range). 

I was considering a 33% contribution of my paycheck towards my 401k, but I wanted to know if you guys think that is reasonable. My employer currently gives me 5% matching on either a Roth or traditional 401k. 

Because this would be such a large contribution, and because I live in a high-tax state, Roth vs traditional gets a little complicated. I was originally leaning towards Roth, but I am not certain. 

The way I see it, there are the following pros and cons to traditional vs Roth 401k plans for me- 

Traditional- 
- I get to dodge the high income taxes in my current state, and if I choose to move to a 0 income tax state upon retirement, I will never have to pay that tax at all. 
- I substantially lower my taxable income by contributing so much of it towards my 401k. 

Roth- 
- I get to take advantage of historically low federal income taxes.
- My effective income is likely the lowest it will be for my entire career, making this the best time to eat any taxes. 
- I can withdraw the principle amount whenever I want without a 10% penalty, effectively making it like a bank account whenever I need it. Way more flexible than the traditional 401k in that respect.   


With all that said, I have 1 question- 

-- Would I be better served putting 33% of my paycheck into a Roth 401k now, or into a traditional account? 

Thanks in advance.",finance

My student loans: $56,077 at 5.15%. $755 monthly payment

My car loan:  $12,029 at 3.00%. $187 monthly payment

We’re toying with the idea of putting 10% down on a house instead of 20% and using the extra cash to pay down some of our other debt. We have been preapproved for a new mortgage with an interest rate of 4.65%. We both know that long term, we’d save the most by putting it all to the new house, but seeing some of our other debt disappear is really tempting.

My husband would like to use the extra to pay off his student and car loans. His reasoning is that even though it doesn’t save us money long term, it frees up $620 per month that we can put toward whatever we need month to month. Let me also say that we both have comfortable jobs and are currently able to still save at least $1000 per month while paying all our regular payments, so we’re not living paycheck to paycheck. I would rather, if we have an extra 20-30k, put it towards my student loans since it’s obviously our largest debt and has the highest interest rate. If we did that, I would continue paying the same monthly payment and just pay it off a few years earlier.

Are we being dumb to even consider not putting all the money we can on a down payment? I know over the course of a 30 year loan, we’d be spending a lot more, but we may not be in our next house 30 years. And there’s just something about seeing your other debts disappear sooner.

If you’ve read this far, thanks, and let me know if I left out any crucial details.",finance
personalfinance,Need help figuring out student loan payments using debt avalanche,"I've been posting a lot recently in an effort to try to figure out how to pay off my loans as fast as I can. I want to use the debt avalanche method to pay everything down, but I'm having a hard time because my money's spread out all over the place. I'll list out my loans below:

**My Great Lakes:** Total Balance: $23,504.43

Minimum monthly payment: $274.61

|             TYPE             | CURRENT BALANCE | INTEREST RATE |

**Nelnet:** Total Balance: $20,609.97

Minimum monthly payment: $156.97

|                TYPE                | OUTSTANDING BALANCE | INTEREST RATE |
|:----------------------------------:|---------------------|---------------|
| Direct PLUS Unsubsidized (Group A) |      $7,801.60      |     6.960%    |
| Direct PLUS Unsubsidized (Group B) |      $6,357.86      |     6.590%    |
| Direct PLUS Unsubsidized (Group C) |      $6,450.51      |     6.590%    |

I've been putting $800 a month towards loans and want to continue to do so. I've just been splitting it $400 toward each account. My employer will be giving us $100 a month per loan account starting soon, so for me that's $200, bringing me to a total of $1000 spent on loans monthly.

I understand that I should pay $275 to MGL and direct $525 to Nelnet, since it has my highest interest loan. Thanks to my job, it increases to $375 and $625, respectively. But I'm confused because it's not just 2 loans I'm paying- it's 12 loans under 2 *accounts*. So does *each* loan have a minimum I need to meet, since they're all in active repayment status? They all have different interest rates, which is why I'm thinking so. I do not see an option to view the minimum due for the individual loans, only what's due monthly and I believe it's spread across all the loans in that account. Is this correct?

Let's say I do have $625 going just towards the Nelnet Group A loan. Do I still owe that month on Groups B &amp; C? I want to just set it up in auto-pay and change the amounts as needed, but does that effect the way that $625 is distributed? Every time I think I understand, it turns out I don't. Any insight would be appreciated; I'm getting a headache trying to figure it out.",finance

gaming,Help with restoring a scratched GameCube disc.,"I have a copy of Cubivore for GameCube that gives me an error message when I try to play it. It’s the error message within the game because it’s displayed in the Cubivore font, meaning the issue is definitely with the disc and not with the console. I’ve tried multiple consoles and they all have the same results. I got the disc used a while back and it definitely has some scratches. I had the disc buffed at a local game store but unfortunately it did not make a difference.

Is this disc a lost cause? I really hope not because it’s a very valuable game, and it’s definitely one of the most oddball games in the Gamecube library. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to possibly save this disc? Thanks!",technology
personalfinance,Where to open a checking account as a nonresident paid tech intern in San Francisco?,"Hey there!

I was wondering if you guys had any tips for a foreign intern in San Francisco searching for a bank or credit union to open his checking account in (so I can get paid there).

Some things to take into account:

* I would like to keep the account open even after returning to my country. That way I can have an account where I can get my tax refund next year instead of having to receive a check through the mail.
* Account minimum: can I take as much money back to my country with me as I want or should I be careful about fees?
* International fees: can I send money to an account in another country? At what cost?
* I have a 4 month J1 visa but I'm **not** a resident of the US (I'll will receive a SSN shortly tho)

Options I have considered:

* Capital One's 360 Checking. **Problem:** They were not sure if I can open an account as a non citizen or not.
* San Francisco Federal Credit Union. **Problem:** I'm not a US citizen or permanent US resident.
* Chase/Wells Fargo/Bank of America. **Problem:** Minimum $1500 to waive monthly fees. Apart from that, any of them seem like solid options. Should check which of them offer the lowest international fees. Would probably pick Bank of America between these three because it was recommended to me. 
* BBVA Compass ClearChoice Free Checking. **Problem:** Just found about it today, still need to know if a non citizen can open one. Another thing is that google maps shows nearest official branch close to SFO, but also a rep office near financial district. Can I even open an account at that rep office or would I need to go to the one near SFO?
* PayPal Cash Mastercard. **Problem:** Can I trust Paypal as I would trust a bank? Can I even use this as an account where I can get paid by my employer? Does the $2.50 international withdrawal fee means that a foreign transaction fee is not applied if I withdraw my money from an ATM in my country? (probably not)

If you think I should provide any more information please do say so. Any tips are welcome, thank you for reading!",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on making money with my investments,"My husband and I are both in our early 30s and interested in investing our money in ways that will give us the greatest return. Several years ago, we were gifted a large sum of money – now that I have been reading the personal finance subreddit I know that it can be considered a windfall. I was not very money literate at the time. My husband used a large portion of it to open a business, I was in school so we used a portion of it to live comfortably and to travel during a time when I didn’t have an income and my husband’s income was pretty low. We bought a house and now own it outright. We had a kid. Now I am about to go part time at my job. My husband makes about 30,000 after taxes and will bring home even less now that we are going to be on his insurance. Our house is worth between 285,000 and 300,000. We have about 15,000 in savings, I have approximately 12,000 in student loan debt (interest rates 3-4%) and 10,000 left on my car note at 0.9%. My husband is debt free. I want to start generating income from our investments and though I am happy that our house is paid off, I have been crunching numbers to figure out what would be our best way to use our money. We are considering 2 options. Option 1 is to stay in our house and save up our money to put a down payment on another property so we can rent our current house to a tenant. At our current rate of saving, we will either have to save for a couple years or take out a HELOC to have enough for a down payment for another property. Option 2 is to sell our house, use the cash to put a large down payment on a house that is about the same price as ours or cheaper (we are looking at a new build in a neighborhood that we anticipate gaining considerable value when the entire development is finished), pay off my debt, and spread the rest of our money across several investments like buying a condo that we can rent out, opening and maxing out Roth IRAs, and invest in mutual funds.  I am leaning towards option 2 because we could keep our monthly bills approximately the same as they are now – our biggest expenses are taxes on the house, homeowners insurance, and my debt payments – and we will diversify our money. I like the idea of spreading my money across several investments and eliminating the school and car loans while essentially keeping our expenses the same and making money on other investments. I am currently finishing up Rich Dad Poor Dad and I am very interested in re-allocating my money in a way that I can make a monthly income that can pay my mortgage and ideally we would continue investing in additional properties. My question is – would option two be my best decision? Are there better ways to maximize my profits than what I am considering? Can you recommend any other books that can help me in my investments?",finance

personalfinance,Questions about Financial Advisors (Real life Humans vs. RoboAdvisors from Banks vs DIY),"I'm currently in the process for a federal job and was trying to come up with some financial plans for the future. I really do enjoy the concept of compounding interest for retirement in a stock account or 401k, but many examples that people give (such as using historic averages of 7% in the long-term, over a period of time), seems so wild. I've never met or known anyone who has 500k in their retirement/stock accounts (unless they are day traders who do it consistently for a living), let alone these outrageous projected examples of earning $1M+ in 30 years or so. 

I do fancy the idea, but I fear that's just people in a crazed state due to us being in one of the greatest bull markets in US history, and that they believe trends can continue forward. Still, I do want to get over my fears and get my foot in the door the right way. 

My friend tells me that I should go DIY, learn the basics, terms, strategies, and finding out goals with a set schedule (eg: buy $50 worth of stocks every week for a year, invest $1000 as principle) to see if you are comfortable with it. 

I see myself focusing on my career once I get in and probably won't spend that much time building and managing my portfolio and this brings me to the title of this thread. Is it worth using an advisor? (I've been contemplating speaking with a Fidelity advisor and choosing them as the platform of preference.) 

Do Financial advisors actually just manage and compile data to review every quarter/year/time frame? Can I just sit down, speak to them with my goals in mind, risk tolerance, etc, and just fork over my money and they'll do the rest and update it for me? I know it sounds like I'm being lazy, but seeing as I probably won't have the time or discipline to consistently be on top of my portfolio, especially since I'm looking for long-term goals, I'm quite worried about things that may go wrong somewhere in between from when I start and my end point. 

Please, go ahead and tell me your experiences using any type of advisor, I am curious about your opinions and thoughts on financial advisors and the compound interest strategy.",finance

personalfinance,"I need advice, possibly professional advice, on my somewhat unique situation and I'm not sure where to begin looking","**Background:**

I am a US citizen. I moved to Japan 7 years ago immediately after graduating university. I've lived, worked, paid taxes, and contributed to the national pension service in Japan for a total of 6 years, working as a government employee (teaching English for a municipal government). I have not been paying US federal or state taxes due to foreign earned income exclusion, but I did pay some very small amounts when I worked whatever American jobs I held before and during my uni years.

**Situation:**

I'm moving to Europe in a month or so to follow my wife for her work there, and I have secured remote contractor-type employment for a US firm, which is a separate tax situation deserving of its own post here.

As a non-Japanese, and to the best of my understanding, I can do one of three things with that pension money (about ¥1.8M, or ~$16K):

1. As of a treaty that went into effect in November (?) 2017, I can transfer that money to social security (but not a 401K, Roth IRA, or standard IRA).

2. I can leave it alone and collect the full amount in 30 or so years when I retire by requesting the payout from the Japanese pension office.

3. I can do a lump-sum withdrawal, which allows me to receive a maximum of 3 years' worth of pension payments.

I'm really hoping option one is me not understanding everything correctly and I could put my money into an IRA, but I won't hold my breath. Option two sucks because as I understand it, Japanese pension money already has negative appreciation, and even if it didn't, I'm somewhat confident that I might lose the ~$8k or so I would lose in option 3 anyway, just with not collecting interest smartly. 

Option 3 sucks up front because I would be throwing ~$8,000 into the bin, but I'm most inclined to do this option because:

- I can invest the 8 grand I *will* get however I want, including opening up my first retirement savings accounts with the rest of my personal savings.
- I don't have to trust social security or Japanese pension systems not to collapse in the next 30 years due to demographic strain
- I don't even know where the next 30 years of my life are going to be, or with what companies I will work, but I hope a great deal of them are me continuing to live and work abroad. 

**Questions:**

1. If I'm looking to have my cake and eat it too, i.e. transfer the full 6 years of national pension money into an American retirement fund, who do even I ask if that's possible?

2. Assuming that's impossible, and that I know next to nothing about what I need to do to save/invest for retirement, which of the three above is my best option, and why? 

If #3 ultimately is my best choice, I can look into the side bar as to where to begin investing and whatnot. I will be calling the US embassy in Tokyo soon to get more information as well, but I just wanted to poke around here in case anybody happens to be a specialist or knows a specialist I could ask.

3. I'm 30 years old with no debt, no investments whatsoever, and only about $15k totally liquid savings. Am I ok? Did I fuck up wasting time sitting on cash and not investing? Or can I still turn this ship in a good direction for myself?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan,"I currently have a student loan that is in collection status on my credit report. I thought this loan was included when I consolidated all my federal loans so I could enter the PSLF program and it disappeared from my report for a couple of years.

I am in a position now where financially I have been getting my credit back in order. I agreed to terms with the lender to make payments over two years to have the debt paid off. Where I work they do periodic background checks where they review your financials. I have been making payments for one year now as agreed, but my credit report still reflects that I owe the entire amount $10,205 even though I have been making all of my payments. When I check my account with the lender online the correct current balance is reflected $5,498.

gaming,Unpopular opinion: PlayStation Plus and the changing face of gaming...,"https://my.mixtape.moe/wspuok.jpg

####**This month's unpopular opinion looks at Ps Plus**. 
You could possibly apply this to the other console equivalent like LIVE and NSOS.

So first off....

####I resent paying to play with my friends.

It use to be free and before that they made games with split screens and consoles had multiple controller ports.  Hell even 80s Atari pong apparently had two controllers and one screen and no extra charges.

Sony has over 20 million plus players and over 140 million consoles in play and healthy stock share prices so they can afford to let us play for free or stop increasingly the costs.

But Sony and the rest...now make more money from Plus users via subs than they do on their exclusive games so it's business choice....But I don't like it.  Regardless if it's an unpopular opinion in 2018 (shake a head and sighs).

Beyond this 'here to stay' , 'stable door open horses bolted' issue where's there's no hope of going back ...I feel that Plus is adding insult to injury and pouring salt in the wound and poking me in the eye....and not even buying me dinner first...before bending me over the mcdonalds booth table and ramming....you get the point (as did I that fateful night :-O).

**I'm talking about the way Plus has evolved.  Or de-evolved over the years.**

Some of us users pay a monthly fee and because Sony knows this is a shaft fest they give us free games...woot woot free!!!. 
But they're not free...or ever our games. It's an expensive rental service where we waver our consumer rights and don't own anything except the right to fu&amp;k off if we have a problem... as we signed a waver.

####*'But these free games are good'*, you shout!

Yes sometimes they're great and usually I own them already and I will sell my physical game and keep the rental so not all bad ...though they still have unexplainable lag and Plus base price keeps rising.

This is what it is but we're use to it, so no point complaining right? ...or we should complain...but Sony no longer needs to give a fu&amp;k with absolute market dominance.
**But Plus has changed**...is changing and at times I feel like a lamb being fattened for the seasonal meal.

Ps Plus mostly gives out single player games which due to the nature of the industry often have microtransactions or DLC.  This has been arguably unavoidable and now and again the B game will be episodic like gameofthrones or the walking dead series so there is precedent of these two business models at play.

Recently we had the excellent B game Dead by daylight but it's the B game as it has no single player and 50% is behind a paywall with heavy cosmetic microtransactions (over 350$£ for it all). But it's the B game so whatever and it's free (not free).

**But then we get games like Destiny 2**...which is a whole other ball game.

####The game changer....

**Destiny 2 is the reason for this rant.** Not so much the game but the decision to use it on Plus and the changes to Plus to accommodate it and what this says about Sony going forward.

Destiny 2 is an episodic game which releases incrementally to keep the community alive but each part is not only necessary but expensive considering you already paid for a aaa 50£€$ title.  
On top of that for D2 the devs have rammed front and centre microtransactions for cosmetics but in the sparkly world of destiny the loot and the cosmetics are the gameplay.  

**I have 300 hrs in D2** so I was part of that fanbase though some shady shit goes on with rhe devs which lead me to reject it.
Fans know the setup and mostly accept it but so many others reject it or refuse to go anywhere near it...Until Plus found a way to circumvent the walls they put up and find a way into your home and potentially wallet.

Many gamers didn't want destiny 2 but now they have it ...via sneaky old Plus.  It's.not they hate destiny but they don't like what it represents and how it pays for itself.

You could argue those players don't have to install it right....right...wrong.  My Plus auto installed D2 when I added it to my library which was a shock.  Maybe that was a glitch or maybe Sony did a deal with its publishers.  Eitherway it's not vanilla d2 but the new chapter...Forsaken.  Or so it seems but it's not really Forsaken...it's just a demo for 24 hrs... regardless if the servers are periodicllay down (which mine are).

So now I've been forced to install a rental of a demo of a pay model I opted out of and it's on a timer....great.  But when it runs out....ill have the exciting opportunity to buy chapter 1..2....3...xxx?  Extra parts to stay current in the community and work towards the true story ending.  

I'm not a fan of the latter for free but on  a service im paying for...that's bs.  Who willingly would sign up to such a pay model....it's crazy! **But that's Plus September 2018.**

####The above scenario isn't ideal but it gets worse....

Increasingly I realise that Plus is giving me microtransactions heavy games which are intentionally incomplete .  
I couldn't proove this until Sony psn redesigned their interface hub with the new micro transaction 'add on' button front and centre on the Plus page.

Plus is now 100% confirming that it is a gate way to DLC, paid microtransactions, season passes and even supplying dlc heavy games masquerading as the latest complete game while generating free marketing.  Like a carrot on a stick we are donkeys being lead up the garden path to the paid DLC troth.

Sony admits they makes more money from Plus users than on their games but they make even more money via DLC through Plus which ofcourse they get a share of.

And that fat lamb analogy...that's because all this is about working towards something Sony tried to implement before. 

It's on record that Sony wanted this gen games to be like what the Plus pay model has become but they did a 360 when outraged fans attacked Microsoft for the same idea and killed the Xbox One launch.  Sony then distanced themselves from this business model and became heroes and went on to win this gen.

That's right , as with Plus, they wanted you to waver all your consumer rights and never own physical games and rent digital games which you can't sell  or trade them or complain after a fixed period.  Even though they might patch microtranactions into the game with loot box gambling or just break it...you can't complain about what you signed away.  That was both companies plan and for a time it failed.

####This model killed Microsoft this gen...

...(sorry but the false start was disastrous) and caused Sony to scrap their plans (temporarily) and claim to be 'for the players'.  Though once Sony had won this gen war (they have long since won) they started re-implementing their plan via a new Trojan horse....Ps Plus.

Fast forward five years and we're all fat lambs waiting to be carved and Sony will in time announce the ps5 has no physical media drive etc. And all games go digital only.  

But even without any game manufacture, distribution and reduced marketing the prices will likely stay high or increase because...ofcourse they will.  Sony...Microsoft...even Nintendo have a captive audience of effectively addicted drug addicts who are mostly underaged so why not take advantage of their trust.

Ofcourse such a scenario of doom is a direct reaction to gamers simply not giving a shit or being too ignorant to see they work for free to defend these anticonsumer practices.  Though in our defense many of us might not know that there was before....when none of the above was a thing and we still had kick ass games we played together for fun and paid only once.  

For ps5 there will still be an inevitable kickback from people who see this for what it is which might delay such a business model until ps6 but it will come in time as it's already here.

Here in Plus as an indication of Sony's shift in priorities and its trend to push incomplete pay walled  games with endless addons  which are signs of things to come across the industry.

Personally I'd prefer if Plus kept user choice as it's priority or atleast a less overt sales system which feels like outright manipulation.   But it's business about money and greed...and we're  talking about millions becoming billions.  

Half of us are rushing to embrace any bs the gaming giants can come up with while they attack the other half for not following them or daring to ask questions.  The vast influx in casual players has lead to the norm being the **unpopular opinion of the minority.**

####But this is the real kicker.

We don't have much choice.  Sony took that away when they moved toward this system and if you want to play with friends you have to have Plus.  Meanin they will keep slipping the rental of these incomplete microtransactions heavy games under our defenses.  

 We find ourselves with games we'd never buy or rejected based on their insideous business models.  Inevitably our weakness will lead a number of us to pay for that next chapter...those extra coins..credits.. shards...crates...whatever microtransaction bs they can think of...renamed as 'addons'.  That's how Sony always win. It's a rigged game and the house will always win.

Ofcourse we can stay strong and ignore the ""free games"" and uninstall them after they forced themselves onto drives. Or we can play them and accept them as incomplete and turn to youtube for the ending but....that's all shit...isn't it?  And not what gaming is about...not for me atleast...as **it's no fun.**

####Ultimately it's about **a war of attrition** and Sony know this.  

We know they want absolute control over gaming. They wantall the money which means exclusives and digital only and microtransactions and consumer rights wavered...and they know they are steadily working towards that day.  That day imo which will also kill gaming as we know it...and is no better than some EA exec wet dream.  

Imo The war is won when we loose that physical drive.  When the game shops close, rhe manufacture ends , the distribution dies and salespeople all go home.  The attrition is the creep towards getting us to buy digital only and sign that waver and then keep buying what we've  already paid for again and again while we pay a monthly charge for this luxary.  Only in gaming and maybe gambling... could such a shitty model  exisit and be actively embraced by fans.

####The real Fu&amp;king cherry on this shit sunday...

... is that all that dlc and the microtransactions we buy for our incomplete Plus games...isn't ours! 

If you stop paying for Plus or get banned or just fed up...you can't access your DLC as you can't access the gateway game!   If that's not a colossal fu&amp;k you I don't know what is lol


####The irony is **I love Sony.** 

I bought the laptop, headphones, t.v. and phone and Ps1234pro...So I'm the biggest sucker of them all and as much as the problem as anyone else.

Maybe I'm worse , as I keep paying but I bitch about it like a little lamb....waiting for the fateful day they carve me up my limited resistance once and for all.  After that I won't bleet so much , as I'll just be another fanboy screaming **shut up and take my money!**

Also go look at Vita for yet more proof of Sony's long term digital only goal being implemented right via the **discontinuation of all physical Vita cartridges** and going only digital.

####That's my unpopular opinion :-D

If you want to know how to change the above possible future then vote with your wallets and tell Sony politely if they wish to retain your business they need to honour the pledge that PlayStation is for the players...*not payers.*

*Feel free to down vote my unpopular opinion, get angry too and help increase the certainty of the above scenario.*

personalfinance,[Credit] Paid two Federal Perkins Loan in one installment and my credit score dropped 80-90 points.,"\[Credit\]

Like the title says, I paid two Federal Perkins Loans (with Grand Valley State University) in early august and noticed on Credit Karma that my credit score dropped 85-95 points between TU and Equifax within the next week or so. I know the drop is from the loan payments because other than some other student loans, I only have one credit card with my bank that I pay off every time I use it, so I don't have a vast credit history. I am still in my deferment period for all student loans until February and have not begun paying back any other student loans. The Federal Perkin loans were owed to GVSU, while all my other loans are to FedLoan Servicing, so I think it is GVSU that I want to take this up to.

I spoke to a Collection Supervisor at GVSU who said there was nothing that they could do, which I was expecting I guess. I know you can't change your credit score with a snap of your fingers, but answers beyond ""It happens"" would have been great. I didnt think paying off a student loan would have this effect and I am worried this will stay on my record for 7-10 years.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was in the process of taking out an auto loan for a car when the person I was working with suggested I see what I can do/find out about this before they pull my credit report, since the APR I could have gotten was 2.something% and now could be 7.something% for how low my score is. So it would be awesome if this was all some sort of error.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on what I should do would be cool, has this happened to any one else?

Hopefully I got the flair right. Also posted in r/StudentLoans

personalfinance,Negotiating overtime,"I just started a new position 2 months ago and I'm currently on probation.

The company is pretty much a start up and there is a lot of work to do. I could put in infinite hours and still not get everything completed.

When I originally took the position, I negotiated a 7k salary rise (very proud of that) and they gave me it. It's a 15k pay rise from my last position, so I was chuffed.

I've worked my life away for employers before (they paid over time) but unfortunately things went South after a couple of years. 

I now value my time and health more than my job.

I am prepared to work extra and commit more time to this employer, however I'm beginning to feel like it's not completely worth it because I'm receiving nothing in return for it.

After my 6 month probation I will need to give at least 3 months notice before I change to a new role.

So I'm considering sorting this out before then  and attempting to negotiate overtime if I get offered the full time position. It is in my contract that overtime is included in my salary.

I'm looking for advice on what to do.

Am I just being greedy? Wanting more?
Should this negotiation be conducted with my manager, HR or the director of the company?
Should I look elsewhere for a job before the probation is up so I have something secured in the event that it doesn't work out?
Is it possible to negotiate a contract ammendment while converting from probation to full time?",finance

My hobbies are relatively cheap. I like to watch stuff and read and play games. I really enjoy going to bars and restaurants and leaving town for the weekend, though, and would like to continue to be able to do that after I move out. That's literally where all of the rest of my money currently goes, except for paying off a medical bill and credit card.

I'd like to think my student loans could be refinanced or something, but I don't even know where to start. I have 4 loans from 3 different lenders. My consolidated federal loans have a fixed interest rate (4.125) and a graduated payment plan. However, my Navient and 2 Sallie Mae loans have variable interest rates (6.83 &amp; 9.625). I'm paying the latter off more aggressively, with just a 5 year repayment plan. My total debt is about 30k.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, this was actually kind of a good exercise for me, to see my costs laid out. And to see how much money I actually have vs. how much I think I have. If anyone has any advice or words of wisdom while I try to pay ""real"" rent and utilities, that would be much appreciated. &lt;3

personalfinance,Where is my car payment money going to?????,"To start off, I financed a VW JETTA 2015 back in 2016 (when I was 22)for $12,500 at 24% interest. I know it's really high and stupid rate but I didn't know at the time since it was my first big purchase. My dad was there when I signed the contract with the devil but didn't stop me. He says he didn't realize how high it was until a year later. 
It's been a little over two years now and the payoff quote is $13,500 like where has the money I have been paying the last two years gone to??? The interest??? 
I was offered a 300$ monthly payment but I decided to give $400 instead to try and pay it off ""faster"", but obviously didn't get to that. I managed to refinance with Capital One earlier this year, whom I already had a credit card with and got a lower interest rate at 14% with a payment of $380 monthly. 
What should I do? This car had been a burden financially. What can I do to better myself in this situation? I really just want to get a $3-5k and avoid paying monthly payments but not sure that's in my future of I still have this burden.

personalfinance,Is this a good value for Solar?,"I just received a quote from my city's solar program for a new solar system. I'm trying to make a determination if these numbers are a worthwhile investment or not.

Unit size: 4.48kW

Cash outlay: $15,142.40

30% federal tax credit: $4,542.72

Total cash out: $10,599.68

Rebate from city: $450 to $650 depending on program uptake

Expected yearly production: 5485 kW

Energy rate: $0.145/kWh

Cost per watt: Approx $2.25

Payback time: 11-13 years

I'd also earn 5 SREC credits per year. PA SRECs are only worth about $13 right now, but you can hold them for 3 years before selling and the state is trying to make that market better (for comparison, NJ S-RECs are worth about $200). I don't count this number since an increase in value is not guaranteed. This would be gravy.

It seems like solar would be an okay-ish return on investment, but not necessarily a great use of my cash versus say, the market. (Retirement accounts are already maxed, FWIW).",finance
personalfinance,Possibly being scammed? [Craigslist],"Hi everyone, don't know how to go about this but I need your help in recognizing this as a scam or not. 

About two and a half weeks ago I answered a job posting ad for an assistant business admin. At the time of his first email he sent me a questionnaire about my qualifications, I also checked out his website and he appears to be real. German architect/photographer to travels around and needs help with booking, flights, planning meetings etc. Since he has been out of the country he can't meet face to face yet or schedule a phone call.

So far the grammar and tone have been professional and haven't noticed any red flags. His first task for me was to get a PO box once I got the information for him I emailed him but didn't hear back from him until this morning in a new email. He ignored my text message also. 

This is the text of the email:

personalfinance,Help me grow into an adult and learn how to budget and save,"Okay reddit lets do this I am currently holding a debt of:

64,000 in private loans 

48,000 in federal loans

I used to go to a private college thats why the amount is so high but when I realized I didn't want to be in so much debt I left and transferred to a cheaper college. I do not have a degree yet and was very close before family strains caused me to loose my cosigners and ability to gain a loan so I am about 8,000 short from actually finishing school and getting a degree.

My job is a 15hr a week job at $11.50 an hour. I KNOW I need a new job and I’m working on it, but I have to get a phone first since when the family strains went I had to give up my phone as well. So I need to get a phone but I was planning on getting a phone where you buy minutes and add it on if you need to like; cricket wireless or straight talk but I’m not sure if that’s the smartest way to go. Also someone at my work is going to have baby and I can pick up their hours which would put me at around 20-25 hours a week. But the baby is due in mid October so it wouldn’t happen until then. I know I need either a second job to get me at a lot of hours and able to make more or I would have to try to get a full time job that pays well with the little experience I have. (again something I want to do I just need a number to be contacted at so I waiting for my boyfriend to come home today to look through plans together if anyone has any suggestions let me know! thank you!)

I am super super lucky to have a three-year boyfriend who’s family so kindly took me in and I thank them everyday and try my best to be a good housemate by cleaning and making them food and doing their laundry and any way I can show them how grateful I am that they let me and my boyfriend stay here rent free (I mean sometimes my boyfriend helps with the bills and pays them for his parents one month and I try to chip in as much as I can) I know I’m ranting about this on a finance post and skip this if you want but they deserve all the shout outs and the thanks in the world.

Current money in bank account: $60 dollars but I’m getting paid this week so about $360

Expenses:

$300 interest payment on my loans/ every month (which I will probably have a payment for the loans soon because I only have six months to either find a cosigner or start paying them back I’m already mentally prepared for the latter)

$150 for car insurance/ every month

?? for phone plan (if I could my boyfriend said he would get a cheap plan with me)

$8,000 (dream goal) of SAVING so I could pay for my last semester

$40 a week for gas (but probably less unless my new job is far away)

$20 a week for personal (such as food or if I need tooth paste)

Any help is appreciated! I know  no one has to help me figure out my life and I am very grateful that people do take time from their day to give free advice to someone they don't know.

Am I a failure?,"First, some general info: I am a 23-year-old female who just graduated with a B.A. and approximately $22,000 in federal loans, with no other debt. I am working full time and make approximately $36000 after taxes/deductions. I have $27000 in a savings account, and should have $28000 by the end of the month. 

I grew up in a toxic family situation, with parents that were very open about their money issues. Screaming matches, a lack of emotional stability, and cut off heat/power are all strong memories from my childhood. As a result, I have had extreme anxieties about money that persist until this day, and leave me feeling terrified that no matter how much I try to save, some terrible catastrophe will occur, leaving me penniless. 

These anxieties were recently triggered when I learned that my childhood home is up for forclosure after my parents failed to make payments for literally 10 years. I have not been living there for six years, so my physical wellbeing is not being threatened by the forclosure. However, my anxiety has been off the charts, and I once again feel like I'm on the verge of losing everything.

I'm not looking for a pat on the back, or to get my anxiety blindly assuaged. Really, I just want to hear some candid takes from the impartial Redditors of this thread.

personalfinance,Can we discuss bond funds?,"So most sources will say that in a diversified portfolio, a certain percentage of your assets should be in bond funds to mitigate risk. I'm having a few problems understanding this. Maybe someone can clarify a few things for me?

1. How, exactly, do bond fund prices correlate with interest rates? I understand that if interest rates decrease bond values go up...but how exactly? Does the change in interest rates scale with the change in the bond worth or is it more complex than that?
2. With historically low interest rates, isn't it riskier to buy bonds now than before?
3. With bond yields lower than before, why wouldn't I be better off with a CD, money market fund, or even cash where I have less risk of loss of capital?
4. People often say the point of bond funds is to have available money in case of a stock market dip, but isn't this already mitigated if I am making monthly contributions to retirement and non-retirement funds?
5. Doesn't the tax inefficiency of bonds make them even less desirable in non-retirement accounts?

personalfinance,[Planning] Options to stretch money until fiancee gets a job,"So I bought a house in January. I can barely afford it right now and so we (fiancee) are having to budget pretty hard. With all my extra income from March, bonus and tax returns, we should be fine until the end of the year and though next match. Around December my fiancee will have graduated and we will gain a second income with time for her to find a job. In theory at last... In practice we might be running short in November or December. And we were just hit with the knowledge that she may not receive any more school loans so we will have to spend about 4k in this last quarter.  
  
I guess I'm looking for options that will help me starch our money though March. So far we have done really well in reducing our spending, we can do more but we are down from about 2.5 - 3k of spending per month to about 1-1.5K. That number includes about $500 per month in bills. 2 cc's are almost maxed out with limits 11k and 9.7K.  
  
These are the options I can think of:  
* apply for a cc with a long time for 0% interest on balance transfers. Then transfer as much as I can to the card so that it frees up my existing card(s) then we can pay off the card before the interests kicks in and close it.  
* I typically take 0 electrons and withhold with max amount for taxes giving me a pretty big refund in Feb. And with the house I'm kinda expecting more this year. But I can change with withholdings to free up income. I should be able to get about 2k safely with this method. (Tax return last year.  
* stop or reduce 401k contributes. Right now I'm paying about $300 per 2 weeks for 401k.  
* refinance the home loan. I don't know if I can and I don't think I'll get a lower interest rate but I should be able to drop the mortgage insurance $580/month. From when I bought the house I should have about 10% equity due to a combination of buying the house for cheep and normal market changes. Right now I have a fha loan and I was told that the mortgage insurance will never drop off of that loan.  
* ask parents for money. Not only do I not want to do this, I don't know if they can even help.  
* ask you lot for more options  
  
Edit:  
Required Bills:  
(Included in the 1500 total spending)  
Water - $200/2 months  
Electric - $100/2 months  
Phone - $140/month  
Gas - $50/month  
Internet - $50/month  
  
(Not included)  
Mortgage - $4250/month  
Car insurance - $95/month  
School loan - $225/month  
  
Outside of this we aim to keep total spending below 1k on the card that pays the bills (first section) and less then 500 on the other (1500 total). That gives about 1k total for food and other diversionary spending. Like I said we can cut some stuff from there, like Netflix, and we can be more conservative with other spending in general. But this is already about 50% of where we were before the house.  
  
Edit 2:  
Income is probably useful..  
Salary - $115,000  
Cash bonus - $14,000 (in March)  
Stock bonus - ~$3000 (in March)  
  
After all the stuff I take home $2650 biweekly  
401k matching is up to 6% (matching 1/2%)  
  
Edit 3:  
Thanx for your feedback. I know I have lots of options I was just having issues sorting out the best ones. So here is my plan:  
* I'm going to adjust my irs withholds. I looked at the irs withholding calculator and it says I should take 14 allowances at this point. That seems high but we are more then half way though the year. I'm gunna double check anyway. Assuming that's correct that'll be $430 per pay check.  
* reduce my 401k conditions to 6% that way I keep the matching. That'll get me $150 per pay check.  
  
Assuming everything is correct, between those 2 I'll have about an extra 1k per month. If shit is still flying I'll reduce the last of my 401k followed by looking into a 0% cc to hold me over if I think a few months is all I need.  
  
Finally, the fail safe is to sell the house. I don't think (hope) that the housing market won't go down that much in less then a year.",finance

**Second**, I have some more specific questions about the Inherited IRA. I moved the IRA because it wasn't growing significantly with Morgan Stanley over 2 years or so. I think they made my portfolio too conservative. I also want to reduce unnecessary costs.

* Questions on the IRA:
   * What do you guys think of a plan to select 2 or 3 ETFs, maybe in technology and cannabis, and let it sit?
   * I saw a lot of articles suggesting Target Retirement funds. Does that make sense for a $50k IRA?
   * Stupid question - selling positions inside the IRA to then buy new positions is not taxable, right? (just want to be absolutely sure)

personalfinance,Is this the best way for me to tackle my debt?,"I recently have a new job after several years of being unemployed and then subsequently underemployed. I am attempting to be debt free in the next five years. I am able to pay approximately 50% of my take home pay towards my debt at this time. This is the plan I have set up so far:

LoC: $10, 327 @ 9.19% interest rate; 1400 per month

Student Loan 1: $7,089 @ 5.7% interest rate; minimum payment $150/month until LoC paid off, then $1,650 per month.

Student Loan 2: $13,238 @ 3.7% interest rate; minimum payment $150/month until SL1 paid off, then $1,800 per month.

Car loan: $11,500 @ 0.5% interest rate; $324 a month minimum payment until SL2 paid off, then $2,100 per month.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from any general comments about this plan, I am curious if I should aggressively pay off my car loan following other debt due to the low interest rate or put that money towards my RRSP? At this rate, I estimate I will be debt free in two years.

In addition to this debt, I have an emergency fund, contribute monthly to an RRSP (albeit not much at this point &amp; have a lot of contribution room left), and some money in a TFSA.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

personalfinance,Using 0% Balance Transfer to Accelerate Mortgage Payments and Drop PMI,"I am currently trying to pay down my mortgage as quickly as possible in order to reduce total interest paid, and ultimately drop PMI, which my mortgage provider has indicated I can ask for once I get to 80% LTV.  I have included the details of the mortgage payment below, but essentially I am paying 7% of the monthly payment towards PMI, in addition to the 3.625% of interest on the outstanding principal.  We are currently budgeting an additional $1,200 per month to make an additional payment each month and help pay down the balance faster.

&amp;#x200B;

I received an email offer for 0% balance transfer for 15 months.  There would be a 3% one time fee.  My understanding of balance transfers is that they also provide checks that you can use to pay down other loans (other than just standard credit card to credit card balance transfers).  

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my back of the napkin calculations, I would pay $464 dollars up front for the balance transfer of $18,547.  If I were to pay this balance off equally each month over the 15 months of 0%, I would have to pay $1,236 per month.  However, I would then be saving $93 per month on the mortgage from dropping PMI, as well as a reduced amount of principal I would be paying interest on.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing anything in my calculations, or is there anything else I should be considering in my decision making process?  I recognize that I would be taking on some additional risk, that if I were to not pay back the 0% credit card by the end of the 15 months that the rate would skyrocket, and I could end up paying quite a bit of interest.  Other than that is there any other downside to how I am thinking about this?

&amp;#x200B;

Appreciate any advice or comments in advance!  Please let me know if any additional information would be helpful or make a difference in the decision making process.

personalfinance,"Refinance or leave it alone? 14Y $174k left @ 7.8% Interest; primary residence: Long Island, NY","I live at home with my widowed mother. We are currently $174k left, 14 years left, interest rate at 7.8%. We are in a position now where my brother who lives out of state meets the salary requirements to be able to refinance. The house is worth $450k on the market as per Zillow.

The reason why our interest is at a 7.8% is because the house is classified as a second mortgage. However, there is no first mortgage. Before my father passed he had paid off my mother’s house in full. He bought a second property a block away to be a rental property. He was diagnosed with cancer a few years later and passed away within a 2 month diagnosis window (October 2007.) My brothers and I were in college at the time,  my mother had to sell the other house to pay for the clearly failed cancer treatments, daily expenses, etc. BoA worked with her to get the mortgage off the rental property which was sold, and onto the paid off primary residence, classifying it as a second mortgage despite the fact there is and never was a first mortgage. The classification is why the interest is at 7.8%. It comes to $1850 per month, split between the brothers (3 including myself) that doesn’t include the property nor school taxes (Long Island) that I pay in full when it comes due every 6 months: 

$2700 in school, $1700 in property x 2 = $8800 per year. The Home Insurance is not wrapped in ($1400 a year.)

My brother who had landed a great paying job just got a raise that gives us the opportunity to refinance. However his taxes are out of state, and his pay stubs are out of state. Meaning, as per the lender, to have my mom eligible to have an out of state immediate family member (her son) to be on the loan for the refinance, the lender needs to qualify my mom as essentially too poor to pay the mortgage: they need to roll in her $12k in credit card debt. She collects $500 month in social security which has been going to paying minimums on these cards. These cards have been used to pay water bills and last years home insurance ($1400), and are the leftover of her debts from years ago, since my father’s passing.

I myself already have a home that I bought with my wife for my in laws. That one is at $290k left. My wife pays that entirely out of her paycheck, as she is the breadwinner for her family. My paycheck goes to my mother’s house and one day, we hope to move out into a condo that is under my name, after proving I don’t make payments to house we bought for my in laws in 2015. My in laws didn’t have the credit, the entire family was being kicked out of their living arrangement, I had a kick ass credit score and my wife saved $20k herself = let’s buy them a house.

So the refinance we are being offered at the current much lower rate at 4.575% for 15 years, with the 12k mom debt wrapped in, with the property &amp; school taxes wrapped in, the home insurance wrapped in (we have a pending quote for $865 a year vs $1400 we had been paying per year on credit cards), takes us a to a monthly payment my brothers and I can’t afford to split (in consideration of their rent): $2400 a month. We pushed the lender to offer us a 30 year, which he didn’t want to do, to make the monthly more feasible: back to $1850. 

We are at the final stages and are unsure if it’s worth all of this. The new 30year loan at 4.8% increased the mortgage from $174k to $210k (12k cc debt, $16k in closing costs.) The closing cost number jumped at me as a last minute surprise as well, unsure if that’s normal. The monthly may look the same but it’s technically not, we have taxes and home insurance rolled in, so I am not dropping $4400 in cold hard cash every 6 month. We are at the point of pulling the trigger. Should we?


Edit:
- in Long Island, Mom qualifies for Star Enhanced, which saves her about $300 every 6 months on school taxes, starting January 2019 when she is 62
- we are aware the interest rate is supposed to go up this month, and two more times before the end of the year (source: news...)",finance

personalfinance,Break before starting a new job = no disability insurance?,"OK, so my husband is a healthy, active, 30-something dude. He’s also currently our family’s only income-earner, since we recently moved for his job and I’m still looking for a job in our new state (CA). 

He was recently recruited away from his 6-figure finance job to a position at another bank, and he's decided to take 2 weeks off before starting his new job in order to travel a bit, and attend his friends’ bachelor party. (Note: The itinerary of this bachelor party includes some extreme hikes and potentially dangerous, outdoorsy activity.)

So our health insurance won’t have any gaps in coverage, but his income protection plans (short and long term disability, and life/add coverage), understandably, would. 

In part because of the aforementioned dangerous trip—as well as the fact I used to work in the life/disability insurance space before we moved, AND I recently had a sister rely on her own late husbands’ benefits—particularly long-term disability. (Backstory: My sister had to quit her job to become my bro-in-law’s full-time caregiver after complications from a heart surgery left him paralyzed and very sick for a year, and eventually caused his death at the age of 32. This was all so tragic and financially draining for them, and I could not imagine how much harder this would have been for our family if they hadn’t had his income partially covered throughout, as well as his modest life benefit following his death.

Of course my situation is different than my sisters’, since my husband is healthy and has literally never even taken a sick day from the job he’s held for the past 10 years. I know there’s no reason to logically fear anything would happen in those 2 weeks. But, because of the above-mentioned reasons, and my obviously anxious nature, I’m really nervous about these 2 weeks where my husband won’t be covered for disability. I’ve looked into it briefly, and it doesn’t seem like we have any real options for getting disability coverage during this short gap. It kind of makes sense, since he won’t have any income to insure during that period, but he is an extremely high earner taking 2 weeks off before his next, even higher-earning job starts--so it’s not like there’s nothing to protect, you know? 

I assume we’d be able to get him an individual term life separately, but I’m not super worried about that for some reason. (should I be??)  It’s more the idea of him getting hurt on this hike or something, and he’s not able work for a month or 3 or more. Then this new job will disappear and we’d totally eat through our hard-earned savings…eek!

My insurance background tells me that our situation would be very low risk for an insurer like Aflac or whatever, but it doesn’t seem like there’s any std/ltd options out there for people without an active income. It just sucks, because he is under contract to begin earning an even higher income in just 2 weeks, so it’s kind of a catch-22, you know? My husband thinks I’m nuts, but I just thought I’d ask—are there any realistic options to get him disability coverage in these 2 weeks? His job ends in 3 days!",finance

I have two credit cards that are open that have about $1,500 in total between the two that both have interest rates of about 12%. I then have two closed cards that are with a debt consolidation company at a interest rate of 7%, but I pay $250 a month and only $200 of that goes to the credit cards that combined between the two, amount to $7,000 total. I then have to pay my girlfriend monthly for a $3,000 “loan” which is on two separate cards, $2,000 of which has no interest until next year and the other $1,000 has a 15% interest rate. In total, I pay about $550 a month spread across these cards and that is barely paying over the minimum payments so I am barely see improvement due to the interest rates hitting it back and I have no extra funds because of other bills. 

My main questions here is: I have been pre-approved for a $11,000 loan that has a huge interest rate of 32%, would it be worth it to use that now and consolidate all the payments into a $450 a month payment and not have to worry about all the separate payments, or am I better off doing what I’m doing now?

APIs are different than the actual oracles that connect the APIs to the blockchain. Yes banks and their APIs are centralized but if you want to do any kind of fiat transaction payment it's always going to be like that. That's why cypto is used before being converted at the last step.

What ChainLink does is allows you to trust the oracle service that will connect that bank's API or any other API you need, to the blockchain of your choice. The nice thing about ChainLink is that it is a one-stop-shop for any APIs you want to connect to a smart contract.

The reason why so many people talk about banking and ChainLink is the fact that they are the only oracle partnered with Swift using their ISO 20022 standard. Swift will allow ChainLink to connect directly to any bank account to freeze, transfer, etc funds.

Why do I need chainlink to trust the bank API? The info is centralized. You have no choice but to trust the bank info if you want to use it. Coming from the financial sector, I suspect the actors involved will build their own oracles to the ETH standard.

Bonds, interest rate derivatives, insurance settlements, etc.

Will a centralized oracle function for a lot of these use-cases? Sure. But when you have a smart contract with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line there is no room for error, and having a single point of failure makes you vulnerable

Even if 99.999% of the time the data is totally fine, there just isn’t any room for that .0001% of error with some of the institutions who are considering adoption.

Imagine having an API just have a hiccup and it disperses 100mm.

You would use the APIs from each of those sources, and if they found consensus about whatever data you specify, then the smart contract would execute.

Furthermore each contract will essentially be secured by link, where if a node provides false data, the link is taken.

The project wasn’t marketed to us ‘Linkies’ really. 30mm of the 32mm crowd sake was pre-sold to institutional investors/clients who will be running the bulk of the serious nodes. You get to choose which nodes run your contracts.

No I'd use the source's eth oracle and my own custom contract to determine accuracy of the data according to my needs and weights, with failovers. There's really no reason to put another institution between an end user and the source.

How would your contract determine the accuracy of the data with needs, weights and fail overs?

For example, if I need to know the 10 year US Treasury yield for my smart contract , and Bloomberg glitches or is hacked and falsely tells me the 10yrT yield is at 5.00% instead of 2.95% as it is today, how would your contract know that to be false?

I don’t think you can program accuracy parameters in all use cases.

In 99.99% of cases the data from the sources' oracles are consistent and no further action is required. In the handful of cases where the data is inconsistent, the failover data is incorporated according my own tolerances and standards. if the data is still not adequate, i halt execution and pull all the info to a human. How would a smart contract know which data source is inaccurate vs untruthful?

personalfinance,"Colonoscopy/Upper Scope screening below age 50, and Insurance.","Hi, I'm hoping someone can give me a little bit of info here.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I was having symptoms of what could have been Colon cancer. Pencil thin stools, extreme rectal bleeding (im talking the toilet would look like someone was murdered), constant diarrhea, gas, and bloating. I saw a doctor, and he referred me to Gastroenterology. They said it was really concerning and referred me immediately to get a colonoscopy within a week. The fact that she ordered it so soon was alarming. I got the colonoscopy and an upper scope at the same time. No colon cancer or polyps, however I have what they say is pre-Barrett's esophagus and incredibly bad internal hemorrhoids.  


My insurance at the time was a high deductible health plan. I am understanding that this was not typical screening because of my age, so the federal law didn't affect the bill at all and I was charged, billed straight to my HDHP and left me with a bill of almost $2500 to pay out of pocket.  


My question is, is there any way to get around this and have the law work on my side to help pay for this screening? I absolutely cannot afford this bill, but I had to get the screening done because what is money if you're dead because of cancer.  


And, to note, I have found many scientific studies explaining that advanced and aggressive colon cancers are on the rise in people under the age of 50. Is there any way to use these journals to my advantage? Thank you for any assistance you may give.",finance

So to make sure I understand, lets say I make $60,000 and my healthcare with my domestic partner is $15000, $5000 of which I cover and $10000 of which my employer covers. So the $5000 we would still be paying, and then 50% of the $10000 (so another $5000) I would be paying taxes on. So in essence, it would be like paying taxes on $65000. Is my thought process correct on this? And then are there any other tax implications on a state or federal level? Thank you for your help.",finance

.

.

.

Now that I have your attention, just to give you a little background on me so you guys can have all the necessary info.

I am a 27 year old living in Texas

Income: Around 60k a year after taxes, I have around 60k in the bank currently.

Finances:  currently my credit score is 800+ (rarely does it stay that way)

Debt: I owe 9k on my school loan and around 2k on my car (paying that off soon as I refinance)

Rent: On my Duplex, Apt A, on Apt B there is family living and I charge around 850 a month, the other side I pay.

Property: I have two duplexes, one is my parents which is under my name (Edit: Its paid already), another one is the one I recently purchased (March of 2017) This is what I currently owe and all the details that I could find on my duplex:

Type of loan: FHA (Want to change this to Conventional, I wasn't aware of the different types of loan and no one told me about it, fail.)

Original loan amount: 171k

Principal that I currently owe: Around 167k

Interest Rate: 4.375%

Term: 360 Months

Monthly Payment: 1,437.30

&amp;#x200B;

My Goal: I want to refinance the loan into a conventional so more money can go into the principal instead of just fees and interest, I want to give 55-60k which is more than 20 percent of the loan to get the payments down and I can keep more money. Be able to save and enjoy little bit more, maybe travel.

&amp;#x200B;

Question: now I am still not as familiar with all the types of loans that are out there, just wanted to ask anybody from experience so I don't make the same mistake again,

What questions I should ask?

Should I do a 20 year or 30? Considering I would maybe refinance in another 5 to 10 years.

How do I know whats the best loan for me?

Why is the sky blue?

.

.

.

In all seriousness, I appreciate everyone's input on this, its not a small steps and I have 3 years worth of savings that I want to invest in this duplex for extra income.

&amp;#x200B;

TL; DR -  I want to refinance my loan into a Conventional and lower my monthly payment so I can travel more and at the same time be able to save. What should I be looking for in the type of loan and what questions should I ask?",finance

personalfinance,Auto Refinance from 25.99% or Take Out a Personal Loan?,"So I'm currently financing a car loan for 40 months with an annual interest rate of 24.99% (I was clueless at the time and my parents were the ones who got me signed up for this deal).
The amount I financed is $7,592.57 and I payed 13 months so far with monthly payments of $284

Now I recently found this subreddit and realize I could refinance and I'm trying to figure out if I'm a good fit for it.
My credit score is currently around 704-705 after a inquiry hit (from 710) for applying for a credit card and got approved for another $1,000.

I saw that credit karma gave me some refinancing options through autopay (2.34%), IFS (2.74%), and Chase (4.69%). However, these three would extend my term for 6 more months making it from 28 months to 36 months.

However all of them is a no mainly because my car is a 2007 Honda Accord and they only do it for cars above 2010 - 2011

My balance remaining is around $5,600, I'm considering taking a personal loan out for around $5,000 with a lower interest rate then pay off my car right away with that loan. 

I'm currently also paying for car repairs that cost me $500 and still needs an extra arm control job that would cost me $200. I honestly don't want to keep this car because the amount of repairs i've done on it has been around $1,200 so far.

I honestly am stumped and feel trapped. Any ideas?",finance

devops,Moving large company to DevOps,"I would like some help, pointers or ideas, that could help me implement DevOps in a company I work for. Sorry in advance for a very large post. Or if it is innapropriate for this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

The company wants to move to DevOps model, but that is pretty much all that was decided :)

&amp;#x200B;

While looking through this sub, I noticed that the majority of posts and comments talk about automation and container tools, or that DevOps is a culture not tools. I would like to dig in to more of a culture aspect and how it can be stimulated from management to tools.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL/DR:**

\- &gt; 300 Dev team members, \~150 Ops team members (including Service and Help desk)

\- only on premise solutions due to compliance reasons

\- Jira will be a must, no similar solution is used right now

\- we use GitLab for source control + GitLab CI  (can be switched)

\- HashiCorp Consul, Nomad are deployed, Vault is in progress

\- went through a merger with major competitor

\- 2 major Dev silos, which further down are more silos

\- Ops (support) is very short staffed, SysAdmins don't do applications only OS or vendor solutions

\- QA/Testers do only manual testing

\- deploys are performed either by QA or Dev

\- only some of the critical systems are monitored, others are not

\- executives support is very high

&amp;#x200B;

**P.S.** I did read Project Phoenix (management focus is because of this book), but did not get my hands on DevOps Handbook yet.

&amp;#x200B;

**My ideas:**

**Management:**

\- Setup Jira with one shared project for the company, with task types per repeated job (ex: server setup).

\- Business projects are represented by epics, requirements by user stories (rolled up into epic), task are tasks (rolled up into user story).

\- A lot of boards (personal, team, project, overview, etc).

**Infrastructure:**

\- Hashicorp Nomad for container/job orchestration

\- Hahsicorp Consul for service discovery + security through connect

\- Hashicorp Vault for secrets

\- Hashicorp Terraform where possible or needed

\- CEPH to replace some of the SANs

\- LXD to replace some of the virtualization

**Automation:**

\- Gitlab

\- Jira

\- Gitlab CI

&amp;#x200B;

**History:**

Company (not in the USA or EU) recently bought and merged one of the major competitors. The merger left us with quite a large tech debt, almost no monitoring and a very siloed teams.

Due to compliance reasons we can mostly run on premise solutions, cloud solutions can only used in a very limited fashion.

No centralized work management solution is implemented yet (email and phone for now), but Jira is will be rolled out soon.

Automation (for IT) is pretty much non existent, however business side is very automated. We have about 20 major systems, upwards of 200 minor systems and more than 2000 additional integration and business services.

Recently Dev rolled out a suite of Hashicorp tools (+ a bunch of other opensource tools) to build out our containerization platform. It was and is one of the best experiences so far. We plan to push Consul also into non containerized workloads to do service discovery and systems health monitoring.

In fact one of the main reasons why we chose Hashicorp tools instead of Kubernetes was that it is very easy in deployment and low-maintenance in Ops, as we did not get cooperation from Ops other then compute resources.

From culture standpoint we have a very big problem right now. In the merger Dev teams from the other side were not merged into Dev from original company. Before the merger there was a lot of tension and even hatred between companies (think Google and Microsoft or Pepsi and Coke). Internal Dev and Ops cultures were quite different, even opposite. Original had strict dress code and work times, while the other one did not have any dress code or time control.

On the other hand Ops teams were merged into one, but a lot of people were let go or quit. Ops now is smaller then it was before in the original company before the merger.

To end on a good note: execs and everyone else do see a problem in this and want to fix it, so support for many internal initiatives is very high.

&amp;#x200B;

Well that was quite a big post :). Thank you for reading it to the end and hope for your help.",technology

personalfinance,Double checking understanding of avoiding tax penalty by withholding 100% of last year's tax owed.,"Wife and I have both job and I also have freelance income. I haven't paid any estimated payments this year on the freelance income, bank interest, etc., but had wanted to just cover that by additional withholding from my or my wife's jobs.

It seems that if one has paid in (either via quarterly estimated tax payments OR additional withholding from a job) 100% of last year's total tax owed, your won't get a penalty if you underpay this year (though you will owe more taxes at tax time, of course). For example, from [Turbo Tax's site](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/small-business-taxes/estimated-taxes-common-questions/L1luHqVdl):

&gt; If your prior year Adjusted Gross Income was $150,000 or less, then you can avoid a penalty if you pay either 90 percent of this year's income tax liability or 100 percent of your income tax liability from last year (dividing what you paid last year into four quarterly payments). This rule helps if you have a big spike in income one year, say, because you sell an investment for a huge gain or win the lottery. If wage withholding for the year equals the amount of tax you owed in the previous year, then you wouldn't need to pay estimated taxes, no matter how much extra tax you owe on your windfall.

So, to check this, I got out our 2017 federal 1040 and found on line 63 what says ""This is your **total tax**:"" and that amount was $2,714.

I then just checked today's pay stub from my wife's job, and for Fed Withholding YTD, it lists $2,738.89. 

**So, since $2,739 YTD withheld is more than 100% of last year's total tax of $2,714, are we all set for the year in terms of avoiding an underpayment penalty?** There is nothing further we need to do (other than be sure to have enough cash to pay what will amount to a few thousand in self-employment income for 2018)?",finance

financialindependence,Unique FIRE Situation For Relatives in Taiwan,"Hello, I'm posting here because I have a unique situation where I need to plan how to FIRE that I haven't been able to find relevant posts or guides that covers it.

My uncle in Taiwan suffered a fairly severe stroke that leaves him unable to work anymore and requires a live-in aid, plus he has a wife and 2 kids. Fortunately, my grandfather left the family a nest-egg of $20,000,000 NTD (About $650,000 USD) and my uncle lives in an apartment owned by my aunt rent free. My grandmother has been the trustee since my grandfather passed away, but she hasn't done anything with the money. It used to sit in a savings account earning 4% interest which she lived off of it comfortably, but now the interest rate is under 1% and she has to make monthly withdrawls from the principal to help with my uncle's living expenses. 

I'd like to take what I learned about FIRE to help her get her finances in line, but there's some differences that I'm not clear on.

For one, they live in Taiwan and the money is sitting in a Taiwanese bank account in NTD. I don't think the TWSE Index fund would be able to yield 7% long-term average, given the instability and economic stagnation the country is experiencing. If I asked them to invest it in an index fund like I'm doing, they'd have to convert NTD to USD and then back to NTD when they want to use the money. From what I could find, the lowest fee's come to 0.5%, so it'd be 1% converting back and forth. Does anyone here from outside the US have experience in investing from abroad and is able to share any insights?

Even with a 1% hit from exchanging currencies, I still think it's preferable to letting it sit an accrue 1% and lose against inflation every year and also eat into the principal amount. Thanks to the LCOL, I think my uncle only needs about a 2.5% withdraw rate, so I'm thinking even bond portfolios with 3% yields would be a step up.

Any input would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer Advice on Mortgage Terms,"I'm currently pre-qualified, working on pre-approval of a home loan and have started the bidding process on a specific place we're in love with.

* The home price is $670,000 (in Los Angeles County)
* We're putting down 5% ($33,500)
* The loan amount is $636,500
* 30 Year Conventional Fixed Loan
* 4.75% interest
* 0.625% points
* Monthly mortgage payment is $3,320, with taxes and insurance it's $4,399

Being absolutely new to this, I'm concerned with a few things. I've gotten a couple of quotes on the loan and that seems to be right along the best I've seen, but isn't that interest rate really high? Probably not fair to look at it this way, but after the 30 years, it shows that I would have paid $558,000 in interest alone on a principal loan of $636,500—is it typical to have almost a 1-to-1 ratio of interest to principal? Also, concerning the monthly payment, our monthly income is approximately $7,000 after tax. The loan officer mentioned after paying the points up-front, our monthly payment would be a little closer to $4,000. Both myself and my wife are inline for promotions this year and hope to bring home an additional $5,000 per year. Is it common for people to stretch themselves this way for the first little while and have the payments get easier as we grow in our careers? Any wisdom and advice would be very much appreciated.

personalfinance,Downgraded house to free up cash to pay off student loan debt. Need some advice.,"I made a post here about this around 5 months ago when I was considering this. As of today, I have sold my house and bought a much less expensive house. Now I need to decide where to put the money. I'm 38, self employed, generally net about 70k a year, but it can vary quite a bit.

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8bih67/downgrade_house_to_pay_off_student_loans_looking/

I bought a house for 155k a couple months ago. I sold a house for 245k today. I walked away with 104k on that house. My new mortgage is for 154k at 4.375%. I initially put 5% down and financed costs. I owed 126k on my last mortgage. So, mortgage is a little higher now, but the interest rate is low and it allowed me to free up more cash. 

Student loan debt is 82k. It's breaks down as approximately 42k at 4.23% and 40k at ~6.8%.

Obviously, my first move is to pay off that 40k at 6.8. After that, I'll have about 65k left. I need to put aside at least 30k for renovations on my 'new' house. I'll be doing most of the renovations myself and will have good equity in a couple years. It was appraised at 188k recently. It needs a full gut, and that's what I'm doing (having a project was the other reason I wanted to get a new house; I had finished the last house). So, if I sell after 2 years, I should have another decent lump sum then. 

So, that safely leaves me with 30k to put towards the 42k remaining in student loan debt at 4.23%, or make a lump sum on the mortgage, invest, etc. I have no other debt. What would people recommend? I only have about 10k in savings, so I could also add to that. I'm leaning towards putting it towards student loans, but would like input from people who know better.",finance
worldpolitics,Ann Coulter Gets Fucked (2005),"Sunday, April 24, 2005
The Farmer’s Market on Fairfax and 3rd is a Los Angeles landmark, attracting tourists and everyday Angelinos alike, as well as many famous faces. Among the celebrities I have seen there are Muhammad Ali, Terri Garr, Tyra Banks, Laura Linney, Keenan Ivory Wayans, the guitarist for The Cult, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, and Weird Al Yankovic.

But Ann Coulter is the only celebrity I’ve ever spotted at Farmer’s Market that I wound up fucking in the ass, hard.

It would be fair to observe that my feeling obligated to present the list of celebrities above in roughly Black-White-Black-White order is indicative of my own carefully Liberal sensibilities. And that this sort of conscientiousness is more than a little ridiculous, on examination. But what I notice about myself only on reflection, Ann Coulter seemed to recognize and respond to in an instant, like a puma recognizes an injured giselle. For Ann Coulter is a predator. A predator with a hungry asshole.

I first spotted her sitting at a table in front of The Gumbo Pot with another woman who looked not unlike her, but a generation older (I neglected to ask her at any point subsequently whether this had in fact been her mother). I vaguely recognized her—there’s always a lag time placing faces you know from cable when unconfined to a telescreen—and began to notice, stealing furtive glances up from the copy of Steinbeck I was reading, that she was eyeing me with unsettling scrutiny.

The next thing I knew, her companion (mother?) had left and Coulter was standing over me, looking skeptically at my reading material.
‘The Grapes of Wrath, huh?’
‘Yes’ I said, faking composure. ‘It’s fantastic.’
‘It’s a fantastic primer for vacuous proto-Communists everywhere,’ she said dismissively.
‘I don’t know about that..’
She sighed. ‘I don’t have enough ink in my pen to keep a running list of what you don’t know. May I?’
She motioned to the empty chair next to me.
‘Of course.’ It would be fair to say my voice trembled a little.
She sat and said nothing. Ann Coulter evidently takes an unappreciative view of small talk. That she was eager to continue antagonizing me became evident when I re-opened my recently-insulted book to resume reading. A young man passed in a t-shirt proclaiming ‘Iraq Nam’. She stopped him.
‘1. Haircut. 2. Shower. 3. Get a job, you sniveling hippy,’ she glowered. ‘You’re probably too high to remember that, so write it down--if you can write.’
He looked at her with dismay and scampered away like a kicked cat. She turned to me with bloodlust.
‘What do you think of the war: complete success, or very nearly complete success?’ she asked.
‘Well, in no time—barring the strong possibility of Civil War--we’ll have a democratically-elected anti-US Islamicist government in charge of the world’s second-largest oil reserves, so I’d have to say only very-nearly, on the complete success scale, at a hysterically distorted best.’
She showed her teeth. ‘It sounds to me like you don’t support our troops.’
‘I think that ‘Support Our Troops’ business is the most crass, craven cowardice ever to go unquestioned by the allegedly Liberal media.’
‘Yes? Yes?’ There was oddly growing excitement in her voice.
‘It allows the Administration to absolve itself of responsibility for its own flawed policy. It’s no different than if you sent a classroom of 2nd graders into a burning building, and when anyone objects you throw in their face that they ""don’t support our 2nd graders""’
‘Where do you live?’
‘A few blocks away.’
‘Take me there.’


When we got to my apartment, she looked around glumly.
‘I was thinking you’d have half-burned American flags up on the wall,’ she said, disappointed.
‘That’s ridiculous. I love my country.’
‘Whatever you think that means,’ she said, rolling her eyes. ‘Don’t you have anything nasty to say about the President?’
‘Like what?’
‘Like he’s an imbecile, or corrupt, or a corrupt imbecile—the usual sore-loser bitter chatter.’
‘To be honest, I didn’t like the nasty things that were said about Clinton, and I’ve decided to have respect for the Office, no matter who holds it. I don’t think President Bush is corrupt or an imbecile anyway. Would you like something to drink?’
‘I think maybe this was a mistake,’ she said, starting to go.
‘That’s not to say I don’t disagree strongly with many of his policies and objectives.’
She seemed to reconsider. ‘Like what?’
‘I don’t know. Name one.’
‘Get me a drink first.’


With every point I expressed that ran counter to a view she held, she removed one article of clothing. Soon she sat on my couch naked, gently pulling at her untrimmed pubic hair, staring intently but not quite invitingly at me. The growing hard lump in my throat was just outpaced by the one in my pants. I was a little nervous because we had agreed on the last two points—the need to reconsider the option of nuclear energy, and drilling in the Arctic—and I noticed her oversized nipples were no longer hard. Luckily, she was, by this point, determined.
‘What do you think,’ she began provocatively, ‘of the President’s plan to privatize Social Security?’
I sighed with relief; this was as sure a promise to seal the deal as her asking if I had a condom.
‘I think it’s a payoff to the Americans the President has always been most intent on pleasing: the richest 1%.’
‘What do you mean?’ she cooed. I noticed her nipples hardening once more. She dropped to her knees in front of me. She pushed me backwards and positioned my legs up in the air.
‘A stock’s value is even now only partially tied to the actual value of any publicly traded company. But who’s going to profit from inflated valuations when stock prices swell irrationally from the forced, artificial injection of capital?
Her breath was hot on my ‘taint as she lifted my scrotum. ‘Yes? Yes?’
‘You might as well shoehorn billions of dollars into the Baseball Card market. The price of a Derek Jeter rookie will be driven up to hundreds of thousands of dollars—before the bubble bursts and the whole market crashes massively.’ It was getting hard to stay on point as she tongue-fucked my shitter vigorously.
‘Don’t..Stop!!’ her contorted mouth pled from my butthole.
‘The top 1% will sell stocks at the inflated valuations to the novice investors-by-necessity, the market will swell and crash, and the same 1% will come back and re-purchase their holdings at pennies on the dollar. Meanwhile, Social Security will go bankrupt and all the novice investors will be eating catfood for the duration of their ""golden years,'’ barring a massive Federal bailout several hundred times in excess of what the Savings &amp; Loan scandal cost us.’
She sprung up on the couch on all fours and looked over her shoulder at me. She pointed to her twitching, puckered anus. ‘See this?’
I nodded eagerly.
‘I want you to wreck it.’
I spit on my skeezer-pleaser and, prying her ass cheeks apart like a hot dinner roll, drove it home, into the biggest browneye I had ever seen. She gurgled contentedly. Every thrust of my babymaker was met with a wrenched squeal as I grabbed her by the hips and began really leaning into it.
‘Harder!’ she begged, ‘Harder!! Tell me what you think of Chomsky!’
‘I..think..he’s..brill..iant..but..I..don’t really agree with much of his stance on Israel, and--’
‘You’re slowing down!’ she snapped. ‘DON’T SLOW DOWN!’
I went back to punishing her asshole, giving no thought whatsoever to compassionate conservatism as her chocolate socket gnawed on my pork pipe. She was babbling now, as out of a delirious reverie.
‘Feed it,' Ann Coulter rasped. 'Feed my hungry asshole!'
I buried her face in a throw pillow and she swiveled her hips back on my fuckstick with obvious appreciation. My pace quickened as my man-magma built towards eruption.
‘Wait!’ she gasped, sensing the fuse on my yogurt cannon was burning quick. ‘I want to take you ass-to-mouth!’
I withdrew from her puckerhole with an audible ‘pop’ and she scrambled around, gulping at my wang-dang-doodle as though the lives of all her loved ones hinged on her marks for enthusiasm. Her eyes rolled up pleadingly as she threw her head down again and again on my magic johnson. I knew what she wanted.
‘There is a specter haunting Europe,’ I began, and she started to convulse spasmodically with her own thrashing orgasm, her head now dribbling in a blur against my groin. I repeated every Karl Marx quote I could think of until I reached my own ‘historic inevitability’ and launched surge after surge from my hairy boda bag. I ejaculated with what seemed like enough force to blow out the back of her head--but her head was made of stronger stuff. She sputtered, gobbled and gulped what I’d have to call a very liberal, even radically so, quantity of hot splooey.
Once she caught her breath, she wiped her mouth, stood, and took me by the hand.
‘Let’s go to the bathroom.’
‘Why?’
She seemed surprised I had to ask. Her tone was that of someone reminding another of something too obvious to need mention.
‘Uh, so I can get in the tub and you can piss all over me?’



I sat in a robe and watched her as she dressed.
‘Will I see you again?’ I asked tentatively.
‘Sure,’ she said, pointing to the TV. ‘On that.’
Some moments passed. I tried to dispel the awkward silence.
‘Well, nice meeting you,’ I offered.
‘You’ve really got a gift for tedious small talk,’ she shot back.
I was a little hurt and, recognizing this, she softened just a shade as she reached for her purse to leave.
‘Hey.’
‘Yes?’ I asked.
‘Thanks for not staring at my adam’s apple.’
‘No problem.’
She let herself out without another word, and I sat in the late afternoon silence alone. I considered how it felt to be a disposable instrument in someone’s personal debasement fantasy.

All in all, it didn’t feel too bad.

personalfinance,Questions on understanding the tax burden of 1099-MISC income on top of W-2,"I'm looking to gain some insight and clarification on understanding how taking on some outside consultant work will affect my tax situation.  I've reviewed some sidebar wiki and still have unanswered questions.

I'm currently full-time employed as a W-2 with decent income.  Standard withholdings as well as insurance and 401k contributions are deducted from this pay.  I've been offered an exciting side gig and am currently negotiating my wage for that role.  I want to understand my tax burden so I can value the time:work ratio against the net income it will generate and not the gross.

Because my pay will be regular and &gt;$600 annually I'll make quarterly submissions on federal self-employment rate of 15.3%.  And while my 1099 income will pass-through my LLC which I'll convert to S-Corp, my overhead and expenses will still be low compared to revenues.  Most of my net revenue will then be subject to income tax.

So, here's my main question.  The 1099-MISC income will be added to W-2 income on my 1040 at tax time to get my annual gross.  If I'm already in the 22% bracket after standard deduction, does this  in theory mean that my actual tax burden on the additional 1099 income is taxed 15.3% (fed self emp) + 4.36% (state) + 22% (fed income)?  In plain English, the marginal tax rate is calculated over my combined gross (W-2 income + 1099 revenues), correct?  If I'm making 60k gross now and with the outside income make 75k gross all that additional 15k is taxed at the highest marginal rate, right?

Am I really going to be taxed almost 42% on my additional income?",finance
personalfinance,Help me make sense of the interest I'm being charged?,"Today was the closing date on my Discover card. I was charged $18.69 in interest, and after looking over my CMA/statement, I've found the following info:

* Discover uses the ""Daily Balance Method (including current transactions)"" to calculate what interest is being charged on
* My balance subject to interest rate is $927.01
* My total closing statement balance was $1668.27
* I have $163.93 in pending charges

personalfinance,"Accidentally Claimed 3 on My Taxes, Should Have Been 0","Hi, all.  


I started at my current job in late October, 2017 while I was finishing my last few weeks at a different job. When I filled out my W-4 for my current job, I wound up claiming 3 exemptions when I should have claimed 0. It was my first time filling out a W-4 while being employed by more than one business. I didn't really know what to do, and thought I'd done it correctly. When I filed my 2017 taxes this past winter, instead of my usual refund, I was shocked to find that I owed just under $2k between my Federal and State Taxes.   


Current problem: I only just corrected this error with my boss today. What can I do, if anything, to prevent myself from once again having to pay a huge chunk of my money in taxes in early 2019?

personalfinance,Should I refinance my FHA loan?,"I need help deciding whether to refinance my mortgage. I’ve talked to two different companies and both just seemed bothered with me asking questions. 

I want to refinance to remove the MIP on my FHA loan. 

The hubs and I bought our home back in April of 2017 for $510,000 with an interest rate of 4.25% and a monthly MIP payment of $340 (this MIP will stay on my loan forever unless we refinance).  Our current balance is $487,000 and according to Redfin.com our current property value is $608,000.  We know that our house should appraise for more than $510,000 because we completely remodeled one half of the house (new living room, new kitchen, new plumbing in kitchen and new water heater) but not sure if $610,000 is an accurate figure.  

Loan Depot told me that because my loan to value is too high, I only qualify for a Lender Pays Mortgage Insurance loan, with an interest rate of 4.75%.  When I asked about how much closing cost fees were, the telephone agent told me not to worry about it because they would be included in the new loan.  I asked him to please provide me an email with all the details so that I could think about it. I never got the email. 

Wells Fargo was equally annoying.  They ran our credit and decided to use my husbands credit score, which is about 70 points lower than mine. When I asked why they did that, they did not give me an answer and just changed the subject.  They offered a refinance with 5% interest with a loan total of $502,000 and a monthly PMI payment of $90 for the next four years (then it would automatically drop off). They had already told me that closing costs would be $3,000 so I asked why my loan would jump from $487,000 to $502,000.  Again, I just got the run around.  They explained that this loan offer would be contingent on our home appraising for $610,000. 

I REALLY want to get rid of MIP but I’m EXTREMELY hesitant to take on a higher interest rate AND tack on an extra $15,000 to my loan. 

We are currently paying an extra $200 towards our principal bringing our monthly principal payment to $900.  On top of that, I have about $1,000 extra income per month that I had wanted to set aside for savings but could potentially pour into our mortgage.  My husband will get a $10,000 bonus at the end of the year and we are expecting at least $5,000 back in taxes in the new year so I’m thinking we should just wait, throw as much money as we can into the mortgage and HOPE that property values stay high and interest rates stop climbing, then refinance next year. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Retirement advice,"Hello,

I am thinking about buying 10 year individual municipal bonds in part of my ira. My goal is to secure my money and hopefully sell them for a profit if we go into a recession. These allocation would be my only bond part, and the rest would be in equities and dividend stocks. 

I know bond funds exist, but they tend to be more volatile, esp with interest rate rises.

Since I plan to hold these bonds or sell them when interest rates drop, is this idea smarter than buying a muni bond fund?

Also how safe are individual municipal bonds? I plan to start withdrawing from retirement in 5 years. If the bonds must be held, I would sell my stocks",finance

personalfinance,"Applying for promotion, need help with salary negotiations if I get it","I work in a manufacturing warehouse and I'm currently an hourly employee applying for a salaried supervisor position at my current plant. My boss got promoted, and I'd be applying for his position and would still be directly under him. My concern is that the company may not be willing to offer what I think I would require, not because of my qualifications but due to the difference in overtime being a thing for me currently.

Gleaming information from my boss before he got promoted his salary was around $50k per year for roughly 45 hours per week. If my department was operating at full staff the decision would be a no brainer as my normal pay is around $30k per year working a straight 40. However, due to promotions out of the department and lazy workers quitting we are woefully understaffed and I am on track to make $45k this year after averaging 55 hours per week. And because of us being so short staffed my hours would barely change should I be offered the supervisor position, but my responsibilities would go up as I'd still need to do my current job to some extent.

I think a fair salary would be minimum $55k, which is slightly above the median income in my state for this type of position according to sites like glassdoor.com, but I think is deserved given the increased responsibilities and no end in sight to the 50+ hour weeks. But even this seems ""low"" as I would be able to make nearly that should I end up having to consistently work 60+ hour weeks currently, which is seemingly more likely. Yes, it would mean if/when things level out I'd be slightly overpaid, but they are filling the position now and not 6 months (or more) down the road.

This would also be the first position I would be negotiating for as all my prior jobs have been hourly work where I didn't feel the need to negotiate as the offers were significantly better than where I was at or were side gigs where I wasn't too concerned with the details.

Aside from laying out the facts as stated above, what other avenues would you all recommend I prepare for the interview process in regards to my concern over the salary? 

Thanks for any input you all can give.",finance
personalfinance,Can my mom do anything about her HELOC payments increasing beyond her ability to pay?,"My mom is in a predicament that she is worried about being unable to pay her HELOC. After my dad missed a credit card payment of ~3k because the money wasn’t in the bank and the payment bounced, my mom began to uncover a lot of stuff she had no idea was happening. Turns out they had managed to rack up a LOT of money in debt that my dad, who did the finances, hadn’t been paying at all. They ended up with a HELOC to wrap up all their debt, totaling a whopping $167k. Her house is worth probably between 425-450k, which is virtually nothing in the Seattle market. 

Not long after, my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. He then had some serious health complications that rapidly progressed his disease. In less than 60 days after his diagnosis, he wound up permanently in a nursing home as his Alzheimer’s is too far progressed for him to stay safely at home. 

Medicaid is taking his entire social security paycheck to pay for his nursing home expenses. Thus, my mom’s income has been cut virtually in half, but her bills are relatively the same. She makes about $2400/month. She has to count her pennies weekly in order to stay on track and very much lives paycheck to paycheck now. (She is 56 right now so she can’t retire, whereas my dad is 76.)

At first her HELOC payments were around $450/month, which was doable, and she knew they would increase after the first year. She had kind of thought maybe around $650 but was shocked when her big jump went to nearly $800. Since then, every month the payment is climbing higher and higher. They said it depends on current interest rates.  In probably 5 or so months it has ballooned to $870, with no signs of it stopping from rising each month. Property tax is $400/month thanks to rising home values in the Seattle area, and she also makes monthly IRS payments, another bill that my dad was forgetting to pay in his last couple years at home. 

I told her to go back to the credit union and ask if she can get it redone because she now has literally half the income she did when they signed on to it. But the credit union said they can not redo it that type of loan anymore. 

She’s so squeezed tight for money right now. She has thought of selling the home and getting rid of the HELOC, but there’s really nowhere for her to go in this area without just buying another house that is ridiculously priced beyond her budget. Moving out of the area means giving up her job that she is lucky to have as she has no skills or education beyond a high school diploma, plus she would then have to think about what she would do with my dad in regards to his care. It seems the best option is to try to stay in her house but get her bills under control. 

Are there options available in her situation? It seems absurd that a HELOC repayment could just keep ballooning every month with no regard to a person’s capacity to actually meet those payments. I feel like maybe we don’t have all the right information, or that there has got to be some other solution we aren’t aware of.  The biggest problem is the uncertainty of how much the HELOC will continue to increase each month. She would love to just have the price controlled so she can plan for it and know that she can afford it. What is out there for her to do?",finance

My questions are:

- What does TLT track exactly? Interest rates?

- Is it the same as buying treasury bonds? The same way that SPY is like buying S&amp;P? In other words is TLT supposed to return 2-3% or whatever the current rate is?

- I read that some people use a portfolio of SPY and TLT in some ratio to get similar returns to SPY with less drawdown. But I also see people saying this is a bad strategy because it doesn’t hold up on a market crash.

- How is TLT typically used? What strategies? Why would you buy it?

personalfinance,"Might need student loan starting next fall, when to stop applying for credit cards","Like many others, I apply for credit cards to get bonuses and maximize my rewards, though I may not be doing it as extreme as others may be. However, I may be applying for a student loan for professional school, which starts in the fall if I get accepted. I have had about four new credit cards within the last 24 months, with one of them being two months ago, and one of them being a few weeks ago. I am currently working full time now, thus if I wanted to apply for new credit cards, I would need to do it while I am still working, so that I have an income to put on my application.

Once professional school starts, I was told that there will be zero time to work (not even a 10 hour a week part time job), thus no income. Almost everybody has to take out loans to cover tuition and living costs. People are warning me that trying to get a sign up bonuses on new credit cards now can result in a higher loan interest rate, and in turn become thousands of extra dollars in interest when I have to pay it back.

personalfinance,AIG Max Accumulator Worth?,"My dad recommended the AIG QoL Max Accumulator life insurance plan for me since I'm 23 and I can get a ""good deal"".

I worry about this plan because I'll probably earn the less money in my early years of work and I'll need that money to buy a house and do all the young spendy things, but I'll be short $6,800 a year. The money breaks even at the age of 43 and I'm basically getting a bunch of money after that but I'm not sure if it would be worth. Since these companies are obviously out for profit, I might be missing something. Have you guys heard of plans like this or have any criticisms or encouragement to give?

personalfinance,3rd Party Employer wants scanned copies of my Passport and SIN card??,"Hello all,

I recently started work in Canada for a company that is based in the US (I'm a Canadian citizen). My company uses a 3rd party company to pay us as contractors in Canada as they deal with all the legal and tax implications. My issue is that the 3rd party company who will be physically paying me is asking me for photocopies of my Passport and my SIN Card in order to set up my account. I have already provided my SIN on my federal and provincial tax forms, so they have the number - is there any reason why I should have to send them a scan of the actual card? 

I'll add that my colleague who started a few months before me and was set up through this same 3rd party company never had to send scans of their passport or SIN card, and the info filled in on their tax and banking forms was sufficient. It seems highly irregular to me to be asking for this info - no other company I've ever worked for has required scans of my personal ID documents. I also don't feel terribly comfortable scanning and sending these files electronically.

My question is, am I being overly paranoid? Does this seem like standard procedure that I should just comply with, even if my co-worker didn't have to? Does anyone know of any documentation that outlines what an employee has to provide to an employer in Canada? Any help would be greatly appreciated as I'd obviously like to get this figured out ASAP in order to get paid :)
Thanks to all in the sub for all the great comments and advice!",finance

Cannabidiol (CBD) Infusion into Healthcare Products Industry Growing Faster Than Expected
September 13, 2018

Palm Beach, FL – (September 13, 2018) – The massive impact of CBD on the healthcare product industry continues to be widely apparent as consumers increasingly show a preference for alternative methods of medicine. A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.   Active companies in the Cannabis markets this week include Cannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTC:NUGS),  Sugarmade, Inc. (OTCPK:SGMD), Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG), Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH).

Cannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTCPK:NUGS) BREAKING NEWS:  Cannabis Strategic Ventures is pleased to announce a joint venture agreement with True Promise Beauty to develop a new skincare line infused with cannabidiols (CBD). Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty’s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.

“The True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,” commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.

The True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.

The agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.

Yu added, “We are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.”

The infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a “high” feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

Sugarmade, Inc. (OTCPK:SGMD), one of the largest publicly traded hydroponics supply companies, yesterday announced SeeThruEquity has initiated coverage on the Company with a price target of $0.30, with the reporting adding, “Sugarmade appears well-positioned to target the large and growing opportunity to supply hydroponics equipment and supplies to the legal cultivation market in the United States through its master marketing agreement with BizRight.”  Jimmy Chan, CEO of Sugarmade commented, “Having Sugarmade highlighted by SeeThruEquity is important to this management team.  Over the past two years, Sugarmade has almost completely restructured.  We have entered one of the fast growing sectors of the American economy, reduced debt levels, added a significant number of personnel, moved our headquarters, and most importantly, positioned our Company for substantial growth.  Based on our growth rates, we now believe our $30 million revenue guidance for next year is very conservative.  We welcome SeeThruEquity’s research coverage and look forward to supplying its analyst a steady stream of news on high quality developments regarding our progress.

Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) yesterday announced that Dr. David M. Feldbaum MD, Fellow, American College of Surgeons (FACS), has been appointed to the Board of Advisors for PYTG.  David M. Feldbaum MD, FACS is certified in vascular surgery by the American Board of Surgery. Dr. Feldbaum completed a surgical residency at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, and a vascular surgery fellowship at the Carolinas Heart Institute in North Carolina. He is affiliated with the Memorial Healthcare System, and Westside Regional Medical Center. He is also a member of the voluntary faculty clinical instructor of surgery at the University of Miami School of Medicine.  Dr. Feldbaum’s presence on the Board of Advisors seeks to bolster its already credential-filled advisory capacity by offering instrumental input on the implementation of whole-care wellness plans, and specific case-relevant treatment plans, related to his area of expertise. Dr. Feldbaum has a unique interest in Medical Cannabis affairs and is a strong advocate of the use of Cannabidiol (CBD) products as part of a health and wellness program for many patients.

Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), a global leader in cannabis research, production and distribution, announced this week that Tilray 2:100, a product produced at Tilray’s federally licensed, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-certified facility in Canada, was successfully imported into the United Kingdom, to supply a pediatric patient in need.  The changing regulatory measures in the United Kingdom (UK) previously prohibited the use of medical cannabis. However, in July 2018, Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced that clinicians will now legally be able to prescribe cannabis-derived medicines to patients with an exceptional clinical need noting “recent cases involving sick children made it clear to me that our position on cannabis-related medicinal products was not satisfactory.”

GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform in a broad range of disease areas. The Company, along with its U.S. subsidiary Greenwich Biosciences, announced last month that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EPIDIOLEX® (cannabidiol) oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age or older. EPIDIOLEX is the first prescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana, and the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days. LGS and Dravet syndrome, which develop in childhood, are rare, severe forms of epilepsy that are notoriously treatment-resistant. Most patients with LGS and Dravet syndrome require multiple seizure medications and the majority are resistant to currently approved AEDs.

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt Payoff vs Bank Loan - what's the difference in the end?,"I have about 10K in credit card debt. Interest rates are varied and go as high as 27%. I was using a method to pay off the highest balance first and I got it down from $2000 to $600 and then an unexpected (I don't have an emergency fund, I know I know) expense hit and I was forced to use the card and now it's ballooned up to $1800 again. 

A friend mentioned to me why don't I get a bank loan and pay off all the credit cards and then just pay the bank one payment. So I was thinking about it but my question is what's the difference? Say I get an loan of 10K, wouldn't I still be paying interest on the bank loan? Maybe I can defer it and pay it off over years but there would still be interest. What would be the point or am I missing something?

personalfinance,Debt making me feel trapped,"Hello everyone I hope you could give me some advice on my debt and money issues. 

My money problems have escalated quite badly in the last 18 months and I am in need of practical advice! Here is a rundown of my current situ:

My job – I work 24hrs a week and earn about £1200 per month. This is fine but then you factor in that I am a mum of two and commute to work four days a week. Commute takes 1.5 hours in car/heavy London traffic both ways, sometimes 2 hours. You can imagine how draining this is. Also, I’m heavily pregnant and struggling because of this. 

Family life – Family take care of kid as childcare here is akin to paying mortgage, hence why I commute to an office over 40 miles from my home, so that I can drop LO to grandparents.

Bills – lucky that my OH pays mortgage and household bills. I TRY to contribute £300 to savings but that’s as much as I can afford.

My outgoings:

Car finance : £230

Car insurance: £130

Monthly petrol: £200 (because of the long commute)

House bill under my name: £150

CC1: £70

CC2: £120

Food/misc: 150/£200 (depending on if there is family/colleague birthdays, new babies etc)

Phone: £40

Savings: £300

Total outgoing: £1320

As you can see the budget is very tight and I rarely get to put £300 away every month.

Car situation: I made a huge mistake of getting a car on finance. I still have 9k to pay off and recently someone hit and dented my car very badly while I was parked up to pick up my son. Thankfully we were not in the car but it meant I don’t know who hit me and cannot claim on insurance. I estimate the cost to fix it will be £500+ but I’m so fed up of spending money on this car – I feel like it is rinsing me out. Not sure how I can even sell it as it’s damaged and on a finance plan. I would need to make some money off it to buy a smaller cheaper model as I need to be able to drive (two kids and London winter without a car is HARD) OH works long hours and can’t always take us out. 

I know there are people worse off than me but right now I feel very, very trapped.

Because of my lack of budgeting etc I now find myself in overdraft. So I get paid £1200 every month but my balance will be £400 after the overdraft eats the majority of my income – that amount alone will only cover my car costs!

It’s a vicious circle and has made me really depressed! Sometimes I wonder if being a working mum is worth it? I feel those on benefits have it so much easier simply by staying at home and not running around, trying to get to work early, pick up grouchy toddlers etc. I can’t even imagine surviving without my OH. He works to put a roof over our head and I work…. For the sake of working, seeing as my money goes down the drain each month!!

Also worth noting I am going on maternity leave in a few months. This means my pay will go down even more and then be nothing.

Next year I will also have to find a family member to watch TWO kids instead of one. Easier said than done when you are faced with constant complaints from the family members who offered to take care of them in the first place. I don’t want my kids to grow up thinking their family considers them a burden L

I do freelance work on the side but this is used to bump up my overdraft which is always teetering on the edge. 

Anyway, sorry for the long post. I figured if I post as much info now there won’t be any questions. 

Anyone out there with some advice? Please be kind!",finance
personalfinance,Need help with student loans,"Hi,

So I took out about $10,000 for student loans. During the application process, I thought I would be working a part-time job so I chose an interest repayment option. Since starting fall semester, I don't think I'll be able to handle a part-time job/ school work. I called my loan provider and unfortunately, because the loan was already disbursed they can't really change the repayment option, which is understandable. But only half of the loan was disbursed through my school and the other half will be disbursed in January 18th. They said if I really wanted to change the repayment option, I could cancel my loan before the disbursement date and re-apply with a different payment option. The catch is that the interest rate could be higher or lower or the loan might not even get approved because they look at my credit history before approving the loan. I have some savings left that I can use to pay for the monthly installments. So should I just continue with this loan and try to find a source of income while in school? or should I just cancel the second disbursement and re apply with a different payment option. If anyone has any experiences with these stuff, please let me know if you have any information/insights. I'm very new to this.

Thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Student loans affecting credit score,"I'm currently a grad student with all federal student loans placed in deferment until 2020. This year, I have noticed that the disbursement of my federal loans has been having a negative impact on my credit score- every time they are disbursed, my score goes down. Financial aid at my school gets disbursed 5 times a year and today was the third time in a row that my score went down because of this. I'm confused as to why this is happening because it's never been the case until this year. I've had an account with credit karma for several years and I have never seen my score go down because when federal student loans are disbursed. Is this normal? I'm only questioning it because of the sudden change in how the agencies are calculating my score.",finance
investing,Can someone help me understand Ray Dalio's comments on what he says is the coming debt crisis for the US?,"&gt;The impact of the nation's current tax cut-driven fiscal stimulus will begin to fade in about 18 months, just as the U.S. ramps up its borrowing to help pay off pension, health care and other unfunded obligations, he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Wednesday  
&gt;  
&gt;Domestic and foreign demand for U.S. debt won't keep up with the nation's borrowing needs, and the Federal Reserve ultimately will need to print money to fund the deficit rather than raise interest rates. That will result in a steep depreciation of the dollar, said Mr. Dalio. The greenback could fall as much as 30%, he said.

That's a snippet from an interview he gave, and I'm trying to understand how exactly this works.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. So right now, we have pension funds that don't  have enough to cover their liabilities. So they borrow money to pay the people they owe money to?
2. Aren't pension funds at the state level, what does this have to do with the federal government/fed, I understand obviously we are a country comprised of individual states so a problem for all the states is a problem for the country as a whole,  but does the federal government borrow money on behalf of the states to help them pay their pension obligations? I'm trying to understand the mechanics of how pension obligations flow to the federal government.
   1. Also if he is correct, wouldn't we expect to see the crisis first manifest in municipal bonds?
3. Healthcare and other unfunded obligations, I assume here he's talking about federal entitlement programs, Social Security and medicare/medicaid?
4. So is his basic argument, people will stop buying treasury bonds, or demand a higher rate? In return the Federal Reserve will print money and give it to the government? I'm trying to understand the mechanics of how this would work? Does the Federal reserve literally just say print say $1B dollars, hand it over to the treasury, and say go ahead use this for social security?
5. Why would the Fed printing money in this case be different than QE, which to my knowledge did not cause massive inflation?",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loan Help,"TLDR: How do I refinance my wife’s student loans totaling 149,000 into a payment structure that is more affordable. Is it even possible?


Both my wife and I have student loans right now. My loans are NSFL huge and in forbearance for the forseeable future, so I don’t need to worry about them for the next few years when residency is done and then I will be able to afford to repay them. Yes it would be great to pay interest or what have you on them during residency, but it’s not in the cards at the moment. We are both working, and have one young child. My wife’s on the other hand have entered repayment and the amount due on some of them is somewhat crippling. Trying to figure out how we can refinance them. We actually had thought for the past 12 months or so that we were doing really well financially. Student loan payments were a few hundred a month in total for the 2 of her loans. We were steadily chipping away at credit card debt a few hundred a month, and it was down to 3500 on one card (these were mostly old necessary expenses).  Everything was great. 


Then a couple things happened simultaneously:

1.	We both had necessary vehicle repairs totaling over 1000 per car even after doing much of the work myself. I am actually borrowing a vehicle right now (so thankful for this), while debating on how to proceed with the repairs on my truck vs sell it and get a more economical vehicle, now that I no longer need a truck. All I need is a safe economic car that has a backseat for a carseat. 

2.	One of the student loans my wife has said that she had to recertify for the income driven repayment plan, and the payment has now increased by a couple hundred dollars to 432.03.

3.	Unbeknownst to me, my wife’s mother had been paying a student loan for us because the bill had been sent to her house. She has been doing this for about a year and I didn’t even know this loan existed. Understandingly so my mother in law is tired of paying this loan because the payment is $450. Now it’s our responsibility. I’d rather not get into the details of how or why this happened because it’s not even clear to me, but whatever, the loan is ours. I am definitely thankful she paid it for so long, I just wish I would have known about it because we bought a house during the past year and I could have made allowances for such a payment.


Current wife student loans: (Current principal, average interest rate, payment)

1: federal $124000, 5.66%, $423.03

2: private $4650, 5.0%, $85

3: private surprise loan, yay! $20,530, 8.375%, $450. 


Conservative Rough Monthly Expenditures:

1711 mortgage

970 daycare

1000 food/drink/pets

450 utilities

400 averaged auto repairs over last year 

40 internet

50 security system

225 gasoline

165 insurance (auto + home warranty)

300 medical

400ish fun money/restaurants/meals while at work

958.23 (student loans)


6669 total Expenditures. In all honestly, this is probably not entirely all inclusive, and there are some expenditures that are not included here. 6669 is a little underestimating a few things like house repairs/items (we just bought a ceiling fan for a few hundred bucks) which seem to be less predictable. I know the mortgage and daycare are steep, but those two are non-negotiable. We got the house we wanted and the interest rate was incredible. Food and drink is high, this is a long term battle slowly trending in my favor (spending less money). Other stuff seems like it just adds up to a lot . My gut is telling me that we are on the verge of spending more money than we make (heck I know we did last month due to car repairs). 

Take home total between the two of us per month after taxes is 7385. My credit is low 700s. Wife is mid 700s


Good news: 

1.	We have 100k split relatively evenly in 401(a) and Roth IRAs. 

2.	We have roughly 16k in individual stocks we can partially liquidate and disappear the credit card debt and car problems without too much heartache. 


Tentative plan?:

1.	Sell about 8000 in stock.

2.	Kill the credit card debt forever. 

3.	Figure out what to do with my truck (repair and keep, repair and sell, don’t repair and sell). Might be worth just 
under 6k as is. Probably a little more if I did a bunch of repairs to it.

4.	Get another car… preferably all electric vehicle. (I did not drive my truck further than 43 miles last year except 
once, and my place of work has a free EV charging station). Used vs lease (Lease allows lower upfront investment vs spending several thousand on a used car and also worrying about repairs. Also, my monthly truck gas/repair bill was so insane that I think a EV lease would be cheaper. EV monthly cost would be about 300 including lease, down payment, and electric charging vs probably 350-375 monthly cost for my truck including gas and estimated repairs). I also wouldn’t have to worry about the unpredictability of fixing it if it breaks. 

5.	After the dust settles, put the leftover cash, if any, in a Roth. Again, this is a side benefit to me of a lease over a used car. I get to put leftover money in a Roth instead of a used car. I will only be able to contribute to a Roth for 3-4 more years and then my income will be too high for me to take advantage. Therefore, every penny I can cram into a Roth over the next 3-4 years is extraordinarily valuable.

6.	Figure out student loan refinancing options (I NEED THE MOST HELP WITH THIS). I am so ignorant on this subject. How? What companies are good? Is it possible? 

7. Stick to budget and don't overspend.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  My wife is able to pay most all our expenses. I currently have no expenses other than my current vehicle's gas. I make $1662 per month and pay about 70 per month for gas. The only future expenses I will have is the car monthly and the insurance premium.

personalfinance,Quarterly 1099 taxes,"Hello all, I have a question regarding 1099 quarterly taxes and if I should file them. To preface I would like to slip in that I am an Indiana resident but all of my income comes from Illinois. Not sure if that matters but what do I know. 
So I'm an audio tech and work for four different companies. Three of the companies are W2 and I make most of my income from them. They take out state and federal taxes for me and I usually get a refund(although I think I had to pay like $80 to Indiana for some weird reason this year). The fourth company, who I just started working  a couple days a month with is 1099 and they do not withhold taxes. I only expect to make about $2,500 from the 1099 company as I've only made about a grand so far. Do I need to file quarterly taxes? I know its kinda getting down to the wire(pretty sure deadline is in two days) but I literally discovered what quarterly taxes even were this morning because our education system is so adequate in giving us proper life skills.

The IRS website says you don't have to file quarterly if you think you will owe less than $1000 yearly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",finance

I just checked my credit score and it is 521...ouch! I am looking how to repair it?


This is my current debt situation...

Federal Student Loans: $52,000

Chase Card: $2,200 (acct closed, not making payments)

Best Buy Card: $530 (acct closed, not making payments)

Wells Fargo: $1,930 (acct closed, i am making monthly payments)

Capital One: $700 ($2000 limit, i am making monthly payments)

I make $2700 take home monthly and have $4500 I've saved so far.


My current expenses are...

Rent+Utilites: $900

Food: $160


The rest I either try to save or use it for gas, going out, etc.

My insurance and cell phone are paid for...I own two cars both in great shape and paid off.

Where do I go from here? I am completely clueless on this stuff.

Also, Chase and Best Buy have sent me reduced numbers to close the accounts (BB said I could pay $300 and Chase said I could pay $750). 

Will paying these also remove the reports from my credit score and improve it once they are taken care of?

personalfinance,First time needing to pay estimated quarterly taxes and didn't plan ahead. Is it a problem if I pay them late?,"Hey all,

I was hired as a consultant at the beginning of July of this year. I don't have any of my wages withheld for taxes, and I'm required to pay estimated quarterly taxes on my earnings. I knew all of this when I started my consultation gig, however, I mistimed payday, and I won't have the funds to pay back quarterly taxes until Friday the 21st where the taxes are due by Monday the 17th...

personalfinance,What redflags should I be worried about when refinancing?,"I bought a condo about 3 months ago and have a mortgage with a high interest rate due to the condo  HOA currently being in litigation with the builder (came with a substantial drop in price, which made the higher rate a reasonable compromise in the short term). There are only about 3 companies in my area who finance these types of loans, since they aren’t guaranteed by FNMA.

The company who financed my loan reached out to me today to find out if I would be interested in refinancing with them and dropping my rate by 0.625%. This would be a 0 cost refinance (they mentioned that they’ve been getting appraisal waivers for other units in my building, and if they couldn’t for me, they would repay the appraisal cost upon closing). There would be no prepayment penalties. 

Except for an issue with funding the loan a few hours late, which delayed closing a day, they were very reasonable to work with during my home buying process. 

My question to everyone on this subreddit is what are the red flags I should be worried about when refinancing? This sounds like a win all around (no upfront cost, only a 3 month extensions on my 30year mortgage, dropping my rate substantially), but I feel like there has to be a catch. No one just reaches out to you to save money without getting something out of it for themselves.

My mortgage was sold as soon as it closed, but since it’s a non-agency loan the brokers work with a specific investor base to sell the mortgages after they close instead of putting them on the TBA market. The only thing I could think of is that mortgage brokers make money when they sell mortgages, but that seems less likely the motivation in this case due to the relationship with the buyer.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I replaced the link. ~~I'm not sure why the old link isn't working.~~ Looks like they removed the desktop version. All quotes directly from article.

&amp;#x200B;

Such gems as:

1. ) "" For example, assume you have a 30-year mortgage with a monthly payment of $2,000. Your first payment includes about $360 in principal and $1,640 in interest, while the last payment includes about $60 in interest and $1,940 in principal. If you made a double payment of $4,000 (to “save” on interest), all you’re saving is $60, and that’s 30 years from now. Put another way, it’s a return of less than 0.1% per year.""

&amp;#x200B;

Really? So it's not my mortgage rate that I save? Wrong, it's exactly my mortgage rate I save. My mortgage company compounds monthly too, so it's really 3.375% / 12 months = .003125% monthly compounding or about 3.75% compounded annually. Nearly the 4% mentioned in the following example.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I just understood what they're trying to say in this quote. They're saying that you're only saving the $60 last payments. This is false. You save mortgage rate x $ every year compounded. There are calculators, but I'm guessing it's \*about\* $4,000 that you save from a one time $2,000 lump sum payment. I did $2,000 x 3.75% for 30 years compounded, because I'm lazy. $6,034.94.

&amp;#x200B;

Then

2.) ""If rather than make that extra $2,000 payment, you invested it in anything — even a money market account — paying 1% interest, after 30 years, it would have grown to $2,695.70. In other words, to “save” $60 in interest, you gave up $695.70 in interest. Now imagine that math compounding each and every payment for 360 months. Now imagine that you got a decent return.

For example, suppose you have a 30-year loan of $419,000 at 4% interest. Your standard monthly payment of principal plus interest would be $2,005. If you paid an extra $2,000 per month, you’d save almost $204,000 in interest and pay the loan off in under 11 years, shaving about 19 years off your payment schedule. Sounds pretty good, right? Not so fast. It might not be the best use of your money. Here’s why:

Suppose instead of making extra payments, you deposited the $2,000 per month in an account earning that same 4% per year. You would have contributed a total $720,000 plus earned $679,000 on that sum, for a grand total of nearly $1.4 million. Since you didn’t pay off the mortgage early, you would still pay around $300,000 in interest over the course of 30 years, but you would end up $379,000 ahead. That handily beats the $204,000 you would have saved by prepaying the mortgage.""

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong! So they say that $2000 x 30 years at 4% is 1.4 million. Okay, true so far ($1,399,880.05 if compounded once yearly at 4%)

Then they say that you only save $204k by paying off your mortgage early!!! Wrong. They forget that you paid it off your mortgage in ""...under 11 years."" To be apples to apples they should then compound the $2k per month at 4% for the remaining 19 years... but they don't. Further the bonds should be taxed at some rate. If you're in the 25% bracket, all the sudden you're only getting 3%. This is lower than the 3.75% from my (and most) mortgages.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) Wrong on selling too

""Despite popular opinion, a home (meaning your primary residence; your personal dwelling) is not an investment, and regardless of what you paid for it, when you eventually sell, any increased value is yours. For example, suppose you buy a $500,000 home with $0 down and your best friend buys an identical house for $500,000 cash. A year later you both sell for $550,000. You both “pocket” $50,000.

The fact that one was mortgaged and the other wasn’t, makes no difference. Where the real difference lies is that you used a bank’s money to buy your house and kept your money in your own pocket, (allowing it to work for you), instead of giving it all to the seller (and allowing it to work for them). Money only works for one party and that’s the party that possesses it.""

&amp;#x200B;

Umm wait a hot minute. Your friend is paying his interest rate on his $500k home for 1 year (say \~$18,750). Therefore a cash only buyer would save that amount, not to mention points and fees of a mortgage which can be thousands. This rate should really be compared to the risk free rate of return to determine if a bond yield (after taxes) is superior.

Also, you should recommend staying in it for 2 of the last 5 years to avoid any taxes on the $50k.

&amp;#x200B;

4.) Nope.

""Also, with the majority of interest being paid up front, the mortgage company has already made most of its money by the time you pay the mortgage off. When a borrower pays off their loan early, the lender benefits, because it just reduced its debt load and increased its liquidity ahead of schedule. The lender now gets to go lend your money to someone else, and make a lot more.""

&amp;#x200B;

This is false. It's a common myth that you ""pay interest up front."" You simply pay the same interest rate on a larger amount. As you pay down your principal, your interest payment decreases. Banks don't make out. They like giving out loans and making money on them. It's their business.

personalfinance,Advice on what I should payoff next,"Just wondering what the best option for dumping extra money into to become debt free would be.

Ive paid off all my personal loans and credit cards as well as cancelled all, except one that autodrafts and I pay off every payday. So i have two debts left the car I drive daily and a car that got repossessed a few years ago. I bought it, it broke down, lot told me too bad, lawyers told me too bad. I owe about the same on each (13-14k) Same interest rate 8%~. 

After repossession I heard nothing from the bank for well over a year about it, then one day I get a letter from a lawyer saying they are seeking garnishment. I called the lawyer and bank and they said it was too late to just do payments and even if I do make payments they will still be seeking garnishmwnt. I have to meet with the lawyer and a judge next Tuesday in regards. So I think it's safe to say in the next few weeks my wages will be garnished to collect the balance on the repo'd car.  

My thought is to pay off the repo'd car just to end the garnishment as fast as possible because to me that's just stressful. Today is payday and after bills I paid a thousand towards the repo'd car and I just want to see what opinions others have.

I recently started working in my new job, in Graphic design in a small Marketing company that revolves around creating marketing strategies, developing websites, social media maintenance and other stuff like that. 
I started as an Intern 6 months later, they liked me and well enough they asked me to work on the team. Now, don't get me wrong, I get along really well with everyone at the company, super nice, positive, and I have a lot of respect for every one of them. But the problem begins right as I started working with them. We have a meeting, all of us, as we usually do every Monday morning, and our boss tells us we are in a financial crisis and because of some in work problems that have been amounting through time, from not responding to client email, to having bad work ethics and all those sorts of things, and have had a similar crisis before, and the way he dealt with it was pulling money from his own account and trying to wait it out. But this time was different, he had no backup money and unfortunately, the salary would have to be delayed, he was very honest with his approach. I was paid the first working month, but the second one was when the problem hit the team, I'm finishing the second week with no payment, and it's been super rough, not just because of the pressure we are putting up, but because I feel frustrated that I'm overworking over something I did not cause, at all, and I'm not even being paid! 
Now of course I understand it's not because he doesn't care or anything, It's not that type of situation, but I can't help but feel frustrated having to keep this up with this, the team is very determined to resolve this situation, and that's really the only part that gets me going. But I'm starting to feel really tired all the time, getting really fed up with everything, beginning to feel overwhelmed and I'm starting to feel impatient all the time, due to the lack of rest. 

My thing is, I respect them a lot and I know it's not something that anyone proud of and everyone is trying their best, but I'm going through a lot and I don't know when too much is too much. How normal it is to work without getting paid in this situation, or if I should quit and save myself the for getting overworked soo soon, wasting away my week for something I did not cause.",finance

personalfinance,Filing a flood claim; what to claim?,"So a pipe burst on the side of our house and quickly flooded half our house in an inch of water.

We sucked over 45 gallons up with the shop vac before Servpro arrived and used most of the towels and sheets in our house to barricade the water. So much got wet. 
What gets claimed?
I have piles of wet laundry from the flood- one load I washed smells fine, but will it grow mold over time from the grotty floor water? Do I claim them and all the wet clothes/ shoes?
Several small appliances and power tools were sitting in the water- should we test them to see if they still work, or claim them because they may have long term rust damage from water exposure?
The kitchen fridge, garage side by side, and garage deep freezer were all sitting in water, but only an inch. Are they ok if they are still working?
Power boards and charger cables, are they even safe to use anymore?
Stuffed animals? Especially the ones with electronic voice parts from Disney?
Electronic toys? Again, if they work now are they ok, or will the water damage them over time?
My sewing machine? With all the metal in that I'm assuming it's toast. Teaches me for storing it   On the closet floor.
The printer was up on a table but it's power board was submerged- is it ok?
If there are a few parts of my headboard delaminating at the bottom from the water but they aren't that noticeable if you don't pick at it will they cover to replace it?
There is a small area of the bathroom cabinet that swelled but they said it dried fine and is salvaged with just a replacement toekick. How hard should I press for a new one?
Most of our house is tiled but my daughters room, the office and our master closet are carpeted. The carpet is only 2 years old and they said it will be fine after it is dried. My concern is we have a child with a trach on a vent and I really want to avoid mold. Will the carpet really be ok after the fans dry it?
Also, one of my sons oxygen concentrators was sitting in water, but I'm not sure if any actually got to the inner workings of it. Is it claimable? We bought it second hand.
The outlets in my daughters room seem to be popping the breaker now. Whenever they plugged the fans in it would pop. Could the water have affected the wiring? Should we have it looked at? Will insurance cover that?
Will they replace wet insulation? Curtains? Craft supplies (scrapbook paper, printer paper, post its, card stock, crayons)?

Small background: I come from a traditional Asian family, except my mother is the breadwinner and she does the entire family's taxes. For the sake of civility, my mother isn't the best person and does a lot of shady things that I have little to no knowledge of - I can only guess bits and pieces of. Not ""drug-dealer"" (for a fact) level bad, but more like ""hey let's take slight advantage of welfare"" (I think). My father and mother DO NOT get along. They hate each other's guts but still live together. ANYWAYS - 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a small (well big for me, everyone says this is small) issue. My mother has always been controlling everything I've done ever since I was little, virtually ""brainwashing"" me with false information about anything 'adulting'. Things like, ""Oh don't worry about car payments, I'll take of it. It's only $3,000 a month, but it's okay I'm doing this for you."" and ""because you work a part-time job, I have to pay taxes and I do not get any benefit. I lose more money to taxes than you make but that's okay, I'll take care of it."" - basically things like this. She's my mother, so I as a child and well into my college years, believed her with everything I had and never questioned it. I never had a reason to. She's my mom, I'm her daughter, I have to work hard so I can get a good job and support my family when they get older, etc. Sigh.

&amp;#x200B;

This continued and nothing bad ever happened, until I graduated from college. Red flags started to pop up. I hate to admit this, but I was a damn good (and incredibly naive) kid. I studied hard af and budgeted like crazy cause I felt horrible my mom was paying for everything of that caliber (she doesn't even make that much. She isn't salaried and gets paid $20+ p/h in a clinic for the last 15 years; my dad doesn't work, he's retired and he's 86 years old). I started feeling tremendous guilt when I graduated, so I looked for ways to help my family now that I had a degree.  I started talking more about finances to other people, asking them ways I can help get more money saying, ""Jesus, my mom pays $3,000 a month for my car payments and $2,000 for car insurance per month, and house bills cost over $2,000 per month, etc.""  Everyone gives me a look and goes, ""Um, that's absolutely false, how is it that much?"". I'm taken back and I go, ""Hasn't it always been that much?"" *Everyone* goes ""hell no!"". Thus began my questioning of my mother. Unfortunately, any questions I ask gives me the same response from her, ""They're lying. They're rich and they don't know any better. Don't worry about these things. I'll handle it. I'm your mother; trust me. Focus on your career."" My nativity took over and I believed her *again* 'cause I mean she's my *mom*! She's taken care of all the finances for our whole family from day one! How could she have bad intentions? Not only that but she's been building up my credit score, and the entire family has a near perfect credit score. I've seen the scores personally too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this hellstorm, I never got to control my bank account - we have a shared bank account and she's also been controlling that too. I never did my taxes. She always filed them (she pays another tax person to help with that stuff; she's not... very bright, but she has A LOT of resources). Everytime I asked, she said, ""Don't be nosey. Don't concern yourself with things like this."" I finally got fed up and only FINALLY went to a different bank to get a new bank account for myself two months ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now... to the present. Things happened and now I want to try and be independent. I've come to see my mom for who she is: Incredibly selfish, narcissistic, passive aggressive, materialistic, shady, the list goes on. I understand why she became that way, but I still love her. After all, I wouldn't have made it this far without her. She lives with my grandparents and in theory, my dad as well. She doesn't want to take care of him and has basically ignored him for years now. I'm mainly taking care of him, but my dad is incredibly independent and has a plethora of friends to help him. He still goes to the gym for 6 - 8 hours a day, extremely healthy, every morning at 6am for the last 25 years - so he good, there's no issue in that department.  BUT...

&amp;#x200B;

Under the veil that I ""dislike"" each of my parents (my dad thinks I ""moved out"" because I couldn't stand to be around my mom, while my mom thinks I ""moved out"" because I couldn't stand my dad lmfao) I moved out of the house and into an apartment with my boyfriend. In order to pay and have my own life, I tutour off to the side. I make a fairly good amount (approximately $2k a month). Now here's the issue. My clients pay me in Cash and Check. I don't work for anyone, and I just do house calls. I've been told that the more I deposit into the bank, I'm going to have to claim that as my income soon (next year).  Problem is, how do I do this tax thing (with no knowledge whatsoever) without my mom knowing? I absolutely can not allow her to know I make money off to the side, she will take all that money from me and I won't be able to say ""no"", especially to my own mother. My godparents know of my family's relationship and even they told me not to tell my mom anything. This includes getting a bank account at a different bank and that I tutour off to the side. My mother thinks  I'm just freeloading off my boyfriend and she's okay with that. To keep up the facade, I sometimes use ""my credit card"" every day to buy around $7 worth of food for her to see my credit card statement so she doesn't get suspicious. It's been working very well so far.

My boyfriend told me that if I fill out something called a W7, my mom won't ever get wind of it because she'll be filling out a W2? I have no idea what those are and even if I read it, the jargon to me is completely lost. I am utterly helpless due to my stupidity of never confirming my mom's bullshit. My concern is that: wouldn't it not match up? Would she not get the notification that something was amiss? Would I get in trouble with the law? What the heck do taxes even look like? Is there a packet of papers you need to fully fill out? Would she not fill out the W7 and say that I am unemployed, when the reality is the complete opposite? Everything I search up, I get differing opinions, and when I ask people I get different answers. Nothing ever matches up. I'm afraid to even discuss what my family is doing incase someone reports her and my entire family gets screwed? Worst of all, I don't want my own stupidity to be the downfall of my family or ruin whatever my mother was working up towards. I want her to think she's still able to control me because she still does - she takes care of my car payments, has access to everything including my SSN (and my father's), and I still piggyback off her for insurance. Not too long ago I had to get a cyst removed and my bill was cut down from $22k to $0, thank God.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, my full question is: Is there a way I can file these taxes without her EVER knowing I'm tutouring off to the side? I heard that if I file first, hers will get rejected, but what if I file incorrectly from how she originally does it? Will I lose my Medicaid or whatever health insurance I'm getting from my mom? Will car payments go up? I have no idea who to talk to, everyone's answers are VASTLY different. I feel I can't ask questions because I don't know who to trust, and even though I /know/ my mom is untrustworthy, I'm scared that she might just be right and I might ruin everything she's worked for ever since immigrating to America. I'm just so utterly lost. Please help.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR -** I want to file and just pay my taxes like a good citizen *separately*, but my mom files my taxes and I do NOT want her to know or get any notification from the IRS of my meddling. 

She doesn't know I do tutoring off to the side (I am paid with cash/check and I deposit into a separate bank account). I do not want to do anything that jeopardizes my relationship with her and the family. I don't have the funds to fully take care of health insurance and car insurance so I still rely on her a little. I also do not know what lengths she will go to to ruin me via SSN or ... whatever if she finds out I lied to her. She has been known to be extremely and severely petty as long as she ""wins'. To keep my respect for her - it's bad and she's not someone to be trifled with. What can I do?",finance
cardano,Inflation rate / emission schedule?,"Hey all 

I'm looking for the inflation rates of Cardano - anyone ever calculated this? 

Second best is the emission schedule design for staking.

personalfinance,no retirement savings options available - looking to invest savings,"hi!

I'm 24 and in a bit of a weird financial situation. I'm at a point in my life where I'd like to start saving/investing for retirement, but my salary is not reported on a 1099 or on a W2 (this is legally stipulated). I pay taxes through estimated tax payments both federal and state. As far as I can tell, this makes me ineligible for the traditional retirement accounts all of my friends with normal jobs are starting.

My income: ~38k/yr + 1.5k/year raises for COL
My expenses: ~1600/mo. This is all inclusive, and saves for anticipated and some unanticipated costs.

* I've got a 6mo emergency fund. 
* I have around 150k in liquid savings (losing a parent sucks.) 
* I've got a few thousand sitting in a vanguard acct.
* debt free, excellent credit

So, I have 2 questions: 
1) is there another way to invest in retirement that I'm not aware of? It would need to be something that doesn't require a W2 or 1099. (I do have paystubs!)

2) how do I invest this much money?

* the fam is skeptical of investing heavily in the stock market because they are anticipating a recession/depression.
* I would normally invest in real estate, but I can't afford anything around here (housing crisis) and I don't want to manage a property remotely.
* I'm pretty overwhelmed by the number of options for investing my money with Vanguard. Most of what I read isn't talking about investing 100 grand. 
* I'd like to keep some of this money (~40? 60?k) for use within the next 7-10 years for the costs of being a real adult (house/marriage/babies/to help out my mom as she gets older). She's a planner, so she probably won't need this, but occasionally she'll ask me to borrow some money and always pays it back.
* I would like to keep my investments diversified. Investing in a bunch of target date funds, all in the stock market, seems like a bad idea?

personalfinance,[Planning] Is my savings plan viable/reasonable?,"Hi personalfinance! This is going to be my second post ever here, so please forgive me if I leave out any relevant information and I'd be happy to provide it! Anyways, the point of this post is to ask for any advice/guidance on my plans for the future regarding my savings and paying off my student debt.

I graduated this June with a degree in computer science and I currently have a junior level job at a software company making 56k/year. My monthly take home is currently $3526. I have around $30k in student debt and my payments start in February 2019, so I'm doing everything I can to prepare to start paying that off. Currently my expenses are as follows: Rent - $422.15, Car - $250, Utilities - $60-$80, Gym - $45, Netflix - $11, Spotify - $2.50. So that added up means at worse case, my monthly expenses are $810.65. I spend around $50-$70 on food each week and $40 on gas each week, and I have accounted for those in my personal budget.

Currently, I have 3 accounts with Bank of America, 1 ""Bills"" checking account where all my monthly bills listed above are deducted from each month, 1 ""Discretionary"" checking account for my daily spending like food and gas, and also where my credit card is paid from, and 1 savings account where I plan to build a small emergency fund. Since my company doesn't have a 401k match yet, I have started a Roth IRA with Vanguard instead, and plan to max that out every month with a $458.33 deposit monthly.
**Goals: One month buffer in ""bills"" account ($820). Buffer in ""discretionary"" account ($500 or $1000 ?). Small emergency fund for 3 months expenses in savings, (~$2400).**

After I reach these goals, which I will hopefully have met before I start paying off my loans, then I can start aggressively throwing money at my loans because I want to get them paid off as soon as possible. My goal is to put at least $1000/month towards my loans, along with any extra money I have at the end of each month. Does this goal seem reasonable? My interest rates average to ~4.5% so I can have these loans paid off in 3 years with this plan. **Please let me know if this plan seems reasonable, or if my goals for the amount of money in my accounts should be adjusted. I'd love to hear your opinions. Thank you so much!**

Edit: I also plan to start putting money into a high yield savings account, most likely Ally, once the goals for my other 3 accounts are met.",finance
personalfinance,Am I crazy? Bankruptcy questions,"Ok, just writing this out as it comes into my head so please excuse the disorganization and the book-worthy length of it. 

Also, just to be clear - I have worked since I was 14. I worked all through college, and have had multiple jobs at a time up until last year. My friends are always telling me I work far too much and that I am too stressed. I am not lazy, I am good at budgeting and making spreadsheets for my finances, and while I do sometimes spend frivolously, I wasn't buying vacations and stupid stuff. This was mostly groceries, gas, utilities, everyday expenses. 

To start, I have a LOT of student loan debt. Like I could have bought a house for the amount of money I spent on my bachelor's degree (over $100,000). Unfortunately, it is split between three different lenders and each is in a different name (mine, my mom's, and my dad's) so consolidation was not really an option for us. What this means is that my student loan payments equal almost half of my after tax income. (Salary job, $46,000 a year, roughly $2,200/month after taxes, healthcare, 401k, etc.)

So - I had a second job bartending, but the bar closed a little over a year ago. I had worked there 4 years and had the perfect schedule and the best shifts; closing bar Friday night and opening Sunday morning for brunch, which got me $1200-$1500 extra a month, without screwing with my full-time job schedule too much. Tried to find another bar to work at, but none would fit into my already full-time job, especially starting at the bottom of the totem pole again, plus be worth the time and loss of sleep. ~1/3 of my total income went poof.

Debt:
I lived off my credit cards after college for a year or two, because I had just moved to a new city (parents moved while I was in college), and I couldn't find a job in my field that didn't require 5+ years of experience and that paid more than $10-12 an hour (I graduated college in 2010), so I was again back to serving and bartending and internships and part time office work. Those barely covered my rent and student loans - everything else went on the cards.

Then I was in a TINY fender bender in 2014 and ended up (barely) rear ending the most nightmare of all nightmare people, the bitch who sues everyone (apparently there are 20+ other suits with her name on them in the surrounding counties). Found out my insurance hadn't renewed automatically the month before, but since there was no damage and I never heard from her about fixing anything, I thought we were good. Went to traffic court for unknowingly driving without insurance, paid the fine, done. Cue to 3 years later (2017, RIGHT before my 2nd job bar closes and three days before the statute of limitations expires on this accident) and I get served with a civil lawsuit for her ""neck injury"" and another 100k of pain and suffering, because apparently her insurance won't pay out. They think she's full of shit, and say she never made a claim when the accident happened, so they are denying her a payout. I get a lawyer, show him my finances, and he is asking me why I haven't thought about bankruptcy before, since I'm clearly drowning in debt. He decides he will not be charging me for his services (I adore him, he was even invited to our wedding!). Obviously I don't have any money to pay this lady; we settle for $1k.

I never thought about bankruptcy because I figured since I got myself into this mess, I've got to work myself out of it. I made stupid errors, like letting a car salesman talk me into a lease I couldn't afford, and taking out a personal loan to cover my credit card expenses at a lower interest rate (good idea) and then still using the credit cards (bad idea).

In any case, finally I got overwhelmed and talked to the bankruptcy attorney that my lawsuit attorney recommended. He was a dream and made me feel so much better about what I saw as a huge failure. We got along because apparently I'm a decent human being, and he charged me half his normal rate for filing. I know there are skeezy lawyers out there, but these two I've dealt with are honest-to-God amazing people. He walked me through the process, we filed in April, and the bankruptcy court official barely looked at my paperwork during my hearing before granting it and wishing me luck in the future. Easiest process I've ever been through. Obviously my student loans didn't go away, but the massive amount of credit card and personal debt I had accrued in large part because of them did.

*I also felt it was unfair to saddle my soon-to-be husband with my debt, so getting this out of the way before we got married seemed like a good idea. A fresh start, as they say. He recently started his own business, paid off all his debt, and now makes a good living. He has earned it, and as much as I know he would help me if I needed it, I would never ask him to take on all that mess. He helps plenty as it is. Plus he still has to deal with me and the student loans!*

Now that the long ass back story is done, here are some stats and my questions:

1. I had NO late payments for probably 2-3 years before the actual date of my bankruptcy filing (April 15th-ish)

2. My credit score was in the 660-690 range before filing

3. I had 2 credit cards with zero balances that made it through the bankruptcy without the accounts being closed, since I didn't owe them any money 

4. My car was just ""repoed"" today, but it was scheduled by me with the lender earlier this week and very cordial - I handed them my keys, my spare keys, etc and had a nice chat with the dispatcher on the phone as well as the repo man when he got there. Apparently they don't get a lot of pleasant interactions, ha!

5. My bankruptcy was discharged officially on August 27th. I got married on September 2nd.

6.  My credit score has not gone down. It dipped a few points a few months ago and then jumped up about 16 points this past week. I keep an eye on it and my accounts via credit karma, and even though the bankruptcy shows up and the accounts included in it are closing, it has not made my score dive.

Why is that? Everything I'm reading says my score will take a nosedive right after filing. That didn't happen, obviously. And now that it's discharged, it hasn't either, it went up! Am I missing something? I need to go get a new car (and by new I mean a used junker or cheap lease I can actually afford!) and I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop on my credit, so I'm scared to go and try to get a car lease! My now husband had near perfect credit, so he can cosign and help me get a better rate, but I still feel like I'm missing something.

I tried to Google my question, but the only thing that will come up is about credit scores going up after the bankruptcy drops off your report. I'm clearly not there yet, so that didn't help. 

Thoughts? Questions? Concerns? Advice? Should I expect a big drop to still happen?? What's the best way to get a new vehicle?

TL;DR - I went through bankruptcy and my already decent credit score went up instead of down. Why? Also how do I go about getting a new vehicle?",finance
personalfinance,"How, Where, What to Do with Savings?","Hi there! I have a question on what to do with my savings? I have some money sitting in a checking account, not doing more more than that, and I know it can be put to better use. I’m just not sure what the best use is.. 

Here is a little about me and my current situation. I am a 31 year old male, in a relationship but not married, no kids, earn $76k/year, own two condos (one I used to live in and now rent out, and one I currently live in), and I don’t have any debt aside from the two mortgages. Student loans are paid off, car is paid off and I pay my full credit card bill every month. I also max out my IRA contribution every year and just started the account 2 years ago (I know I’m behind) and have about $11k. My work does not offer any IRA or pension. 
I also don’t really have a budget. I try to live well within my means and have always been a saver. 
Long term goals are to own a few more properties to rent out and eventually make money on appreciation. I have experience in real estate and see that as safe investment I understand. 

I have about $30k saved up in a couple checking and savings accounts, with the bulk in a checking account. This money isn’t doing anything and its frustrating. But, I also like having cash on hand so I’m not stressed over a big purchase or in case of an emergency.

I make the minimum payments towards my mortgages each month and I’m thinking of putting more towards the principle or interest. My interest rates are both below 4% and I owe $133k and $177k on both mortgages.

I would love some advice on if I’m making the right decision by contributing more towards my mortgages. If there is a better use of my savings, I welcome any suggestions. Also, any thoughts on how much I should have saved up would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;If you talk to the average educated person at this point, they probably have heard of blockchain at least once. There isn’t an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore.

From my point of view, **it’s better to focus on short-term trading right** **now**. Pay attention to yesterday’s Ethereum interest rate chart, the price has grown from $182 to $204. It’s very unstable now, and traders can benefit from this.

investing,Should I bail out of a Total Bond mutual fund into a TIAA Traditional fund paying 4.00% guaranteed?,"I have a good percent of my retirement money in TIAA.  One of my investment options is a total bond fund where I have about 40% of my total assets.  The total bond fund money is meant to be a protection against a huge bear market in stocks.  Though I am only getting about 2.5% return in the last five years in the total bond mutual fund.  (This year it is losing money.)  With federal reserve raising interest rates I would guess the Total Bond fund is going to continue to get poor results. 

One of my options is to move most or all of the money in the total bond fund to TIAA Traditional.  It would give me an average return of 4.00% guaranteed. Every day I could watch my money in TIAA Traditional increase regardless of what is happening that day in the stock and bond market. The only thing people don't like about TIAA Traditional is the money can't be pulled out all at once. Instead, once I need it I can pull it out gradually over a ten year period in equal annual amounts, or get an annuity. Which I guess is fine.

Would you pull your money out of the Total Bond Fund today and put it all in TIAA Traditional if that was an option you could use?",finance

personalfinance,Financial bind from covering all the bills,"tl;dr - I am quite literally supporting my boyfriend financially and he doesn't understand the severity of the situation he has put me in.

Right now I am feeling as though I am in a financial bind, and I am not sure how to resolve this situation tactfully. Ever since I moved out at 21, I handled all the bills for whoever I lived with. This was mainly because the lease had always been in my name and in turn, all the utilities. I would pay the bill, and whoever I was living with would pay me back or ahead of time. Perhaps I was lucky, but this had never been a problem.

My boyfriend moved in with me in February, and I have since purchased house which is in my name alone. As mentioned before, I pay the bills and he is \*supposed\* to reimburse me, and lately I feeling as though he is taking my flexibility for granted because he knows I am not going to miss a payment. In the last couple of months he has grown very lax regarding paying me and tells me he feels uncomfortable always talking about finances, but I am now struggling as a result of him. At first I would Venmo request him and those piled up. We ended up sitting down and having a very serious talk about this. We agreed that he would pay me a minimum amount each month, and any extra goes towards his balance owed to me from previous bills, groceries, vacations, etc. I asked that he also get a part time job given he owes me a significant amount of money. He was resistant to doing this, but eventually agreed (although I don't even foresee this happening).

We are two weeks into this agreement and he has paid me just about a quarter of that is owed for the month and knowing what he makes weekly, there is no way he is going to be able to pay the remaining amount. My finances are suffering significantly and I have had to dip into my savings account a number of times recently to cover his half of the bills, which is now down $4K to cover his half of things. I expressed my concern and he says things like ""At least you have a savings account."" and most recently stated that if I am in that much of bind that there has to be something wrong on my end from a budgeting perspective. I am not sure what I can do to show him that I am in this bind as a result of his irresponsibility.

I fear he is not taking this seriously and I need to figure out a way to penalize him for not making a payment whether that be charging an interest rate or late fee. Without this he is going to continue to take his time, but adamantly disagrees to this because obviously he doesn't want to owe me more than he already does. I am not sure what to do to make this fair without literally managing his finances personally (which I wouldn't want to do for another adult).",finance

personalfinance,Use Emergency Fund to Pay Off Auto Loan?,"Greetings everyone,

A little background, I am a recent college graduate (23) with no student loans and was fortunate enough to land a job in IT with a net income of around $57k. Upon graduation, I decided to purchase a new to me vehicle. At this point in time, I have made steady payments on the vehicle and have put myself in a situation where I can pay off the loan, but do so using almost all of my emergency fund. At the moment, the current value of the loan is at ~$16,000. In paying off the loan, my emergency fund would be at around $1800. The current interest rate on the loan is 3.21% and the monthly payments are around $345. At the moment, my only expenses are insurance ($114), fuel (~$60), and my monthly credit card statement. My question is, should I use my emergency fund to pay off the loan and rebuild that fund, or just ""tough out the loan"" and wait to pay it off? I am also making contributions to my 401k matching the employer at 6% and also making small contributions to my ROTH IRA. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Is the cost-benefit analysis of corrective eye surgery worth dipping in to my savings for?,"I’m currently making about $50k a year and living with Mom and Dad until I can move out. My savings are currently $10k at a fair interest rate of 1.5% and I have no loan or credit debt of any kind (only monthly car payments on a lease). 

I know the general rule is to not spend savings in case there is a medical emergency, but I’m wondering if getting corrective laser eye surgery could actually be worth dipping in to savings in order to dial back on all my glasses/contact lenses expenses. I have terrible vision. Like, we’re talking  “can’t see six inches from my face” bad. 

After doing the numbers with exam appointment costs and contact lenses, I probably spend about $350 a year on eye care. The surgery to correct my vision would be $4.7k, and I’m luckily young enough where I can take advantage of my “young eyes” for the maximum amount of time possible. Over the course of the 13 years I have until I’m 40 (when old age might require me to wear reading glasses), I would hypothetically be saving $4.5k in total thanks to all the eye care I wouldn’t be needing anymore. 

While there is financing for surgeries like this, I’ve always thought that it might be a better long term benefit to my wallet if I paid lump sum out of savings than incur interest by going into a line of credit again. 

So is it worth even doing a surgery like this at this time? If no, why not? If yes, what would be the smartest way to pay? Should I just wait for another time when I might have those kinds of disposable funds in the future?",finance

personalfinance,Rolling High-APR credit card into Lower-APR Personal Loan,"Hello all!

My wife and I just recently got married, and when we went to the bank to add me to her bank account, the financial specialist mentioned that her current credit card has a really high interest rate (17.5% before prime, 22.5% with) due to her having had that credit card for the last 5 years (her credit was lower then).

He mentioned that he would recommend taking out a lower interest rate personal loan (10.99% with prime) to pay off the old credit card and close that account. 

She currently owes $4100 on the card, and we'd probably take out $5000 for the personal loan.

My question is, are there any cons to this? It seems like the smarter idea so we can pay it off faster.

personalfinance,Got my dream job! Getting a 70% raise and moving to a HCOL area. What should I be aware of?,"Hi PF!

First of all, thank you. I've learned so much from this sub over the past few years, which has allowed me to develop healthy spending and saving habits. No debt, 30k+ in retirement, and a robust emergency fund. I'm 29.

Currently I work in higher education, but I just got my dream job with the federal government. I'll be going from making 45k in a low cost of living area (TX) to 77k in a very high cost of living area (DC). With my new job, I will not need to pay rent. No one goes into higher ed expecting to get rich, so I am having a hard time wrapping my head around my new income.

Other than avoiding lifestyle creep (already a temptation, but one that I'm confident I can control), what else should I be looking out for or thinking about when I make this transition both in salary and in location? I've already noticed that rent is much higher, as are gym membership prices, etc in DC.

Anything else I should look out for or make sure to do? I'm moving in a few weeks.

I'm 28 yrs old and I want to start investing and saving for retirement and potentially a new home in the future.
I have about 2.5 months expenses in an emergency fund. (I feel pretty secure at my job and can get another job no problem if let go)
I currently have about 4.5k in a 401k (no longer being contributed to , I switched companies and no company match at my current place)

&amp;nbsp;

I just finished paying off a CC and now want to start paying off my car or invest in retirement/future goals.

&amp;nbsp;

I owe ~9300 on my car. Current interest rate is 4.02%

&amp;nbsp;

I was thinking of putting an extra $300 to it every 2 weeks on top of the monthly payment of 279.
&amp;nbsp;

However I wanted to see if I can make that money grow elsewhere. I was thinking of transfering my 401k account to a roth IRA and start contributing a bit 
every check to it. I wanted to pay off my car first because it would just give me a better piece of mind but I wanted to do the numbers first and see if it will
be worthwhile to do something else with it.

&amp;nbsp;

I can get the car paid off in a year or so. Or will it be more worth while to put money into some type of investment account and 
only pay the minimum. Payoff Day if paying the minimum is October 2021.

Thanks!

personalfinance,Introduction to Buying a House,"Hello PF. I've seen lots and lots of posts around here about housing questions, buying, selling, all that fun stuff. And I've noticed that there isn't anything particularly helpful on that topic in the sidebar, so I figured why not, I can contribute. Background: I'm a licensed Mortgage Loan Originator in the US, with licenses in 6 states. So anyway, about buying a house!

Your house is the largest single investment most people will make in their lifetime. And yet, the vast majority of people have absolutely no idea how this whole thing works. If you were paying attention, you probably know that the 2008 recession had something to do with housing and something or something, but that's a topic for a whole different time and another sub. People's knowledge generally stops at making payments on time and everyone got screwed on their interest rate. So let's try to learn something about the way this whole thing works.

So you want to buy a house. Congratulations! There's a LOT of stuff that you need to be thinking about and every single person you talk to is going to have an opinion or a way to help. But no matter who you talk to, the first question you'll get is always ""What's your rate?"" Gonna be honest, as an MLO, I absolutely hate that question. I could tell you the rate is 3.5%, I could tell you it's 7.5%, but what does that actually mean for you? Most people don't really have a point of reference for it. I understand why everyone cares, but there's a TON of stuff that goes into it. We'll get to rates later. Yes, it's a fair question, but it's not at all the most important thing.

The first thing you should actually be asking is this: How can I get a pre-qualification letter? The vast majority of the time, to actually make an offer on a house, they'll ask you for some sort of evidence that you actually have the money to buy the house. If you don't happen to have $250,000 lying around somewhere, you'll probably need to borrow it, so they want to see proof that you're actually qualified to borrow that much money. That's what the pre-qualification is for. It also helps you with figuring out exactly what your price range is.

So, we're trying to get you pre-qualified, that's fantastic! A couple of very important steps are coming into play here. How much of a down payment do you have saved up? The ""traditional"" wisdom is 20% of the house, but... That's a *ton* of money and a lot of people just aren't able to get that much saved up very easily. If that's you, there are other options available. If you're a veteran or active duty in the military, you can actually finance 100% of the house. The same is also true if you live in a metropolitan statistical area of under 20,000 people. Financing 100% of the house isn't exactly ideal and it'll bring your payment up quite a bit, but we can do it. If you don't fall in to one of those two categories, like most people, you *must* bring at least 3.5% as a down payment, no matter what. Gifts are allowed, but if it's a gift, you have to have a notarized letter saying that there's no expectation of it to be repaid. Otherwise, you have to be able to prove that you've had the money for at least two months. So, to summarize: How much should you bring for a down payment? As much as possible, but at *least* 3.5%. The more, the better.

Okay, awesome, you have a down payment! The next thing we're going to do is get you credit qualified. That's easy, right? Eh.... Not quite. It's not quite as simple as just checking your credit score, although that is a part of it. As long as you're above ~650, there won't be a problem with the score. But just to make it more complicated, your Credit Karma score isn't going to really help you. It's been tossed around a little bit, but mortgage companies use a different scoring equation. So it's fantastic if Credit Karma tells you that you have a 750, but if I pull your credit and see a 550, I can't help you. That's an extreme example, but I've seen differences of up to 100 points between the calculation methods. Beyond just the credit score, there are also things on the credit report that we need to see. No bankruptcies discharged in the last two years.  (Side note, if you're in the middle of a chapter 13, we can still help you. It might be worth looking into.) We don't *like* collections, but those are case-by-case and we usually ignore medical collections (mostly). As far as late payments go, all we really care about is late payments on the mortgage. If you have a mortgage right now, you have to be current on it. But if you've been late more than twice in the last 12 months, our investors don't want us to take that risk. If your credit score is below 650, it just means you need to shop around a little bit. My last company, for example, was able to lend down to 620 or even 600 with some circumstances. Your local bank might be able to lend on even lower credit scores. It just depends. 

And while we're on the topic of credit, time for a second about credit pulls. The CFPB has actually put a rule in place stating that after a mortgage company makes a credit pull, you can have every other mortgage company in the country pull your credit and after 45 days, it'll all only count as 1 credit pull. You have a 45 day window for free pulls, you may as well use it and shop around while you can.

Okay, great, so you have a down payment and you have your credit qualification. Next step, income! You do have an income, right? Yes, I have actually run into problems with this one before... You HAVE to have an income that reports to the government. If the federal government doesn't know about it, we can't use it. So you 1099 folks, be careful how much you're writing off for business expenses. That can affect how much income we're allowed to use to qualify you. Now, how much do you need? So conventional budget-building recommends that you should keep your housing expenses right about 30% of your budget. Fun fact, when it comes to the mortgage, that's the actual rule. It depends on the mortgage program, but your housing expenses aren't allowed to be more than ~28-36% of your monthly income, although some exceptions occur. In addition, your TOTAL debt-to-income ratio has to be under 45%. Your income is one of the limiting factors for your monthly payment.

Okay, so we've already got a lot of the stuff we need to know. Your down payment, your credit qualification, and your income gives us benchmarks for what your payment limits are. There are **6** pieces of information that we need to give you an accurate rate. If anyone is trying to quote you a rate before getting all six pieces of information, be very skeptical of it. It probably won't be accurate. Those six pieces of information: The loan vs the value of the house (LTV), the amount of the loan, the income you're able to use, your credit score, the loan program you're using, and what the purpose of the loan is (in this case, a purchase). Right now, rates are typically in the 4-5% range, *mostly* on the lower end of that. Obviously, though, your mileage may vary.

Okay, now for my mini-rant about why rate doesn't actually matter. On a $100,000 loan, a 10 year note at 10% is $1,321 per month. A 30 year note for the same amount at 3.5% is $449 per month. Over the lifetime of the loan, though, the 10 year costs about $158,000 while the 30 year costs $161,000. A .125% change in interest rate on the same 30 year note is a difference of $8/month and about $2500 over the life of the loan. It's not nearly as important as people think it is. Not saying it doesn't matter at all, but that 4% vs that 4.125% isn't quite as big a difference as people think. The difference maker is actually the term of the loan.

A $100,000 loan at 4% for 10 years costs you $1,012 per month with a total lifetime repayment of $121,494. The same loan over 30 years is only $477 per month, but you'll end up paying $171,870 before the house is paid off. Extending the loan out 20 years saves you about $750 every month but costs you $50,000 over the life of the loan (spoiler alert, you end up ahead by about 20 years' of payments on the 30 year). What I recommend to people, for the most part is this: Go with the 30 year note, then make extra payments. Why? Because no mortgage since 2008 has prepayment penalties (unless you have a *really* shady bank) and mortgage interest is simple interest, instead of compounding. That's right, mortgage interest does *not* earn interest on itself. Your mortgage interest for the year is calculated at the beginning of the year and scheduled out throughout the year. Every penny you pay over your minimum payment is money paying down the principal of the loan. This makes mortgages one of the easiest loans to pay ahead on. That's why I personally tend to recommend going with a 30-year, then paying ahead when you can. That way, you have the lowest possible payment if something were to happen, but you can afford to throw a ton of extra money at it while you're able to.

Okay, so we have your credit, we have your rate, we have the program, all the structures of the loan, all that fun stuff, we're almost done right? Kinda... Next step is the appraisal. If we're going to lend you money on your house, we need to know how much your house is *actually* worth. I've seen a lot of people really not understand what the appraisal is about. It has nothing to do with how recently you put your roof on, how recently you painted, if you recently replaced a door, none of that stuff. The appraisal is based on the prices of houses in the neighborhood and what they *actually sold for*. The appraiser will do some adjustments because not all houses are identical, but it all depends on what your neighbors are selling their houses for. (There are other ways to do appraisals, this is the most common.) And this is where you start to get into all the fees associated with buying a house. Title work, inspections, origination fees, surveys, HOA fees, all that fun stuff. There's a lot of it, but I'll save that for another post because this one is already getting long. Just... Be prepared to need anywhere from $2-5000 dollars to cover the ""closing costs"" of buying a house. I promise, the fees all make sense and none of them are meaningless, it's just expensive.

So congratulations! You now own a home and owe on a debt for 15-30 years of your life. I'll put up another post about the closing costs and what all goes into that at a later date. Until then, be an educated consumer.",finance
stocks,"If low interest rates is the new normal, what is the case against MREITs?","I bought some REML today and I'm looking for counter-arguments.

But I'm adding to MORL/REML now because I don't see rapidly rising interest rates - the economic condition that kills your average MREIT as very likely.

I’m being told that the car pay off is on my credit but that it shows as closed and has not affected my credit score. I was under the impression that it would have made a small positive impact on my score since I paid on time and paid it off. Is this not the case? Do you think I’m being told this to put down a higher down payment?",finance
personalfinance,Confused trying to deal with medical debt being reported by 3 separate agencies.,"PLEASE HELP. I am so lost.

In February, I got a phone call about a medical debt from an (alleged) law firm. The caller said “you are NOT YET a defendant in a lawsuit”, and then insinuated that if I did not pay them immediately; I would be sued. I tried to ask for information regarding the debt, but they continued to vaguely reference a potential lawsuit and pushed me for my credit card number.

I don’t think I handled things correctly, but I was caught off guard and afraid. I asked if they’d send me a letter validating the debt. They refused and said they had already done that. If that’s true, I honestly never received it. I’m not sure if maybe it could’ve been lost in the mail when I moved last.

Anyway, they were being rude and I was panicking, so I wanted to end the call. I asked them if they were local and if the number they called from was a good call back number. They said yes and I hung up. The number was my area code. Quick google search reveals it was a spoofed number and they’re across the country.

I googled the name of the law firm and found complaints that they are a collection agency, not an actual law firm. I pulled my credit reports and had new accounts in collections, but under a different agency. I couldn’t tell if they were the same accounts, because the caller refused to give any info.

Tried to google my rights, then I filed a complaint. I’m not sure if that was the right thing to do, but eventually I received a letter from them saying they’d closed the accounts. So I went ahead and disputed all of them on my credit report. They were all removed. I spent time building my credit from there.

Fast forward to now, credit karma sends me an email that my credit score suddenly tanked. I go to look, all those accounts were newly reported into collections. Under a THIRD agency. I have not received any communication from this new agency, no letter and no phone calls. They went straight to reporting and it wrecked my credit. Dropped it almost 100 points.

I tried disputing everything again. Equifax removed everything, but Experian said one of the accounts is “verified”. I filed another complaint. And now suddenly after I filed the complaint, this new third agency has started calling me incessantly. From several different numbers, from blocked numbers, at all hours of the day. The latest was at 9:11pm on Wednesday. Sometimes when I answer, it’s just silence and then they hang up.

What the hell do I do now? I’ve tried to figure this out on my own and I’m waaaay over my head now. Who do I contact? How do I fix this disaster? Am I just stupid for thinking this can’t be right? Sorry for the novel. I don’t even know how to condense it.

**TL;DR** - CA claimed to be law firm, threatened to sue me, then said they closed the accounts when I filed a complaint. Disputed and removed them from my credit report. Now a third agency reported the same accounts without contacting me and giving me a chance to respond before wrecking my credit score. Feels like I’m being harassed. Don’t know how to proceed.",finance
personalfinance,27% interest rate credit card - should I pay it off with another card/loan with a lower interest rate?,"I'm currently tackling my credit cards - and I have two left. 

I have a best buy credit card with a 27% APR and balance of $2200. I am realizing now how preposterous that APR is. Should I acquire a different loan to pay it off completely? Would one of those ""pay off your debt"" services help here? My only other credit card is a line of credit through my bank, which has a 13% APR and a balance of $2200. I could see about raising the limit, not sure if that's smart though.

personalfinance,Help me pull the trigger on my finances! Advice needed after Step 5/6 of the flowchart.,"I need to open a roth for myself and my husband and figure out what funds would be best to have in it. I also want to buy some stocks (will set aside some fun money for this, I know its not ideal to “beat the system”).Not sure if its wise to trade stocks within an account or probably separate is better. I know I should open an account with vanguard, fidelity or schwab but can someone please help me figure out which one would be best for me? That is what’s making me not able to put my foot down so far. Is there any hidden fees I should watch out for? I heard some accounts you need to have more money to open up the better fund types? I am willing to do it as long as its within my means. If I can only start my roth with 5.5k in the account, can I not get access to the better funds if they cost more? I  Also would love to hear advice for our situation.

Last year my hubby and I did not qualify for a roth but I think this year we can make it work. I wanted to do the megabackdoor roth but it was quite complicated.

Some background Info:
Emergency funds: yes 
Debt: mortgage 170k @ 3%
Tax Filing Status: Married filing jointly
Tax Rate: 28% Federal (2017), 9.3% State
State of Residence: CA
Age: 32  

I am pretty much at step 5/6 of the flowchart and just need help with the details of it and advice for hubby’s situation. 

My workplace offers a 401k Roth which I max out and have set up most of my money to go there and some goes to the 401k (non-roth) portion which my company matches at 3%. Is that good? Also, I can still put 5.5k in my personal roth though right?
I also have inherited my dad’s ira and currently its being managed by a financial investor at LPL and he charges 1% annually. It has been growing steady...but of course I wonder if its really funded to the best of my interest. Should I take the reins and not have him manage the account? If so, what should I do with it? Put it in a target date fund?

My husband works two jobs currently. He works a few days of the month at his old job which most of his retirement 401k is there at Prudential. I think the options are not that great there. His full time job is at UCLA where he gets a pension and they offer a 403b there with fidelity. Should he put most of his savings into the 401k at the old place or open up the 403b and transfer it in? Or should he rollover his 401k? Regardless, I am thinking he should open up the 403b with fidelity and just opening up a roth there too.
Also, if I wanted to dabble in buying some stocks, should I do it in one one of these accounts so I don’t have tax implications?

Also, where do people stash away extra cash to let it grow more and reach FIRE? After 18k max retirement account, I’ve just been saving the extra in my savings account for when I decide to buy a house.

Sorry if that was a bit all over the place. I hope that wasn’t too much or too little info to work with. Let me know if you need any more info. Thanks in advance for all your help.",finance
Banking,BoA flagged me for account abuse. Can I dispute?,"Hoping this is the right place for this. 

I banked with BofA until 2014, got fed up with their customer service, and went to a local credit union.

I went to my local branch, cleared the accounts and closed them...or so I thought.

We recently moved out of our credit unions area and tried to open a new account with another CU only to be told that BofA had flagged us for account abuse, as one of the accounts I ""closed"" was overdrawn by over $200.

Calling BofA, I've been told that the accounts are now ""force closed"" so they will not continue to acrue debt, but that they cannot pull my statements to see what caused the issue. They then asked for a payment toward the balance. 

We did nothing with that bank account after we closed it. We destroyed the debit cards and never gave it another thought.

Is there recourse here? I need to be able to open a new bank account here. Our money is still with our old credit union, 1500 miles away. which is fine, but also inconvenient. It has also been tanking our credit, which was already suffering from medical debt. 

I can't find anything clear on the law from google.

personalfinance,"Help me figure out this real estate transaction, owe more on loan than what I took the loan out for after a year.","Ok, I'll try to keep this quick and simple.  

I had taken out a $250,000 mortgage to buy a house, I had the house for 15 months.  

The interest rate was about 4%.  

Property tax was about $5,500/year.

The monthly mortgage bill was $1800 +/- including property tax, insurance, etc.

I fell on hard times and missed 2 payments, then decided I wanted to try to do a mortgage modification program, so started on that. After a while I realized I just cannot at all afford this house anymore due to some unforeseen financial circumstances, so decides to sell it.  

All in all I had missed probably 5 or 6 payments on the mortgage before I had the funds from selling the house to pay off the mortgage.  

I end up selling the house for about $295,000.  

Now, after owning the house for just over 1 year, (15 months) and missing 5 or 6 payments total before closing on selling it, how did my pay off quote end up being $258,000?  

How did I end up having to pay $8k more than the loan was even for? I still made money on the deal, just, about $8k less than I was expecting.   

What could be the reason for that $8k amount more than what I had even got for the loan originally?  

To me, it seems like they are charging me for those payments that I had missed (less the other escrow items included in the monthly mortgage bill, so just the principle and interest on the loan, not the tax and such) but in my mind, once I paid off what the loan was for, shouldnt I not have to pay for the missed payments also?  

I just assumed after making the 9 or 10 payments I made out of 15 months, that the amount of the payoff would have gone down some, not gone up $8k.  

Any ideas? Am I just missing something? Is there some clause in some mortgage that would cause this discrepancy? How does it work?

Thanks.  

And I realize it was a stupid buy, I lucked out by making any profit at all, and am trying to fix my financial and credit situation. Just trying to make sure I'm not losing $8k for no reason, due to an error.",finance

Ripple,Part Owner of the Technology (XRP),"One of the things I think people struggle with is the relationship between their investment in XRP as a digital asset and ownership in Ripple the company. What is often made clear is that ownership in XRP tokens does not denote ownership in Ripple in the classic sense, as an investment security, like a stock or bond. 

I would argue ownership of XRP is actually better than a bond or a stock and I present the following reasons why:

1. XRP's supply is finite, and integral to the ledger itself. It is therefore central to the use case and utility that anyone hoping to utilize the benefits of such a confederated consensus ledger hopes to derive (scalability, settlement speed, etc.) A stock or bond, or any classical investment vehicle, has no such properties, corporations can function and thrive without them in the public sphere. Stock and bond issuances are centrally controlled and are at the discretion of the majority holders. 

2. Owning XRP is literally owning part of the technology itself. In the most technical sense, the token is the portion of the blockchain code necessary for trustless value transfer, which depends on no one single agent. Can you imagine how valuable it would be to own part of Google's search algorithm, or the code that underpins Apple's App store? You can't. The technology is all at the end of the day, Ripple just happens to have and recruit the best people to leverage it. There are lots of smart people in the world that can leverage it too. 

3. Detractors argue that ownership in XRP does not automatically confer the success and profitability of Ripple. The most often cited example is how the number of xCurrent contracts signed to date are having no immediate effect on the speculative market price of the token. This is true, however it ignores the accumulating of future leveraged network effects to be leveraged by the Ripple team (with xVia/xRapid). Let's not forget, this low beta correlation works both ways. The fact that ANY corporation that leverages XRP as a digital asset can incur value on the token when used in utility (i.e. COIL or as yet unheard of companies in some garage somewhere) to me reflects a future added benefit, not a negative. As an investor I am potentially holding a digital asset that is inherently diversified, not singularly tied to the success or failure of one Corporation. Can we say that about any stock or bond presently in existence? What are the real benefits of stocks anyway, voting rights, dividends, bankruptcy entitlements as a creditor?  How do these benefits compare to the possibility of real diversification when a fully realized ecosystem is developed? What better hedge against bankruptcy or corporate failures is there than a technology that can continually rise from the ashes depending on it's wielder? When the value of my asset is reinforced by a legion of corporations, not just Ripple or COIL, it begins to reflect and economy, not a company. 

4. When I hold stocks or bonds, how liquid is that asset? What degrees of freedom do I have with it? Can I tell fidelity to bundle it with my retirement account, only if their fund managers wish it so. Can I transfer it to another firm to manage on my behalf for lower fees? Can I directly leverage it as collateral for raising capital loans without having a team of corporate contract lawyers? Can I pay global debts and settle instantly for my vendors with a bond or stock without incurring massive hurdles and fees? 

Freedom means many things, but to me,  cryptographic digital assets that settle via consensus, and without intermediates, begs the imagination, and makes traditional assets seem like playthings.",cryptocurrency

investing,Why arent laptop/computer prices coming down?,"Laptops/computers/technology generically are rapidly depreciating items and for a lot of very good, robust reasons (moores law, etc). Laptops have stayed at pretty much the exact same price and in some cases have somehow increased in price over the previous 2+ years for the exact same models. This is alarming for several reasons. Either inflation is that goofed or we have a situation where a large number of stocks have a bunch of assets sitting on their sheets at pretty much astronomically too high of value. Normally because these types of items practically go to zero in next to no time sitting on the shelf at the end of a cycle they will do their best to clear inventory knowing that there isnt any way this items about to appreciate and as soon as they can get it sold the better because the losses will only be worse. Instead apparently weve got a strategy where to avoid an immediate not that significant haircut because everybody already bakes that in pretty much we have a situation where stuff could literally just crater. Personally if im a large institution id just want folks to have a reasonably stable return stream rather than a random sudden mark to market. I would really hope they start selling some of those at reasonably good prices pretty much immediately especially with the next cycle of hardware coming to market.

personalfinance,"Should I refinance my loan now, or wait?","Two years ago, I bought a pre-owned 2015 Ford Focus for $13k at a 14.44% interest rate. I know I'm getting gouged on that price; I was a first time car buyer with a part time minimum wage job and shitty credit. Since then, I've graduated from college and gotten a better paying job with similar hours, but only because I split my time between two jobs making $12 and $18 an hour and working near 32 hours a week. I work in mental health and education, and my specific position makes it difficult to balance those two or else I'd take more clients and get more hours. The only reason I got the loan at all is because my parents, who make near $100k combined, agreed to cosign, but their credit was also not great.

My credit score has also vastly improved. It's up to 655 according to Credit Karma, which while not great is a lot better than the 500 I started out at. Both Creditwise and Credit Karma are suggesting I refinance to lower my interest rate, resetting my loan by a few months (original was for 72 months and suggested refinance is 60 months, I'm currently at 52 months). My current monthly payment is $285.64. My parents, who have also improved their credit in the intervening years, have agreed to cosign as long as it results in a lower monthly payment.

I am preparing to begin applying for, and hopefully attending, graduate school to enter my ideal career. While I can afford the payments now, reducing them would be helpful when the time to find an apartment comes. I plan to keep working in grad school as long as I am able to, but even a little budgetary wiggle room would be immensely helpful. At the moment, I have no other expenses besides a student loan that will enter repayment in December, and my current job(s) are enough to handle my debts and save to build an emergency fund. I am fortunate to still be living with my parents until grad school, and possibly through it if I attend one of the schools on my list. I'm planning on putting my student loans in in-school deferment for grad school and fighting hard to make payments on the interest for the unsubsidized loans.

My question is: does it make financial sense to pursue refinancing now, or wait until I'm closer to moving for grad school? If I refinance, would more money go to the principal, or should I stay at the higher rate if it's reducing the principal faster? My current lender, Ally, does not allow payments directly to principal. If I refinance now, I imagine it would also make sense to take the now freed money and add it to my slowly growing emergency fund until such a time as that money is needed for other necessary expenses.",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week of September 17th - 21st, 2018.

# **WEEK AHEAD: Stocks could buck September trend and hit new highs** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/stocks-could-buck-september-trend-and-hit-new-highs.html)*

* Stocks may aim for new highs, as soon as the coming week, even though there are some mixed cross currents impacting the market.
* September is usually a weak time for stocks, but the market has defied a lot of market lore this year, such as August is bad for stocks and the ""sell in May"" trend.

*****

&gt; Stocks could be bucking for new highs, even as the market deals with negative cross currents in what historically has been a weak month.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed out a positive week Friday with a gain of 1.2 percent to 2,904 and is now 12 points away from its all-time high. But traders are perplexed by the lagging performance of financial stocks, even as interest rates and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 3 percent Friday. Nasdaq was also higher for the week, with a gain of 1.4 percent, as tech shook off some of the worries that had been weighing on the group and rose 1.8 percent for the week.
*****
&gt; ""It's kind of concerning that rates are back to 3 percent, and the banks are not acting well,"" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. ""It may be they don't believe rates are going to stay up here. The banks muted expectations at a conference this week. A bunch of them spoke, and Wall Street didn't like what it heard about the next quarter.""
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P financial sector was down 0.4 percent for the week and was the only negative major sector, even as the S&amp;P edged within 12 points of its all-time high.
*****
&gt; ""The question is can we get above and stay above the high of the year, which was 2,916. If we survive September and get through October, that could clear the road for 3,000,"" on the S&amp;P 500, said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com.
*****
&gt; ""A close above 2,916 would open the door for more upside. It could happen next week. Next week historically is not a good week in the market. If we get past that, the probabilities increase for a fourth-quarter rally. That could start sooner than many people think,"" said Redler.
*****
&gt; The coming week does not have much on the agenda, so traders will be watching for developments on trade with both China and Canada.
*****
&gt; There are some economic reports, including existing home sales Thursday and the Philadelphia Fed survey, but not much in the way of major news on the economy. Fed speakers are also quiet ahead of their Sept. 25 and 26 meeting, where they are expected to raise interest rates.
*****
&gt; There is also a late-quarter lull in earnings reports, with just a handful of reports, including FedEx and Oracle Monday, General Mills Tuesday and Micron Thursday.

&gt; We’ve had many requests this week to look at how equities do around major hurricanes and, using data from the National Hurricane Center, we found that markets generally appear to have taken the catastrophes in stride.

&gt; “As tragic as major hurricanes can be, they appear to have little immediate impact on equity prices,” according to Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, after the 15 most costly hurricanes to hit the United States, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher six months later 13 times. Additionally, the returns going out one to six months are quite strong as well.

&gt; If you are in the path of Florence, stay safe!

# Any Fourth Quarter Rally Could Be Underwhelming

&gt; As of today’s close DJIA is up 5.1% year-to-date, S&amp;P 500 is up 8.0% and NASDAQ is up a solid 15.5%. All three indexes are just a few percentage points below their respective all-time highs. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ were at their highs in August while DJIA still has not cleared its January high. Nonetheless, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all well above historical average levels for this time of the year compared to past midterm years. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are also well above respective averages in all years.

&gt; Comparing “All Years” (solid red line) to “All Midterm” years (solid black line) in the charts above there is a well pronounced fourth quarter rally in both whether the index was positive for the year or not. The rally is present in “Midterm” years beginning right around the start of October and begins slightly later in October in “All” years. However, the magnitude of past fourth quarter rallies in “Midterm” years is notably greater across all three indexes than in “All” years. This pattern would seem to suggest that this year’s solid, above average midterm year gains could lead to a less than spectacular fourth quarter rally.

personalfinance,ELI5...Why not just switch into a TDF 2/3 of the way to the date?,"I understand the love for Target Date Funds and my TSP is fully in one of the lifecycle funds.  But for my Roth IRA, and in general, I'm questioning some things. I'm probably just an idiot so help me out and thanks in advance.

Let's say you are an early 30s individual starting to invest in a TDF on a Roth IRA. You have TSP, federal pension, and social security down the line, so the Roth IRA is on the side.  As guinea pig funds let's take the Schwab SWYJX Target Index 2055 and Schwab SWTSX Total Stock Index.  You didn't start investing when you were 20, so you already feel a bit behind. For the Roth, long term gains are the goal, not lowering short term risk.  

Why on Earth would you want to be in bonds and international to such a large extent in SWYJX? Couldn't you very easily get superior returns from staying in the admittedly more volatile SWTSX for 10-15 years, selling during a good period, and switching to the TDF for the last 20 or so years? 

I understand the concepts of diversification and the ease of the TDF, and also that past superior returns on SWTSX or similar funds are no guarantee of future returns. But the more I read, the more the consensus seems to be that long term stock index holders do best.  So my question can be distilled down to: why not hold a riskier but higher growth index fund to enjoy better returns for a mid to long period and then shift to the TDF later on during a good time, and enjoy the diversification and portfolio adjustment it provides during your sunset years?  What am I missing? Why not just be fashionably late to the TDF party, wouldn't you still reap the benefits? 

Thanks so much.",finance

Both my wife and I (30-35) are regularly contributing to RRSPs through employers, have no high interest debt (aside from our trailer loan at 5%). Two vehicle leases at nominal interest rates and a 2.68% mortgage.

We have an emergency savings fund already established and though we're not the best budgeters, are always in the black.

personalfinance,How seriously should I be taking the recession predictions?,"Friends and media keep talking about the next recession happening soon, and that I should be selling stock and holding onto cash.

Any other situation, I'd take all this with a grain of salt -- I've heard talk about the next big recession and the impending bursting of the tech bubble since 2014. But I'm in grad school now and have roughly $10K in my vanguard brokerage account that I've been keeping because I figured it'd gain more faster than parking it in my Ally savings account. I'm planning on pulling it soon anyway to help pay for next year's tuition.

Should I just withdraw the money now and put it in the savings account now? (argument being that maybe it's unlikely that the stock market would fare much better than 1.85% interest rate between now and next July)",finance
personalfinance,18 year old wanting to learn everything about banks: Saving and checking accounts.,"hi, so I made a similar post learning about taxes, now i wanna learn about banking.I did some research and have some questions about it.   


what I know: I know you can open banks in places like Chase to put money in. you can have credit card and debit card (i know how they work and what they are used for). I also knew that chase gives saving and checking accounts. but learning more, it seems like there are other banks specifically made for savings accounts and they give high APR (interest rate?). I also learned that they are federally insured to 250k so I dont have to worry about losing my money.   


right now, my family has about 15k in chase saving account and i learned that they have .01% APR interest rate while others give 2% or more. should i be switching it? can you have more than 1 bank at the same time? IG: can you open a saving account in different bank and put our chase saving in there while continuing to use chase? what are the benefits and disadvantages of having saving account? can you take out money from saving account like regular or is it more like 401k? what is online banking? how should i worry about theft? what is liquidity? maintenance fee? and if these banks exist that give you these good interest, why would anyone ever save in any bank that gives less interest?   


what are other forms of savings i can do thats better? like something about direct deposit or something",finance

personalfinance,Common Sense Lending?,"Is there anywhere on earth that gives loans based on actually have a person examine the situation and decide about the loan? All the companies obviously use a formula to decide if they will lend to you or not and these formulas currently would not offer me a loan but I’m in a situation that would be easily fixable and causes me a lot of hardship. 

A few years ago I got into a high interest debt cycle (I don’t need to be lambasted for this, I’m a moron and believe me I crucify myself in my head every day for it). I’ve been looking for solutions to it forever, but the crazy thing is I make a ton of money. I work multiple jobs and make 75-80k per year and my loans are under 10k combined. 

The interest rates are just so high they eat all my income almost instantly the day I get paid and I can’t afford to put more than maybe 50$ a week towards the principle (the payments are over 600 a week and take off basically 0 principle). 

Isn’t there anywhere I can go and just say:

“look, I make 75k a year, if you lend me 8k to pay these off I can do 1k a month payments for 12 months and it’s great for me and your company”

And have that go into consideration instead of just “Oh sorry system says you are near your credit limit nothing we can do” etc

I understand these people don’t know me etc but it seems insane to me that these companies wouldn’t want to make that deal. I made my mistakes years ago, but I’m just trying to stop my entire life from being ruined by it.",finance

Over time, due to rising costs of living (Orange County) and my compulsive spending habit (discussed below), we accrued something to the effect of $7k in auto loans (2.1%), $65k in federal student loans (4-7%), and about $35k in consumer debt (credit cards refinanced to fixed-rate and term unsecured personal loans - 7-14%).


I am the sole income earner. I just started a job in the past three months paying me $50k gross yearly, $35k after taxes, insurance/FSA, retirement, etc. deductions. My husband's grant financial aid and part-time student job bring us another $8-$10k/year net. We spend about $1000/month in debt/loan repayments, which amounts to the required payments on our fixed personal and auto loans, and the minimum amount allowed on the student loan REPAYE plan. 


Enter the problem: basically, due to a privileged upbringing, I never really learned the value of money. Throughout college my parents paid my bills, so I had no concept of how much life in Southern California actually costs. I had a shock when I graduated and my parents effectively cut me off. So, in the interest of maintaining my previous lifestyle, I became addicted to credit cards and spending money frivolously (stupid, I know). I racked up thousands of dollars in debt that I miraculously was able to keep up with the minimum payments on, but always rang them back up and kept opening new cards to keep up with my spending habits. 

Now, I'm sure that this is a story you've all heard before. What I am asking for is genuine, no-holds-barred, harsh truth about my situation and how the hell I am going to get out of it. I know I have a problem, but I don't even know where to start to fix it.

personalfinance,"Single dad w/ 4 kids, live with family for help with kids. My kids mother never contributed, but passed a few weeks ago, we now qualify for about $1k a month in social security.","I’ve posted numerous times and have always received great advice, so I want to say thank you in advance. So 2 years ago I separated with my wife and moved back to my home town with my mother/sister/grandparents because I needed help with my kids. I was unemployed and incredibly depressed, I took a job making $13 an hour, and I received a couple of raises and promotions for working hard and what not. Last may after a bunch of great advice from this sub I’m now making close to $50k a year (with over time).  Because we live with family we don’t have many living expenses, and over the last 2 years I’ve paid off over 25k of debt, my credit score went from 590 to 720, and my only remaining debt are my federal student loans. My emergency fund is at about 3 months, and I have over 10k in credit cards if ever needed. To be honest I’ve been spending money kinda frivolously because I was going through a divorce and now because she passed away (retail therapy I guess). 

Because of her passing we’ll now receive about 1k a month in survivor benefits, and I don’t know how to plan for that. I could very quickly save up to buy a house right now, but I don’t know if that should be a priority because to be honest I still need help with my children, and there are so many other living expenses I’d absorb. Also we currently live in a suburb and I don’t know if I could afford to live in the area and keep my kids in the same school. Part of me feel like I should just leave that money separate and start college funds for all my kids. Also I’m 33 and don’t have much saved for retirement. My 401k isn’t even a year old and I’m only contributing 5% a month. 

I’ve made a ton of steps in the right direction, and I want to stay on track. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Friend I have loaned money is being audited,"So over the years I have loaned some money to my friend with a pretty bad gambling problem.  

&amp;#x200B;

In 2014 I loaned him $2600 over the first few months that he would normally pay me back right away.  It would be in smaller amounts of $600 here or $400 there.  He paid that all back.

&amp;#x200B;

In October 2015 it hit the fan and I gave him $5,000.  He paid me back $5000 in April of 2016 when he got his bonus (sales job).

&amp;#x200B;

In October of 2016 I loaned him $3,000 for some legal fees he had with a sever speeding ticket.  I once again got that money back in April of 2017, but this time he gave me $3,330 back as a thanks for my generosity.  

&amp;#x200B;

In September of 2017 I gave him $1,000 that he gave me back in October.  One week later I gave him the $1,000 back and he gave me the money back in November. 

&amp;#x200B;

In December of 2017 I gave him $5,000.  In February of 2018 I gave him an additional $900.  He paid me back a total of $6,400 for my generosity (this was in April of 2018). 

&amp;#x200B;

In May of 2018 I floated him $1,500 that he paid me back in June.  

&amp;#x200B;

That brings the total to $20,000 over the years.   I got back $20,800 total. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now he asked again for money last month and I told him no.  He can't have anymore because he's got a problem and I was enabling him.  He understood and hasn't asked for anymore which is good.

&amp;#x200B;

However, he's got some legal trouble.  In 2016 he wrote off his home office and personal car.  The problem?  He had a company car and the company reported it via some form.  So they audited his 2016 car allowances.  He wrote off $600 and was able to find $580 in gas station transactions.  Of course some of those where for things like cigarettes, but it doesn't show that on the bank statement.   He had the company car in Arkansas.  His personal car was in NC (family here) and he also told the IRS he used it because his territory was in NC (which wasn't true, but I am not sure how they can prove that?)   He got the IRS letter August of last month.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now for 2017 he did two bad things.  First he originally didn't file his W2 from his second job.  Now he realized htey would catch on for him for this and filed an amended return.  However, that return stated that he owed $2,300, and and he mailed in the return WITHOUT the money.  The second thing he did was he wrote off his home allowance of saying he paid $2200 a month in rent.  However, he was paying his girlfriend half the rent due which was $500 a month.  His 2017 tax returns are not yet under audit. 

&amp;#x200B;

For 2018 he current put down as many exemptions as they allow so he pays NO federal income tax each month.  He clears $9,000 a month in his bank account each month (none of it goes to savings).  However, for 2018 the home office deduction is gone for W2 employees.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I see this going one of two ways.  1)  They say you can't write the car off and pay us the money.  2)  They say you can't write the car off and they smell a rat and keep going from there.  

&amp;#x200B;

If it goes the second way will I be in any legal trouble?  To clarify some of the money I gave him was cash, and sometimes it was checks or Venmo.  Same with him paying me back.  He's also got some debt collectors after him too.

&amp;#x200B;

financialindependence,On this day 10 years ago Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.,"September 15. That was a Monday.

The next day the Fed loaned AIG $85 billion to prevent bankruptcy.

The day after that Washington Mutual went up for sale and interbank lending stopped.

On Thursday treasurery secretary Paulson briefed Congress on an emergency relief plan being put together (later called TARP), the president cancelled his travel plans to remain in Washington, and Morgan Stanley shares dropped by 46% over the course of a few hours. Paulson tried to broker a deal to *give* Morgan Stanley to JP Morgan Chase for free, but JPMC *refused to take it*. 

On Friday Paulson announced a $700 billion bailout and said ""If it doesn’t pass, then heaven help us all.” President Bush later said, of the program, ""I've abandoned free-market principles to save the free-market system""

Since that time the stock market has returned something like 200%. Just a reminder to not let the fear take hold and prevent investment, even when it's hard and even when it's scary.

personalfinance,"I have to make the most difficult decision of my life soon. Do I stay the course with my current job, or accept a better job instead? (It's complicated)","Hey all, posted here several times before. Here's where we're at currently. I'm the manager of a certain fast food restaurant in the mall, been doing it for about a year now, plus another 8 years on the job. The owner is retiring in a few years and has talked to me about buying into the franchise as his successor.

I really love the idea of finally owning the place. And I've done the numbers over and over again, I would be making a lot of money if I managed to buy it. The thing is, I know there are no guarantees, even if I have his endorsement. Will corporate favour me? Will the bank lend me what I need? Maybe, maybe not. Also I'm getting contradictory information from the current owner and google about requirements to own my particular franchise.

Now, I'm really really good at customer service, like ungodly good at it. So naturally I attract a lot of attention, I've received a ton of job offers over the years. Mostly other entry level fields, so I just pass them over. Yesterday something rather exceptional happened, a man gave me his card, said he would like to talk to me about stealing me away from this job. His card indicates he's part of management for the Canada Revenue Agency.

I'm going to phone him on Monday when they're open. I'd like to see what exactly is on the table, and I know at the very least I've landed an interview for some position. That's a federal job, they pay well and have the best benefits. I would be living much more comfortably in the short term for certain. However, the consequence being that I am shutting the door forever on the prospect of owning my current store.

It's basically down to if I want to take the safe path to financial security, or do I go the risky all in approach for even greater financial gain?

I think I already know in my heart what I want. I'm 30, I've spent over 10 years of my life working in fast food, do I really want to spend another 3 or more years doing this? I'm a simple man with simple needs, I just want a basic house in a nice neighborhood. I have enough money saved to put 20% down on a good house, with the pay increase my goal could be achieved in just months.

Still, I always think of my Dad. He's often moaning about how he never bought property in Vancouver while he lived there and how he could have been a millionaire today. I know there will always be the ""what if"" conflict hovering above me for the rest of my life if I give it up.",finance
personalfinance,"Bad idea to use student loans for a house? Dad said he'd co-sign with me, agreed to sign lease TOMORROW, now he won't. Boyfriends parents offered to co-sign, but that might cause a rift between me and my family. Do I take their help or back out of the house?","So. I just transferred to a university about two weeks ago. My parents encouraged me to live at home to save money, so I never really looked into housing options. The only trouble is that the shortest commute by bus ends up taking two hours each way, and I already have a long day of studying and classes on campus. By the time I get home I'm burnt out and it's dark out and I have no time for homework. My counselor told me she's worried my commute will threaten to make me fall behind academically. 

A few friends of mine had another friend that was looking for another housemate. The rent is $550/mo. + $80 for utilities and the commute would be 7 minutes from campus. I really love the feel of the place and the girls who live there. It felt really natural when I first considered moving in with them. 

However since I initially was going to be living at home when I submitted my fasfa form, I didn't receive any aid for housing. I sent in a request for a change in living-arrangement that will potentially qualify me for housing aid, however interest rates for a loan through the SELF Loan or Wells Fargo would be lower, so I decide to do that. My dad agreed to co-sign the loan with me, and said that he was positive it would get approved if he co-signed so it wouldn't be too risky to sign the house lease before everything was processed. I am supposed to go over tomorrow to sign the lease and today he told me that he only said he would because he didn't want me to screw up my finances by taking out a loan in my own name, but he doesn't want the responsibly of it hanging over his head for years. I would not be comfortable applying for a loan and signing the lease before I know if it gets approved if I did not have a co-signer. 

My relationship with my parents is getting increasingly strained and being at home is tense and anxiety-provoking for me. If it would be financially feasible to be a bit independent from them, I feel that would be good for me mentally and academically. However I understand that that is a huge privilege and that in life we often have to suck it up and muster through situations that aren't ideal because, well, we have to. So if it seems absolutely idiotic to try to move into this house at this time, let me know. 

Another part of this, though, is that after being yelled at by my father, I went over to my boyfriends as I didn't want to be in the house any longer and needed somewhere quiet to do my homework. I was visibly upset, so I told them what happened, and they right away offered to co-sign with me. In the past they have offered to be a ""backstop"" for me if I ever needed, even if my boyfriend and I broke up they say they want to help me. They assured me that the amount I would need to request ($13,700) isn't a scary amount to them and that they trust I will be responsible with the loan. 

I have less than 24 hours to make a decision but I feel that if I can be assured that this isn't a monumentally idiotic decision, I want to do it. I am nervous about being in debt to my boyfriend's parents or that being too much to ask of them. I'm worried that, with tensions already high between me and my own parents, that me getting support from his parents will make them feel hurt and further make things tense between us. I feel if I stay just to not hurt their feelings I will grow resentful and depressed, but if I leave while they are feeling abandoned and animus toward me, I won't feel right either. I want to have a good relationship with them but I also feel like I need so badly to get the hell out of there. 

So what do I do? Financially, how sound of a decision is it to co-sign a loan from SELF Loan or Wellsfargo for $13,700 with my boyfriends parents to cover housing and a remaining sum of my tuition? (only $7,150 will be used for the house, the rest I would have to take out anyways. My dad will co-sign if it's just for the tuition but if I do choose to apply for a loan that includes the cost of housing, he no longer will.)",finance

personalfinance,When to save for a house?,"My wife and I have been discussing when to save for a house under the Prime Directive and I am curious what people think. Right now it feels like a moot point because houses in Utah seem to start ~300k in areas we would consider, but advice is welcome. 

Current debt:
 14k in debt on a car (2.5%interest), 
120k in federal student loans (6%), 
8k in private loans (5%)

However, I am in PSLF and have 6 years left to absolve my Fed loans. For my purposes, I assume 22k in payoff debt plus $160/month payment for 6 years since tackling my loans any other way feels like a Herculean task. 

Assets:
4K in cash
36k in 401k
2 vehicles, a 2011 Chevy Malibu paid off and a 2012 Toyota Sienna (14k loan). 

We live with my recently widowed father and pay his utilities (~300/month). I make ~70k/year and we have two young kids. 

Where should I be on the Prime Directive? I think our goal should probably be to save 6 months of expenses assuming my dad asked us to move out at some point, pay off the private loan and the car, and then work on a house down payment. My wife thinks we should go for 3 months expenses, but then save a down payment before paying off other debts because housing prices have gone up in Utah over 10% annually for several years.

[Specific loan information](https://i.imgur.com/7s2j57l.jpg)

I posted about this awhile ago and got some good information, but in the process of my recovery from heroin addiction had some more pressing financial issues to tackle first. However, my situation is a bit  different today...now my court fines are all paid up, I manage a Sober Living house so have much cheaper rent, just got a raise to $15 an hour at my warehouse job, and am beginning some chemical dependency courses at CSU East Bay to become a drug and alcohol counselor, so I'm on a relatively solid path.

As such, I'm finally ready to get my loans out of default and begin paying them down. They are almost all from 2012 when I was at Berkeley, before dropping out due to my relapse at the time. I have never made a payment, and all were done through the Dept of Education. Last year was the first year I had income and filed a tax return in about 5 years, and they took my refund of about $1000, but I don't see where that's reflected in my debt. I have a number of loans, and on the notice I recently received it says with the fees and interest, altogether I owe just over $40k.

So what I'm wondering is, since they apparently just sent it to a private collection agency, can I still do things like rehabilitation or consolidation through the Dept of Education? Would it be better to pay off some of the smaller loans individually, or consolidate them all? It looks like I have different interest rates on some versus others. How would consolidation change my interest rate? Would it be best to try and pay off the high interest loans first? Finally, I'd like to avoid them seizing my tax refund again next year, and while I'd likely put most of it toward my debt anyway, would prefer to do it on my terms.

personalfinance,Car was just totaled and I don't know what my next steps are financially.,"Being a short time lurker I have picked up a few tricks to help me learn to budget in my newness to this sub, but now I am kinda in a pickle. 

So to start off I was rear ended and my car was totaled out last week, they will pick it up this week.
Luckly me and my Fiance have another vehicle to share for a month or so. I am honestly looking at this as a blessing since I got this car when my credit was horrid and my interest rate is out of this world. 

So the insurance company isn't gonna pay off my loan due to the worth being less than whats owed. Thankfully I have GAP insurance which will take the rest. I am wanting a newer car and my price range is 10-15k for me to have the monthly payments I want. I will have $500 to put as a down payment. 

Now comes the problem. My credit was decent until I couldn't pay my student loans. (I just moved states and it really has me behind) so just today have I resolved that by requesting a forbearance. Which if I understood correctly it brings me to current like I never missed a payment due to retroactivating it on my missed month (april). So going off credit karma my score now is 530 (was 670). My fiance is also co signing with a credit score of 640. 

Now my questions:

1. Should I wait until my current car is picked up and my current loan is paid before applying for a new auto loan?

2. Should I wait until the forbearance is accepted and to affect my credit score before applying?

3. Should I apply where I currently have an auto loan, because I have banked with them previously and they might accept my credit score?

4. Not a question, but any advice dealing with auto loans or this situation at all is warmly welcomed. 

Thank you so very much in advance and I am sorry I tend to ramble when my nerves are shot, that translates to text aswell. 

Extra stats you may or may not need:

My yearly income: 27k

Fiance yearly income: 25k


EDIT - Thanks for all the info! So i probably should of put this in, but in my haze I forgot. The reason I am looking for something in this price range is because of a gas economy and reliability. I drive every other weekend to take care of my mother in GA which is 400 miles away. I moved away to for work, and sadly it is cheaper for me to help her than to hire someone. (I rotate with my aunt that lives in FL, she helps the other weekend)

Also remember this is both me and my fiance's car, instead of looking at just 27k look at it as 52k. I shouldn't of differentiated since both sources go to the same account. 

Now with this new info (I should of included) should I still look into a vehicle in that price range?

If not, what should I do with only having about month to save? I have one car and both me and my fiance work, and she goes to school full time still. I tried to carpool when I had a working vehicle, but no one wants to drive out of their way to pick me up.",finance

financialindependence,Withdrawal strategies,"Everyone knows the 3% / 4% rule - but it escapes me what actual strategies to use, which assets to sell and when exactly to make withdrawals.

I am simulating a mini retirement in my home country Sweden by using  investment returns from a Swedish broker to pay off my Swedish student loan. The investment and loan are equal in size but the investments return 10ish% while the loan interest rate is only 1-2% .

I now live and invest the Netherlands but intend to leave the investment at Swedish broker to self-sustain payments on student loan AND leave some ""playing money"" for when I go back and visit.

So, to my questions: 

At swedish broker I did stock picking instead of just the same index fund that I do currently, should I sell my highest returning assets first?

How often and what time of year should I make withdrawals? To avoid costs I am thinking just withdrawing lump sum 1x per year - but is there any particular month that would be most beneficial?

Is there any tax optimisation possible here?

And finally, I've been playing with the thought to only withdraw any amount over X, always leaving the principal untouched. However this has risk to bite me in the ass if there's a downturn and I cant make withdrawals to pay off the student loans anymore

personalfinance,Cashing in a Bank EE Bond through a relative &amp; tax - how does this work?,"Hi, I'm an American living in Canada.  I have a bank EE bond that just fully matured after approx 30 years. However, none of my local banks here in Canada can cash in the bond.

My relative, who also has his name on the bonds as someone able to cash them, has agreed to bring them back to the US and then mail me the money.

Being that I'm an American in Canada, how does the tax work for a Bank EE Bond?   

&gt;Both types of bonds are tax-deferred, in that you do not pay taxes on interest income until you redeem the bond. You may opt to pay tax on interest before they are cashed. All interest on US savings bonds are treated as standard income for income tax related purposes. EE and I-series bonds are exempt from all state and local taxes.

Will the ""federal tax"" automatically be deducted once the Bond is turned into the bank? Do I have to write down how much once I declare my taxes each year?

Or am I given the full amount of the bond, and I have to keep track how much I was given? I'm googling, but I can't seem to find what % of the income should be paid in taxes.

When they turn in the bond, should I tell them to bring me a statement?

CryptoCurrency,Trust is the largest energy consumer in the world. Cryptocurrencies and smart contracts can increase economic efficiency &amp; reduce prices of goods by almost an order of magnitude by reducing need for trust.,"As has been mentioned in many modern ""futurologist"" type writings, everything in the world can be summarized by its representation in energy. This is called ""Heat Theory"" or ""Theromdynamic Economics"" by some. A bed took energy from the sun to grow trees, and fossil fuels to cut, assemble, and transport. A website took office space, food, and electricity to create. A government took many types of energy to assemble and operate.

&amp;#x200B;

While certain commodities with mature markets and high volumes are becoming exceedingly efficient, look at your phone for an example, even the most mature markets use excessive energy for trust.

&amp;#x200B;

What is trust? Trust is the idea that you can reduce risk by knowing more about a counter-party. You trust your spouse not to cheat on you and have a child who isn't yours. You trust your bank not to steal your money. You trust your government to protect you and give you a good set of tools to work and live with. You trust your vendor to deliver quality product on time and on budget.

&amp;#x200B;

We use an inordinate amount of energy on assuring, validating, and enforcing trust. Law is the current defacto trust framework. Governments give us the framework of law to give us a safe way to interact with one another and create an environment where risk is reduced and trust can be reasonably assured. If an entity breaks the law the government assures us they will be punished. In this way there is decreased economic value in breaking trust. We can go about our lives with less concern of theft and deceit.

&amp;#x200B;

Governments of all type and entire industries such as banking, insurance, physical security, and various types of brokering, exist as ways to reduce risk. Versus not having them, they increase our economic efficiency because we do not have to plan as many contingencies when making a decision to buy a house or even go outside our home. Without them, each individual would need to accumulate all manners of security to carry the necessary power to live safely. Anyone who did not have the power to defend themselves or punish breaking trust would be taken advantage every day.

&amp;#x200B;

Information reduces the need for trust because risk is caused by unknown factors. The more known factors in a decision-making process, the less risk. The human factor is often the largest unknown in a decision making process. Will you get mugged? Will they deliver on time? In highly liquid markets the risk factors are valuated into commodity prices. By commodity, I mean anything that can be bought or sold, whether it be employment of a worker, an iPhone, some corn, a company stock, or a barrel of oil.

&amp;#x200B;

It is difficult to price the value of risk in all commodities, but we can easily valuate the industries which exist to reduce risk. These industries can not be replaced, but they can be made exceedingly efficient using cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. For 2017 we payed federal governments around $23T. We payed local governments $7T. We payed financial companies over $3T. We spent around $2T per year on weapons. These industries alone account for the majority of spending on trust. Many of their expenses are not trust-related, but the majority is. I will leave the details for a scholar to consider. There are also an insurmountable number of other industries and processes which exist to reduce risk and increase trust that I will ignore because they are difficult to valuate.

&amp;#x200B;

With the above considered, the working price of trust assurance is around $35T. Our global GDP was $80T in 2017, which means almost half our global expenses were related to assuring that people behave nicely with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

It is extremely naive to think that cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and smart contracts can be a silver bullet, but the fact is they are a highly efficient means of decreasing the requirement for trust. If we consider requiring trust to be a type of thermodynamic waste, perhaps one day we can double global efficiency by the effective utilization of these technologies.

&amp;#x200B;

To see the full result of blockchain, we as a global race, must reinvent things. I believe some changes will be gradual. We may see companies that find places a blockchain can increase efficiency of a particular process. I believe the most impactful changes will happen all at once, much like Bitcoin. Bitcoin up and replaces an entire set of industries. It does this not because it reinvents everything about them, it reinvents only a small part. But that small new part makes a set of assumptions that banks operate on irrelevant. The new assumptions make most of the processes of a bank redundant. In this way, the largest changes to efficiency will happen all at once when a new paradigm makes the workarounds of an old paradigm irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

Any entity which operates cubical farms of bureaucrats may see a smart contract that makes it irrelevant one day.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know what this looks like. Will governments still exist? Will banks still exist? It will take a long time for us to implement and mature all the ways we can utilize these technologies. However it is plain as day to see that smart contracts and other blockchains are an elegant solution to a lot of expensive problems in the world. If implemented by or on top of governments to replace processes that require administrators and bureaucrats, they have the potential to dramatically improve the lives of everyone on the planet.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Fell for the “pay day” loan scam when not in a good place, trying to get out of it but need some advice","When I was between jobs (had just started one and had to wait almost a month for my check due to the way the pay periods fell,) my savings were already a mess because of a less than favorable experience with workman’s comp from a hand injury, I ended up falling for a payday loan.

personalfinance,Is debt consolidation worth it?,"Hi there!

I have $24,000 in credit card debt currently. I have no other debt aside from this and make more than enough money to pay over the minimums each month. The part that is killing me is the super high interest rates (one is 18% and one is 20%). 

If I were to pay them off completely, I would not need to use my CC’s as I make enough to cover my bills, have fun, and even put some in savings. But I feel like I’m having troubles crawling out of the debt hole. 

Is debt consolidation a good idea? Is there a way to move everything to a much lower interest rate? Or are there CC out there where I can do a balance transfer (from Chase) to a 0% interest for a year?

personalfinance,"27yr old, $13,950 in debt. Just started new job with slight raise, need help getting out. TL;DR at bottom","Hi r/personalfinance


&amp;nbsp;


Using a throwaway since there are people on here who know my situation who I don't need knowing my real account. 
I'm a 27 year old woman currently working in the auto industry (not selling cars). Sparing the details of how I got started here, I recently quit my job of 8.5 years after several pay structure changes and started a new job last week. I used to make around $78,000/ yr up until the past couple years where, due to those structure changes, it dropped to about $68,000/yr (before taxes). I've been at this new job for 1 week so far. During the interview my new boss showed me the pay structure / numbers and if accurate, I should be making ~ $82,000/yr before taxes ($4,000 / month base salary + 1.5% of total department gross profit bonus). Likely just under $60,000 / yr take home. 


&amp;nbsp;



I was around 22 years old when I started making decent money after a couple promotions and made some stupid financial choices. I bought a brand new vehicle, helped a couple friends out, gave my dad a bunch of money for a business that ultimately failed, and racked up some credit card debt (10k at 19.75%). I went from having $12,000 in savings at 22, to being $22,000 in debt by 25. 


&amp;nbsp;


At this point, my total current debt is $13,950 


&amp;nbsp;


$2,900 is on a line of credit that's at about 10% interest rate now (used to be 7%, variable rate and Bank of Canada has raised it since I opened it) 


$11,050 left on a 5yr personal loan that I took out when I was 25 (3yrs left at current payments) and have been paying $358/month on since. Also variable rate, and is now at about 10% interest. 


No current savings. I did open a TFSA but I've been pouring all extra funds onto debt and none into savings. 


Visa balance is currently at 0. No credit card debt as of yesterday. 


&amp;nbsp;


The total debt load when I opened the personal loan in 2015 was at $22,000. At that time the line of credit was empty, but I had to put $3000 back on it when I had to sell my vehicle (lost $1,000 in the sale, but meant no more car payments) and buy a new car (bought a $2,000 beater). So in 2 years I've paid down ~ $8,000, $2000 of that being paid just yesterday after getting my last paycheck from my old job + payment from new job.  


&amp;nbsp;


Current Expenses: 


Rent - $900/month including heat/water/electricity (1 bedroom apartment, live alone) 


Phone bill - $140.00 / month 


Internet - $80.00/ month 


Car Insurance - $197.00 / month (I've shopped around extensively and this is the lowest I can get with 2 accidents on record) 


Renter's Insurance - $20.00 / month 


Gym Membership - $86.00 / month 


Gas - $215.00 / month 


Groceries - $450.00 / month 


Eating out / Entertainment - $350.00 / month 


Bank Fees - $29.00 / month 


Personal Loan Payment - $358.00 / month 


Pet Food / Supplies (cat) - $ 100 / month 


Netflix + Music Subscriptions - $20.00 / month 


This doesn't include unexpected expenses or shopping that isn't food related. 
I want to get the personal loan paid off ideally by the end of 2019 and not wait until I'm 30 to have that financial freedom. That would mean all extra money goes towards paying it off with nothing being put into savings. Is this a) possible and reasonably with my current expenses? and b) Wise? Or should I be making lower debt payments and putting some into savings. 


&amp;nbsp;


Ultimately, I want to not be in debt anymore so I can go back to school and get out of the auto industry altogether. Right now the idea of going back to school and racking up more debt overwhelms me and I feel super trapped in my current career just to be able to afford living + paying it off.  Any advice would be much appreciated! 


&amp;nbsp;


**TL;DR**
Started a new job and will be making around $82,000/ yr before taxes. Current monthly needs expenses around $2,970. Current debt $13,950 at 10% interest. Want to pay off by end of 2019. Is this realistic? Also, Help.

geothermal,"800 ft well, radiant heat, tankless backup?","I'm framing my new house now and I'm really starting to look into radiant heat + geothermal after getting 25-30k quotes for forced hot air.   

We live in a pretty cold climate (Northern New Hampshire, winter avg low 10F, rare drops to -10F).  We already drilled a well (for water, not a geothermal well) that went 800ft deep.  We're getting 7-8 gpm.  I don't know the temp of the water coming out.  We have plenty of land and the correct topography to discharge water onto our property.

Everything I've read tells me about 1T for every 1.5gpm.  House is ~3000 sqr/ft and if I need say 4-5T, that is going to be close to pushing my well to its limit.  

My questions are as follows:

* Would it ever make sense to have a geothermal water to water heat pump that fed into my tankless hot water heater?  The idea is that this is a failsafe if my well can't always produce what is needed.

* Maybe there is something else to look at that I'm not even considering?  I'm sure my situation is not uncommon?

personalfinance,Cashing out old 401k to clear debt?,"Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that it is never a good idea to cash out a 401k early, despite my current question.  I would never think about doing it, but I have had some unplanned circumstances occur in life .  I graduated with a doctorate last year, and have been working in a new position where I earn roughly $82,000 per year (4200 per month after taxes, 401k, insurance, etc).  My wife was recently laid off from her job.  Total monthly expenses are 3200, so we won't have issues paying bills or continuing to save money.  Monthly expenses could also be cut a few hundred depending on us dropping streaming services, shopping at cheaper grocery stores, etc, which we are planning on doing.  Approximately 6k in savings, but we have been working on that.  We recently found out that she was pregnant, despite our best efforts.  While we weren't expecting it, it was something we planned on for the future.

Our plan was always for her to be a stay at home mom, because daycare costs would take about 3/4 of what she would normally earn in her profession.  Daycare ranges around 900-1200 per month, she would make approximately 20k before taxes.   We were also working hard to pay down as much debt as we could prior to starting a family.  Currently there's 21k in student debt, 10k on financed car, around 80k on the mortgage, and 50k on a loan from my credit union that I used to pay off a bulk of my student loans to get a better interest rate.  We have no credit card debt.  I have a 401k from my previous family that has 33k.  I understand the taxes and fees that come into cashing out early, but I was wondering if taking that 19k and using it to pay off the car and a chunk of the student loans in order to free up 450 dollars a month or so would make sense.  Again, I know the general advice is to never cash out early, but I'm concerned that that \~1000 extra dollars a month won't go far with a new baby in the family.  Any advice would be helpful.",finance
investing,Looking for advice on where to move non-retirement money that is currently short term bond funds,"I am in my early thirties and have a non-retirement account with $268k.  This is money that is currently being set aside for early retirement.  For the most part, I don't expect to need the money for at least 15 years.  However, a small portion of this account is invested in Vanguard Short Term Bond Fund and cash and serves as my 6 month emergency fund.  I keep a few months of expenses in my savings/checking account, but I don't like to keep too much there since it pays such paltry returns.  I'm fine taking a small loss if I have to pull this money out when and if an emergency arises.

My account is currently 86% stocks, 11% short term bonds (i.e. bond fund) and 4% cash.  I'm getting killed on the bonds since the interest I'm receiving is completely offset by the decline in NAV based on fed rate increases.  I feel like with taxes, I'm actually doing worse than if I was in cash.  Can anybody recommend a better strategy where I can get some net profit from this money to at least partially offset inflation?  So far, I have considered converting the bond fund to cash or high dividend stocks.  Cash obviously loses to inflation, but seems preferable to my bond fund.  Dividend stocks have more risk, but they may actually offset inflation and they are more tax efficient.

financialindependence,I (20M) just hit 50K net worth because of this sub and wanted to say thanks,"I’m in a pretty good mood today, but can’t really share why with anybody IRL, so I figured I’d share here. 

For some background, I've been a regular reader of /r/financialindependence since I was a Junior in high school.  Originally, I was just curious about finances and the stock market in general, but over time began to realize that the idea of becoming financially independent appealed to me.  Thus, I resolved to devote myself wholeheartedly to that end once I got a job.  That ended up being pretty quick, as I decided later that year to enlist in the Air Force for personal reasons.  After graduating High School, I quickly left for basic training, and from there began to put into practice what I had learned.  

There were some rough patches here and there, but a little over two years later I hit my very first personal milestone:  [$50,000 in net worth.]( https://imgur.com/7iKNBIf) On top of that, I have a fairly nice car, a great credit score, and, thanks to my military benefits, my future college degree all but paid for.  It might seem cliché to say it was all thanks to a forum on the internet, but honestly, it’s the truth.  Without r/FI, I never would’ve known to save any of my money (much less &gt;50%), wouldn’t have known to start building my credit early on, would’ve likely bought a car I could barely afford with an outrageous interest rate loan, and probably wouldn’t have realized anything was wrong until reality slapped me in the face 10 years down the line.  I can say all that with relative certainty because I’ve been watching many of my peers make those exact mistakes over these past two years, blowing every paycheck down to the last penny.  

I realize I’m still young, and have a long way to go, both in life and in my journey to FI, but I just wanted to thank all of you here who contribute your thoughts, research, and experience to this subreddit.

personalfinance,I'm 22 and in debt from student loans and wondering if it is a bad idea to use my leftover loan money to survive for my last year of college,"Hi,

I'm new to Personal Finance so sorry if I'm formatting this poorly or if i'm leaving out information just let me know!

Lately I've been feeling like my mental state has been terrible after realizing how much debt I am in. All in all, I wish I made some different decisions on where I went to college but regardless I am about 39,000 in debt (32,000 of unsubsidized + subsidized and 7,000 in a private student loan from Discover) and just started my 5th year. I'm majoring in Business Management of Information Systems so hopefully I can find a job to pay it off smoothly. Anyways, this year I took out a private loan of 7,000 since my cap has been met on federal loans. I ended up taking out too much, and left myself with 3,200 additional dollars after everything (paying for dorms and tuition). It's been sitting in my account for now, but I really feel like I need to quit my part time job to ensure that I survive my last year of upper division courses which have been getting tough and time consuming. While I've been doing really well in school maintaining a 3.5 GPA the last 2 years, I have this constant fear that failure of even one class will cause my debt to skyrocket even higher. I am no longer scared of how long school will take me to finish but rather how much money I am going to owe at the end of it. I've been advised by a friend that if I quit I should try and budget very hard to use as little of my loan money as possible to survive the semester which ends December 23rd. In total, my balance including my own money and the leftover loan money is about 4,500 dollars.

My expenses really are only my iPhone payment ($41.66 per month) and my food expense which I'm unsure what I'd look to aim for. I'm guessing between 200-300 dollars per month?

Is it a dumb idea to quit my job for my mental sanity and focus on school by using some of my loan money to survive until December 23rd?",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my car loan in 18 months?,"Im a personal finance newbie that’s trying to navigate down the road of financial freedom (i.e. my knowledge is lacking but I’m eager to learn!!!) 


Earlier, I had this thought, but since I don’t quite consider myself financially literate, I’m not sure if this is a smart thing to do or not... please feel free to correct me as needed... constructive criticism welcome as well. And if you feel you need more details, please ask. So, here’s what I thought:

I have about ~$8,900 left on my car loan. I plan on keeping this car until I physically can no longer drive it (ie no plans whatsoever of purchasing another/new car in the near future). 

My current car payment is $228/month, and I believe the interest rate is at ~4.5%. 

According to my calculations, if I pay $495 a month, I can pay my entire car loan off in 18 months. The downside to this would be that I have less money to put in my savings. The upside would be that 1) I no longer have a car payment and 2) I could put that $228/month in my savings (would eventually like to invest), which means I would then be able to put ~$700/month in savings/investments (I currently put ~$500/month in savings + the $228 from my car payment). 

Some (maybe useful) details: 

Aside from my car loan, the only other debt I have is ~$18k in student loans. I’m currently still in school so no required payments yet. 

I have 2 credit cards. 1 is an $800 limit and currently $0 balance, the other is an $850 limit with a $300 balance that I plan to pay by the end of this week. 

As I mentioned, I currently put roughly $500/month in savings, so, essentially I would just be putting this toward the car loan (and maybe budget to still put ~$100/month in savings while paying off car loan so I’m not completely lacking in savings). 

The parts that scare me a little are 1) I wouldn’t have much money to put into my savings during this time and 2) it would take a little more effort and discipline in regards to budgeting to make sure I can pay $500/month on my car loan. 


Is this a smart thing to do? Are my calculations accurate? Should I try to pay off my car in 18 months? Is doing so worth it? 

Constructive criticism and advice welcome!!!

investing,Is there an easy way to see when companies' debt will be rolled over? I think this will trigger the end of the bull market.,"Corporate debt as a percentage of GDP is significantly higher now than in the pre-financial crisis era. Older readers may recall that the short term debt market dried up in the crisis, which meant that big companies were actually staring down the barrel of ""how will we make payroll this week?""

In response to that debacle, companies have since issued debt with longer duration. This makes them less exposed to short term panics, as they're more flush with cash (supposedly). The flip side is that, unless the company plans to pay down that debt, they're exposed to rollover risk. This is when they want to issue new debt to pay off the old debt (i.e., roll it over), BUT interest rates may be much higher when this rollover event happens!

As we all know, short term interest rates have been steadily rising for a few years now, and the Fed says they're going to keep tightening. So I'd like to be able to model when all this corporate debt is due. My hypothesis is that, if LOTS of corporate debt suddenly needs to be rolled over, you're going to see interest rates spike, especially on the short end of duration. You're going to see the yield curve invert further as this mountain of corporate debt comes due and needs to be rolled over. 

You're going to see stock buybacks grind to a halt as corporations scramble to figure out how to handle the debt that is rolling over at the wrong time.

CryptoCurrency,FED - Rising Interest rates vs. Cryptocurrency Market,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

i expect that the FED will take a decision for rising interest rates in 2 weeks.

What do you think will be the impact on the cryptocurrency market?

&amp;#x200B;

As long as i understand the topic, money would flow out of the emerging markets, it would build pressure on company debts, lead to credit defaults and could lead to liquidity shortages. I´m pessimistic about cryptos in this case, because people would need cash.

personalfinance,Some help with money market accounts,"My father passed away back in March, and my brothers and I received the payout from his life insurance policy. We split it evenly, with each of us receiving $25,000. I dont want to touch this money unless I absolutely have to. I just want to allow it accrue interest while I add to it over time. The research I've done has made me think that a Money market account (not an uninsured Money Market Fund) is probably the best option for me, since they tend to yield higher interest. My biggest question is this: how do I know which bank to go with?
I've read a lot of online banks can offer much better interest rates, but is that as safe an option as a brick-and-mortar bank or credit union in my own town? Are the rates ever fixed? I dont want to tie my money up in an account that promises a high-interest rate at first only to knock it down to a much lower one later on. I know to go with an FDIC-insured account, but I'm really at a loss as to  how to tell the quality of the account I'm opening. Is a Money market checking account a good choice?

personalfinance,401k or student loan and debts,"Recently I've come to a realization that I'm not managing my money well. I'm 4 years out of college and in a total debt of about $66k.  I didn't come from a family with a lot of money, and my parents really never taught me the importance of saving money and how to manage money. They have always been in debt, and I feel like I'm following their footsteps, which I don't want to do.

This is an overview of my current debts

* $30k in student loans with interest rates that vary from 3.86% - 6.8%. Minimum payments are $490, and i've basically just been making minimum payments.
* $8k loan for my motorcycle with a 5.9% APR, minimum payments of $190
* $9.5k for my car with a 3.5% interest rate, minimum payments of $225. Which I refinanced through the bank to get some money to pay for credit card debts. The car is probably worth 5k now.
* $19k in credit card debts. I've been trying to move the cc debts around with 0% APR for 1 year with balance transfers that have a 3% fee. I have about 4 accounts with \~$4k balance on each. So each time I move my balance, I pay \~$140 fee. But that gives me about another year without getting hit with the \~20% APR interest. Each account have minimum payments of \~$100.

I live in a house with roommates and my minimum monthly expenses are $500 rent, $45 cable/internet, $\~70-90 utilities.

I'm currently making $80k/year, and maxing out my 401k. After taxes, med insurance, and 401k contribution, I'm getting about $4.4k/month.

1. Should I stop 401k contributions and focus on paying off debts? The contributions are taking \~$500/month pre-tax, but company will match $.50 to for every $1 up to 8% of my salary, so I'd be missing out on some free money.
2. What's the best approach to get rid of my CC debts? Consolidation? Just keep doing the balance transfers?
3. There was a PLR for 401k matches based on student loan payments. When will that take into effect?

And I know I have a spending problem, I should probably have lived at my parents house out of college to pay off my debts first. Asking for any advice that anyone may have.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Thanks for all the tips. After looking at everyone's answers

1. I know I need to budget and stick to that budget. I haven't really been tracking my spendings and i'm getting a better picture of where my money is going. So far it looks like after meeting minimum payments + living costs (without food), I have \~$2.3k/month in surplus. 
2. Sell the bike
3. Don't stop 401k contributions
4. Live frugally till I can get rid of most of my debts.
5. I was wrong saying that I was maxing out my 401k, I'm only contributing enough to max my company's match",finance
investing,When do you think investors will start turning toward long term bonds?,"I imagine there would be a rush in the event of a financial crisis. But is there some typical time when investors start the slow process of putting aside equities for safer bonds and yields. Even as I say this I see the stockbroker shills turning to more risky junk bonds as 'safer' than stocks. Yesterday there was an article with the wise words of Michael Milken on basic income. Is it forgotten what he did? 

It seems there's a progression that happens when interest rates start to change. But where are we on that progression and what type of events and metrics might push it forward?",finance
personalfinance,I'm thinking of stopping 401k contributions for real estate investments,"I'm thinking of heavily investing in real estate over the next couple of years to build equity and semi-passive cash flow through rental properties. I'd like to buy a house a year for the next 3 years. I'm considering sacrificing my 401k contributions so I can build up my savings. I did some preliminary math (explained below) and I was hoping I could get comments about my idea. 

One of the largest reasons I'm thinking of not contributing is the past two jobs I've been at I've never hit the vesting schedule and its crushing watching 15k of ""my"" money disappear in the blink of an eye. There's a fairly good chance I'm not going to hit the 100% vesting schedule for this job either because I tend to move around, so I feel I can find a better use for this money then let it sit in a target date fund. 

&amp;#x200B;

$98,966 *(base salary)* \- $6,000 *(6% 401k contributions)* = $93,024 *(gross taxable income)*

$93,024 - $91,901 *(low boundary of 33% tax bracket)*  = $1,123 \* .33 = $370.59 *(federal taxes paid @ 33%)*

$98,966 - $91,901 = $2,331 *(federal taxes paid without 401k deductions)*

\-------------------------

$2,331 - $370 = $1,961 *(tax savings (now) by contributing to 401k)*

$6,000 - $1,961 = $4,038 *(annual increase in cash flow w/o 401k contributions)*

&amp;#x200B;

This extra cash flow will push me to roughly 45k in net cash flow after all other investments, taxes, living expenses, food/going out expenses. If I make \~400/month in cash flow from the first property (which I'm planning on purchasing soon), it will put me closeish to 60k/year which is enough for a 20% down payment on a 300k, multi-unit home.

personalfinance,"Terrible Math from a ""Professional"" Advisor?","Is there any way that this article isn't as terrible as I think it is?  If it's as incorrect as I figure, it should almost be illegal to be so misleading about such an important subject.

[http://amp.kiplinger.com/article/real-estate/T025-C032-S014-making-extra-mortgage-payments-not-so-fast.html](http://amp.kiplinger.com/article/real-estate/T025-C032-S014-making-extra-mortgage-payments-not-so-fast.html)

&amp;#x200B;

In his point #1, the author reinforces the classic misunderstanding that making an extra payment does absolutely nothing more than take one payment off the end.  Maybe someone with better knowledge can correct me if I'm wrong, but not having given an actual principal or interest rate, the best I can figure from his total payment and breakdown of principal and interest is that this hypothetical loan is somewhere in the neighborhood of $143,500@ 5.75%.  Even then, his hypothetical final payment is not what he says, but it's the only combination I could find that worked out to his initial breakdown.  His extreme example only goes to completely destroy his argument if you do actually do the math, since if you were to make extra $2000 payment in the first month of that loan, it would save you almost $9000 over the life of the loan - and that's still not bad for a return on investment.

&amp;#x200B;

He then magically figures out mortgages in his point #2, and is correct that paying the extra every time would cut off almost two thirds of the loan (completely contradicting his first point), but then goes on to say that just saving your money at the very same interest rate (one that would be very difficult to find today) would actually work to your advantage.  He does so by assuming that after you pay off your mortgage 11 years in, your either give away or burn the $4000/month that you're no longer putting toward your mortgage.  If you saved whatever sum of money you weren't putting toward your mortgage for the full 30 years - at the same interest rate, you'd at least come out even, if not ahead simply due to fractional rounding working to your advantage instead of disadvantage in the mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

Point #3, I don't know enough about inflation to comment on - I'm guessing he's wrong and plainly leaving something out.  (my gut is that having money sitting around would also be hurt by inflation).

&amp;#x200B;

Point #4, he completely ignores that the person who bought their house with a mortgage paid interest (though he doesn't give a rate) that entire first year (not to mention closing costs, loan fees, etc), so quite clearly, the person who paid cash would still have made more in that exact scenario.  I'm not sure why he even brings the seller into it, as the seller gets the same amount in either scenario (is he assuming that the seller only gets money as you make payments??)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm not trying to say that it's always better to pay down your mortgage than to do other things - the math of arbitrage is to put your money where the rate is best - pay down your highest rate first and, generally speaking, making money at a higher rate is better than losing it at a lower rate.  Obviously, plenty of exceptions (like wanting to have some cash for potential expenses, etc, etc) apply - but all of the actual reasoning and math in this article is still, as far as I can tell, completely wrong.  Am I missing something here, or is the article as bad as I think?  Especially considering comments on the article are disabled (and I'm guessing the author either knows he's wrong and doesn't care, or would assume he's right and not listen to anyone that would correct him, making contacting him likely pointless), how do the sane/moral people in the personal finance community fight back against supposedly professional advisers spreading fallacies like the ones in this article?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: My math on figuring out the actual principal/rate on his example loan in #1 was wrong - corrected.

personalfinance,A little insight into if refinancing our house is worth it? I need a ‘I’m not trying to sell this to you’ approach.,"Hello all! I’m currently debating refinancing our mortgage to shorten the length of the loan, remove PMI and to take advantage of the lower interest rates. Currently, we have a home valued at well over 210k and rising...our stats:

My husband and I are in our early EARLY 30s, one kid, solid careers etc...

Currently owe 109,900 at a 4.6% interest rate/30 year fixed conv. Loan, we have PMI that’s roughly $78 of our mortgage payment. The mortgage is JUST almost 5 years old...We aren’t sure if PMI can be removed with just an appraisal showing that our renovations/area have increased our homes value etc. 

We could refinance for the same balance amount at roughly 4.1% for a 15yr/ fixed rate at no change to our actual mortgage payment (per calculators I’ve tinkered with) 

We hav no other outstanding debt (knocks on wood) but we plan accordingly and have savings etc. is it worth it to pay the cost to refinance or just pay more monthly/annually towards our principle? Or is this just personal preference? Just need some honest advice/knowledge on refinancing etc.",finance
personalfinance,Purchasing permanent placed double wide trailer,"Okay PF, first time posting in here, I've been lurking in your budget wiki for quite a while now, and I think this subreddit does some truly helpful work. Work that changes peoples whole lives and gives them confidence and freedom when it comes to their personal finances. With that in mind I've come to you all for help with my next step, buying a home

So, to start off, let me list out some things for you:

* 23 years old male
* 0 dependent single filing, will be planning to live with my girlfriend throughout this
* Midwest, Nebraska to be specific
* My Yearly income, around 31K before tax, 27K after
 
Okay, so my **current situation** is that I'm working at an industrial production plant full time, renting out the basement of my parents house, and my girlfriend lives with me. I have a 2000 GMC sierra and she has a 2010 Dodge avenger, both fully owned by us. The avenger is less than 100K miles and runs fine. The truck is at 181K and is starting to show signs of its age, but is still reliable and should stay reliable for another 2-3 years.

I work operations at an industrial plant and take classes part time at a local community college for engineering, she is working retail (9.50/hr) while getting CNA classes done. I've been looking for houses for about two years, with it becoming serious about six months ago.

My **end game goal** is to have land. Something around 4 acres, with a decent off-grid 200amp house and an above decent garage/work building. My **current goal** is a house, 1 car garage, heat/ac of some kind, 100amp or more service, and room for my kind of lifestyle. My lifestyle is a very midwest style. I like to tinker, I do my own maintenance, I will leave saw horses in the yard over the weekend, I will use loud equipment, and I like my space. This does not mean I won't live in an apartment and do these things where I can, but that would be extremely unwanted.

So, **the land**. It is one narrow lot, 1.5 acres, split into two fenced areas. There is a very interesting building in the back lot, about 25'X10', along with a few that are not worth keeping upright. It is wire fence with wood post, and goes around the entire back lot and half of the front lot. The back lot is just dirt and grass, and the front is the same with a few more trees to keep sound down from the highway. It has a well on site, with a pump room in the garage, septic in the back lot. 100amp or more service. **It is located in a flood plain.**

Now, **the house**. It is a 3 bed, 2 bath, 1400 square foot home built in 1974, a 2 car garage, and a connector building/hallway in between. The garage is very decent, two bay doors, with room to pull in two cars on each side. It has a small pump room for well water in the back. The connector building has washer/dryer hookups, water heater, and is fully roofed/insulated/it's an addition from the house to the garage, it's just narrow. The house itself has an a/c unit, uses propane for heating, very large front deck with newerish roof, and... It's a permanent set double wide trailer. It was a foreclosure, I spoke with the neighbor and she said the owner moved to Arizona, it has been vacant from Oct. 2017 (winterized by lending company at the time after found vacant) The house is listed for $37,000.

**Math and logic**

I see this as a great opportunity for someone like me. Using YNAB and PFs advice, I've got my current expenses budgeted and have room for another 650/month, which is what I would expect the mortgage payment, insurance (home, flood, and less than 20% down payment so mortgage as well), and other monthly costs to be. 

My logic for this kind of house (a cheap one that won't sell for anything real, ever.) is that, in my head, if the TOTAL cost of renting an apartment for 5 years in town is more than the TOTAL cost of this house for 5 years, buying the house is the better option in the scope of overall cash cost. 

Another reason I like this idea is that a 40K house on 1.5 acres is still small enough that if I do have an upset (scenario I owe 40K~ in debt) it is not the end of the world and can be paid down relatively fast. I am not planning for failure, but I feel it is important to feel security in the knowledge that this would not be a game ending decision if it went south. 

I have no problem with the stigma attached to manufactured homes, as I've never cared much what other people think about me, and to me, a house is a house as long as it's sealed and livable it counts.

**Questions and advice**

1. Am I right in thinking that, as long as total cost is less, it is usually a better option financially to purchase a house than to rent for the same price over 5 years?


2. Is there a good comparison of well water/septic vs city water/sewage? (info graphic or in depth article of some sort)

3. I do not know much about manufactured homes and am not sure how different upkeep is on them. Is there a guide/article about maintenance and information specific to manufactured homes?

4. As a first time home buyer, with it being such a unique one at that, I'm sure there are many things I need to look at and identify. I'm not sure how old 1974 is for a manufactured home. I do not know much about propane/well/septic and the costs associated vs. NG/city/sewage. I'm unsure of what restrictions there are maintenance and upgrade wise due to it being a manufactured home. Any information, anecdotal or article, would be helpful.

personalfinance,Best Way to “Refinance” Credit Card Debt,"I have a Capital One MasterCard with a $4500 limit. I am 28 and make around $55k per year and that is my only credit card. I also have a great deal of student debt which is where a good amount of my monthly income goes.

Anyways, due to switching jobs and changing tax brackets in 2016, I owed the IRS $4,000 which I paid off from April 2017 until January of 2018. I paid it off successfully, but it required me to live largely off my credit card which ran up the balance. Now, I am able to pay off around $2200 per month on my credit card, but I have watched my balance snowball from around $2800 when I started trying to eliminate that debt in January to $3600 this month. This month, too, I have $500 committed to a friend’s wedding and can only pay $1700 towards that $3600.

I feel like it is silly to try and pay this debt off while being charged credit card interest rates. However, what is my best option to “refinance?” My credit score is fairly high. I have received offers from other banks to let me transfer the balance onto another card and pay no interest for 12 months. Is that a good option? Would it be better to get a personal loan and pay back a bank over the next year at a lower interest rate? Is there another option I am not thinking of?

I'm planning on graduating Spring 2020. I'll have $11,000 of student loan debt (federal unsubsidized) - most of it from my first attempt at college when I was 18.

Questions: When I was 18 I had a nice internship that netted me $10,000, but events in my life caused be to withdraw basically all of it a few months later. This was 2015. In Spring of 2016 I got a notice from my bank (BoA) saying they are closing my account (which had &lt;$200 at the time and I hadn't made a deposit or withdrawal in several months after the big withdrawal). This past month I opened up a TD Ameritrade account and put $100 in it at the time of account creation, and bought 2 stocks. 2 weeks later (last week), I received a notice that they are closing my account.  Disclosure, I am a convicted felon, but not for anything financial related. Could that play a role into the BoA and TDA account closures?

financialindependence,Excel Budget and FIRE Tracker File,"I am posting this excel file for two reasons. First, I think it may be helpful for some people. They may come to certain conclusions based on the data or simply see a formula/concept/chart that they would like to use in their own Excel file. It is possible that someone could delete all the data and input their own. But unless they happen to have the same accounts as my wife and me, it is likely that they’ll need to make quite a few modifications. Second, I am hoping for some feedback/advice on just about anything. It could be improving the Excel file or giving me actual financial advice. I would not be surprised if there are people out there who have a lot more info/tools than this. I just rarely see anyone sharing Excel files.  I have future plans to write some VBA code to get my transactions from Mint to this Excel file. But for now a simple copy-paste from the Mint csv file isn’t the end of the world once a month. So here is a basic breakdown of the tabs within this Excel file, what they do and how they are operated. 

&amp;#x200B;

[OneDrive Link for Downloading](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AuJCXOqoMoUzafPbIbBoY3_h_Vk)

&amp;#x200B;

**Transactions:**

This sheet serves as a place to hold data for all my income and expenditures. Every month I export all my transaction from Mint for the previous month. This includes spending and income. My wife and I both have all of our accounts synced to this Mint account. So most everything we need is available from that export file. I have to make some minor edits before copying the data over to this Excel file. Those include small things like deleting old data not from this month, deleting items I don’t personally consider ‘transactions’ (interest, reinvested dividends, etc.) and pulling down a formula to describe whether the transaction is “Income” or “Expenditure”. The remainder of the green colored tabs retrieve data from this sheet. I have erased the ‘Description’ and ‘Original Description’ data as there was some more personal information in there.

**Monthly Categorized:**

This sheet automatically updates based on the data that is placed on the ‘Transactions’ sheet. It tallies up the monthly totals based on their category. I do not have to rewrite the formulas every month because they are already written for every month until 2042 (there are simply hidden rows that need to be made visible every month). This sheet also calculates the 1 Year Average, 1 Year Totals, and 1 Year Percentage of Expenses for each of the categories that I use. (Note: I currently only have 11 months of data, so if you want to steal these formulas, just change “-11” to “-12” within cells D308:T309). There are also some graphs of the data for those who are more visual thinkers. 

The big take away for me with this sheet was how much we spend on our Home (46%). Although this number will never go completely to zero (city taxes, repairs, insurance, yard work/improvements), it made me aware that I may need to seriously re-analyze my planned retirement expenses. Once the mortgage is paid off, our expense will drop considerably. Not to mention that the mortgage will not be affected by inflation as my other spending habits will. Another takeoff for me is regarding travel. I am a firm believer in enjoying your present life even though I have monetary goals for the future. Therefore, I am not ashamed to say that we have spent over 13% of our expenditures (not income) on travel. This year it has been a mix of both full trips and some short weekend getaways. 

**Monthly Totals:**

This sheet pulls data off of the ‘Transactions’ tab and provides monthly totals for both ‘Expenditures’ and ‘Income’. Again, nothing needs to be entered in here because the formulas are already set up for many years to come. This sheet also shows the yearly totals for ‘Income’ and ‘Expenditures’. I plan to use this data as I get closer to retirement to better understand my expenses from a bird’s eye view. I feel it will help me determine a good starting point for anticipated future expenditures before making adjustments on items such as increasing health insurance, decreasing mortgage, etc.

**Savings Rate:**

This sheet is used to calculate my Savings Rate for the year. All of the ‘Income’ and ‘Expenditures’ are grabbed from the ‘Monthly Totals’ sheet. Again no future modifications needed to the future formulas. Just ensure that you are using the correct dates for your transaction, as this is how it finds them. So in order to calculate the correct savings rate, I only need to enter in our 401k/ESOP/403b/457 contributions at the end of the year. In my case, I don’t get ESOP numbers until the following summer so it is rare that I have an ‘up to date’ idea of what this percentage is. But I don’t consider Savings Rate to be a particularly informative statistic. 

**Net Worth:**

This sheet is very similar to the ‘Transactions’ sheet (in that it serves as data for other sheets) except that it is data for all of my (meaningful) assets. Every month I update the balance of several accounts (checking, savings, 401k, brokerage, etc) with their current balance. Our only current debt is our home mortgage. The mortgage debt is updated every month from a mortgage amortization chart on another tab that I will talk about later. I don’t particularly pay attention to total net worth but I do keep an eye on total cash and investments. Projected home value is just my opinion, so that is another reason to not heavily consider net worth as super meaningful. 

**Asset Allocation:**

This tab was created to help me visualize where our money was located. These charts help me visualize how much of my money is readily available vs. how much we will have to wait for/use 401k rollovers. I chose to create these views in order to determine if we would have enough personal investments and Roth contributions to get through the required 5 years of a 401k rollover before the funds are available penalty free. These charts also help my see which pieces of my money will be taxed vs. which have already paid income taxes. I plan to use that information right before retirement to better understand how much taxes we will pay in retirement. Although I wish we had more money in tax deferred accounts, these charts helped me understand that we will likely be able to pay low tax amounts in retirement by simultaneously using already taxed accounts with our 401k/403b. Even if spending $60k-80k/year, I still think we would manage to get ourselves into a relatively lower tax bracket. 

This sheet has personally helped me realize how we had previously not been doing a great job at utilizing tax deferred accounts. The data is slightly skewed as we are both young and also were given some money as children in brokerage accounts. We are now focusing more on our 401k/403b’s. Up until reading up more on this subreddit, we were hesitant to put but so much in retirement accounts. Next year we will try to max out some 401k/403b accounts and switch to traditional IRA (as I feel we will be in a low tax bracket during retirement even with high spending due to the flexibility of our already large percentage wise brokerage and Roth IRA). 

**Actual Growth:**

This tab reads the most current data off of the ‘Net Worth’ tab. The long term intention of this sheet is to look at growth/returns of various accounts. As I currently only have 5 months of growth data, I don’t find this tab particularly useful yet. In the future, I plan to add more graphs to help me understand if one account is growing slower/faster than the others. 

**Future Projections:**

This tab is intended to forecast potential future growth based on your current assets (grabbed from the most recent line within the ‘Net Worth’ tab) and anticipated future contributions, growth rates and interest rates. You can alter all the yellow cells at the top of the spreadsheet in order to come up with different example future data. I provide a spot to state planned retirement expenses per year and the safe withdrawal rate that you are comfortable with. The graph helps visualize in what year you may be FI. There is even a column on the right side that helps you see what percentage FI you are (aka what percentage you (will) have of your total needed safe withdrawal balance.

I am not even sure that I will end up retiring early (!). I don’t hate my job right now. I might even say that it is fun at times and occasionally energizes me by giving me motivation. It is going to take quite a bit of freedom in terms of travel and leisurely spending in order to convince me to move away from work. Therefore, I have set our future expenditures much higher than our current expenditures. I also plan to have to pay for college expenses for two (still unconceived) children.

**Mortgage Amortization:**

The final sheet is to calculate our mortgage debt balance. This sheet was a copy-pasta from a file my boss gave me when we were ‘home shopping’. I have tweaked some things to show actual interest/total payments vs. anticipated interest/total payments based on additional planned payments per month. I have also added the ability to see how many mortgage payments and the remaining mortgage balance at your retirement age. 

Although I use this sheet to help calculate net worth, the most important tool for me is to understand how long/how much I will be paying my mortgage during retirement. Also, there appears to be some rounding issues between these formulas and my actual mortgage. I pay $50/month extra (I view it kind of like a bond in that it is a less risky return, guaranteed 3.875% savings as long as I hold the mortgage). So I occasionally have to change those values to $49.99 to get them to match my statements.

**Random Notes:**

\-I have not done any calculations to plan for social security. Someone using these tools that is older may have a higher confidence that it will still be around during their retirement. I believe that it will be but I prefer to plan as though it will not.

\-I have provided any tools to alter contributions in the future. In other words, if you plan to ramp down savings for 18 years while you have a child and then ramp back up contributions to 401k, IRA, etc. This pretty much assumes that I will save a consistent amount over the next 15-30 years. This is probably unlikely in reality but my overall goal is to make a general forecast and more importantly track and better understand ‘where I am now’ over time.

\-I have not provided a tool for those who plan to have variable spending in retirement. If you plan to spend more or less the first X years of your retirement this is unfortunately not set up well for you. On that note, I have not set up ANY tools to look at your actual withdrawals from these accounts during retirement. I would say that I plan to do it when I get closer to retirement but I am not even sure we will be using excel at that point. My computer and my prescription glasses might be the same thing…it is just that far out still.

**Conclusions:**

I would appreciate any feedback on this Excel file. Maybe you notice an incorrect formula or maybe you simply disagree with my methodology. I am always looking to improve this file and it is honestly still pretty “young” at this stage. I would also appreciate any advice/opinions on the actual financial data, as I am still learning.

Also, I would recommend that more people analyze their expenditures and investments in more detail. Simply creating this sheet and keeping it up to date has been eye opening in terms of understanding what I spend money on and how quickly/slowly I am getting to FI. Even more so than simply having a Mint account (which I have had for several years). I would guess many “failed” FIRE attempts are due to misunderstanding one’s expenditures and investments. Spending some time looking at and entering the data is very helpful.",finance

personalfinance,"401(k) contribution, emergency fund, and student loans","Tl;dr: Should I reduce my 401k contribution while I increase my emergency fund and pay down my low-interest debt?

I have never been very good financially. I have recently gone through a divorce and ended up with $15,000+ in credit card debt. I was living worse than paycheck-to-paycheck, I was putting everything on credit cards, and then paying them off the next month, while still carrying a balance on my other cards. Had I had an interruption in income, I would have been totally screwed and would have been paying a significant amount of extra interest. After about a year of working on my financial situation, I paid all my credit cards (completely) and started getting building a checking account buffer. I’m finally there and have no credit card debt and a one month buffer in my checking account. Now I’m in the process of working on my next financial steps, including an emergency fund and paying off other low-interest debt. I have $37,000 in student loan debt, with a weighted interest rate of 4.1%. I also have an auto loan with a balance of ~$7,800 at 4.75%. I have never cooked, so I have been eating out every meal. I’ve been working to change that by using HelloFresh, but even that is expense since I’m a single guy. My income is significant (base salary is $115,000), but I barely “bring home” more than half. My normal net pay is ~$5,000.00 a month. My monthly expenses break down as:

Rent: $1,608  
Utilities: $125  
Internet: $70  
Auto Loan: $399  
Television: $110 (I am planning to kind of cut the cord to reduce this to $50 or less a month)  
Cell Phone: $0 (work pays for my cell phone)  
Gym: $150  
Student Loans: $403  
Food: $750 (groceries and eating out are included)  
Side Business Expenses: $50  
Auto Insurance: $130  
Gas: $150  
Pet Expenses: $150  
  
My annual expenses are:  
Auto Maintenance, Taxes, Registration: $1000  
Side Business Expenses: $475  
Renter’s Insurance: $180  

I’ve been working to really solidify my budget using YNAB, but I’m not sure I’m in love with it yet…so recommendations there would also be appreciated.

You may ask how is it possible to only bring home ~$65,000 a year from a job that pays almost twice that. Well, there are two reasons: one, I have a very high retirement contribution (12% employee/3% employer match) and two, I have a huge FSA contribution ($200/paycheck) because I started this job mid-year. This pays for both my braces and mental health care that is rather expensive. Next year, I will have a significantly smaller FSA contribution ($70/paycheck) as I will have barely anything left on my braces. 

I think that a safe emergency fund would be $18,000. My plan currently is to put $500/month into my Ally savings account automatically each month, which would get me there after 3 years of no additional contributions. Anything I have left over at the end of the month also gets transferred to the savings account. Each quarter I get paid a bonus based on my quota at work (but I don't have much control over whether I hit my number or not), and I also budget without accounting for my “third paycheck” that happens twice a year. My plan is to send both of those straight to my savings account as well as any income I make from my small side business. 

I think my question really comes down to whether I should reduce my 401k contribution while I increase my emergency fund and pay down my low-interest debt. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",finance

My wife and I bought a condo in 2007 a bit before the market crash. While we were content living in a two bedroom condo when we had 1 kid we had a second that is the opposite gender. Fast forward a couple of years and had to make a decision: move in with my folks for basically no rent (two family over under setup, basically just need to pay for the increase in utilities, cell phones, food, gas and tax on vehicles, etc) in a town with a much better school system.


Important to note that, even with health insurance, we have had many significant events and non-covered treatments that led to us not having the extra money to throw at the mortgage or save much.


The 3 year plan is to bank as much cash as possible and buy into a 3 or 4 bedroom and have as close to a payment as we currently have.

We have had the condo on the market for 4 months with only 3 showings. We have dropped the price to the point where we are basically covering closing expenses and will walk away with nothing. Is it better to refinance for another set of years for what we have left and rent it or is it better to continue to try and sell?

Mortgage: $1480

gaming,IDEA: The Stars Like Dust - the ultimate last word of 4x galactic gaming?,"***This  is just a rough sketch, some very rudimentary ideas thrown on  paper...er, a webpage...this is by no means a complete game idea, just a  bunch of random thoughts thrown out there. If people have other ideas  or think this is good stuff, I'll make a more serious game document. At  this point I don't even know if people would be interested in a game of  this complexity or not. I've always dreamed of making ""the ultimate""  galactic strategy game...something like aurora 4x or distant stars but  with even more meat on the bones. While I am a programmer, I don't have the kind of know-how to even get a bare-bones model of this working...but I would be interested to know if people find this idea interesting...perhaps with some more work I could get a team together that could get a basic model of this going...***

The  game will be a real-time, pausable strategy game. It will take place in  a randomized galaxy that can be customized according to a few  parameters. There will be a certain number of races in any given game,  each with their own unique gameplay style.

The Player

The  player will play the role of a galactic statesman, guiding his faction  from humble pre-warpdrive era to galactic empire-hood. The player will  have some control of the economy, can direct colonization, can govern  planets or assign planetary governors, can direct fleets or appoint  admirals, can conduct espionage, can direct construction of planetary  infrastructure, space-stations, star-ships, and even  super-weapons...players will also direct diplomacy, signing treaties and  other such actions.

The player will be  able to design star-ships and star-bases, using many different  components, or they can buy designs from private companies. Everything  will be customizable...even the components themselves. The player can  design engines or laser emplacements if they choose (or buy specialized  ones from private companies) the only limiting factor is technological  levels, weight, and cost.

Super-weapons  will play a role in the game...they are massive and can be  customized...ultimately the player can even destroy entire star systems,  though they will suffer a massive diplomatic penalty for doing so.

There  will be several different resources in game, each of which are required  for building and maintaining certain components. Some areas of the  galaxy will be more rich than others, creating asymmetric game-play and  encouraging economic warfare

DIPLOMACY:  
The  player can sign mutual defense treaties, line-of-sight sharing  treaties, formal alliances, and federation treaties (federation treaties  are alliances but between multiple empires, not just one). They can  alternately close borders, declare war, and embargo other empires.

ECONOMIC MODEL:

As  time goes by, each empire will start to have certain private companies  arise, there will be mainly three types of industry: mining, trade, and  military. These industries will arise without the player's direct  control, thus simulating actual economic growth. However the player can  interact with the companies by subsidizing or leveling tariffs, building  infrastructure for them or conversely seizing assets, and some  government types will even allow the player to nationalize a industry  entirely, though doing so will be risky as it could cause other  industries to move away from one's empire.  The strength of each company  will be determined from the relative strength of the player's empire,  population, low company tax rates, and certain policies.

Mining  Companies – almost focus solely on mining planets and asteroids, can be  nationalized, player can subsidize or level tariffs, can be granted  mining charters to build mining colonies, which are semi-independent  extensions of the host empire the mining company comes from, which  cannot be controlled by the player but have increased tax revenue

Trading  companies – focus on trading with other planets within one's empire,  and can trade outside the empire with other races if certain policies  (like free-trade) are passed can be nationalized, player can subsidize  or level tarrifs

Military Companies - can  be nationalized, player can subsidize or level tariffs, military  companies create designs and can be assigned research tasks for certain  military related tech, the player can buy designs or order a certain  number of ships from the military company…

Different economic policies:

Free  trade – allows trading companies to trade with all  empires, you make  less money off of taxes and you can't level tariffs on the trade  companies, but you get a diplomatic realtions bost with the other  empires...they get a small boost to their income depending on your  economic power...

Restricted trade – same  as free trade but you can select which empires you want the companies  to trade with...this helps if you are conducting economic warfare with  another empire

Allow Mining Colonies –  allows the construction of semi-indepedent mining colonies that you  cannot control of directly tax, but they extend your borders just like a  normal colony and give a boost to the resrouce output of the mining  stations in the system

Don't Allow Mining Colonies – duh

Allow  private armies – allows all companies to build private armies, which  function to protect them from pirate and raider attacks, this can be  dangerous however, as if you anger or attempt to nationalize a industry  and their army is strong enough, they may go to war with you

Dis-allow  private armies – no private armies are allowed...however you must  protect the company from private attacks...if you don't then they may  decide to build a private army anyway\*

I made the mistake of not reporting my student loans as a thing I pay which might've helped soften the blow but I think its ridiculous that I'm paying this much in taxes that its basically like the government has taken my entire bonuses and then an extra $500. Living is affordable but still hard from time to time for what I make so I was just wondering if I've done anything wrong, should've reported something differently or what the case may be here.

personalfinance,"Career planning for a 10-year horizon: Navigating the switch between public/private sector, considering PSLF student loan implications","When is the right time to switch from public sector to private sector (and potentially back again)? 

How should I balance a potential salary increase (in the private sector) with the benefits of a public-service loan forgiveness program (in the public sector)? 

What other financial considerations am I overlooking? 

**Basic Facts:**

I am 31 years old, currently employed in the public sector, where I have worked for 3.5 years.

I love my current field (urban planning and design) and consider this career track a calling. It is not uncommon to jump between the public and private sectors of this field throughout the span of a career in this industry.

I currently make **$62K** per year, and expect to see an annual increase of approximately 3.5% for as long as I remain in this role.

I am considering whether/when I may want to jump into the private sector. 

I could reasonably expect to earn approximately **$90K** per year in the private sector, based on my qualifications.

However, if I switch to the private sector, I would no longer benefit from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.

I have **$260K** in student debt. 

Under PSLF, I pay **$230** per month, based on my current salary of **$62K**. At the current rate, I will have paid back approximately **$40K** after 10 years, and the remaining balance at that time will be forgiven tax-free. 

If I were to transfer to the private sector, my student loan payment would increase to **$2800** per month. I would be paying back a total of **$340K** over 10 years. 

Based on this difference in monthly loan payments alone, my break-even salary in the private sector would need to be **$93K**, just to have the same “take home” pay I do now at **$62K** in the public sector. This assumes the same contributions toward retirement, savings, investments, etc. as I am making now.

An interesting wrinkle is that the PSLF program does not require you to make 120 CONSECUTIVE payments--just 120 total. So I could, for example, stay in my current role for another 1.5 years and then, after having made 60 qualifying payments over 5 years, switch to the private sector. During my time in the private sector, I would need to make standard payments ($2800/month), which would not count toward the 120 required under PSLF. After a number of years, I could then come back to the public sector, make another 60 payments over 5 years, and the remaining balance at the time would be forgiven.

I THINK my best option is to jump into the private sector for a few years, then get back into the public sector (at an ultimately higher salary, re-negotiated from my private sector position). At the current rate, I don’t see any reasonable opportunities for a vertical promotion or a raise beyond an annual 3-5% if I just stay in my current role. However, considering the value of having the balance of my loans forgiven, I think it would be best for me to plan on eventually finishing at least 10 years of service in the public sector. 

Also a consideration: I would be eligible for full retirement at the age of 57 (after 30 years of service) under the City's retirement program. My employer's contributions to my 401K (6% annually) vest after 5 years of service (I am currently at 3.5 years).

I feel I have found my dream job, and would love to keep doing what I’m doing for the entirety of my career. Whether I work in the public or private sector, I intend on staying in the same field. However, I also want to do the financially prudent thing, and I am hoping this community can help me identify the best moves for somebody in my situation.

More detailed information below, in case anyone is interested.

**Public vs. Private:**

I currently work as a mid-level supervisor in City Planning. Might not sound sexy to you, but I am deeply fascinated and passionate about the field of urban planning &amp; design. My job is 50% work and 50% hobby--I consider myself very lucky to have found a career I consider a calling. While I value personal fulfillment, public service, and work-life balance over raw income, I want to be sure I am making financially responsible decisions and not selling myself short.

I think work in both the public sector and private sector of this field could be interesting and fulfilling, but there are obvious pros and cons to each. Public sector jobs are generally much more flexible, and I would qualify for full retirement at age 57 (after 30 years of service with the City). Private sector jobs pay better, but require a lot more travel and longer hours. Both public &amp; private sector jobs could offer great opportunities for growth and networking in the field--something that is important to me, as I have ambitions of becoming well-renowned in the field over the course of my career.

**More details on my job history:**

I have worked with the City for **3.5** years, with no previous full-time professional employment. I was hired in an entry-level position at a salary of **$42K**, which had increased to **$45K** after 2 years (approx. **3.5%** annually).

After **2.5** years, I took a significant promotion (from entry level position to mid-level supervisor). My salary increased from **$45K** to **$62K**\--a significant raise, almost **40%**. I will be receiving our annual merit-based raise in October, which I expect to be approximately **3.5%** (on pace with previous years). I do not expect to have another promotional opportunity like this anytime soon.

While I have taken on many additional duties and responsibilities with the promotion, the new position did not change my overall situation substantially, other than the salary increase and the “value” of the experience I am gaining in this new role. I still enjoy the same flexible schedule, work the same number of hours per week, and still love my job. 

I have been very successful in my new role, but there is a ceiling on where I can go from here. Essentially, the only viable opportunity for vertical transfer available to me (and thus the only opportunity for a salary increase beyond a standard 3-5% annual adjustment) would require my direct supervisor to vacate her position and for me to fill that role. I do not expect this to happen anytime soon.

I am currently happy with the work that I am doing and I am content with my role. There are 12 employees within the City organization who share my “job classification” (equivalent positions). Relative to these others, I am among the lowest paid. As of 2016--the latest year for which I have access to salary data--the minimum salary for this position was $59.5K, median $73K, max $88K. Most people in this position have at least 8-10 years of professional experience. HR cited my relative lack of experience as the limiting factor in their salary offer (which I negotiated up to $62K, from an initial offer of $53K). 

At the age of 31 (with just 3.5 years work experience), I am the youngest person working for the City in my job classification by at least 5 years. However, looking forward to an annual raise of approximately 3.5%, 5 years from now I will be making what was the median salary in 2016. That does not seem acceptable to me.

I currently intend to stay in this role for at least another 1.5 years (which would give me 5 years of total employment with the city) and then re-evaluate my options. At that point, I feel I will have wrapped up a number of major projects that I want to get done, and will have gained an ample amount of experience so that I could feel confident re-entering the job market and competing for a good job in the private sector.

Beyond limited work experience, my resume is very good and I believe I will be competitive in the job market. Over the past few years, my work has received numerous awards from local and regional professional associations in the field, and I have been building a strong reputation and professional network. I have a M.A. in my field from the #1 school in the nation, as well as a J.D. (although I do not practice as an attorney, the general legal background &amp; training is seen as highly desirable and marketable in my field, since we deal often with regulations and ordinances).

**Student Debt Details:**

With 9 years of higher education, I have accumulated a substantial student loan debt (all consolidated Federal Direct student loans). My current outstanding balance is $260K. 

A significant perk of working in the public sector is that I am enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Under the terms of this program, I will be eligible to have the remaining balance of my student loans forgiven after 10 years of repayment (120 qualifying monthly payments) while employed full-time in a government or non-profit organization.

While enrolled in the PSLF program, my monthly student loan payments are capped at a fixed % of my disposable income. That monthly payment is now approximately $230. After another 6.5 years of qualifying monthly payments, the remaining balance (principal + interest) of my loan will be forgiven tax-free. If I were not enrolled in the PSLF program, my monthly payment would be $2,800 on a standard 10-year repayment plan (i.e. if I were working in the private sector).

Based on this difference in monthly payment amounts, if I were to take a job in the private sector, I would need to be earning an annual salary at least $31K more than I make now just for my “take home” pay after student loan payments to remain the same. 

**Final thoughts:**

I love the work that I do, and have every intention of remaining on the same general career track in the field of Urban Planning. However, with limited opportunity for vertical promotion within my current City organization, I see only two potential options for a significant salary increase: (1) take a private sector job in the same field, or (2) take a job with a different City or non-profit in the same field.

Option 1: An equivalent job in the private sector could reasonably pay 50-100% more than my current salary. However, I would lose the benefit of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program I am currently using to repay my student loans, and would likely mean significantly more hours and less overall flexibility.

Option 2: This would be difficult. Working for a different City would require moving or commuting, neither of which is a good option for my family. It is still an option, but there are some substantial barriers. There are jobs in the non-profit sector of this field which would pay more than my current job and would still qualify for the PSLF program, but these are hard to come by and generally don’t pay much better than public sector.",finance
personalfinance,Need to help ex-wife move debt into her name,"EDIT: apparently my post touched a nerve with some people, as evidenced by the constant downvotes.


My ex-wife and I got divorced in May of this year. The only thing we had to split was credit card debt, which came out to a little over $15k each. Unfortunately, I am the owner of all the credit cards, while she is only an authorized user on some of them. We both moved back to our home state and moved in with family members to recover financially from the divorce. When we divorced, we turned in a separation agreement to the court which stated that she has one year from the date of the divorce to situate her finances so she could either pay off her half of the credit card debt or move it into her name with a credit card transfer or a personal loan.

I have been paying off my debt rather aggressively this summer, taking advantage of living with my parents, and am on track to being completely debt-free by mid-October. Unfortunately, my ex-wife has only managed to increase her debt to $17k. Because the two credit cards that she is responsible for are in my name, my credit is still suffering. We recently got together to discuss her financial situation, and this was a quick rudimentary monthly budget that she came up with:

· $285 – Car loan

· $350 – school loan (She’s stated she has the option to reduce the monthly amount)

· $450 – Credit card payment (approx. $200 interest a month)

· $150 – payment to me (I struggled to find a job for 9 months, and she will make this payment for one year)

· $350 – Utilities for her sister (sister and husband do not ask her for money, but ex feels she needs to contribute)

· $50 – gym

· $200 – gas

· $200 – groceries

= $2,035 approximately

Her credit card debts:

$14,272.27 -  16.9% interest (she is an authorized user)

$2,564.04 – 14.99% interest (card is in my name only)

The next issue is that her take-home pay after all of her deductions is $2400, which only leaves her with approximately $350 left over each month. The two immediate options I could think of were for her to reduce her student loan payment, and to have a talk with her sister explaining that she won’t be paying the utilities for a little bit, at least until she gets her financial situation organized. I’ve also added her as an authorized user to two of my credit cards with a $0 balance and $12k and $15k limits in hopes of raising her credit score enough (she’s currently at a 656).

We created a credit karma account for her, but the loan options that were offered to her had a minimum 20% interest rate, and the only ones with a realistic monthly payment for her were all 60 month or 5 year loans. I also don’t know if she would even be approved for a personal loan with all of the monthly debts that she has. 

So it is unfortunately in my best interest to help her situate her finances. She technically has until May 2019 to figure this out, but we would both like to find a way to fix this sooner then later; me for my credit, and her so that she has more manageable debts. Are there any other options that I haven’t considered?",finance

Bitcoin,Robinhood Said They Do Not Sell Customer Information,"Robinhood, a zero-trading fee cryptocurrency platform, which took the space by storm earlier this year, is back in the limelight. This time, however, unlike the usual good announcements made by the platform, Robinhood is alleged of selling user data to high-frequency trading (HFT)firms.  


The news hit the space right after Robinhood disclosed their financial report for the second quarter of 2018 in order to abide by the Securities and Exchanges Commission Rule 606. The report spread like wildfire with many claiming that the platform is selling their customers orders and earning millions by doing so. However, regarding the matter, the Head of Communications of Robinhood, Jack Randall issued an official statement on behalf of Robinhood on Twitter. The statement claims that Robinhood, alongside other licensed brokerages, is required to execute customer orders at the best available price across every regional and national stock exchange as it is required by the Federal Law.",cryptocurrency
solar,Cutting through the possible BS: Is this system proposal really economical?,"My wife and I are very interested in considering a Solar Panel installation, and have priced things out in the past-- largely finding them to be non-economical. But we like to look into this every once in a while, so when a door-to-door salesman called on our house last weekend, we invited him in to share some info. We then had him back to run a numbers consult, which turned into a bit of a pre-planned spiel.   


We're having trouble cutting through some sales-pitchy cherrypicked facts, and the truth. We'd want to go with Solar Panels if they would save us money long term, but definitely want to know exactly how much extra they cost if that ends up being the case.  


Here's some info on us: We live in North Carolina, own a single family home that uses an average of \~$750 kWh of electricity every month. Range is 1130ish kWh in peak summer, and as low as 500 in winter. Our average electric bill was $85ish.  


The sales rep pitched an 8 kW system, which they estimate as being \~103% of our energy usage. The install cost was around $18k. Our local power utility is Duke Energy, and their base rate is $14/month. With tax credits and a 3.99% interest loan we qualify for, we would be spending $162 on energy + solar panels for the next 20 years in this home.  


Here's where things get a bit sketchy: The sales rep estimated our future power uses based on current usage being maintained, as detailed in this article:

[https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-progress-files-new-rates-for-north-carolina-customers](https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-progress-files-new-rates-for-north-carolina-customers)  
6.2 percent per year for 4 years, and 7.3 percent per year after that was the proposal in March 2018. If true, we would expect a monthly bill of $165 at the end of 10 years.  


Fact checking, however, I discovered a major issue with this: State Regulators told Duke Energy that they could not boost rates this much. In fact, Subsequent federal tax breaks are now going to allow/force Duke to drop the planned increases to 0.3 percent  per year for 4 years, and 1.19 percent thereafter. Based on these rates, our electric use in 10 years would only by \~$93/month.  


I'm also concerned that, although our house is one of the cheapest in the subdivision due to being the smallest floorplan, adding an $18,000 improvement to the home may not reap anything like that in added sales value if we sell during that time. We can afford to lose some money on Solar, but between the somewhat sketchy sales pitch and the lack of real energy savings in the short term, I'm just all-around skeptical about the economic costs.

personalfinance,Secret Mortgage Info part 2 - closing fees and loan programs,"Welcome back! I apologize for not being very active in the \[first part\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9fukac/introduction\_to\_buying\_a\_house/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9fukac/introduction_to_buying_a_house/)), there was a lot of stuff going on in life at that point. I'm back with part 2, on closing costs, loan programs, and other assorted questions and answers. \[This here\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9fukac/introduction\_to\_buying\_a\_house/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9fukac/introduction_to_buying_a_house/)) is a fantastic guide for getting started, although it doesn't \*quite\* include everything. Feel free to use that one for reference, I'm going to make my own list. Note that these can be paid by the buyer or the seller, that's up for you guys to decide, although it might be \*very\* difficult to get some people to budge on things they don't want to bring to the table.

* Appraisal fee: \~$400. You are allowed to shop around for it. I mentioned last time, appraisals are absolutely necessary after the 2008 housing crisis. I also mentioned this, but home values are based upon the actual prices homes in the area sell for. If there's no home like yours in the area, then they may do a cost-based appraisal, but market-based is the standard.
* Application fee: 0-$600. The other post lists these two as one fee, but the truth is that different lenders handle them differently. I personally don't like them and my company doesn't charge one. If you are being assessed one, make sure you find out if it's refundable. As a general rule, if it's not refundable, be very cautious about finishing the application. It's not a guarantee that they're not good, it's just money you won't be able to get back.
* Credit Report Fees: $25-$50. This is the only fee they're allowed to charge before an application has been completed. Federal law says this \*must\* be the actual cost of pulling credit, which is \*typically\* only around $25, but co-borrowers will bring that up.
* Home Inspections: $250-$300. This is \*not\* an appraisal. These aren't required except for VA loans, which require pest inspections, water tests, the whole 9 yards. I'd \*recommend\* it just as a good idea for you to know what you're getting into. Edit: By ""recommend"" I mean *you might be screwing yourself over with what turns out to be a crappy, moldy house. It's worth the $300, but if you absolutely can't afford it, it won't stop the loan.*
* Survey: \~$450. This one may or may not be required, depending on where you are and who you're working with. The point of the survey is to determine exactly where the property line is and that the property matches what's on the county record. Very helpful for property disputes, too, but usually not really worth it for those.
* Title Services: $700-$1500. You can shop around for this. This is one of the pretty cool things about a mortgage. When you buy a house, they do a complete title search, checking the entire history of the title, starting from the time the title was actually first established. Edit: Note that this varies *heavily* from state to state. Some states have flat fees that are simply set and can't be negotiated. Do your research on your state. That will \*typically\* include the recording fee for the update to the title, too. If it doesn't...
* Recording Fees: $50. This is just the cost of getting the county clerk to actually mark the transfer of the title. Usually included in title services, but if it isn't, it's still usually pretty cheap.
* Lender's Title Insurance: \~$400. This is to protect the \*lender\* in case blemishes that need to be cleared up come up on the title search. You can also buy your own policy for about the same amount of money, but that's completely optional. It covers the lender (and you) if any unexpected liens show up, or a past heir appears out of nowhere to claim the property as an inheritance. Not the sexiest product out there, but it typically doesn't require anything outside of the up front premium.
* Transfer Taxes: \~0.1%-1+%. The actual dollar amount depends on the amount of the loan. It also varies \*heavily\* on where you are. Some counties are a lot more expensive than others.
* Attorney/Paperwork Fees: $0-$500. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. This is the fee associated with actually drawing up the contracts involved and paying the lawyers for their time. And this is where we start getting into some of the doozies.
* Prepaid Interest: 1st month interest, typically \~$200-$300. Most of the time, you'll be required to pay the interest that would accrue over the first month.
* HOA Transfer dues: Varies. IF your neighborhood has an HOA, they \*may\* have some fee associated with transferring membership in the association, or you have to pay your first year's dues...
* Initial Escrow: \~$1000 + \~0.3-1% of price. This is the combination of the first year's homeowner's insurance and the property taxes for the rest of the year. Edit: You are only paying for that day onward in the year, not from January 1. Something to be aware of, the previous owners \*may\* have paid ahead on the insurance, so they may need to be refunded for that. Property tax rates vary state by state and county by county, so you're going to want to look into that ahead of time. I also get a lot of questions on what escrow actually is. Escrow is what you call it whenever you give money to a third party to pay someone else. When it comes to a mortgage, it typically refers to the taxes and insurance. When it comes to buying a house, it refers to...
* Earnest Money: $500-$3000. This is negotiable and down to the seller. This is the money you put down on the house to show that you're actually going to buy it. When you do this, it also gets put into an escrow account, to be held until the sale goes through. When you hear that your house is in escrow, that means that your offer has been accepted, but the closing paperwork hasn't been signed. Edit: At the closing table, earnest money gets counted as part of the whole down payment. And now we get to the last two fees, the two biggest ones.
* Origination Fee: $700-1.5%. This \*might\* be a tiny bit negotiable. This is how the MLO gets paid and this is where the underwriting and processing fees typically get rolled it. Sometimes you might get them itemized, but if you don't this is where they are. This one depends heavily on the lender you're working with. Ask about what's getting rolled into it, because depending on what it includes, you might be able to get it reduced more than you would by just saying ""that's a lot"".
* Discount Points: 1%-3%. These are entirely optional. Just know that you'll be paying a higher rate. The way these work: a point is equal to 1% of the loan amount. MLOs are limited in how many they're allowed to use on a loan after 2008, usually around 3 or 4. You can usually bring the interest rate down by 1/8% to 1/4% per point. Whether they make sense for you or not is entirely dependent upon your situation. Ask the lender how many points, how much it will cost, and how much it will save you. This one is for \*you\* to determine.

Now, time for the fun part! Loan Programs! Because lenders don't really talk about what the actual differences between loan programs are, a lot of people really don't understand how they work. Really, there are only 3 major loan programs out there. Those three: FHA, VA, and Conventional.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*VA:\*\* I'll handle the veterans first. Veterans have the best loan program available. You can have 100% of the value of the house financed with a guaranty from the VA. There \*is\* a funding fee to be aware of, but this is the only fee on purchase that you are allowed to roll into the loan. It's usually 1%-2% of the loan amount. HOWEVER, if you receive literally any disability benefits from the VA, you can have the entire funding fee waived. In addition, VA loans require a VA appraisal, which is a little bit more expensive, usually \~$650. They also require pest inspections, water tests, the whole nine yards. VA loans are only allowed to be used for primary residences in a 1-to-4 family residences. Fun thing about this stuff. VA loans are not actually loaned by the VA. The VA simply guarantees it against default for the lender. But only certain lenders are allowed to offer a VA loan. Not just anyone is allowed to underwrite those, it's an extra certification process. If you're looking for a VA loan, make sure to actually ask if they can offer those. As a \*general\* rule, there are very few times a VA loan isn't the best option for someone. However, with rates on the rise, the advantage of VA loans is shrinking.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*FHA:\*\* This is the one that people toss around a lot that confuses a lot of people. FHA stands for Federal Housing Administration. An FHA loan is insured against default by Ginnie Mae. ALL FHA loans have a Mortgage Insurance Premium attached to them, which will raise the monthly payment a little bit. FHA purchases require a minimum down payment of 3.5% to come from \*somewhere\*. The actual down payment amount required is slightly dependent on your credit score, but as long as you're a 580, it's fine. These loans generally have much looser credit requirements, which makes them a little bit more common. They also require an FHA appraisal, which is also more expensive, usually \~$550-$650. These also have an extra underwriting certification, but it's much more common than VA. Right now, about 1/3 of the loans in the US are FHA loans. The biggest disadvantage with FHA loans is that they include Mortgage Insurance for a \*minimum\* of 11 years. If you put down less than 10%, the Mortgage insurance is in place for the life of the loan. BUT FHA loans also have much more generous credit qualifications, and this is the other big advantage. Most conventional loans (going into that next) require at least a credit score of 620. FHA loans can get as low as 520, although lenders that actually offer those are a little more rare. The one catch is that you can not in any way be delinquent on any government debt, \*including student loans\*. Just be warned of that.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Conventional:\*\* This is the last major category of mortgages. Conventional just means there's no associated government program. This includes just about every ad that you see, including those idiotic HARP ads.... (For those wondering, HARP is designed for people underwater on their mortgage. If you haven't refinanced since June 1, 2007, you can have the appraisal waived. If you owe more than your home is worth, it might be worth looking into. Otherwise, just ignore it all.) Conventional loans typically require a 10% down payment, but almost universally, require a 5% down payment of \*your own funds\*. These can be gift funds, but they require a notarized letter saying it's a gift and not a loan. There are certain, very specific, circumstances that can get you a 3% down payment, but they're very rare. If you're putting less than the traditional 20% down, you will be required to pay for Private Mortgage Insurance. Yes, this is technically different than Mortgage Insurance Premiums from FHA loans. Either way, you'll be paying extra. On Conventional loans, though, the second the loan hits 80% you're allowed to cancel the PMI, and the second it hits 78%, they're required by law to cancel it. Edit: They're required to cancel it when you're *scheduled* to hit 78%. If you're paying ahead, expect to be required to get an appraisal. If your credit score is above 620, conventional is going to be your best bet about 95% of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Adjustable Rate Mortgages\*\* Time for a little note about ARMs. These are really the loans responsible for the housing crash in 2007. After that, they're a little bit more strictly regulated. An Adjustable Rate Mortgage is a mortgage that will \*change in rate\*. That's the catch with them. Typically, they're fixed for the first \~3-5 years, then adjust every year after that. The adjustments are capped and you're informed of what those caps will be, usually a maximum annual adjustment as well as a maximum lifetime adjustment. These are \*risky\* as all get out, the adjustments are tied to what the markets are doing, usually tied to one of a couple of indexes. I would never, ever, actually advise anyone to go into one of these unless they're going to be in the loan for less than 5 years. Even then, it might not be worth it. Just... Risky products.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, to wrap it all up, because this one is getting long too, I'm going to say a little bit more about something that got a lot of conversation on the last post. I know I said interest rates really don't matter, and to an extent, that is true. They matter only inasmuch as they affect the monthly payment. The bigger effect is the length of time of the loan, because you have to pay a large sum of money in about half the time. (Side note, some lenders are able to write loans on 5-year intervals, some are only able to write them in 15 or 30 years. Worth asking about.) I'm not going to tell you to not worry about the interest rate, but I am going to say that the interest rate is not automatically the single most important part of the loan. For those asking about why I'd recommend a 30 year loan for someone who really couldn't decide on what term, here's why: 30 year mortgages have \*much\* lower payments, which allows for much more flexibility. If you're able to make the payment on your 15 year loan without a problem, it's not really something to think about. But if the 15 year is going to be a little tight, or you foresee something coming up in the near future, like having children or a company going under, the 30 year gives the flexibility for just in case something happens, you're on the hook for $700/month instead of $1300. Very, very few mortgages have prepayment penalties anymore, so that shouldn't be something you need to worry about if you choose to go that route.

&amp;#x200B;

One last note, just in case people are feeling a little cynical or jaded from past experiences: After the Dodd-Frank Act, Mortgage Loan Originators are, by law, only allowed to be compensated based on two things. Those two things are 1. the Loan Amount and 2. the number of units they fund. If an MLO is compensated based on program, rate, discount, or anything like that, it's \*quite\* illegal. We don't care if you choose a 15 or 30 year, FHA or conventional, Adjustable or fixed rate, any of that.

personalfinance,27 w/ debt...401k w/ new job starts in October. Few questions.,"I am 27 with 87k in student loan debt (41k @4.25 in private/46k @\~4.6% in federal). I am putting nearly 2-2.5k a month toward student loan debt. I recently got a new job, a potentially long-term situation, as I really like this company. Next month, October, I can begin to contribute to the 401k. The company matches up to 50% of a 4% contribution (i.e., a 2% contribution is matched at 1% and a 3% contribution is matched at 1.5%).

Should I contribute, period? As in, should I wait until after I pay off my debts? I am trying to get to paying 3k/mo on my loans, but I sure would hate to give up free money.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, should I contribute pre-tax or Roth? I have read the information on here regarding retirement and the difference, and frankly I'm still a little blurry on the difference. I guess I just want to make the best decision for me now so I'm not losing too much money that would hurt my ability to pay more on student loan debt.",finance
personalfinance,Young and dumb - How to get my debt under control now,"A year ago, I was doing (imo) extremely well and being responsible with my debt. At 22, i had an okay credit score of ~730 and managed to pay the $100-$200 I would rack up in monthly debt off on time with no problem. 

This will be.long winded to explain the whole situation, so apologies. TLDR down below.  This all started when I had to take my late dog Raleigh to the ER late at night. Having no money saved up to pay the bill, I put it on a card. This happened with him a week before I was set to go on vacation and seeing as how the vet chalked it up to him being okay, I went on vacation as planned and incurred a little more debt. A few days after I got back, Raleigh was exhibiting the same signs and being very scared for him, i took him to the ER once again given this was about 4 am and it was my only choice. Vet tells me hes now concerned and my dog is taken to a vet clinic with a neurology department where they find a cyst in the left part of his brain that has a 10% chance of actually being removed even if they can operate. Long story short, I leave without a dog and have about $3,500 worth of debt. 

Fast forward closer to the present, I have had an ""existential crisis"" that has led to me quitting my job, and spending sround $4000 to a trip to Japan, where I am currently residing. I'm still unsure if this was self-sabotage in a lack of caring for myself or a genuine desire to lay it out on the table and gamble with fixing my life and starting new, but im now beginning to see it was the former. 

I find myself with about $10,000 worth of debt (and rising due to no more money in my checking account), no job and very little hope in coming back from this one. Yes, i know im dumb. I could use any input that you guys can provide. I am already putting in applications for a new place of employment for when I go back home to America in about a week. 

TL:DR: ER visits and impulsive spending has me in about $10,000 worth of debt with no job (yet) to help with payment. 

Dont know if its important, but a little info that may help: 
Have three credit cards at the moment, two with debt. Credit card one has $6,500 of debt (used for almost all of my purchases, terrible idea) card two has around $500 worth of debt and is being used to pull money out of the ATMs in Japan since I cant use my checking. All other debt is from a loan I incurred to get a lower interest rate on some debt previously charged to card one. Furthermore, my bank is asking for a minimum payment of $1,000 due on October 10th or else they will add an additional $1,000 to the card.",finance
personalfinance,It’s official: Interest rates don’t just go down…,[removed],finance
personalfinance,I have a 10k loan but also have 10k cash...,Should I invest the cash or pay the bank loan? The reason I ask is because the loan has a fixed interest rate whether I pay it off early or not so is it better for me to do something else with the cash?,finance
personalfinance,A question about credit and financing,"Hi r/personalfinance,

Forgive me if this isnt the right venue for this. I recently purchased a home theater system at a local AV store who offers financing through Synchrony. I had a salesman that was not familiar with the store's financing options and a few mistakes were made in the ring up and sale (the store was also in the middle of remodel, so more experienced salespeople and the store manager had their hands full)

We got our first statement from the bank at 29.9% apr. This is the deferred interest rate and the bank offers promotional periods from 6 months to 24 months. The bank explained that the vendor can adjust the promotional period within 90 days. 

The store manager is now telling us that they only do 6 month deferred interest. 

My question is this: Does the store's profit get affected by offering different promotional periods? Does the store have a particular advantage to only offering 6 month deferred as opposed to longer periods that the bank offers? 

Thanks for your help.

devops,Nomad Architecture Question,"Hi all. I'm doing some research and testing of HashiCorp Nomad, as we're considering the possibility of using it to run containers. It sounds like Nomad works fine in a multi-datacenter environment, and so I'm considering running a few hosts in our own datacenter, along with some additional hosts in Azure to give us some flexibility in where/how we deploy jobs. Federation between the two seems simple, although I haven't tried it yet. Are there any gotchas I should know about?

Another question is in regards to the number of servers vs clients. The clients run the actual jobs, whereas the servers just manage the cluster. It sounds like I need an odd number of servers, similar to Consul, in order to form a quorum. Let's say I fire up three server nodes. Do I need three servers per datacenter/region, or can I spread out three server nodes between multiple datacenters/regions? I assume the former is true.  

Lastly, do servers need to be on baremetal, or could these be VMs? Can they be the same machines as the clients, or is it necessary for them to remain on separate machines? What's the best way to manage hardware usage in this regard?  

Anything else I should know about running containers in Nomad, or running a hybrid environment with Nomad?",technology
personalfinance,Going through a custody case and it seems like it will be very expensive. Should I get a personal loan at 9% interest or take out a loan from my 401k?,"I'm taking my ex to court for some custody changes for some very valid reasons. In addition to my own attorney's fees (which will be $15-20k by the time this is over), I may have to hire a best interest attorney for the children (an additional $10). I've already spent nearly $10k for my own lawyer in the last 6 months alone, but I'm starting to feel the financial strain and don't want my credit cards carrying a balance.

I have a few options, but am unsure of which is best considering my finances will be scrutinized by my ex's lawyer.

1. Take out a personal loan for $25k to cover the expected remaining legal costs for both lawyers. Interest rates I've been seeing are typically 9%
2. Take out a $25k loan against my 401k and repay it at 0% interest. My YTD rate of return is currently negative (-0.61% to be precise)
3. Suck up my pride and ask my girlfriend or a family member for a loan. I'm not sure how this will look in court or if it will be counted as income

In any case, I can most likely have the balance paid off within 6-12 months after the custody case is resolved.

What's the best option, PF-wise?",finance
personalfinance,Connected and Abandoned Verizon Accounts Causing Major Family Drama,"My brother and I shared a Verizon account when I was in high school and college. Years ago, I went to open my own account, however, Verizon just made me a subaccount under my brothers. Although, I never asked them to do this. I simply wanted my own account.   


This subaccount issue ultimately caused problems for me and within the last year, I opened yet another account not associated with my brothers. I unknowingly left a $50 balance.  


We paid this balance just last month, but after it was already reported to my brother's credit report. He is in the process of buying a house. This account is causing a 100 point drop to his score - thus raising his interest rate and PMI. He is very upset with me and isn't talking to me.

There's a lot of equipment and tools I would like to buy to start some side projects and do cosmetic work on my home, but I always talk myself out of spending the money. I was totally broke after college and couldn't find a job outside of the food service industry for over a year, so I became very frugal with my money which makes it hard for me to justify spending on things I don't need.

Am I in okay enough shape financially to feel okay about spending money on non-necessities?

Would I be better off putting my available income towards paying down my student loans more aggressively, adding more to my IRA, overpaying on my mortgage, or adding to my investment fund?",finance
personalfinance,Had surgery last year while uninsured and today just got my bill (23),"This is in Oklahoma. I'm 23.

&amp;#x200B;

So last year I had to have a freak surgery and each department of the hospital sent me a bill a couple months after saying I can pay any amount on them and they would discount the bill because I was uninsured. I've been actively paying them since I got their bills. ($20 each a month, I have almost one paid off). I was a student in May so I was covered on my parents insurance up until July because I was not a student for the Fall 2017 semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Then today I got a letter directly from the hospital. Saying I owe them about 20 thousand dollars. I'm at a loss for words. I'm not sure what to do now. I live in a smallish town, working above minimum wage still and there is no way I'd be able to pay that $20k on top of my student loans I have to start paying in a few months.

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked at the hospital and they have a financial assistance program that says

\&gt;The total period during which we must accept and process the application is 240 days from the date of the first billing statement. 

&amp;#x200B;

It then asks me to submit documentation of:

1. federal tax forms or proof of non filing. (My parents filed me as dependent because while working minimum wage I did not make enough to need to file myself).

2. Household income, does that include my parents as I am living at home? But I make enough now to probably file for taxes in 2019. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Proof of medicaid denial. In Oklahoma it's soonercare, which I tried for a month after my surgery and got denied.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am really worried on what's going to happen and I am worried that their financial assistance ""240 days from first billing"" has already past even though this is the first letter I've gotten from them telling me to pay that bill.

personalfinance,Amending Parents' 2015 Tax Returns,"Hi all. I'm in a bit of a weird situation regarding my schooling due to my parents' (mother and step father) 2015 tax returns. I am a 19yo male who is currently unable to continue schooling, but would like to continue.

I live in Hawaii. My mother is divorced from my father and remarried. I currently live with my mother and step father.

So, for the Fall 2017 term, I was able to fill out a FAFSA using only my mother's 2015 tax return; IIRC, the financial aid advisors at my high school said that only my mom's would be needed in my situation. That information was sent to UH Manoa, where I ended up going to for Fall 2017. At the time, I would wait for all that financial stuff to be processed and to see how much federal aid I would get before applying for persona/private school loans. But as the semester passed through, a couple big issues presented themselves. One being that my step father's was needed. Okay, no big deal. Got that submitted. 

But the real problem then exposed themselves in their filing statuses. My mother filed as head of household, while my step father filed as single. As I mentioned, they're married, and I've determined (with the university's fin aid office) that my mother does not qualify to file as a HoH despite being married (and also had no idea why my father straight up filed as single). Up until now, the university has been unable to process my financial aid package because of this, and an almost $12k balance for the fall semester is hanging above me. All I know now is that I need to file an amended Form 1040X to the school (and to the IRS I presume, unless the university can also do that?) before everything can get fixed.

Unfortunately for me, my mom seems to want to be as little involved as possible (while still harping on me why I'm still not going to school despite either not understanding or caring to understand that her tax returns are the only reason why I'm not) and my step father is kind of deadbeat TBH. Up until now I've been trying to get my mom to come in with me to the financial aid office to sort this out, as I'm not willing nor able to fix their taxes for them, but her seeming reluctance to get involved has been really stressing me out and it's already been over a year. Should I just try to go into the fin aid office myself, or try and go to a financial advisor to get this sorted out?",finance

personalfinance,How to budget for future living expenses when life is about to change dramatically/avoid borrowing too much?,"Hi all.  Thanks in advance for any help or recommendations you can give me and sorry about the length.

My current situation: I'm 25, graduated college in March 2016 with no debt, have been living at home since graduation (aka no rent or at home food costs). I have a solid job that pays well and that I've been at for nearly two years. There is some room to increase my hours if desired. Just got accepted into nursing school and the total estimated cost (including ""everything"") is listed at $115k, though I think I can easily keep this closer to $105k-110k. Between a variety of different sources (529, Roth IRA, expected merit scholarship), I have somewhere between $65-67k of that covered if I utilize them all to their fullest extent. Only other things to note are that I'll like be offered around $17.5k in federal loans and that my parents do have enough money that they could loan me (and I do mean loan) the remaining balance if needed.

Future situation: School will start in February and I shouldn't work again until end of May. I will have two summers off and most likely will be able to resume my current job during that time to save some money up. Sometime between next June and next September, my boyfriend and I will be moving in together. If rent costs were split 50/50, I would anticipate my share being between $600 and $750 a month (utilities not included). My boyfriend will be beginning a high paying job around then so it's possible the split won't be 50/50, but we haven't discussed this yet and I'm by no means counting on him paying anything more. 

I'm struggling with two key items here - How to budget when I've never really had to ""like an adult"". I haven't had to pay anything for room/board while living with my parents, which has been great for saving but is less helpful in determining what my usual expenses are and how I can manage them while in school. I also had money my grandparents saved for me paying for my first degree/all expenses during college, so I don't have a whole lot of info to go off of there either as my parents usually just paid off school/food/rent bills at the time with that money **AND** how to determine the amount of loans (whether federal or from family) that I'll need to take out. Not knowing what my living expenses are going to be like, I'm obviously unsure how much to plan on borrowing. I also obviously want to be keep it to a bare minimum so that I don't have lots of interest/debt to deal with later.

I am at a total loss as to where to begin with either of these items and figuring them out. I have plans to speak with my financial advisor (who manages the IRA) in a couple weeks, but doubt that'll be much help unless I have a little better idea of what my expenses are going to look like over the next two years. Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly expenses are roughly $2750, so my take-home is about 1k pre-commission.

I've got very little saved up (spent several months paying off credit cards as the primary goal, that's done now), in a traditional savings account, and only a few grand (I set aside the 3% of my check) for a Simple IRA.

I estimate max of 2 years before we see a major correction in US markets. We're in the longest recovery ever outside of post ww2.  The easy credit an low interest rate environment created by the FED was just put in over drive in 2017 by Trumps tax changes regulating corporate debt to income ratios.

  Why? Would they use leverage when they have 300 billion in cash, because they don't want to repatriate that capital. And executives get nice fat bonuses.  Sounds familiar, huh. Now when we have a correction which is inevitable it will be more severe than 2008. Most of these companies don't have the cash to cover the debt in a high interest rate environment. When it starts companies are going to rapidly deleverage by selling stocks they bought on margin at market highs.

When the next liquidity crisis hits and banks can't find easy access to credit. They will look to new areas to prop up balance sheets and look no further than Nostro and Vostro accounts that conveniently don't count towards banks capital requirements for deposits. In this environment XRP will be the standard. 

Banks will also jump on for the very nature of the transfer of assets on blockchain. In a low or locked credit environment. Exchanging value with another party can happen much easier than in 2008.

personalfinance,Asking for a substantial raise at my 3 month review? And other questions.,"So 3 months ago I started with a new company. It's a hip/young company that's medium-sized with about 700-900 employees across all locations. I started at a lower salary for the probationary period and am switching to a 35k salary now that the period is over. I was originally hired to work for 1 location (there are 5 branches across the country) but in the past month I have taken over all of them as they are short staffed (which I don't see ending any time soon, and even if so I would keep most of my work). This has increased my workload tenfold. It's a large amount of work with lots of tight deadlines and a lot of previous experience needed. I tend to miss most lunches and stay after hours most days to get it all done if needed, as do most of my coworkers and bosses. I have never complained once, have agreed to take on these branches with enthusiasm, traveled to other branches, volunteered to work holidays (I get a different day off in return), purchased home office equipment so I wouldn't have to miss work due to potential illness, and have proven i'm driven and hard working. My bosses all like me a lot as i'm very sociable and we get along well.

My worry is that they asked me to stockpile on all this new work when I was only 1-2 months in, so I didn't feel comfortable at that time asking for a raise to compensate, especially since I was still in the probationary period. I just had no idea when I was hired that it would be this amount of work for the amount of pay i'm getting, it isn't balanced at all. Calculated out by hourly i'm only making a few dollars over minimum wage.

So my questions are these:

\- Is is normal/okay to ask for a raise this early on? The industry standard for my position is around 50k and i'm extremely hard working. I now have my hand in all locations and honestly they would be completely screwed if I left.

\- How much of a raise should I ask for? My partner thinks I should ask for 10k, in hopes they at least settle for 5k. Kind of a ""shoot for the moon and land amongst the stars"" kind of deal. But I read you're only supposed to ask for 20% in order to not come off greedy?

Any tips/insight/thoughts would be helpful! Also yes i've googled the hell out of this, so personal experiences and advice are much appreciated. Thank you in advance!

What type of credit card would be most helpful? Since buying my house I’ve started to get multiple weekly “pre-qualified letters” that I haven’t paid much attention to, just assuming they’ll carry a high interest rate or hidden fees.

Or would a secured card be better for my situation? And why? If so, what limits are commonly used?

I’d appreciate any answers, thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Should I use a Debt Consolidation loan???,"Hey All,

So full disclosure, I pretty much have my mind made up about this and I WILL be getting a debt consolidation loan but I wanted to post this question **just in case there is something glaring that I am missing.**

So I have looked at SoFi loans and will most likely go with them but I will still check with my local credit union to see if they can get me a lower rate.

My situation.

I currently have 3 credit cards, all with high balances and as the title suggests I will be getting DC loan.

Visa - $10,084.58 @6.65%. Current min payment is $161

Discover - $7,778.29 @20.74% Current min payment is $174

Amex - $27,495.91 has two interest rate... Current min payment is $766

\---Amex Rate A - $10,561.30 @29.99%

\---Amex Rate B - $16,728.13 @15.99

So all in all, that total debt is $45,358.78

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on doing a DC loan for 35,000.00 which would cover the Discover and AMEX cards. For the Visa, I have a VERY low rate of 6.65% and feel like I should just pay that off as is because a DC loan will end up increasing that interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned above, I have looked at SoFi and below are the options that I received from them for a $35,000.00 loan.

\*3 year loan @10.625%. Monthly payment is $1139.65. Calculated fees in interest = $6,027.38

\*4 year loan @11.313%. Monthly payment is $909.92. Calculated fees in interest = $8,676.28

\*5 year loan @11.999%. Monthly payment is $778.54. Calculated fees in interest = $11,712.28

\*6 year loan @12.813%. Monthly payment is $699.14. Calculated fees in interest = $15,338.37

\*7 year loan @13.374%. Monthly payment is $643.86. Calculated fees in interest = $16,085.53

&amp;#x200B;

With the above info, it seems only logical to do a DC loan for the AMEX and Discover as the interest rate is lower and the overall interest paid will be a lot less. If I were to just pay off the credit cards as is, it would be about $35,000 in just interest paid.

As it looks to me, the DC loan will at a minimum cut my total interest paid in half. Am I missing anything here???

Thank you in advanced and if you need/want any other info please let me know.

personalfinance,stock grant windfall: tax implications and what to do (529?),"Hello, we have relatively simple finances with little experience with capital gains related tax situations.   We have a well established emergency fund and our 401ks are maxed out, no debts except a mortgage (low interest rate and on the home stretch).  We do not own any taxable investment accounts, just our 401ks and an IRA from a previous 401k rollover.  
My wife's company was acquired so her stock grants converted to cash at ~50% over the market value prior to the acquisition announcement (let's say total value is now $150k).  The grants were counted as income on her W-2 as they were vested.  I assume we now owe capital gains this year on the profit?  

The windfall will certainly help with current and pending college expenses for our two children (freshman in college and freshman in H.S.), which is the most immediate large expenditure we face.  We do not have 529s but we want to roll the proceeds of the stock grants into plans for each.  We live in a state that allows state tax deductions with unlimited carryover ($4k per plan per year).  Am I right in thinking this deduction may help offset some of the capital gains hit?

Does this plan make sense?  Are there other ways we can minimize or offset the expected large capital gains hit this year? Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,"Lienholder won't let me refinance, what are my options?","Hey guys, I've scoured this sub but I can't find anyone else in this situation...I'll explain.

The ISSUE aside from the main meat and potatoes of it is that I found a wonderful new autoloan but they want the title of my car to refinance. My current company won't let me refinance with them or go outside of the company without the title. They won't GIVE me the title. They sent me a copy. But, is this good enough to refinance with?

I work at a pizza place, I'm a medically retired Veteran in college. So I make BAH, Retirement and wages from my pizza place. So I make around 3,500 or more a month during school months (I am still waiting for my GI Bill's BAH to kick in, and my pell grant at around $860) I have only been at the pizza place for 3 months.

My credit score on Credit Karma is roughly 660, I have a very recent Annual Credit Report but for some reason I don't see my score on it.

My APR is 15.99, the car is a 2016 Nissan Versa SV, my ex wife and I were really stupid about it. I currently owe 14,000 and tthe car is rated at around 7k-8k in KBB.

What can I do? Should I just trade it in and take the loss? What can I do to get around these refinance people?

To reiterate: They want the title, the car isn't paid off so my current lienholder won't send me a title but rather a COPY of the title. Is this sufficient to refinance? I tried going through my bank Navy Federal but I had something unknown go to collections and I think that threw it off the day of. (It's paid off and gone now.)

Other than my car, I have a credit card that due to my ex and I is maxed out, but I have been making payments on it. $2,000 limit and it's at around $1,800 with my credit score going up pretty well every time it goes down a decent amount. I have $900 in savings, I had more but I had unexpected things come up.

personalfinance,"89k in federal student loans plus 13k in Sallie Mae. Wife wants a house, I want these loans paid off. Are both possible?","Hello PF Redditors,

I am a long time lurker and wanted to reach out for advice on coming up with a strategy to accomplish some financial goals.

I currently have a very large cloud over my head in the form of student loan debt, most federal and some private. The federal loans are about a total of 89k and the private are 13k. The interest rates are between 5 and 8 percent for all I believe. Most of this debt was acquired due to career change as I graduated with a BA in Mass Communication and went back to grab a MS in Computer Science. I am still in school with just 4 courses to go but this is all now covered through my works tuition reimbursement.

So now I will do my best to give you the details of my current financial situation. I work as an application developer for a large bank. 

My base salary is 76k with around a 20% bonus each year in February. I currently do a split 2% traditional and 2% Roth for my 401k with a 4% employer match. They also have a pension which is about another 4% each year. 

My wife is an RN but has moved on to work in healthcare as an implementation coordinator for an EMR platform. She makes 72k per year with no current incentive structure. She is also doing a 5% traditional 401k for a 4% match.

We do a very separate type of financial arrangement where we split everything according to income ratio(hers vs mine) and pay a portion of the fixed bills based on this. I will list out our joint bills then mine then hers. Go easy we’ve been a little to spend happy before recently. :)

Joint:

Rent - 1400 per month
Electric - 200~ per month
Water - 60 per month
Cable/internet - 140 per month
Furniture (5000 owed 0% APR) - 250 per month
Groceries - 500 per month
Cell phones plus sons ipad - 230 per month
Trash - 20 per month

We spend a ton eating out and doing things so I would say entertainment is around 800 per month.

Me:

Car Payment (5000 owed 4.1 APR)- 300 per month(100 more than payment)
CC Debt (20k 0% APR 18 months) - 900 per month
(Engagement ring and wedding)
Car Insurance - 100 per month

Wife:

She is near debt free and I can’t really think of her current bills.

With all of this being stated, my wife currently wants to look into a house. We have around 15k saved and we can get something in our area around 180k. I also am going to begin to start payment on my student loans. The student loans are my burden and I will be paying them without money from my wife. We have agreed to keep finances extremely separated in this regard as I acquired these before marriage. 

Would purchasing a house at this time be worthwhile? Would this hinder my ability to attack those student loans? The immense rent we pay makes this area difficult.

I know there are significant cuts I need to make I guess I just need help prioritizing where I need my money to go.",finance

financialindependence,FI Plans of a 30-something British Expat,"During the past month I finally sorted out my personal finances.  While I had no day-to-day problems, I had set up nothing for the future and no way to even think about retirement.  

For context on me: I'm a British expat in my early thirties who's been living abroad for around six years.  I have no plans to return home yet but probably will in the future.  There is still a chance I'll remain an expat indefinitely.  

This means that I can't use British pension schemes, and don't get employer-matched contributions.  However, I am able to use tax-free savings and investments. 

Specific planning is tricky as I don't know where I'll retire.  My partner is from Asia and we have a son together which means we could end up retiring almost anywhere in the world.  UK is a likely option however.

My goals in writing this up are threefold:

1. Invite input or critique on my logic. There are multiple places where I've made educated guesses that I might improve upon.
2. Document my choices now such that I can assess them without bias at a later date.
3. I hope this helps others get started, especially if they're in a similar demographic to me.

## Current Situation

I'll keep this abstract and quote figures in *credits* all built around a notional salary of 100,000.  

 Category        | Credits  
-----------------|----------
 Salary                  	| 100,000 	
 Current Savings         	| 250,000 	
 Expected Annual Savings 	| 50,000  	


Savings were accrued over nearly six years and left in a basic bank account, essentially losing money versus inflation.  

## Available Options 

Relatively few options exist.  By my reckoning I could:

* use savings accounts in my bank
* use an offshore pension fund
* invest in markets
* buy property: but where?
* start a business: risky, plus my job is cool

I'll just rule out property and a business up front.  

Offshore pension funds are something I encountered 6 years ago but never signed up for.  I discussed these with some deVere Group salesmen I met on a golf course. I'm pleased to say I had my wits about me and didn't proceed.  

What's left are savings accounts and markets.  With interest rates being low I have little chance of using these to grow and compound my savings.  As a result I looked to savings accounts for my fast access backup cash and markets for the long term.

## How I split

I broke down my lump sum savings of 250,000 credits into two pieces:

 Category        | Credits  
-----------------|----------
 Investments            	| 192,500 	
 Quick Access Savings  	| 57,500  	

The quick access savings are my emergency funds should I require them.  They'll keep me going comfortably for at least one year and could stretch much further if needed.

The investments are the beginning of my retirement fund and aim to give me the option to retire, or at least more flexibility of choice, as soon as I can manage. 


## Quick Access Savings

'Quick' is a relative term, but what I'm after here is something to do with my backup cash.  I'll move it between various fixed term savings accounts such that it earns a little.

I split the 57,500 credits into two currencies and stored in [6-month fixed term savings accounts](https://www.expat.hsbc.com/1/2/hsbc-expat/products/savings-accounts/interest-rates) as follows:

 Currency        | Portion   | Interest Rate 
-----------------|-----------|-------------
 GBP            	| 50% 	| 1.6%          
 USD           	| 50%  | 3.0%          
  
Not game changing but enough to keep roughly with inflation and better than a kick in the teeth.  The long term plan for this is to keep this sum in basic savings accounts.  If I run into problems I'd have roughly 2 to 8 years runway, depending on my cost of living.  


## Investments

The more interesting part.  As above I chose a roughly even split between USD and GBP.  The GBP half represents the high likelihood of me returning home in the future, while the USD is a hedge that would be a useful currency if we, for example, retire in Asia.  

Brexit is also imminent so I'm hedging my bets there too.  The only certain thing is that I have no idea what will happen, nor how it will affect markets and currencies.  So I'm choosing not to second guess anything and aiming to keep my options open. 

With that in mind, I withheld 50,000 credits from my initial lump-sum investment and split the remaining 142,000 into two, roughly-even portions:

 Currency        | Value   
-----------------|---------
 GBP            	| 60,000 
 USD           	| 83,500 

My plan for the withheld credits is to keep this aside in a fixed savings account until March.  At that point I will have that plus an estimated 25,000 credits saved in the meantime which I can use to rebalance my portfolio once we've seen more of the Brexit saga pan out.  I'm somewhat bridging the gap here between a [lump sum investment](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum) and dollar cost averaging.  This cash I'm withholding is most likely a reassuring illusion of control for me, but one that I think is fine given I'm only doing this for 6 months.

Heavily influenced by Andrew Hallam's [guide for British Expats](https://andrewhallam.com/2010/11/how-british-expatriates-can-invest-using-index-funds-in-singapore/), I built a pair of portfolios.

### GBP Portfolio

 Ticker        | Name              | % of Portfolio  | Value 
-------------|------------------|------------------|----------
 [VUKE](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-100-ucits-etf)          | Vanguard FTSE 100 | 20%             | 17,600

### USD Portfolio

The USD/GBP split may be slightly pointless as I'm really tracking the performance of companies behind each of the selected indexes.  In any case I was converting to USD and GBP from a third currency and so I chose indexes in both USD and GBP.  All are bought via the London Stock Exchange.  

## Summary of Costs

One aim of throughout has been to minimise costs.  Here's the breakdown of recurring costs:

 Cost        | Rate   
------------|--------------
 [Broker](https://www.home.saxo/accounts) Holding Fee            	| 0.12% 
 Fund Fees          	| 0.07 - 0.12% 

I might dig further on this in future, but for now I think I've found a reasonable optima given my situation.

## The full picture

As it stands I my portfolio overall breaks down into: 

 Type        | Percentage   
------------|--------------
 Stocks           	| 38.5% 
 Withheld          	| 16.7% 
 Bonds          	| 25.6% 
 Savings          	| 19.2% 

Once my withheld cash is added I'll be holding around 55% stocks, which is closer to the distribution I'm after.  After about 1 year I'd expect this to be at 60%, where I'll aim to keep it.  

Later I'll map out more clearly my expectations about what I'll do with this in future.  While I am aiming at financial independence, my preference is for comfort and flexibility over an extreme early retirement.

personalfinance,"Simple but Effective Budgeting and Savings Spreadsheet, and Managing Budgets","So short backstory, I've been going through job changes and constantly adjusting my payments, expenses, etc as life continues to change. I put this spreadsheet together about a year ago as a simple way of keeping track of where my money was going and how changes I made impacted them.

  
It's pretty basic and only has a few parts to it - the information requested is detailed and takes a good few minutes to log into your accounts to get the information, but it's worth it as a monthly exercise.

**Income Tab:** A place to put all monthly income, and sources for keeping track. Easy to use for salary, but also simple to update if you make different amounts each month.

**Debts Tab**: A place to pull all credit cards, loans, and any debt that can be paid off as well as your monthly payments. By putting in your interest rates, you can see a 12-month projection based on your payments, and start planning around payoff plans (in 3 months, Bill A will be paid off, which means then I can start putting money toward Bill B, etc).

**Bills:** A place for all never-ending bills like utilities and housing, or memberships like Netflix.

**Financial Review:** A tab that pulls your expenses, debts, income and breaks it down into a weekly budget for spending. You can adjust a goal for savings per month, to account for in your weekly budget. You also have 1-3-6-12 month projections to view roughly how your numbers will look if you continue on the same path of payments/budgets/savings/etc.

  
It's not some fancy website, app, program, etc - but makes for quick work when considering making a large purchase, getting a new membership, or in general trying to keep to a reasonable budget or save for something big.

It's helped me grow my savings and also gave me a clear path for which debts to pay off, focus on, etc. So I figured I'd share it with the folks on this sub and if anyone had any recommendations, changes, or in general could benefit from it then that would make me happy!  


[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GthJ\_-c\_xuY7iLtwuR3y-1pAFpBLZHrLA51X1CwUUeI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GthJ_-c_xuY7iLtwuR3y-1pAFpBLZHrLA51X1CwUUeI/edit?usp=sharing) 

&amp;#x200B;

The way I've been using this has been to have 3 different accounts in place with my bank:

1. Bill Checking - All income goes into this account
2. Budget Checking - All random purchases come from this account, set to decline when empty
3. Main Savings - All saving happens here

I then used the automatic transfer option (I bank with Wells Fargo, but I imagine it's a pretty standard thing):

1. Weekly deposits from Bill Checking to Budget Checking of my budgeted amount
2. Monthly deposit of my Savings goal to Main Savings account
3. All auto-payments directed toward my Bill Checking account

If there's any leftover money in my Budget checking when my new amount drops in, I either look at it as a good excuse to splurge on a purchase or plan a night out, or if I don't have anything I want I'll transfer it into my Savings account and consider it extra. If my Budget card declines, I can move money from Savings but it's a good reminder that I wasn't very good with my budget that week and need to be more mindful.

Once a month, I save my document named for the new date and update the information on the debts or any other changes. I try to evaluate my savings and debt impact to see if things have been close and figure out if my plan has been realistic.

Hope this helps anyone out. Have a great upcoming week! Feel free to share any additional tips below if you think it's helpful to those trying to get their finances in order - no matter how much money you do/don't have, being mindful of where it's going is a good way to keep you moving in the right direction.

Let me know if there's anything that doesn't work, could work better, or thoughts! Definitely let me know if you have anything that you notice I've completely messed up while trying to clean this up for putting out there - my finances could have been getting better through sheer luck alone! :)",finance
economy,Money is digital now. It doesn't need to be backed by anything.,"You take a piece of gold the size of a golfball, and hold it in your hand. We, as a people, (or just a few...) could say that this piece of gold represents 1 dollar, or it represents one million dollars. It's up to US.

It doesen't pay the most for the field, but it's definitely more than enough to keep me happy.

I heard that it's not good to do this however so I am looking for advice.

personalfinance,Question about putting bonus toward student loans vs. savings/investments,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I had a questions about what one could do with a bonus one receives from work. Let’s say one has $10k debt from graduate school, works a really good/stable job now, and receives a bonus from work. What should one do with that bonus?

Student loan interest rate: 6.6%
Investments: Stock Market

I know you want student loans to be paid off as quickly as possible, but maybe there’s a bigger benefit to putting it in investments/savings? Or maybe there’s a way to do both? Put a portion into paying off student loans, and the other portion (maybe the bigger one?) into investments/savings?

What would y’all do?

personalfinance,Please help me determine if Public Service Loan Forgiveness would be worth it for me.,"Hello all, and first thank you I’m advance if you’re willing to help me with this issue. I’ve attempted to crunch the numbers as well, but I’m not sure if I’m missing something or overthinking something, but I can’t seem to end up with figures that make sense to me.

The overall question for me is this: Will I save more money in the long term by finishing the PSLF program or paying off the rest of my debt outright relatively soon.

I have one final loan left (technically 2 but fundementally they’re the same) that is controlled by fed loan. I applied for PSLF about a year ago and after a very painful experience provided by the well versed and deeply experienced FedLoan staff I was accepted. Now, I will have been with my job for 3 years in December, which means I’ve made 33 of 120 qualifying payments, so I should only have 87 left. Granted this is by my count, because FedLoan has told me it can take over a year (?!?!) to count how many qualifying payments you’ve made thus far.

The loans are income contingent, so they will raise with my salary.


As of today, my remaining balance is 21720.14  

The loans have a 5.25% interest rate.

I currently pay 189.15 a month.

My gross salary just recently went up a little to 57824 a year.

Plugging the numbers into a calculator, I anticipate my monthly payment will go to about 206.

I’m currently looking at 2.75% cost of living a year increase.

In July 2020, I will get a raise to an anticipated 62504 a year. This is the last significant step up I expect during the life of this loan.

Those I believe are all the relevant numbers. Please let me know if more information is needed. But yeah, I’m just trying to figure out if it will be cheaper for me to continue paying 7 more years and getting forgiveness on the rest, or if paying off the loans in the next 6 months is better. If anyone is willing to help me think about this, it will be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,I posted a thread a few days ago asking for advice on how to combat my shopaholic problems. I have some follow up questions about managing the debt and spending.,"First, I'm switching to a cash only method (no credit or debit card access), based on a set weekly ""allowance"" my husband and I decided on. However, I would like to have some kind of prepaid debit card that will allow me to make the occasional online purchase. Does PF have any suggestions for a card like this that won't gouge me in fees (or an alternative method that may be a better plan)? 

Second, we refinanced all of our debt down to three fixed rate/term personal loans so we have a set timeline for paying off the debt incurred (a total of $32k over 3-4 years). One of the loans is at a higher interest rate than we are comfortable with (14% over 3 years), but we don't have the credit scores/income to qualify for a lower rate yet. Our income is set to increase by 25% in about six months to a year. Is it worth it to try to refinance again in about a year to save a bit on interest costs? 

Lastly, we are stuck in the saving for retirement vs. more aggressively paying down debt issue. $25k of our $32k consumer debt is at 7% or below. $7k is at 14%. We don't have a ton of extra income to throw at the 14% debt OR retirement ($100/month depending on the month), but we need to start somewhere with both. What is the best advice here?

personalfinance,"Upside-down on car loan-- pay that, savings, or CCs first?","Long-time listener, first-time caller.

TL;DR: do I focus on paying down my upside-down car loan immediately, focus on savings, or focus on credit card debt?

I have a loan on a 2012 Ford Edge that is still $8k outstanding. I pay $325 a month for this car, and I want to pay less. I was paying $350/month but brought it down by getting an adjustment through my bank... ""yay."" I'm upside-down on it; it's really only worth around 6500 or 7k. This makes it impossible for me to actually trade it for a new car without taking a significant hit, which I can't currently afford.

$320 a month is just too much for me to pay. Between that and my insurance ($130), I'm paying $450 a month for a car that I literally use &lt;5 miles a day and maybe for long weekend getaways. It's just not worth it for me. 

I want to get a ""new"" (used) car with a lower payment, but I'm afraid that my outstanding is WAY too high for that to work. Here's some more info about my financial situation:

*Credit: upper-mid-600s. (was low 400s about 3 years ago, still working on this!)

*Income: I make $59k in Florida (Orlando). 8% of every paycheck is split into my Roth/trad IRA (max match is 3% of 50% of my salary), 10% goes to the company stock purchase program. After health insurance and other employer-deducted expenses (health, dental, vision, etc.), I take home around $1300 every 2 weeks.

*Rent: $400 (we live with a friend in the home she owns-- no additional utilities payments or anything, super fortunate)

*Cell: $220/month split between 4 people; I pay $70/month to cover my phone (i'm higher usage than my dad and his partner)

*Additional: probably around $30 in ""entertainment"" (spotify, netflix, etc.)

*Credit Cards: approx 5k max outstanding (had some life things come up, hence trying to cut money where I can...), total credit line is 19k. I've been paying them fairly aggressively, too. My ""minimum"" is around $75, I put around $600 total between both cards, which have similar interest rates (weighting the card with more debt heavier than the one with less debt). I'm getting my entire security deposit back from my last apartment, so that will be used to pay down my cards immediately, too).

When I moved in with my friend (August was our first full month w/o paying expenses on both homes), my expenses were slashed by almost $1000/month for rent. I've started putting $500/month into savings (I want to save aggressively because when my boyfriend finishes law school in may 2020 we'll be moving back to his home state), and paying my car down faster ($500/month) to help make it easier for me to get a new car quicker. I've also been trying to live more frugally: shop in bulk, don't buy food/drinks when out, planning events more thoroughly to factor in any financial responsibility...

Because of my super high expenses when I lived alone, I have a VERY small savings. About $500, and yes-- for those of you playing along at home-- that is exactly because I deposited it last month. Like, if something happened to my job, I'd be totally screwed... it's stressful. But so is the credit card debt. So is being upside-down on a car that I pay a shit ton of money for monthly.

Time to wrap it up, hayllyn. 

**Should I focus on savings as aggressively as I have, or should I cut back on savings and focus more on my credit cards or get out of my upside-down car loan first? Or is there a better way to balance all my financial responsibilities so I'm not focusing so much on one to the detriment of others? Alternatively, if I am to focus on one, which will cause the least detriment to my credit score/the least amount of headache to put on a back burner?** 

Thanks so much... Sorry if this is difficult to read, I have a lot of thoughts/stress/anxiety surrounding this conversation so it was tough to get my thoughts down in a ""coherent"" way.",finance

I try to be financially diligent, I focused a lot on increasing retirement and getting 529 contribution high.  My monthly budget is pretty predictable at this point in life.   Most of my personal savings unfortunately is from past, that now thankfully grows with the positive stock market.  I'm not saving monthly to my personal savings with this budget which bothers me a lot, I used to be a heavy saver.  Many months I run a few hundred in the red, I don't like that.  1-2 years ago I had similar expenses and lower income and was more in the red each month.

Housing costs are honestly higher than expected now in life.  I'd love to lower that, but live in high cost region.  Cost to sell+buy erase any slightly lower cost too.  Unexpected large expenses just come out of savings with this budget, and I've tried to avoid that mentally with the home/car repair funds. Same for vacation, since I don't want taking a vacation once a year to feel like another savings burden.

So I'm at midlife, in many ways have my ducks in order, but still feel like each month's paycheck comes and goes, and I'm not necessarily moving myself forward anywhere.

personalfinance,Is it still too risky to put a low downpayment in a hot market?,"Some context: my wife and I (28 and 27) are moving to a new city/state for my job in 7ish months.  We just recently got out from under all our debt and have about 15k saved now. We're storing about $3300 in savings/month. 

With that we would only have about $30k for a downpayment by the time we move and so we would have the option of signing a lease and waiting another 6-12 months or put a 10% or less (looking at 350k being our absolute most for a home) towards a downpayment - thus a higher monthly payment and interest rate and less equity. 

Normally I wouldn't consider that, but the market we are moving to is exploding. We experienced this first hand in the place we currently live where a couple years ago a house would sell for 150k and now is easily in the $300s.  And the new city is also on that short list for Amazon which could also push the market up.  So the fear is that if we keep waiting we may get priced out of our market.

investing,"Is it better to hold long in stocks and take a loan on commercial property, or sell and buy in cash?","My business partner and I are looking to buy a commercial building for about $1-1.6 million dollars.  We have both paid off our primary homes and can buy this property with cash if we wanted.  The debate we are having right now is whether it is smarter to pay cash and not be in debt whatsoever OR to take out a loan on the property.  This is probably a widely debated investing question. Every person I know who buys multiple properties says RE's big advantage is the leverage you can get with other people's money and that buying in cash is less risky but not wise if you are trying to beat the market or maximize your investing potential.

My business partner is a HUGE follower of Dave Ramsey fan and now that both of us are out of debt with about $600-800k each in the stock market, he wants to pull our money from the market and use it to buy an underpriced or fair priced property in cash.  His argument is that the market's growth isn't guaranteed and it's super risky having a 1 million dollar loan and having that hang over us.

&amp;#x200B;

My argument is Ramsey is far too conservative with money and his advice is mainly for people who are horrible with money. We have both paid off our primary homes and overall loan rates are pretty low still.  Maybe I am looking through rose colored glasses but year to date, my stock investments have grown 34% while the S&amp;P has grown near 20% (my multi year growth isn't 34% but still pretty crazy high).  It looks like commercial loans for $1million are around 4-9% and I have no doubt we can pay off this loan within 4-7 years pending no crazy recession that destroys our business.  My thought is that if we have a nice nest egg saved up, and the market is growing even at 10%, then it would be smarter to leverage someone else's money on the loan and then quickly chip away at it with profits from the business.

&amp;#x200B;

Today by partner asked this question and I didn't have a great answer for it and wanted to see what your thoughts were:

&amp;#x200B;

""You \[me the OP\] keep saying you are comfortable having your house paid off but taking a risk on a commercial property.  Why does it matter if you pay off the commercial property or the house off first?  Both are liabilities and you are going to potentially default either way if the markets change and our business fails. If anything, you should refinance your own house, get a smaller interest rate on your residential house, and completely pay off the commercial building without taking on a much riskier commercial loan.""

My thought is if the commercial loan and building are taken by our business LLC then if something bad were to happen, my personal house and income would be protected and I wouldn't be left homeless.  I also feel like I'm so close to being Financial Independent (don't care to retire early yet), that it hurts pulling out $700k from my investment portfolio to buy a commercial property when RE is near the top and the market is killing it.  His argument is that the market is also at an all time high and I can't count on 10% yearly gains let alone the 30% gains I'm currently getting (I admit, 15-30% gains are historically insane).

I know this is a long post and tackles probably a very common leverage question but I'm curious to see if someone can articulate one side of the argument clearly and concisely.  I'm also posting this on the /r/realestate sub since I know this might be heavily favored towards owning stocks instead of real estate.

personalfinance,Financial Life of a 28 yo,"I was inspired by an earlier post where another user posted her budget and lifestyle. Just posting mine, and hoping I get constructive feedback. Also hoping other people post something similar because I'm always curious how others are living. I'm single, no kids, no pets. I rent a house in the bay area with friends. My first goal is to save for a house. I want to save about $50k for a down payment, and currently have about $3k for a down payment. This will most likely be below 20%. Will probably buy in a cheaper area of the bay area.

&amp;#x200B;

I make $85k per year. I put 10% of each paycheck into 401k with no company matching. I currently have about $16k between Roth IRA, 401K, and HSA combined. I have about $3k between all cryptos, with about a third of that in btc. I have about $2k in stocks between facebook, spotify, CGC, and apple. I have an emergency fund of $5k. I have $3k in ally savings, which will be my savings account for my house (which I plan to be ready to buy in about 3 years). **Total positive cash is at about** **$30k**, and this includes everything above, plus credit card cashback rewards, checkings account, coin jar, and cash.

&amp;#x200B;

**My only debt is my car, which I owe about $13k** at a 0.9% interest rate. I had $30k in student loans but managed to pay it off within 2 years!

Monthly income is about $6.5k but this includes a reimbursement check for travel. I make money on this with my per diem, and through gas reimbursement, totaling about an extra $1k per month which goes directly to my house savings account.

Monthly expenses include:

* *rent: $1k*
* *hotels: $1.4K (I travel for work pretty frequently and this is an average amount. I get reimbursed.)*
* *utilities: $120 (average)*
* *phone: $95*
* *groceries: $350 (average)*
* *restaurants: $300 (average)*
* *gas: $300 (average)*
* *other car stuff: $100 (average, and this includes toll, oil change, car maintenance. Changes month to month, but usually around this amount)*
* *subscriptions: $13*
* *bars and clubs: $100 (average)*
* *weekend trips: $350 (average)*
* *other personal: $700 (not every month, but this month I bought a bike)*
* *other recreation: $800 (not every month, but this month I'm buying a plane ticket)*
* *car payment: $400 (minimum, still owe about $13k)*

This month I had some extra income from selling stuff on ebay, and made an extra $2k. I make adjustments to my amounts throughout the month, as needed.

The rest of it gets distributed to house savings account, roth ira, and maybe I'll buy some stocks. Right now I'm actually directing all my leftover money at the end of the month to my house savings account. Not buying anymore cryptos, just holding what I have and hopefully make my money back, then sell them.

My total **positive net worth is about $15k** right now.

So how does this compare to other 28 year olds out there? Or do people have recommendations? I know my food budget could change.. how much do other people spend? Also I'm looking for suggestions on categories.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone for sharing! Hearing everyone's situation motivates me to do better. I'll be removing everything that is reimbursement related away from my budget. I'll be splitting up a couple of my categories (specifically restaurant categories), and I'll be trimming the fat on my fun categories. I need to direct more of that money into retirement funds and into my house savings account.",finance

**TLDR - Financed the repair after getting the price lowered somewhat, vehicle is back on the road, and we are planning to pay the cost off within 6 months.**

So my 2012 Nissan Rogue has had its transmission replaced and it’s back in my driveway and usable once again. I really appreciate all of the comments and advice - I read and considered each and every one. 

The CVT in my vehicle was not repairable - it wasn’t able to be rebuilt. No transmission shop in my area would even quote me a price to replace it, save one, and they came back more expensive than the dealer! Since it’s a specialty thing, I was kinda stuck with begging for assistance from both Nissan Corporate and the dealer. A CVT is not something a novice can pull and repair themselves, and Nissans in junkyards are mostly there for having blown transmissions. They’re closed units. Also, I am the furthest thing from being a mechanic that exists on this planet.

Anyway, our original quote came back at $4200 but when pressed, the dealer “took a second look” and offered the replacement at $3600. They called back later and agreed to also include an oil change and tire rotation - both which were currently due. This wasn’t much, but it was something.

I carpet-bombed Nissan with an email sent to 6 different people, and received 4 calls within 24 hours. The response time was great, but the end result was that they refused to extend the warranty on the work and transmission (12 months/12,000 miles) and also would not assist with the price. I spoke with an entry-level call center rep first, who called to say they were immediately escalating me to a contact who dealt with the dealerships in my area. That person then called to get more information, and then got back to me again to say there was nothing they were willing to do - my 2012 was not part of the Nissan vehicle group which were having all of the issues, nor was it involved in the lawsuits that had been filed and settled previously. The rep did not appreciate me asking to escalate further, but later that day I received a call from someone saying they were a Vice President (I forget the division) but that their word was final and I would not be receiving assistance on this repair.

So. We ended up financing most of the work at a high interest rate, but since this is now our shittiest debt, we are going to be as aggressive as possible with paying it off. I also hope to get rid of the remaining car loan on an accelerated plan by cutting some extras out of our budget, once the repair loan is gone. 

Before buying the Rogue, we always paid cash for vehicles, but when my adult son totaled his car in an accident last year, I gave him my paid-off Toyota and got financed for the Nissan, since we had good credit whereas he had none at all. I feel like the car crisis is still ongoing, but I am calmer knowing it won’t last forever - we will definitely be selling the Rogue as soon as it’s paid off and we can build up enough cash to buy another vehicle (not a Nissan) outright. 

To expand on the story, this past weekend my son totaled the Toyota that we gifted him a year ago (he hydroplaned on a highway - completely weather related) and now he’s using the bus. We are all done with helping out. I don’t like being in a bad financial position, and assisting him last time is what maneuvered us into where we are now.

Fun money 10-1200 (also varies wildly, but is 1/3 of what ever is left after my bills are paid.)
Student loan $150

Ive just started getting my life together financially. I got my first credit card about a year ago. Got all my collections taken care of a month ago. Finished rehabilitation on my student loans in august (this boosted my credit score 70 points).

Thankfully my job has a great retirement package, they match 25% of my contributions up to the max,so I plan to start with that at the next open enrollment (january). I also get a state 401k where when I work a state job I get $6 an hour put into an account for me. 

I need to look into an IRA and start with the work 401k. My gf and I are also saving for down payment on a house. 3k saved so far.

I have about  I hit a huge financial hurdle about 6 months ago and have been living at a deficit each month since, with multiple open credit lines and shuffling many payments onto other credit lines, many of which have high interest rates, but I don't miss payments. I fell for the balance transfer trap once.

&amp;#x200B;

Now: My credit is already shit - 500s (compared to \~800 like 18 months ago, ugh). I don't forsee the need for any major loans in the next couple years - house, new car, etc, except maybe student loans (but if I could save enough on credit payments I could pay my way through school). I have maybe 2-300$ a month that doesn't go directly to bills, but does go to living expenses, and am not making any headway due to interest. I get that I could probably live SUPER frugally, cancel my 401k and ESPP to free up a little extra immediate cash, and chip away at my debt bit by bit, but is there really much of a long term drawback in going the debt settlement route instead? Without my credit payments, or with them significantly reduced, I could free up HUNDREDS a month in cash to go towards savings - I am paying nearly $500 a month in credit card payments alone right now, with about $1800 in net monthly income, $650 in rent, $200 in utilities, $400 in car + insurance (which will be paid off in a year) - the CC payment is not sustainable.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR if my CC debt is not sustainable without major frugality and I am young with no forseeable need for a life purchase loan/good credit in the next couple years, is debt settlement (via Freedom Debt Relief) REALLY such a bad option?

If he chooses to not go to school, the money is still his. I just want him to have a leg up that so many of us didn't have if possible. So some info/requirements for context:

- Wife and I are DINKs, this won't change so we should be able to contribute often
- I probably won't have a ton to start with, I'd like to say $500 or so by March (1st bday)
- I would like the account to be something that is easy to deposit into, and I don't mind if it is difficult to draw from, as it shouldn't be for almost 2 decades :)
- I'd like the account to grow on its own with a decent interest rate (sorry, I can't quantify ""decent"", that's part of where I need your help) 
- If possible, I'd like for there to be minimal tax impact (tax advantageous?)
- I trust his parents to steward/be included on the account, but this isn't required
- I'm open to having an extra account that is just in my name if that is what will make him the most money and be easiest for me to drop money into
- I don't want there to be stipulations on the account for what the money is used for, unless there is an excellent reason for it. The intent is education, but I don't want the kid penalized if he opens his own business at 16 and then can't use the money for some reason for anything practical

personalfinance,"Windfall of $9k: buy cars, pay off credit cards, or add to savings?","I'm going to keep it simple since I'm not asking for a complete budget overhaul at this point. After a rough year, our family of four has finally had more income than expenses two months in a row.

We live very conservatively now, but have credit card debt, court fees, etc. from some past bad decisions. We currently have about $25k in credit card debt and are making minimum payments on all but one, which we have accelerated to pay off by December to avoid interest charges that will hit after the promotional period. We also have a few thousand dollars of tax debt that we are making payments on, but I don't think there's an advantage to putting a lump sum into that.

We have two toddlers now, and a third kid on the way. Our current vehicles are not enough for the family and we live in a place where public transportation is nearly nonexistent. The car DH takes to work (80 miles round trip daily) has about 250,000 miles on it and has a catalytic converter problem that will be expensive to fix. We may be able to get about $1,000 for it. He has found a reliable used car with good gas mileage through our mechanic, and he is asking $2,800 for it, which seems fair. Bonus is that if unexpected problems arise right away, the mechanic will cover them because he's the one who sold it to us.

My car is enough to seat the family now, but won't seat the third kid when he comes next year. We need a minivan for that, since they are all young enough to still be in carseats. I think we could get at least $2,500 for my car. I've been looking for used minivans, and there are some available for not too much more, but a $5,000 van is a major upgrade over a $2,500 one. I'm mostly concerned with everything being safe and in good repair.

We've managed to make it through this crisis and still have about $3,500 in savings. Our first goal for now is to get savings up to $10,000, and then to six months of expenses.

DH is at a new job, where he will eventually make higher commissions and we will be able to be more aggressive in paying off debt and building up savings. When that happens, we will also want to move out of my parents' house where we are paying very little, into a place of our own. We want to do that before the baby comes, but the numbers will have to make sense. I don't think we should use our windfall for that, but I'm including it for clarity.

Up against all this, we got an unexpected windfall of $9k. I'm thinking we should use $5k for cars that we need to function, and then split the rest between savings and paying off the highest interest debt. Does that sound like a good plan?

Edit: We have okay credit and a willing cosigner and could finance cars too. My concern with that is that we end up paying much more than we need to in the long run because we'll have to go with higher priced cars from a dealership (rather than cheaper private sales) *and* pay finance charges. But maybe all that is better than some of these ridiculous credit card interest rates.",finance

A while ago, graduated from med school with a MD degree. After a near death experience, I took medical leave and went abroad soul searching for meaning of life. I am now well and good and back in US. I recently started a part time independent contractor job (2 days /week) that pays about 5200 dollars per month, of which I'm putting aside 20% for taxes. By January of next year, I should be full time and making about 15-20k a month.

Current living expenses is about 4000 dollars (I am married with a toddler in a major metropolitan area). I bought a used car that I fixed everything on and is a reliable transportation. I will have to buy another car for my wife (probably pay cash for a nice used car or a CPO) when I go full time. As of now, we have about 15k in my checking account that is emergency fund. 

I went to med school with full scholarship and the only reason I have 100k of student loan is from the living expenses during medical school plus interest for the past few years. Now that I am settling back in US and will be making more money than I need, I plan to set up a financial structure (monthly budget, life/disability insurance, IRA, emergency fund) and use the majority of my paycheck towards paying off my student loan ASAP, before I am contemplating buying a house for the family. Reading personal finance wiki has been really helpful in this regard.

**The question I have for you is this.** Right now, the student loan is under collection and the collection agency wants collection fee that is equal to 15% of my loan (15k) that will then add to the overall payback amount.

On that note: if I can be disciplined and serious about it, should I leave it as is and then store away the 10% in a savings account to get the interest myself instead of giving it away to the government, or should I change my deductions to 0 and then just get back whatever the government decides to give me?",finance

personalfinance,Should I buy this house and budget review,"Hello.

&amp;#x200B;

I read PF daily.  I love this sub.  I feel that now is my time to benefit from the wisdom here and I humbly request the community's thoughts and advice.  Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

**The situation:**

I feel like I'm in a good place in life.  I've been very fortunate after a shaky start at life.  I've lived in a trailer park for the first 20 years of my life.  I'm currently mid-30s and making a respectable income.  I'm considering spending \~$525,000 on 2 acres and a house.  I live in the Midwest, that's a roughly 3,500 sq. ft. ranch (total square footage) with higher end finishings and 2 acres included.  I'll probably buy the lot this week, worst case as an investment I'm sure I can make money on.  Best case I build on it in the very near future.  The lot is slightly over 2 acres for $130k in a brand new subdivision close to the major metro that's sold 7/40 lots in two months.

&amp;#x200B;

I mortgaged my current house for ~$230k five years ago. I currently owe about $200k on it.  I had a sizable downpayment. It appraised at ~$265k five years ago.  The housing market is hot right now.  I've done some minor upgrades and maintained the house well, I didn't mortgage all expenses for this house, I paid for things out of pocket like high-end landscaping, appliances, and a $6k fence. Houses are currently selling above asking price on their fist listing day in my area.  I want to sell my house and build ASAP because:

* My house is artificially worth more right now. Conservatively I'll get $280k for it, possibly I'll get $300k. I want that bubble money.
* I want to get locked into a mortgage interest rate ASAP before they go up again, I'm at 3.75% right now. I suspect rates will continue to rise with the strong economy. 
* I want to get a building contract STAT before the tariff war takes it's affect on building materials and before the potential building material shortage from the recent hurricane affects us.  (Am I being paranoid about this? I think my logic is sound.)

**My financial situation:**

* My credit score is &gt;800.  It recently dropped around 20 points after paying off the last of my student loans, but I'm still golden.  I'm proud of the 10 years of work I did to restore my destroyed credit.
* I only have about $100k in 401k total. I was  young and dumb as wasn't putting enough in this until now.
* My financial document (linked below) has some yellow cells on it which reflect areas I need to update with more accurate information.  I just started my current job about a month ago and I'm not sure how my taxes look after the 401k contribution becomes effective.  The taxes listed are based on no 401k contribution, so they're higher than actual.  I'm erroring on the side of caution. I was maxing out my 401k at my last job.
* Although I'm only a month into my job, I was at the same employer for two years one year ago.  I left, they asked me to come back for more money. This is my dream job, I left to make a point and I was soon asked to come back.  I feel my job is as stable as any job.  Worst case, I can make $150k anywhere with my skillset.
* My w2 job compensation package includes bonus, some commission, and private stock options. I excluded all of that from the financials as it's difficult to predict. I think bare minimum I'll get $3k/year cash + some private stock (which I need to vest in). In the next few years I firmly believe that $15k is entirely reasonable. 
* My wife and I have terrible spending habits.  I bought my current house five years ago when I made $85k. I've never once had a problem paying my mortgage.  Now that we've had so much excess cash we do dumb financial things (eating out and buying toys type of dumb, not racking up debt), but it's been pretty comfortable.  We're prepared to buckle-down and live with a more structured budget.  The budget on my Excel is basically based on what we currently spend, I think we can trim some fat as we hone our adult financial skills.
* I have virtually no debt.  I pay of my CC's every month.  I have my mortgage, \~$5,500 on a furniture store credit line at 0% interest, and I owe my buddy Dave $75.
* My wife drives a brand new car that we bought about one year ago.  We paid for it in cash. It has no basic maintenance expenses for one more year as part of the new car package.  It's a very reliable car brand and not a high-end, expensive to maintain, luxury car.
* My budget for this new house assumes I spend $525k total (building and land) and put $150k down (which I have currently between savings and equity). I might even be able to add an additional $40k between now and closing to savings. 
* My budget includes reduced utilities for installing geo thermal.  This is important to me, I'm environmentally conscious and I love everything about the idea. If I install before the end of 2019 I'll get a 30% tax break on it.  My numbers for utilities are a swag, but I think I've over estimated.
* My wife's paycheck numbers are a bit of swag.  She works part time but does lucrative on-calls. I've kind of averaged some things here, but again I believe I've errored on the side of caution.

**Side business:**

* Not accounted here in the financials is my side business.  I'm currently bringing in about $100k/year from my LLC.  I have taxes, expenses, and contractor fees.  Conservatively, after all of those expenses, I'm pocketing $50k.  
* I anticipate in the next year I will maintain this business income and I'm working on a substantial increase to it.  I think in the next year $180k in LLC work is completely possible.  I won't depend on this income, but I feel good about it's stability for the next 1.5 years.  This income is just extra fringe money right now.
* I do have a vehicle that I section 179'd last year. I bought this the same day as my wife's car.  My $400/bi-weekly payment on it comes out of my LLC, as does all gas and maintenance.  I'm on a bi-weekly payment plan, I pay more than the minimum.  My gas budget in my Excel sheet is higher than actual because my vehicle's gas comes out of my LLC, but I like to error on the side of caution. I drive this vehicle maybe 10,000 miles a year.

**My Questions:**

* Can I afford this house?  I feel like the numbers are way to close, but I read this sub and see people making much less than we do buying $500k houses in high-cost areas. I just can't figure out how they do it.
* When I look at my expenses I feel there is very little fat to trim to live the lifestyle I'd like to.  I can't cut utilities, I can't cut dependent care without selling a pet or child. I want my kids in activities.  I don't pay for cable.  I work a lot and I want a vacation.  If shit hits the fan obviously the kids are out of expensive activities, I don't take a vacation, we skimp on clothing.  My wife doesn't need to spend $2,500/year on hair and botox, but to me she's the hottest MILF on the planet and if we can afford it I'd like for her to do it.  She works part time so she can take care of our family and she deserves it.  Obviously, if anything goes south those luxuries are cut.
* What in my budget should I re-consider or am I missing?
* My numbers are negative for the first year after buying this house, but I need to keep honing the numbers, I'm not counting LLC money, I won't have much in taxes the first year until I'm assessed, I think I've over-estimated many things, I might have more of a down payment than I'm conservatively considering, my W2 wages are still a bit off and erroring too far on the side of caution, etc. Am I a fool for buying this house?
* The past few years I've found myself pulling money out of my LLC to pay off our credit cards.  Most of this is because we literally didn't budget.  We just spent whatever, it kind of didn't matter because we knew we could pay it off.  We're planning to start living this new budget today to ensure we can conform to it before the new house
* I realize the fortunate situation I'm in.  I'm thankful every day for where we're at in life.  I do work a lot of hours a week at the expense of my health.  I'm actively working on correcting that.

personalfinance,Looking to purchase a car but not sure if I'm in the financial position to afford it,"Current situation is that I'm a 24 y/o guy with a fulltime job currently for the past year.  My take home income is roughly $2800 per month, have roughly 15k towards retirement in Schwab and saved a decent 6k emergency fund.  CC debt is relatively low (&lt;$100) and been accelerating payments on some higher interest student loans (24k total).  Fortunately, still living with parents and have been commuting either by bus or biking to work.  From my budget I have around $600 -$800 I don't need devoted towards bills (more if I budget meals more appropriately).

My lender sent me my full credit report and I noticed my trans union score was a 796, but experian was a 696 and equifax a 694...a 100 point difference between the 3 seems odd to me. My lender also takes the median of the 3, which affected my interest rate but it was not absolutely terrible. I work for a bank, and was told I could always refinance when I get off my contract to hire to get better rates.

personalfinance,How do I Negotiate Lower CC Interest Rates?,"Hello Everyone.

I have been using Credit Cards very freely for the last 4 years or so. I like to play the games with rewards points, and use them to my benefit - I have bought a lot of big ticket items at no cost on Amazon.

About 6 months ago, I finally paid interest for the first time because I got crazy with the partying and vacations, and could only pay my balances down to about $6,000 before various promotions and backlogged points ran out. I figured out the numbers, and on one card I have earned over $1100 worth of points and only have ever paid $300 in interest, and another card was something like $450 in points and $130 in interest. The Amazon Card I've had much longer and don't have records of, but I've purchased things from a TV to a Snowblower all on the rewards points... Point being, I'm still WAY ahead on the points vs interest race which is where I feel they try and trap you to pay more in interest than you're earning back in rewards - like the worst carrot on a stick ever for irresponsible people.

Anyways, I am now down to 0-5% utilization. I still use the cards advantageously for everyday purposes, but I just simply don't spend the same amount of money. I never run the balances higher than roughly 50% of a single paycheck. While I was paying interest, I finally took the time to notice that my cards' interest rates are the following:
20.74%
23.99%
24.74%

Now you may be thinking ""wow, and he uses those cards all the time?!"" Yes, I do. 2018 is the first calendar year I have ever paid interest on a balance I've carried in my life because I was stupid with the ""you're young, have fun"" stuff.

But now I want to see how I can lower those insane numbers. My credit scores according to my mortgage application are 751-779. I have heard myths about people who pay more reliably are less likely to be able to negotiate down cc rates because they don't pay as often, so the banks want more when they DO pay... Is there any way to try and get those 3 cards under 20% interest?

My Credit Union offers a decent cash back card (1.5% flat on everything) that starts around 14.5%, but I really do not want to open another card, especially while looking at buying a home and not expecting to pay anymore interest going forward... but lowering those rates would be nice peace of mind in case of an emergency that actually requires me to use credit.",finance

Chainlink,Node Question,"Hi everyone,

I am trying to learn as best I can on how to run a node...unfortunately I don't have pre existing developer skills but I am learning as fast I can.

My question is around nodes - is there a finite amount of nodes that will be available? Or once mainnet begins, will the vacancies for node operators eventually become non existent?

Finally, in regards to the reputation - how can we ensure our node will not feed bad data into the network, therefore penalising the node? If I set my node up according to the instructions laid out by Thomas Hodges, will my node ever feed bad data into the network? Or is bad data fed in only if done deliberately with malicious intent?

Sorry if these seem like infantile questions, as I said I am still learning haha.

Thanks everyone.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Student loan question: my wife and i both have federal loans and would like to consolidate and do a graduated repayment,"Hello everyone, I hope this makes sense, I wanted to check if this was possible.

My wife graduates from grad school in May. By then her student loans will be due, she had $45k from undergrad that are accumulating interest and around $53k now. By July of 2019 we’ll be making $92k

In May of 2020 I’ll graduate grad school with about $35k of loans. By the end of 2020 (graduating/certification bonus) we will make $97k combined I want to attack her loans in this in between year and get her down to $46k hopefully so that we’re sitting around $80k or so.

My question is: can we consolidate our loans together AND can we set up graduates payment plan if they come due at different times due to different graduation rates? Graduated will be helpful. In 2020 I will get my certification raise, and the next year we will have a loan paid off from credit card consolidation from when we were not employed, and so that’ll be about $500 a month of expenses freed up to continue paying loans. 

Additionally, if our first set of payments are $500 a month, we’ll throw $700 a month at it

So basically, is it possible to combine loans AND do the graduated plan when we graduate at different times? And if not, what’s the best way to save money?",finance

My complaint is that, it seems to clearly defeat the purpose of making a game have good graphics and textures if you are just going to simplify everything using a visual tool like ""secret sight,"" or ""hunter's vision"" (in the case of FarCry all-of-them). There should be a better system displaying this information or something which embraces the look and feel of any game. I know that it is a lot to ask.

personalfinance,Recommendations for financing a new car?,"I am planning to buy a new car and was wondering if there is a recommendation for where to get a good auto loan.  I'm looking at buying a new Jeep.  My plan was to put down around $15k and finance the rest which would be around $25-28k.  I wanted to go to the dealership with my financing sorted out so I didn't get screwed by their finance people for having no options.

I submitted a request through lendingtree.com, but wasn't sure if that was the only approach I should be taking.

Since I expect these questions to come up:

The money I have saved to cover the purchase of the car is currently invested in mutual funds that have outperformed the interest rates I'm seeing so far, so my plan was to leave the money invested as long as I could rather than selling it all to pay cash.  I sold enough for the down payment and first year's payments (so I wasn't hit with the fee for selling each money).",finance
personalfinance,New or Used car? (This question again..),"Married, 28yr/old Male, together we are 60k in student loan debt, current savings just went out the damn window when I got audited from 2015 (*disaster of a situation really*). So aggressively working on rebuilding what was primarily the car savings... We're bringing in about $7,200 a month together.

So here's the short story. I am currently leasing 2016 Honda Civic at $210/mo. The lease is up in March and I'm wondering what I should do. The most our budget would allow me to spend extra on cars would be another $100. That would be on top of the ""lease"" budget, which will soon disappear in March. So that leaves a total of $300/mo I could spend on my car. So the current options are:


* 1.) Purchase the civic from the lease. Currently they are asking for $13,700 if I were to pay it off.
* 2.) Look into buying a new car at Hyundai. I have a relative who works for them and can get me 20% off MSRP new Hyundai.
* 3.) Go way less and more in my budget and get a used car for around 5/6k.


Ideally I would want a car that I can drive for the next 15-20 years, which means eventually kids, etc. I also drive A LOT (about 6-7k/year) so the peace of mind this 2016 civic has given me has been great. (My last two older cars seemed to have a new problem every other week.)

So the biggest question I have is if it's worth it to buy new and just make those damn payments every month forever (which I hate) or get a used car and make monthly payments for only a few years and then I completely own the thing and don't have to worry about those monthly payments! (But then eventually run into mechanical/maintenance problems much quicker than a newer car) 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!


**EDIT/UPDATE(per gajoujai's great question): Avg interest rate for student loans is 4.8% on 60k. No other debt. $7,200k/mo is our net income. And we spend ~$800/mo total on both our cars. It would be $1,000/mo if you would consider the extra $200 I was putting aside to save for when it came March (but blew through that when I was audited)",finance

Young me got lucky and choose to invest the portion my parents let me in Amazon so now it's grown quite a bit and I want to make sure I handle it responsibly.

When I applied for a credit card through my credit union ~1 year ago, the employee helping me with the application encouraged me to just write a ""0"" for my income and submit the application as it ""might work and doesn't hurt to try,"" but after getting denied and talking to friends I learned that this employee was misinformed. Many of my classmates got their credit cards by reporting their loans as income on the credit card applications, but this seems sketchy to me as those loans aren't reported as income for tax purposes and I don't want to get in any legal trouble from a credit card application. I was looking into getting the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Card since I already pay for an amazon prime student membership (so there would be no additional fee) and I make most of my non-food purchases through Amazon, but when I started to fill out the application I was not sure what to report for income or employment status (am I unemployed? self-employed? other?

I've looked into secured cards but from my understanding these don't actually have any benefit to them other than building credit, which would not be horrible, but also would not earn me any rewards.

CryptoCurrency,I'm Compound CEO Robert Leshner; we're creating an algorithmic money market for Ethereum assets. Got tokens? Earn interest! Compound was just featured on Laura Shin's 'Unchained' podcast. AMA! [cryptocurrencyevents],"Hi Reddit! I’m a long-time, active lurker. Here's [proof](https://imgur.com/a/SUiDasV). This week I was featured on Laura Shin's '[Unchained](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/how-youll-earn-interest-on-your-crypto-with-compound-ep-82/id1123922160?i=1000419956663&amp;mt=2)' Podcast talking about Compound, and a few people asked if I could do an AMA. In the spirit of crypto, I thought I would provide some radical transparency from the perspective of a project founder -- ***so ask me anything***!

**My Background**

I began my career as an economist, forecasting interest rates and managing interest rate risk for a bank, and then for a private wealth management company. And my favorite book is unironically [A History of Interest Rates](https://www.amazon.com/History-Interest-Rates-Fourth-Finance/dp/0471732834) (it starts back in Mesopotamia!!)

In 2011 I founded a software company, and moved to Silicon Valley, which is where I’ve been ever since, doing the same ever since. My latest company, Compound, is the third venture I’ve launched with my co-founder (Geoffrey Hayes) -- we’re creating money markets for Ethereum assets.

I’m happy to answer your questions about:

* Will crypto ever go up again
* Developing on Ethereum
* Building a company, hiring, etc
* Anything crypto. Seriously--I’ll read your whitepaper
* How the Compound protocol works, and our plans
* Standard reddit things...

Nothing I share in this AMA should be construed as financial advice. Do your own research, reddit bros and brosettes.

**So what’s Compound? Why should you care?**

Right now, most crypto assets sit completely unused in wallets, and on exchanges -- even though there are borrowers who would love to make use of your assets (to use, speculate or trade with). For traditional assets, like a dollar, it would sound crazy to say that it yields 0% interest, and that it’s not being used elsewhere -- but in crypto its normal.

Money markets for crypto assets will unlock value for even the smallest of investors and increase the attractiveness of holding blockchain assets, and that’s what we’ve set out to do at Compound -- ensure that every crypto asset has an interest rate.

Compound is backed by some of the most well-known investors in crypto, including Coinbase Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, Polychain Capital, and we've partnered with 26 hedge funds.

Also, we’re planning to launch soon!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,PNC Bank High Yield Savings - what's the catch?,"I came across PNC Bank's advertised [2.2% APY high yield savings account](https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking/banking/savings/high-yield-savings.html) yesterday. It might be location dependent--put in 94016 for zip code and the right page will show up. Anyway, I can't figure out what the catch is for this high of interest rate. Usually you have to make 12 transactions with a debit card or some type of threshold. I also haven't seen this account advertised here as a recommended HY savings account (vs. Ally, Marcus, CapitalOne360 that I have seen before).

personalfinance,Can anyone help me see the big picture on my poor financial choices?,"Ok. Long post incoming...

I am reaching out today to see if anyone with more financial experience can help me get my life back on track. 

I'm a 28/m married with 2 kids (8 and 6). Wife is soon to be 30 and not working (more on that later)

I was homeschooled growing up and have no formal high school education. The town I live in is a college town of 70k people. I have gotten by thusfar on working labor jobs, taking side gigs, and working my butt off (harder,  not smarter).

Earlier this year I lost my job managing a convenience store, which payed 46k/yr. Obviously this was a pretty lucky position for someone who technically doesn't even have a high school diploma but I digress. I have since gone back to my fallback ""profession"" doing screen printing work in the textile industry. This pays 12/hr. Or about 25k/yr. I also drive for a grub hub style delivery service which brings in about 200 dollars a week. 

So TOTAL household take home income is around 35k/yr give or take. 

Monthly Expenses: 

$315 Home loan (mobile home mortgage, 19k still owed. Not sure on the exact interest rate, but it's awful)

$260 site rent

$295 car payment (4k left on loan)

$150 vehicle insurance

$200 electric

$100 natural gas

$100 phones

$60 internet

$100 medical expenses (Wife. We're getting there...)

Groceries are EBT (not my preference)

Fuel for vehicle I deduct from delivery earnings as it varies from week to week. 

Now. 

Approximately 5 years ago my wife and I purchased our home, and car when we were both working and could make the payments.  1.5 years ago she suffered an injury that has left her unable to work. She has been denied disability benefits so brings in no income. 

I. Am. Tired. Of. This.

I understand, that I am now reaping the seeds of procrastination I sowed when younger.  I hate myself for it, and am determined to make my situation better for myself and my family. But we need to move. The area I live in has very little in terms of job prospects that would raise my income potential with my current qualifications.  Not to mention the fact that we both just hate it here. But clearly we can't afford to up and leave, and even if I found a job in a different area (Tacoma WA comes to mind. She has family that way) we would not be able to afford rent on a house, let alone other expenses with me working menial labor jobs being the sole provider. 

We would like to move within the next 18 months. What I need to do, is find a road map that can make that happen. Being young and fed up, were tempted to just surrender the house and hope for the best. I know though,  that this will tank my already atrocious credit and will only hold us back in the future. One idea I had was to begin throwing all of my delivery income (about 800 a month) at our mortgage, with the intention of paying it off, then selling the trailer as is to fund our next chapter in life. 

I just feel like I've hit a wall. I am getting my GED this December,  and intend to pursue a vocational degree for an IT relayed field. But that will take 2-3 years to come to fruition. All the while were stagnating in in our current town.

What the heck are my options here? Do I need to focus on getting out from under the predatory mobile home mortgage? Increasing my earning potential? Getting to a new economic area? Am I screwed?

** There is a big kicker to this scenario. Due to my wife's circumstances we are currently I. The midst of working with a lawyer to file a lawsuit pertaining to her injury (medical malpractice). The case is coming together, but we are still unclear as to whether we will receive a favorable outcome, and when or how that may occur. The statute of limitations dictates our case must be filed by April 2019. So by then we may have a clearer picture. This is important because should the case go our wayn we may have a windfall to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. If it does not go our way, the medical expenses will destroy us. 

Sorry I'm sure all of that is pretty incoherent. But as you can see. I'm a mess. 

Can anyone help me figure out where to start to get this turned around? I am no stranger to 70+hour weeks and missing sleep. I just need some help knowing how best to handle this.

***EDIT*** It also is worth mentioning that the lawsuit could force our hand in the next 6 months requiring us to move out of state. This has been expressed to us by our lawyer,  for the purpose of filing the suit in a different court for a better chance at a favorable outcome.",finance

personalfinance,Larger income advice on how to distribute.,"I have always been the primary source of income for my family. Finally my wife has landed a full time teaching position that she has been after for years. With this has come a large bump in our household income.  Our take home after tax's and insurance between the two of us is $7000 per month. Our Bills + expenses + fun spend cash is about $3500 per month. What would be the best course of action for our extra income?   
&amp;nbsp;

Some info on our financials: 
Our financials have not always been the most organized. As of October first we will be moving to a 5 account system to help with this. 1 Primary savings account &gt; 4 Checking accounts. All our income will go into savings. Money will be auto transferred to 3 of the checking accounts. 1 for nothing but static bills. Car, insurance, power, etc. $150 into two other accounts as our ""whatever money"" so $300 total between the two of us. The last account will have money transferred as needed from savings for things like Gas/Groceries/Daily family needs. No personal spending.   
&amp;nbsp;

We currently have about $4000 in savings spread across 4 savings accounts. $2000 in house savings, $800 for new car, $200 in a vacation account and $1000 in emergency. Were working on getting the emergency up. We just spent $1000 from it on car repairs. We like to keep a minimum of $2000 in that account.   
&amp;nbsp;

I have about $2000 invested in Crypto. I know dont kill me :( The investment is currently worth about $800 but what im invested in im for the long haul and am not investing more just sitting on what i have.   
&amp;nbsp;

We have about 50k in debt.  

37k in student loans @ 0% - 650 per month payment

8K vacation home @ 8% - 193 per month

3k for car @ 5% - 350 per month (Real payment is like 180 but were paying extra at this time to kill this)

6k Personal loan @ 8% - consolidated several 15-22% CC's - 150 per month

2.5k credit card @ 14% - default payment is 75 per month were paying 250 to kill this balance. 
&amp;nbsp;

We would like to move from our current residence and into our own home in a few year either 2020 or 2021.   
&amp;nbsp;

I am 34 with about 20k spread across 3 401K accounts and my wife is also 34 with only 2-4k in NY State teacher pension. No other 401k's. My wifes new job came with a Roth 401k that she is putting into now with a 6% match. I just changed jobs and can not enter the company 401k for another 9 months.   
&amp;nbsp;

We both pay extra tax's to the state and fed and use this as a form of savings account to help keep us from making stupid mistakes. I know every one will say to stop this. But it always makes sure we never owe a dime and we always get back 4-6k from the gov. We use that for making large chunk payments on debt and spending / saving for a vacation. Its something were accustomed to and im not sure we will change unless their is a major reason. The few $$ of interest we will get from saving it is not work the risk of a tax payment or us foolishly spending money we might need later, or that's at least how we see it.   
&amp;nbsp;

So over if were looking to buy a home in the next few years i guess my question to reddit is. Do we pay off the debt then save? Keep paying off the debt as we are now and save the 3000 directly? Invest the 3000 per month into something? Put more money into retirement?",finance

personalfinance,Am I being taken for a ride?,"So, to preface, this is a mildly long story, but I’m not knowledgeable at all when it comes to insurance matters, so I wanted some advice. 

A few weeks ago, in the flooding in Madison, WI, I drove my truck out to my roommates place of employement because she couldn’t get her car through the flooding and I thought my truck would be able to handle it. Turns out, it couldn’t, and it died while trying to get through a particularly large puddle. Being mechanically inclined as I am, I knew not to start it after being flooded because that’s how you kill a vehicle, and had it towed and filed a claim with my insurance. 
They immediately have it shipped off to a salvage yard, for ‘storage and inspection’, which from my understanding is fairly standard procedure. Two weeks go by and I hear nothing. I’ve been provided with thirty days of a rental vehicle from my insurance so I’m mildly ok with waiting but got fed up and called them. Got told they were passing me off to a total loss expert and that id hear from them soon. Another week goes by and I got nothing, until they called and said that the salvage yard had my truck running and driving, which initially had me very excited but as I thought about it, very much confused me. 
Insurance goes to take my truck to a mechanic to get it checked out, and the mechanic calls me and says the motor is completely seized and most likely threw a rod, which for those of you who don’t know, means the motor is completely shot now. This could have ONLY happened as a result of the salvage yard running and driving a hydrolocked vehicle, and I know this because it ran before they drove it, and didn’t after. 
Insurance is now quoting out a replacement motor for me with 140000+ miles which I’m not pleased about, and I’m about 5 days from having to pay out of pocket for my rental. 
Where I need advice, is on how to proceed from here. Obviously, I understand that I caused the original damage to my vehicle, so I’m on the hook for some of the repairs, but had my insurance had the vehicle looked at before the salvage yard randomly, and without permission, drove it and subsequently totalled the motor, the damages to me could’ve been significantly less. I would’ve still had to pay part of my deductible, but most likely not the full $1000, which to me, is a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I feel like I’m being taken for a ride and don’t know how to proceed. 

TLDR: truck was damaged in flooding but fixable, but then a second party salvage yard caused catastrophic damage and now I’m on the hook for more of the cost. 

ALSO, Apple air pods disappeared from the vehicle before I could get my things out of it, and a $200 Bluetooth speaker was thrown in the bed of the truck by someone not myself to get rained on and destroyed while sitting at the salvage yard.",finance

personalfinance,"Complete budget for couple grossing $161,000/year in Los Angeles with kids and student loan debt","Hi everyone!

I was inspired by the many posts showing up regarding budgets in different areas and different walks of life. I wanted to contribute the budget my husband and I have been following since January 2017 to pay off our student loan debt sooner. I wouldn't call this an ""aggressive"" budget by any means but we are definitely surviving below our means in order to pay off debt. We are looking at being completely debt free by October 2019 (one more year!)

Also - this is my throwaway. My main account has a lot of information on it and I didn't want it tied onto this post.

Please see budget and debts below:

Husband is **30** and I am **29**. We have two kids (5, 1) and I'm pregnant with our third (due in December). We live in LOS ANGELES which is VHCOL.

We started January 2017 with $115,000 in student loan debt and $10,000 in car loan debt for a total of $125,000. In 20 months we have paid off $60,000 and bought a new (to us) car to fit our growing family for $4000 in cash.

&amp;#x200B;

After all is said and done - we have been paying an additional $2000-$4000/mo at our student loan debt (as an average). We have about $15,000 in our Emergency Fund (not including Sinking Funds) and in the event that we are both unemployed I have a budget created that would have us living comfortably on JUST unemployment (which would be $1800/mo each - $3600/mo total).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The student loans that are on credit cards were transferred in the last few months. Those student loans had an interest rate of 6.8% and we decided to do a Balance Transfer to a few different cards with a one time transfer fee of 3% and a 0% interest rate for 18 months. These credit cards will be paid off by December so we will definitely NOT incur interest in 18 months).

&amp;#x200B;

In case anyone is wondering - these are the vehicles we drive:

2010 Honda Civic ($15k loan, paid off last year)

2004 Hyundai Santa Fe ($4000 cash)(trying to sell and get another sedan)

2004 Honda Pilot (just bought a few months back $4000 cash)

&amp;#x200B;

Our goals are:

1. Pay off student loans by October 2019
2. Max out the 401k every year
3. Start two ROTH IRAs (and max out)
4. Save 20% down payment for a house

Now the nature of my work is gig/contract based. I work in Television and there is a chance I will not be employed after I am done with maternity leave. If this is the case then my budget representing this scenario (I have many different budgets... lol) would have us paying off $37,000 extra on our student loans (assuming I am unemployed all year) meaning we would be debt free by March 2020. IDEALLY I am employed all year long but if the show I have been working on for the past 4.5 years does not get a new season I will need to source employment elsewhere. We shall see!

&amp;#x200B;

In any case - I highly recommend everyone create more than one budget for different scenarios. I have the following:

\- Both employed all year (including my maternity leave obviously)

\- Both unemployed all year

\- One employed all year and one unemployed all year)

\- Live like we have no money (for extra aggressive payments - my husband is not a fan of this one lol).

It helps me feel at ease knowing that if anything happens we would not go without.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway - I hope this all made sense and it helps others in a similar situation see what we do to reach our goals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**SIDE NOTE:** Since I know this will be questioned - my husband and I spent a whole summer interviewing daycares in many different areas (near my work and near his work) to find our AWESOME affordable daycare. It's 8min away from my husband's office and my oldest went there from age 1.5 until 3 (and he goes during the summer) so obviously we have our youngest there as well. It's $160/week and includes meals. We provide diapers/wipes/formula (when infant) and donate a SHIT TON of materials and snacks because they are too good to us. Both my kids LOVE this daycare... and they are just... amazing. We got really lucky but we also searched high and low for the best daycare to fit our needs (and our budget!). Daycares near where I work are around $2000/mo MINIMUM so this place was a huge blessing. It's an in-home daycare (not a center) so that also helps with the fee.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you! And if you have questions please do not hesitate to ask!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** Since so many people are in shock - we got INSANELY lucky with our rent situation. We live in the Sherman Oaks/Encino/Studio City area. It is NOT A CHEAP AREA. I just looked on HotPads and an apartment with comparable sizing and amount of bedrooms/baths runs for $2800 currently. This is Los Angeles - it's one of the top 10 most expensive cities in the US - so yes, VHCOL. The owner of our building does not care as much for it as he does his other investments and so does not upgrade anything - including rent prices. We moved in here 3 years ago when the rent was $1800. We obviously will stay here for as long as humanly possible - until we buy our own place, preferably!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 2:** Since this was commented on a bit and asked about - we do plan to always have 3 vehicles. One for my husband during the week for cummuting, one for me during the week for commuting, and one for weekend use mainly that is big enough to support our growing family as well as weekend supplies (beach stuff, wagon, picnic stuff, etc). We also do not live anyhwere near family so when they come to visit we let them use one of our cars as opposed to renting. I currently drive the Hyundai Santa Fe to/from school and work. It is up for sale and once that's done I will purchase a sedan to lower gas costs. It is also the most expensive vehicle we insure so switching it up for another brand/type would lower our insurance cost as well. This is not something that is up for negotiation - we will always keep 3 cars.

&amp;#x200B;

We have 3 phone lines - one for my husband, one for me, one for our oldest. We keep an old iPhone in his backpack for safety purposes. We had an incident at school where he was able to leave the school unnoticed by himself and I found him on the sidewalk going towards home. This is also NOT up for discussion. We will always keep a line for each child that goes to school. I'd rather pay his $24/mo and be able to locate him if he gets lost/kidnapped than not. Paranoid? Yes? Irrational? Maybe? Do I care? No.

2 years ago I got a terrible loan because my back was to the wall and I needed a car. 

I got a 72 month loan at an 18.6% interest rate. My monthly payments came to 315. 

They told me pay it for 6 months and refinance. 

I waited a year and when I tried to refinance I couldn’t find anyone because the loan is higher than the cars value. 

This week I decided to try again and I was given two options

Both with an 8.26% interest rate: 

A) 60 months with a new payment of around 230 
B) 48 months with a new payment around 285 

This is where I’m confused 

My balance is around 10,500 as of today 

If I keep paying as is, in 44 months that will be $13,860

If I take this 48 month offer and pay that it will be $13,548

The difference is almost non-existent from that perspective

So how is the interest rate going down by over half, more time being added yet I’m still paying the same amount?

I have never known this amount of money and I intend on making it go as far as possible.

I am in my late 20's

I have ~25k in federal student loan debt (paying $340/mo.)

I have ~10k in an auto loan to pay (paying $275/mo.)

My credit score is ~ 630

There is a 4% surcharge to withdraw the entire amount at once vs. no fees to receive weekly checks over a 3 year period.

My question is what can I do to maximize this money (paying off loans vs investing)?  I have played around a bit with stocks and have done pretty well.  I am considering a CD or a mutual fund.  What would y'all suggest? I am also curious about the taxes associated with this type of payment.  The adjuster made it seem like it was tax exempt in the state of Colorado where I live.

The idea of buying property is also pretty high on my list also.

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Down Payment or Principal Only,"Hello everyone, I am currently shopping for a mortgage and came across an interesting scenario.  The house we are looking at is $150,000 and I have $15,000 to put down on it on a VA loan.  If I finance $135,000 the interest rate is 4.5%.  If I finance all of it and put no money down, the interest rate is 4.0%.  Does it make more sense to put $0 down and then take that $15,000 and put it towards a principal only payment on the 4.0% loan?

personalfinance,Trying to buy my lease at Honda,"Hi all. I had a three year lease with Honda for my CR-V. I want to buy the car but don’t want to go through the dealership. I applied and was approved for a $17K auto loan. 6 years, 4% interest. The credit union who approved me for the loan needs the invoice/purchase order from Honda who won’t give it to me because they “Don’t take external money sources.” 

Honda says they’ll match my interest rate and financing is basically my “only easy option to purchase my lease.” I know this isn’t true and I don’t want to owe the dealership anything but rather my credit union. 

Does anyone have any advice as to how to handle this situation? Thank you in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Taking out a loan to consolidate debt... which option is best,"So the TL:DR version of my position is that at this point I’ve got about $30k of debt that I’ve been aggressively paying off.  It’s a combination of credit card debt ($22k; half stupid young me + half situational obligations) and an auto loan ($8k).  I’ve managed to pay this down by about $10k already in the past 3 months.  

I am heavily considering taking out a personal loan to cover these debts and consolidate my payment - and no, there is NO chance at all i would be using the CC’s again in the interim

Minimum payments at this point for all accounts as they are run about $1100/mo. 

My question is, if i take a personal loan to consolidate, would it be better for me to take a longer term (72mo) and just overpay by a lot every month, or a shorter term (36mo) and overpay by less a little every month?

I do well financially ($150k+) and realistically want to have this paid off within a year, two max.  

72mo term payment - $555
36mo term payment - $968

Naturally, I could afford to pay monthly at LEAST what my current minimum payments are ($1,100), but realistically I would be paying closer to $2k-$2.5k/mo like I have been

I have good credit (720+) so either option would be a substantially lower interest rate over what i’m currently paying on my revolving credit - it would be higher for the car loan, but i’m lumping it in to just have ONE monthly loan payment.  Additionally there would be no origination fee/initial interest on the personal loan.

Which would be the better option, long or short?  Or am I being dumb to consider this at all??",finance
personalfinance,Questions about buying a home,"Hello all,

My girlfriend and I were thinking about getting a home. We would be first time home buyers and we have a couple of questions about the best route to go. 

We both have credit scores of ~720. We both have Bachelor degrees and full time jobs. She makes about $26,000 (gross) a year and has had her job for about 4 years. I just left a job where I was making roughly $60,000 (gross) a year that I had worked at for 2 years for a job selling manufactured houses. The 5 other salespeople bring in $90-120k a year so I'm hoping I can see similar numbers. The problem is the deals take a long time so for a few months I won't be able to prove income, and because it's commission I've heard banks like to look for years of history?

The other thing is, she has no debt but I have about 75k in debt between student loans and my vehicle loan (65k student/10k vehicle). I pay about $850 a month in these debts.

We're tired of renting and would like to get a home, but did I screw out chances of buying a home by switching jobs? 

Would it be best for me to hunker down and budget for 2-3 years and focus on paying off my debt before we get a house?

Additionally, is there any benefit to getting married before getting a home? We've been together 8 years and plan on getting married after getting settled on everything - but if we would get better interest rates or approval chances we would do it sooner.

Thank you for your time,",finance
personalfinance,Debt Management,"I'm sure you've heard this story before...long story short, I acquired some credit card debt while I was in school. I had two credit cards and stopped making payments on one (the balance is $3,300ish). I'm still making small payments on the other and am down to just about $2,000. The interest rate on the one I'm still working on is terrible, 18%. I just received a letter from an attorney letting me know they have been retained regarding that first credit card I stopped paying on years ago (we were so poor, food bank poor), which terrifies me and I don't want to get sued.
I am a teacher now and my monthly net is about $1,550. Between my fiancé and I, we can cover our current expenses with a little left over. However we do not have the money saved to be able to pay that first debt to ensure I don't get sued. Not even remotely close, even if they were willing to accept far far less than the balance. I could do smallish monthly payments though, which is why I looked into debt management yesterday.

A friend recommended Money Management International, so I spoke with them yesterday and they were able to come up with a monthly payment plan of $175, which includes a monthly fee of $35. The first payment would be $225 due to a one-time $50 set up fee as well. It would take 4 years to pay this off (assuming I didn't make any extra payments, but I'm hoping to do so). This includes both cards and another smaller debt they found from canceling Direct TV early. The interest on the card I'm already paying on would drop to 8%, and if you subtract the payments I'm making on that card, this plan would actually only cost me an extra $128 a month. This is manageable (though obviously not what I wanted to be doing with that money).

Before I sign the agreement, I just wanted to get some advice on if I'm doing the right thing. Should I ""comparison shop"" other debt management companies? If so, who can I trust? I'm worried about accidentally getting sucked into a scam/money pit.",finance

40M here with 36yr old wife - both of us pursued PhDs in biomedical sciences and started working in the ""real world"" since \~2013-2016, in our early/mid 30s so we didnt have much in savings.

I'm a recently promoted gov't employee (GS14) and am currently trying to play catch up with retirement savings.  For the past few years I've been maxing out my TSP contribution ($18,500 per year, 50% into TSP and 50% into TSP-Roth).  Before tax, i make approximately $115,000 and wife \~$85,000.

I currently have \~$65,000 in my TSP and have a a Roth-IRA with \~$6,900, wife with \~$50k in her retirement account.  I know after some rough calculation i can keep putting money into the Roth-IRA for some more years before hitting the income limit (phase-out starts at $189,000; ineligible at $199,000, and I am told that these numbers are ""modified AGI"" and not the pre-tax income).  Anyhow, in addition to maxing out TSP, I plan to keep putting money in Roth-IRA for as long as i could (into the ETF such as VTI).  

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few questions:  -

\#1.  how will IRS (or even Etrade where i have the Roth IRA) know if i am exceeding the income limit for making the Roth IRA contribution??  In the theoretical scenario that i do hit the ceiling would my annual contribution be returned to me?  How does this work?

\#2. Various websites say by now i should have 2.6x my salary in retirement savings - i am far from that and that depresses me - am i too late to catch up (and would therefore work till 70s)?

personalfinance,"Budgeting advice on selling home, signing bonus and overseas retirement funding.","Hi all and thanks for reading. 

We are leaving the country for 3-7 years and selling our house. The house is under contract and we expect to take home a smidge under $50k US. We've been in the home long enough to not pay capital gains.

My new employer is giving us a $30k signing bonus. I anticipate 10k of this to go towards moving expenses (down payment on a flat in Europe, bedroom furniture, flights, short term rental, food and such).

These two things effectively give us the opportunity to ""reboot"" our finances. We have a bit under $4k in credit card debt, with about 10k in cash on hand currently. I carry a student loan burden of around $29k.

My inclination is to wipe the debt slate clean, but I wanted advice on that first point. The interest rate is 5.9% on the loan. If we go that route, how best should we save that money, knowing it will go towards a down payment on a new home in the US eventually? Should we?

Secondly, my new employer will be distributing a 16% taxable contribution to me for retirement. I don't really know what I can do with that money since it will not be earned in the US and I will not have US residency although I will maintain my citizenship. No idea what those legalities look like. I thought I had read that funding an IRA was out of the question due to that complication. Thoughts?

Up until this point, my wife and I both have contributed 10% of our salaries towards retirement. 

My salary and stipends with the employer are tax exempt; I will be under the threshold for foreign earned income exclusion (only just) and any amount above that which becomes taxable will be reimbursed anyway. 

Thanks for the advice.",finance

personalfinance,How should I be managing my credit cards?,"At the moment I have 2 regular credit cards and 2 store credit cards.

Credit Card 2 is a VISA through Chase with a 3,500 US limit and a 21% interest rate. I owe 2,000 and I have a minimum payment of 60$.

Store Card 1 is for Best Buy. It has a 2,000 US limit and I owe 1,800, however all purchases are under 0% financing. Making payments of 130$ each month will keep any of those purchases from accruing interest.

Store Card 2 is for Gap Inc. It has a 2,000 US limit with a 0 balance. I don't ever use it.

I can make all these payments if that's my best course of action. My current strategy is to pay 100 a month to the VISA and 250+interest and fees to the AMEX. It usually ends up being about 400.

personalfinance,New US job. Need help maximizing 401k contributions for 2018 and minimizing tax deductions via withholding allowances.,"I recently started my first job in the US (California) and want to take my retirement savings seriously. I have enough savings to pay for my expenses for the remainder of the year plus plenty to spare if needed. For this reason, I'd like to maximize my 401k contributions for this year and also participate in my employer's ESPP plan. With only 3 months of pay left in this year, that means I'll set high contribution rates.

I need help in maximizing my pay check (withholding calculations) and some sanity checks on my contribution rates.

Details about me: 25 years old. This is my only job and only source of income for 2018. I'm single with no dependents. Base salary of 110k.

Some of my own math:

I only have 7 pay dates left this year starting end of September (paid twice a month).

So I calculate that I will be paid 110,000 annual base salary / 26 weeks of pay = 4230.77 pay check.

So for this year, my income will be 4230.77 * 7 plus a 7.5k signing bonus added to my first pay check, so total income is 37115.39.

When I use the IRS 2018 withholding calculator, using the above total income, 12000 standard deduction, no dependents, assuming 18500 401k contribution, and expected $800 towards health insurance plans (this is a guess but probably will be less), the calculator recommends 8 allowances and says I will have $583 in income tax for 2018. Does this seem reasonable?

I used a California income tax calculator online using the same income and 401k contribution estimate and got $216 anticipated state income tax.

All of these income taxes seem low, but I assume that's because of my high planned contribution rate to 401k that reduces taxable income?

So to get the full 18.5k in my 401k, I need to set a contribution rate of 18500/37115.39 = 50%.

So in summary, it seems like my pay check breakdown for the remainder of this year would look like:

50% for 401k contributions
12.5% to max out ESPP
1.6% towards federal income tax (allowances = 8)
0.6% towards California income tax
1% for California disability
6.5% for California SS
27.8% as a buffer for other deductions (e.g., health insurance)

Questions:

1. Does 8 allowances for my federal income taxes seem reasonable? Is only $583 in federal income tax reasonable? It seems far too low.

2. Is my pay check breakdown good for what I'm trying to achieve? Just want a sanity check here.

3. How would I calculate California withholdings?",finance

investing,Automatic reinvestment of 5y US treasury becomes 7y,"I just noticed at treasury direct that my pending automatic reinvestment of a 5 year bond at the end of this month was set to become 7 year.  
  
I wanted 5 year again, so I cancelled the automatic reinvestment and switched it to purchase of a new 5 year bond.  
  
This post is partially a warning for others.  I caught this mostly by accident.  Is this kind of thing common knowledge (among those with TD accounts) that I just missed?  Or is it a stupid booby trap for investors?  
  
It results from the combination of two somewhat sensible rules with a third very stupid design:  
  
1) If a 5y bond auction results in the same interest rate as the 7y that had been issued 2 years earlier, they cancel the cusip of the 5y and issue those under the same cusip as the older 7y (because they have the same remaining payments and maturity).  
  
2) An automatic reinvestment gets the same term as the original issue of its cusip, not the term of the reissue of that cusip that you actually bought.  You are treated as if you had bought an existing bond in the third party market, rather than a new bond.  
  
3) The whole time you hold that 5y bond that shares its cusip with a 7y bond, it is listed in your inventory as a 5y bond with that issue date, even though it is really  a 7y bond with an issue date 2 years before you bought it.  So when you enable the automatic reinvestment, it tells you that you are reinvesting a 5y bond and gives you no hint that doing so converts it to 7y.",finance

I pull in roughly $650 a month from my part time job, plus I make $100 passively a month from a company I made.  I have about another $1,200 coming in for money from selling some old stuff. 

I plan on targeting the CC Debt first since it has a higher interest rate. I'm also trying to decide whether I should try to pay off my student loans now or if I should begin an emergency fund/fund investment portfolio. I have been into investing for a while now and have been fairly successful in building a small portfolio, but I worry about the debt accruing with my student loans. My dad got hit hard during the 2008 subprime crisis plus losing his job, which all resulted in him losing much of his retirement funds and adding more debt. That is why I'm trying to have control of my debts and setting myself up for a sustainable future. 

Any ideas or tips will be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Graduate Student trying to figure out what to do with paycheck,"Hello everybody. I am a 22 year old graduate student (in the U.S.) currently pursuing a master degree in computer science. I am working as a teaching assistant and make about $1100 (after tax) biweekly and am interested in what people think I should be doing with my paycheck. The rundown of my accounts and expenses are:

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have about about $10,000 in my bank account.

I invested about $1200 in stocks a few years ago. It is currently worth about $4500 and I am fairly confident my investments will continue to go up for at least the next year so I don't plan to sell anytime soon.

I have a total of $24,000 in student loans from my undergrad degree. The interest rates vary from 3.7% to 4.5%.

I currently pay $15 a month to cover the interest on my loans.

I have no cost to attend school as I am here on a full scholarship so I pay nothing and will take out no new loans while I am here.

I have no rent/ utilites/ food expenses as my grandmother has generously offered to pay for it all until I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I am in a pretty good spot overall so I want to do something with some of my money. I plan to save most of each paycheck but I would like to do something with \~300 or so per paycheck. At first I thought I would just buy a share of SPY each time but I am also considering paying off part of my loans instead. Correct me if i'm wrong, but SPY usually has about 7% gains each year so it would technically be the best option since my loan rates are all less than that, but the benefit of paying off the loan is that it is a guaranteed return whereas SPY is a gamble on how well it does. I was wondering what people would recommend I do. If there is something else I should be doing then please tell me, I am open to suggestions. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,What if you could solve your financial needs without selling crypto?,"People have borrowed money since forever, and this will never change. Credit is a good thing and it drives the economy forward when done responsibly. Everybody wins: borrowers solve their urgent needs or buy things that make them more productive and lenders make profit from interest rates. 

Usually, people use their homes and properties as collateral to get a credit, but it’s a complex process and you end up paying back a huge amount of money. Now, there is a better way: you have crypto. And as a true hodler, you don’t want to sell, especially in a bear market. And you don’t have to: you can use your crypto as collateral to borrow money. After you pay it back, you get your cryptocurrencies back and you won’t need to sell anything. And because lenders have almost no risk of not getting paid and there will be a free market of lenders, the interest rates will be lower than for a traditional credit, while lenders making more profit.

All of this is possible through [INLOCK](https://loan.inlock.io), a lending platform enabling cryptocurrency holders to manage short term liquidity problems by taking out a fiat loan using their existing crypto assets as collateral. This is a win-win situation for borrowers and lenders. As a lender, you have a much lower risk of not getting paid back, and as a borrower, you get a quick credit in fiat currency, with no background checks needed and you pay less overall. You can find a lot of info about how the platform works and why it makes sense on https://loan.inlock.io.

personalfinance,I need advice on whether or not we should sell our house due to high property taxes.,"We bought our home in December of 2016 for 105k. We got a good deal on it at the time, and the market in our area has steadily increased. We could easily sell our home for around 165k right now. 

We love our home and do not want to move. Our issue is our property taxes that keep going up. We currently pay 2.8k a year that is paid monthly with our mortgage. The 2.8k a year is based on a 87k evaluation. Our total mortgage payment right now is $870 a month. On a 100k loan at a 3.75% interest rate. 

Since its an FHA loan our monthly mortgage includes the principal/interest, mortgage insurance, home owners insurance and our property taxes. 

We just got a letter in the mail that our evaulation for 2018 is going up to 115k which will raise our property taxes over $1,000 a year. 

Since the market has gone up we could move over the state line which is around 10 minutes away. It would be a lateral move and we would likely get a similar home using the money made from our current house as a down payment and take out the same 100k loan but pay around 1.8k a year instead of 3.8k a year. 

We would be moving into Michigan which has insane car insurance. We currently pay around $150 for full coverage on 2 vehicles in Ohio, but in Michigan we would be paying around $350. Plus the mortgage interest rate has gone up since we bought our home. 

 We're not sure what the best option is here but paying around 3% a year just in property taxes in a slightly better than average but not great area doesn't seem worth it. It seems like the car insurance and new interest rate in Michigan wouldn't put us very far ahead either.

personalfinance,401k to Roth IRA. Tax withholding incurring 10% additional penalty.,"30yr old male. Got a new job. Trying to convert my 34k 401k money from my old job to my personal Roth account with Schwab.
Filled out the forms and selected 20% federal withholding plus 4.25% state.

Got a call from Schwab rep today and she advised opt out of tax withholding and instead pay taxes when I do tax filing in 2019. Reason: because I am less than 59.5yr and withdrawing triggers additional 10% penalty on the 24.25% (20+4.25) I withheld in taxes. I calculated net net I’ll end up paying 26.7% total in taxes.
I don’t understand why there’s this additional 10% when I chose to withhold the taxes now instead of paying it as part of my income for 2018.

I am assuming and hoping paying the taxes along with 2018 returns will incur less than 26.7%. Anyway I’ll have to come up with quite a big chunk of money from my savings (about $8k) depending on what tax bracket i fall in next year to pay taxes. 

Any suggestions how I can reduce my tax burden? I am thinking of increasing my 401k contribution (currently making 10%) with the new explorer and also contributing extra to my HSA.
Thanks in advance.

Converted 401k money into Roth. Deciding to pay taxes next year instead of withholding today. Worried about next year big tax bill and looking for ways to reduce my tax burden.",finance
personalfinance,Is a Personal Loan a good idea?,"Hi, 
I currently live in Louisiana and have a job that pays ~72k/year. I'm renting an apartment and soon will be renting a house and looking to spend about $1k/month on rent and utilities. I've been paying my parents debts and there's about 5500$ left from that but it is a loan from family that they can ask for it back anytime (and they've been hinting) and i have a personal debt here of about $1500 also from family and credit card debt &lt;$2000.

Now i know i can pay it off slowly and i can afford to do so but I hate taking money from family just because it can make things complicated so I'm looking to take a personal loan of 10k. My credit is not that good (624) and also only 1.5 years old so i don't have many options. I tried to find someone who will prequalify me online and I found Upstart that offered me 10k over 3 years on a 24.65% APR and a $740.90 origination fee (APR includes interest rate and the origination fee). 

Why a personal loan? first it can help boost and diversify my credit for sure and two i can get rid of the family loan and pay off the personal loan in monthly installments. Also there's no prepayment penalty so i can really put any extra cash i have into it and lower my interest rate. 

I'm just a little worried because i've never had any type of loans and i don't really know if it's the right move or not or what to watch out for so any advice would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,What to do with temporary increase in salary,"Hi,

This is my first time posting in this sub. I’m using my phone, so please excuse if the format is not optimal. 

Next year I will have the opportunity to work overseas for six months. I will be paid for 10 to 12 hour work days, 6 to 7 days per week. Also add some bonuses. Colleagues who’ve done this rotation tell me to expect 2 to 3 time my current salary during those six months. 

My current state:

Mid twenties, engaged, STEM field. 

Yearly income: $65,000. 
Putting 7% toward retirement, Roth, 5% employee matching. 
Health insurance: $110/month
After that and taxes, my biweekly check for expenses is $1,000. I keep my savings separated. 
Car payment: $335, still owe $11,300, financed at 0%
Car insurance: $105
Gas: &gt;$320/month (LDR) 
Cellphone: $45
Rent: $400 (moved with roommates two months ago)
Netflix: $10.99
Internet: $50
Utilities: $60
Two federal student loans: currently paying $116 per month combined. 
A) outstanding balance $4,675, 3.15%
B) outstanding balance $4,555, 4.04%

Have one savings account where I put $800 a month, right now I have $5,500 there.
Another one for the wedding where we each put $200/month, now at $5,000.
Both of these are online savings accounts at Discover Bank.

Things I will change:
$30/month for unlimited car washes
Amazon Prime: already canceled
Food: $325 (last 30 days) between groceries, sometimes lunch at work and eating out on weekends. I can and will reduce this. 

$7,500 limit on 8.9% credit card but balance at zero; no cash back Or anything. It is my only CC and it is with my credit union. 

My only other account is a checking account with a local credit union. I’ve read too many bad stories about Wells Fargo and the result is I’m weary of big banks. 

My significant other (SO) lives far away in another state, but close enough that flying is not worth it. SO is a PhD candidate in a place where public transportation is good and reliable enough that a car is not necessary. SO’s income is $26,000. After graduating SO can either go to industry and immediately make six figures. The other option is going for a post doc and go the academia route, which is what SO truly wants, and will probably make six figures but it’ll take longer. 

Now that you have an idea of my present, let me tell you my plans for the short term up to the next two to three years.

2018 Q4: will get married in the courthouse. Will probably shop for a term life insurance (workplace will be in a war zone). Add spouse to car insurance and leave them the car for the six months I’m gone. 

2019 Q4: I will come back October, have a wedding ceremony and reception in November. All the money for the wedding will be taken from savings account we created for this exact purpose. 

2020 Q1: I find a Job in SOs geographic area and hopefully get one with at least my current salary. There are many jobs in the area and I have a competent skill set. Then I move over there. 

2020 Q4 - 2021 Q1: We plan on having our first baby while SO is still in grad school. 

2021 Q2: SO graduates. Maybe we buy a house/condo/townhome in the city of my SOs new workplace, where we will be for the next 5 years. This depending on how things are looking by then. 

For the sake of simplicity, since I don’t know exactly how much I’m going to make,let’s say after tax and all my monthly expenses I come back from the work rotation with $35k.


What do I do with the extra money?

I would like it accessible to put a down payment on a property by summer 2021. Maybe one year after that if having a baby causes my SO to take longer to graduate. 

I plan on paying off my student loans to avoid paying interest. I don’t think I should pay off my car because I’m paying 0% interest, less than inflation. 
The rest I’m thinking of just keeping it in my Discover account which is now making over 1.7% in interest. 
Is this my best course of action? Would it be wiser to put it in a CD? Index funds? Put a lot more towards retirement?

Thank you in advance.",finance

My employer has to contribute to my retirement through payments to the national social security fund. I can't personally put more money into this even if I wanted to.


The economy here is bad, but it's slowly getting better. The inflation is between 7 and 8%.


I got a 20% pay increase after my first contract renewal, and an 11% after my second. My income now is $1000 a month which is middle class. $250 goes to rent, and all my other expenses are about $250. So I can save up to $500 a month.


I'm pretty good at sticking to my budget, I have emergency savings and I would like to get into investing.
However, I can't get buy options or stocks directly, investment options are possible only through intermediary companies. They offer options (Stock exchanges, bonds and mutual funds) with a rate ranging from 2.5% up to around 8% (based on 2017 numbers) for the most agressive one.


I asked a friend, who has better knowledge than me of finances in here, if I should invest in any of these options, and he suggested that it's better that I put my money in a savings account because of the volatility of the options.
I looked around and the best savings account has an interest rate of 5%, which is lower than the inflation.


So for now, all of my savings, around $12k, are in my savings account yielding 5% every 3 months (compound interest).

I don't have a short term goal, such as buying a car or a house. I guess my goal is to live pretty comfortably.


Can you guys see a better investing strategy? Should I diversify and get an agressive investment option? If so, how much should I invest?",finance

BlockChain,"Fake News, Real News or Blockchain News; How to protect future elections from foreign influence!","Fake News, Real News or Blockchain News

Almost two years after the 2016 presidential elections, the country is still dealing with election issues and recriminations from each side. Did the Russians hack the system, was there collusion and if so from which side of the aisle? These discussions provide great political drama, but do they help solve any real-world issues concerning the validity of the ballot box? I think not, for political machinations are always more interesting than solving real life problems.

So, what can we do to circumvent the political issues and start looking for a solution? Undoubtedly, there are a multitude of possibilities out there to help solve this problem, however one promising path that should be explored is securing the election ballot box with blockchain technology. Kevin C. Desouza of the Brookings Institute believes that blockchain technology can ensure trace-ability ""so that every transaction is vetted and there is permanency of record and no ability for a single entity to manipulate the record."" Based upon this view and the real possibilities of using blockchain technology, we would have to figure out what proof algorithms could secure the validity of each vote.

It would seem to me that Proof of Elapsed Time protocol (PoET) could be one such answer. Proof of Elapsed Time was designed as a ‘fair’ consensus model’ and focuses on efficiency and revolves around the concept of distributed leader elections across the largest possible amount of network participants. As such, to control (or lead) the chain, one must invest large sums of time and money. This would allow it to be secured on a federal basis while be validated across the spectrum. Furthermore, all participants on the chain would need to verify the leader who was selected in a legitimate manner. Thus, only legitimate votes would be counted as they would have to be widely and independently verified instead of sitting in one centralized location and thus be open to tampering.

While the model itself would need to be researched in great depth and built in a agreed upon and secure manner, there is no doubt in my mind that a PoET based election algorithm could help secure our elections and diminish our arguments over validity in the years to come.",cryptocurrency

Say my wife and I want to buy a $400,000 place from her parents. We can do this by putting down $50,000 and take out a $350,000 zero-interest mortgage from her parents.

My wife’s parents would be gifting us $350,000 x IRS minimum interest rate (AFR) of ~2.5%, or $8,750 a year, which is well below the $60,000 a year they can gift to the both of us tax-free ($15,000 from her dad and her mom each to me and to her each). We then gift back an amount equal to a 3% interest rate, or $10,500 a year, which is again well below the tax-free gift limit we can give to them. This way her parents get tax-free returns, and we can still claim standard deduction of $24,000.

1) How is the total payout calculated here?

There was no mention of amortized payment amounts or anything... just a lump payment of $16,784 at the end of the loan maturity period (3 years).  I'm calculating something much less... if the 5% just compounds annually, I calculate 12,500\*(1.05)\^3 = $14,470.31 

Is there something I am not calculating correctly?

2)  Is 5% a good interest rate for a subordinated debt?  

My understanding is that a subordinated debt should have a high yield but not sure what high is.  

&amp;#x200B;

3)  Is there such a thing as ""preferred"" subordinated debt? 

I saw in one form the debt investment was described as ""preferred"" but in most other mentions its referred to as ""subordinated"" debt.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Are there any red-flags to watch out for when investing ""subordinated"" debt?

personalfinance,Scam call today - but they called my employer,"Not sure if there’s anything that I can do, but looking for advice on potential ways to get these guys. Received a call on my cell phone from a blocked number. I didn’t answer. Message gave the standard “this is a process server and we’ve tried serving you at xxx (listed my address) next we will be going to xxx (listed my work address) then gave me a number to call back with a case number. I ignored it, because I know how these work. An hour later, I get a call from our HR manager. He said that our director of employee relations received a call from this same person saying that they needed to serve me and to see if I could be served at work. 

At this point I get a little nervous. I’ve never had a scammer actually call my employer. I call them back later, they say they don’t know the person who called me, but he is with xxx named a law firm and gave me his number. He said he was a paralegal with the firm and the person who called me must have been the server. He said I was being sued for defaulting on a credit card in 2015 for $2,500. He named a credit card I think I may have had many many years ago, which would be past any type of statue of limitations and definitely never had a credit limit high enough for me to default that much. Also, my credit report is clean and we got a mortgage in 2016 so I’m pretty sure I couldn’t have done that if I defaulted in 2015. I told him all of this. He agrees that my credit was great and started reading off who had my mortgage and who we originally got it from. Basically reading info from my credit report I guess. I told him he needed to give me the account number he said that I was in default for. He started talking over me and reading addresses and things from my report. I repeated myself and he got pretty angry and raised his voice. I continued asking for the account number and he finally said that they would just serve me and good luck, so I hung up. 

I usually ignore these types of calls, but they called my freaking employer. A place I’ve worked 8 years and worked very hard to develop a strong, professional reputation. I’m sure they used a spoofed number and gave a fake name but I can’t let them get Away with this. Is there anything that can be done? Or any advice for someone in my situation?",finance
personalfinance,21 years old and I'm deep underwater.,"As the title said guys, I'm 21 and I got myself into a massive pile of debt with a Harley Davidson. In Feburary, I managed to get one for around 16k, It was a 2016, with 500 miles, I didn't realize how much I got ripped off at the time, and also this is at a 16.35% interest rate, which I found out is absurdly high. My payments were about $375 a month. And then August rolled around... and I still had 15k owed on the bike and found out the bike was worth like only 7k

Early last month I went back to the dealership, I was thinking maybe I can try and balance this out, where I wouldn't be underwater. Maybe get a new bike, that holds it's worth a lot more than my 2016. And stupid me, that's exactly what I did.

I dug myself in this hole where I now have this 2018 FXLR Lowrider and I owe almost 19k on it. I didn't realize that the excess money that I didn't pay off on my first bike would roll over onto my new bike. I'm willing to not even have transportation anymore, I just want to figure out what's the smartest way to get out of this situation. I don't want to be into my late 20's barely surviving because of the $400 payments I have on my bike, plus the 120 for insurance!

I only work 20 hours a week as an assistant manager making $10 an hour, and I commute pretty far to school and all spare money I have goes to gas money to make it to school. Meaning, I can't pay any extra than the minimum payment as it's just about $400.

Going down the road today on my way home and I get a phone call; caller ID says its my bank, USAA. I answer and this nice young man and I had the following conversation:


THIEF: Mr Sumo, this is USAA's fraud department. Have you just attempted to make a $1000 purchase in a Target in Denver?

ME: Ummm... nope. I'm literally in Texas right this minute, so no.

THIEF: OK, sir, I'm going to quickly authenticate you with our system. You're going to be getting a text message from us with a PIN, I need for you to read that to me.

(I get a text message from USAA, my phone recognizes them from previous security checks, so I think I'm good, right? Nope.)

ME: I read the PIN

THIEF: OK, thank you.... hang on my computer is being slow....  


We had a little more conversation but here's the gist of this: While he was calling me, his buddy in the next room was on the phone with the real USAA telling them that he needed the account PW reset. They, of course, sent a two-factor authentication PIN to my phone. I read that PIN off to my guy, who fed the other guy and BOOM, they were in. Clever girl.


Before I could pull over to handle this I had a flurry of emails from the bank in my mailbox:


- Your account PW was changed.
- Your account name was changed.
- Your security questions were changed.
- You added Joes Blower as a payee (the literal name they used!)
- You transferred XYZ to Joes Blower (this one repeated for several attempts)


Understand that I work professionally with computers and am super skeptical about most things. I stay up to date on scams and security. My radar was up the entire time I was chatting with him and I STILL walked into it. From my POV this was the real deal.

The part that I missed, and the part I want to convey... Large companies like this will almost NEVER call and start asking you for info. What I SHOULD have done was this: As soon as he mentioned the Target transaction, I should have said thank-you and hung up, then looked up the number for USAA's fraud and called them. I thought this was them, I fell for it.

The credit union is already working on returning the cash. Because these guys didn't try transactions here in TX the bank shut things down pretty good and the thieves only got a few hundred. I'll get that back. But now I've got a shiney new login that I have to use and worries about what info they might have seen while in there. Yay! Plus, USAA is sending me one of their nice two-factor key fobs that would have stopped this.

Strangely enough I just read a few weeks ago that SMS PIN's were hackable. I thought the article meant that you could hack them electronically. I never expected a literal man-in-the-middle attack!!",finance

Current Situation:
- 22 years old, wrapping up last semester of undergrad as a computer engineering major
- $70k job offer lined up for when I graduate in December (still applying for better opportunities)
- Working part time right now earning $800/month (not too many hours to focus on school)

Current Financial Situation:
- Credit Card Debt: $6k where $2k of that is currently on a 0% APR card whose grace period ends in March 2019.
- Student Loans: $5.5k federal subsidized loan
- Bank Account: $7.5k, ideally want to pay off $4k of my CC debt but want to figure out my car situation first
- Bills: $70 cellphone, $10 Netflix, $5, Spotify, and of course my CC payments

Current Car:
- 2006 Scion tC with 170k miles, an expired inspection since February (it would fail emissions in NJ due to a bad catalytic converter), leaking gasket, mechanics have told me to try to get rid of it soon

Additional Notes:
If I end up with the job I’ve verbally accepted, I would have to move and rent for around $1.2-1.5k a month. Plus I know more expenses for utilities, etc. I’m interested in buying (also open to leasing) a 2018 Honda Accord Sport 1.5T. This would come out to be around $25k OTD if financing. I know the goal should be zero debt, but I also feel that getting this car now could be manageable. Thank you in advance to those who read this.",finance
personalfinance,What are some extremely low-risk investments that I'll be minimally penalized for withdrawing from?,"Basically, I'm looking for an alternative to a savings account. I don't want to put my money in there and have it lose value over time due to inflation. 

My Roth IRA is too high risk, as the market could dip any time and if I have to pull the money from there, obviously I'm massively screwing myself over. So I'm looking for somewhere to periodically put money that I can draw from, if needed, without being heavily penalized or having to pay an arm and a leg in taxes, that will also earn me at least some return so that I can keep up with inflation and then some.

The one idea I have is government (or perhaps corporate) bonds, although from what I see, you need to pay federal income tax on the interest earned, if I understand it correctly, and you also have to wait at least 1 year before you can cash in the bond, so I'm not sure how that would work if I'm periodically investing in bonds like I'd like to.

I currently have no savings account e-Fund. I've recently started investing 15% of all paychecks into my Roth IRA. I'm considering changing things up and investing 10% into the Roth IRA and 5% into some sort of savings account alternative. Also, I'm pretty sure my bank charges me for each time I transfer money from the checking account (where paychecks are auto-deposited) into savings, which complicates things even if I wanted to put money in there. Any suggestions?

personalfinance,Auto Loan Hacking Tips from A Military Financial Specialist,"One of my sailors comes up to me the other day in regard to a very  large amount of back-pay that they would be receiving. They were eager  to tell me that they were waiting to buy their car until this back-pay  was received so that they could buy their car without taking out a loan.  They looked at me with the expectation of praise for their thriftiness  and self-discipline. They were not ready when I told them “That’s a  terrible idea!”

A junior sailor described the following dilemma to a group of senior  peers: “So I have saved 7 thousand dollars. I want to buy a car but I  want to finance 2-3 thousand at most. What kind of car should I buy?” I  quietly shook my head in dismay as the council of advisors took turns  describing what they thought was the most reliable and luxurious  combination of make, model, year, and mileage that our junior sailor  could purchase for between 5 and 10 thousand dollars. Nobody in the room  took exception to the fact that the Junior Sailor was choosing to  purchase a car through dumping all of her savings. When it came to my  turn to give advice, everyone seemed slightly confounded when I said “I  don’t care what kind of car you buy, but I strongly encourage you to  reconsider buying it with cash!”

Why are people so afraid of debt? In business school we analyzed  company balance sheets all of the time, and all companies carried large  amounts of debt that they allotted money to pay down and make interest  payments on. Individuals and families should look at themselves the same  way as businesses do. If you can make a profit on borrowed money, do  so! Auto-loans are perhaps the cheapest source of capital available. A  few years ago a friend of mine got a large auto loan from USAA at 0%  interest due to some special program they were running.

“But how do I make money on an auto-loan” you might ask, “When the  entire amount will be tied to a corresponding depreciating asset?”

The answer is opportunity cost! If a sailor has $10,000 and they use  it to purchase a car, the amount that they are saving is the interest  rate for the auto loan, lets estimate high at 4%. Congratulations! You  barely made money after accounting for inflation! You saved $400 in your  first year. However, if you borrowed $10,000 at 4% interest rate, and  invested your 10k of cash into your TSP/Roth IRA and made 8% return on  the investment, you just spent 400$ on interest charges on your car, but  made 800$ of investment profit, or netted 400$. When you factor in the  diminishing costs of financing your car as you pay your principle down,  and the compounding of returns of your investment profits, you can see  how not being afraid of debt is a crucial factor in significant lifetime  wealth generation.

Some additional pro-tips:

\-By holding onto your cash or putting it into a retirement account,  you can satisfy bank requirements for cash reserves when making real  estate purchases.  
 \-Want to get some extra working capital out of a car deal? Strike a deal  with the salesman that you want 5k cash back as part of the deal. The  car will cost you 5k more, but you’ll leave carrying cash at the very  low interest rate offered only by auto-loans, which you can turn around  and pay down more expensive debt with, or invest at a profit! (you’ll  still have to be somewhat close to the car’s actual value after a cash  out deal for the bank to approve the loan, but there’s more wiggle room  here than you might suspect)

I am aware that advising young people to borrow money to meet their  needs is not always in their best interests. An E-3 buying a 2018 Camaro  at 11% interest is one of the greatest recurring travesties of military  society. My advice in this column is to the people who reached this  site and who have the disciplined financial wherewithal to save a large  cash stockpile. It is my mission to open minds to the kind of powerful  financial practices that lead beyond solvency to the development of  generational wealth.

personalfinance,Suggestion For A Guy Who Made Bad Finance Choices,"Ok, So I need a bit of advice from you all. I'm 27 with a wife, a kid and another one on the way. I make around $70k in North Carolina. Seems good right? Well my dilemma is that I made a few bad choices in the past when buying cars. Bought a 2006 Nissan Sentra that was a lemon, I got completely screwed over. A year later I bought a brand new 2012 Nissan Sentra and traded that in for a 2008 350z literally 6 months later. I kept the 350Z for 2 years and then traded that in for my current car which I bought brand new in 2015, which is a 2015 Toyota Prius. I've had the Prius for 3 years and I have no intention on getting rid of it at all. BUT with being upside down on multiple cars I owe about $25K left on the Prius and my car payments are $650 a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive learned my lesson about continuously buying cars, but I want to know should I just keep paying the $650 for the Prius for another 3 years until it's paid off or should I refinance it to maybe a lower monthly payment? My interest rate for my loan is 6.90%. While I CAN afford to make the $650 payments (Ive been making them for 3 years already) would it be better to lower my payments and just pay a little bit more or should I suck it up and keep making the high payments? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Original loan was 6 years. 3 years left on the rest of a $25K loan, paying $650 a month @ 6.90% interest for a 2015 Prius.  Should I refinance or suck it up? Any other advice is appreciated too.

So, pixel art isn't exactly easy to reproduce and speaking at the level of complex 2D fighting games sprites, what can be done?

There are available thousands of characters spritesheets and thousands of thousands of individual sprites. If those resources were to be cataloged with tags and fed to a system, what could be achieved?

Going even further, if those sprites were splitted into body parts like heads, arms, legs and properly tagged, could a technique like frankenspriting be reproduced? Would it be useful for precise recognition of such parts location in already created sprites?

personalfinance,"New job offer in a new state. Looking for advice on expected costs, massive lease-breaking fee, and moving 401K","Hello hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

Quick run down of situation: After college I took a $55K job in a new state. First offer I got, and I needed it to pay loans. Between $1200 rent, new car payments (\~315) and student loan payments (a lot), I end up netting around $300 a month savings (not counting 401K contributions). Not ideal. Loans suck. Paid a little too much on car, but at least I can afford it. Rent is a lot for living alone. Fast forward 1 year and now that I have some experience on my resume, start applying for jobs back in my home state. I don't like the new location, and miss friends and family. Fast forward another 14 months. I finally got an offer for a job, in an ideal location, with a small bump up to $58K. Finally get to move back and am thrilled. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sooo 1 career question for you, then a couple of the personal finance ones:

&amp;#x200B;

1) I got the offer letter via email Friday. I printed it, signed it, scanned it, and emailed it back to them mid day. Haven't gotten a response from that email yet, but I plan on giving my 2 weeks notice on Monday. I am safe to do this right? I am super paranoid about something suddenly going wrong after the fact and ending up completely screwed.

&amp;#x200B;

now the PF questions,

2) 401K- I have a 401K through my current company, with Fidelity. To be honest I have no idea what is in there. I basically set contributions to get the max match, and just let it be. Now with me switching jobs, what do I need to do with this 401K? My understanding is that I am 100% vested at my current company. New company will match some as well. Vesting is less generous, and basically goes up 20% a year over 5 years, but I plan on sticking with the position long term. So can I just role my current 401K into that plan? What is the easiest way to transition?

&amp;#x200B;

3) Lease breaking- So my current lease is Aug 1st - August 1st. Which means I'm a couple months in, and have to break it to accept this job. It is what it is. I've been applying for 14 months or so with mixed results, so I didn't really have much choice but to renew. All that being said, when I dropped by the leasing office and spoke to property manager, she said that breaking the lease would cost me 3 full months rent. So we are talking $3.6K, offset by my deposit (which was only 500 or so) I guess. Sooo this is abysmal. I was expecting 2 months, and was going to eat the cost, but 3 months just seems crazy to me. Is this at all normal? She said I could try subletting, but I don't really know anyone I'd feel comfortable doing that with, so probably will just have to eat the cost. But really sucks. If people have any suggestions I'd love to hear. Reading through my lease, I don't really see anything about lease breaking, outside of the normal ""do something bad and we can break it"" clauses. There is a 60 day notice required if I do not intend to renew my lease when that time comes, but that is a different issue as well. But yeah I don't see anything about having to break it early, and this cost will suck. I have $20K in the bank, so cash flow wise, I can survive it while still taking care of moving costs and down payments on new apartment, but it really blows. I was hoping to use the savings to pay off the remaining $11K on my car after moving, but now I will need to re-build safety net first.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Anything else I should be thinking about? Medical plan wise, I am still on my parents, so shouldn't have to deal with that headache, although I may enroll at new position now that I have a long term one. Rent wise, I will have a roommate that is a high school buddy now, we have an appointment next weekend to check out the place we want. Rent expenses should be about the same I'm paying now, but now I'll be able to split 60-40 with a roommate, so will save an extra 400-600 a month or so depending on how utilities pan out, but am in a position where if he runs into trouble I can still technically afford the full rent myself. I cancelled my Plant Fitness membership today, so that auto pay should stop (although I've heard some bad stories and will be making sure)... I need to cancel my utilities (electric and internet) up here, and start them in new apartment... Have to convert drivers license &amp; car registration, although my current registration is good through June so I might just wait until then to do so, if it won't get me into trouble. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah. Am I missing anything? Just a stressful logistical headache, and want to make sure I get over the hump as smooth as possible. I'm sitting on 70K is debt, just to throw that into the discussion. $11K or so on car, $25K private student loans, $35K ish federal. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,How do people actually pay for college?,"A little bit of background: After many hiccups and scares about actually being able to go to college, I can proudly say I'm currently in my freshman year at university. I've worked summer jobs 3 years since I  was 13, and I had a full year job for the last year of my high school career. All of that time and money has equaled about $9,000, during my time in high school I had other expenses too, such as a car and insurance, and general expenses like a girlfriend (very costly)! Unfortunately in the end it didnt work out but anyways my first bill is due by October and its about $10,000. I was able to get a couple of scholarships to bring my cost down to about $8,500. So this means that essentially 3 summers and a full year of work, plus just the overall money I've earned in my life, is all being spent for a single semester at school. My family's income is just high enough to avoid federal funding but they're unwilling to pay for any of it because for one they don't agree with my decision, and they don't have the money themselves. As an 18 year old I don't have any credit history, therefore can't get any money through loans, and my parents aren't willing to assist me with this.

The small claims court deferred the judgement to the federal bankruptcy court, (or something, they deferred, I know that.) IIRC, the date on his bankruptcy filing was after the date he received my court appearance letter. That's why I think he filed bankruptcy to avoid paying me, (the amount is less than $600.00.)

CryptoCurrency,Stablecoin based on demurrage?,"It seems like stablecoins aiming to peg themselves to, say, USD essentially fall into three approaches:

1. Centralized currency board maintaining 1:1 link with fiat, like in TrueUSD or Tether. This obviously works as long as you trust the centralized party, and is the most reliable way to peg real world currencies like the HKD to the USD.
2. Collateralized debt with reserves denominated in virtual assets, like Dai
3. Algorithmic central bank, like Basis, with no concept of reserves. Basically tries to be the Fed except implemented as a smart contract.

It's often claimed that algorithmic central banks are the most flexible since black swan crashes in asset backings do not cause issues, and they can theoretically target any exchange rate with anything, including things like baskets of goods. (Aside: I find this highly suspect. Taken to the logical extreme Basis can target a perfectly oscillating sine wave of prices so that everybody can buy low and sell high and get free money, which is obviously false. I am not really knowledgeable enough to know where exactly the argument that anything can be targeted fails though)

The main problem with algorithmic central banks seems to be that without reserves, it's hard to defend a peg when the market price of the coin drops. When the price is higher than the peg the smart contract can simply give everybody helicopter money to drop the price, but if the price is too low there's little that can be done. Basis claims that selling discounted bonds payable only if the peg is restored somehow fixes this, but I remain skeptical --- it seems to imply Venezuela can somehow borrow its way out of hyperinflation using cleverly designed bonds, which seems absurd.

However, I wonder whether or not there's an obviously robust solution to fixing algorithmic-central-bank stablecoins --- *demurrage*, basically a negative interest rate. Imagine I make a stablecoin called PUSD, for Perishable USD, as a token with an algorithmic central bank running on an Ethereum smart contract. Like with any other algorithmic central bank, we print helicopter money if the price (based on some median of oracles) is too high.

However, every year 5% of every PUSD account balance disappears into thin air. Essentially, this means there will always be demand for *freshly printed* PUSD. Even if everybody dumps PUSD and the price tanks, eventually the dumped pile will get exponentially small, so that eventually PUSD becomes scarce and the tiny number of ""survivors"" still wanting to get PUSD must pay 1 USD again. This creates a market expectation that PUSD will always go back to 1 USD, which should prevent price crashes in the first place. PUSD will behave sorta like a fixed production cost perishable good like milk: milk prices won't ever crash significantly under the cost of production. 

Obviously, due to the demurrage nobody would prefer to hold PUSD rather than USD, but for applications like hedging risk in crypto-only exchanges, or having a reasonable store-of-value for people living in places like Venezuela, 5% a year might not be too big of a negative interest rate to bear. Perhaps this percentage can be made much smaller and we'd still have a stable currency.

Is there any idea like PUSD floating out there? It seems like quite an obvious way of fixing the problems with algorithmic central banks, at the cost of course of imposing this carrying cost that makes it strictly worse than fiat for people who can use fiat conveniently. Is there some ""duh!"" gotcha I am missing here?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Making estimated tax payments instead of withholding... Pitfalls?,"To avoid the underpayment penalty, I'm aiming to get 110% of last year's tax bill withheld. However, I haven't figured out how to make my employer withhold the correct amount of tax (without getting into details, let's say that getting the numbers right has been hard, and that withholding calculators have been disappointing). This year, every quarter I've been reviewing the taxes paid and re-adjusting the withholdings, only to have to re-adjust them the next review. Today, I just gave up and submitted a W-4 sending almost all my paycheck to the feds until I hit the 110% target. For my sanity's sake, I'm considering an alternative for next year:

Let's say that my target payment is 160k, so quarterly payments are $40k. Before April 15th (or whenever the due date is), I check how much has been withheld. If less than 40k, I submit the difference. Then, near June 15th, I check again, and if I have paid less than 80k total, submit the difference again. And so on, until we hit the 160k on Jan 15th. If I miss some deadline, I just fall back to the current strategy of bumping up the withholdings. Bonus, if I pay the difference with a high rewards credit card, I can get back some points.

This seems too easy, which makes me think I don't understand how the estimated payments work. Assuming that coming up with the funds by the deadlines is not a problem, what pitfalls do you see? What am I missing?

EDIT: yes, I know one can get a fixed additional amount deducted from each paycheck. That's what I've been doing, but because of the details I'd rather not go into right now (I don't want to derail my own question), doing so has been an exercise in frustration to be repeated multiple times per year. I believe my proposed scheme would be far less frustrating, what i don't know i is if it would work. Thanks for the comments in this regard, though.",finance

personalfinance,Unsure how to proceed...,"Hi /r/personalfinance

I've been reading a bunch of posts here this evening and they have all been very helpful, though I wanted to voice my own situation to see what the ideal improvements to be made would be.

I'm currently:

-27y/o

-No student loan debt (parents paid for my Bachelor's Degree because they are truly phenomenal people)

-Make $81k/yr pre-tax

-Own a home with a mortgage of $1300/mo ($450 HOA fee, but my girlfriend pays that since I cover the mortgage so it is not included here, purchased about 1.5 years ago)

-Car payment+insurance of $450/mo

-Utilities/Phone/Etc... of $250-$300/mo

-401k with $21.5k saved (I contribute 6% currently and my employer matches $0.50 per dollar up to 6% which is why it is currently set as such)

-$91.5k in liquid (checking/savings accounts)

Pretty much everything else monthly goes towards these two accounts, as I do not drink/smoke or anything and am mostly a homebody.

As you can see, I have a lot of money doing absolutely nothing for me right now (interest rate is laughable on these accounts). I feel as though this is a good amount of money to ""have"", but I'm obviously wasting it by not having it invested further.

At this point, should I contact a company/group such as Schwab or something to really begin to invest? I harbor a serious mental block when it comes to money, it led to me needing therapy (seriously) when I was younger because it monopolized and terrified me to not have enough money. Due to this, I fear to lose any dollar that I earn so I have been foolishly stashing it away where I can always watch it.

I've moved fairly well through my company, two and a half years ago I began with them making $59k and have been given multiple promotions/raises as a result of my work, so my situation was constantly in a flux, though I continued to live as simply as possible to ""save"" as much as possible as it did.

What amount would you suggest that I begin by investing with a company like Schwab? Of that $91.5k, I obviously don't need nearly that much readily available while I have a steady income, so I feel as though at least $50k of it should be put somewhere, but is that enough/too much? 

I apologize in advance, I know these kinds of questions are overdone here, though I appreciate the wealth of knowledge that I am sure is forthcoming.

Thanks in advance!",finance
cardano,Cardano ELI5|Bullet point format,"**Introduction**


* Cardano is an open source project that began in 2015, which wants to change the way crypto-currencies are designed and developed.
* The main focus is to make a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem which can equally understand the needs of the users while being able to integrate into different information systems.
* Cardano learns from the 1000 altcoins before it and has a high emphasis on research.
* **Sojourn's End-**  There are two collections of protocols. 1. a provably secure proof of stake based crypto-currency called the Cardano Settlement Layer(CSL) 2. Cardano Computation Layer(CCL).
* **Social Element of Money-** There are always disagreements about philosophy, monetary policy, or even just between the core developers lead to fragmentation and forks. The cardano settlement layer will have a layer on top to handle all these issues. Cardano will propose hard and soft forks to vote on.
* **Scripting-** Scripting of smart contracts can be done unlike bitcoin. Plutus is a general purpose smart contract language and can be used for DSL inter-operability.
* **Sidechains-**  Cardano will have the feature of sidechains in the future called KMZ sidechains.
* **Signatures-** Signatures are needed to securely move value from one person to another. Cardano is interested in integrating quantum computer resistant signatures, which cannot be solved even when brute forced by a quantum computer.
* **User Issued Assets(UIAS)-** Just like how the ethereum network has an ERC-20 standard for creating tokens, users can issue assets in cardano. One alleged drawback in ethereum is that all transaction cost must be paid in ether. This will not be the case in cardano.
* **Scalability-** Scalability is achieved in most crypto-currencies by adding more number of nodes to deal with the incoming transactions. All nodes must have the copy of the blockchain and also all nodes are not active as generally they are randomly selected while the rest sit idle. Ouroborus, a delegated proof-of-stake consensus, selects a group of nodes which have the responsibility of maintaining the network for a period of time. This can accommodate the needs of large corporations such as Facebook and Google.
* **Cardano Computation Layer(CCL)-** The problem in crypto-currencies or anything decentralized is that it can be used for wrong purposes such as trafficking child pornography or selling government secrets. There is no way to stop this but Cardano Computation Layer requires consensus node to willing to include these transactions in these blocks. This can help protect the users.


**Interoperability**


* **The Grand Myopia-** There is a need for an unbiased judge, an uncaring digital judge which perfectly executes according to a constitution. The problem occurs when we want to mix this new fintech with the traditional financial systems. Land can be tokenized but can't be enforced to be given by technology. There is no way to ensure the transfer of a gold bar cannot happen by itself.
* **Legacy-** There is a need to upgrade fintech to new technology and not be stuck with the old. Many banks still use backends using  COBOL. The problem is there is no bridge to move from old system to new systems. Cardano believes there are 3 main concerns that have to be addressed.
Representation of information and belief in its accuracy.
Representation of value and its associated ownership.
Representation of entities and, a particular user’s alongside the aggregate level of trust in such entities.
* Tokenized assets must also be actualized in legacy applications. If Tom has a token of land and sells it on SwitchMyCrypto and if they have not updated to the new ledger there should not be a problem.
* **CryptoCurrency Interoperability-**  This problem is easier solved than the legacy one. Each Distributed ledger has its own protocols and standards which can be quantified. It is a question of converting and translating messages. Plutus can be used for interoperability scripts.
* **Maze of Daedalus-** The question is, what about the interoperability to something that Cardano does not provide? Should that be out of the scope? They have decided to experiment with this paradigm by deploying our reference wallet’s front end on Electron. It is an open source project maintained by Github that combines both Node and Chrome together. Cardano’s build of Electron is called Daedalus. This allows developers to use JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 to build their applications to bridge any need gaps in interoperability.


**Regulation**


* The truth is all financial systems when big enough require regulation or at least there emerges a desire for regulation. Cardano has chosen to divide between individual rights and the rights of a marketplace. Individuals should have sole access to their funds.
* Cardano knows that in the future users will have to send metadata(data about the transaction) to Tax Officials or other government authorities. But this should only be done with the consent of the user.
* As the blockchain is immutable, has timestamping and provides auditability some metadata should be posted to the blockchain. The question arises how much should be posted and how much would just be bloat.
* Daedalus will support over the next 12 months a large array of features to label transactions and financial activity. These metadata can be exported and shared on demand with whoever the user deems necessary. Furthermore, the data can be operated on by three party applications for domain-specific purposes (for example, tax accounting).
* Cardano is also experimenting with some fields being encrypted so the metadata would not be revealed publicly.
* **Marketplace DAOs-** Smart contracts can be used to create a commercial system using self- enforcing and free of ambiguity code. These smart contracts where there is a deterministic relationship are called marketplace DAOs. There is no need to create a new protocol or any mutability in the ledger. Regulation is done directly by the code and enforced by the code.

**ADA coin**

* Total ADA = 45,000,000,000
* 25,927,070,538 Ada were sold at launch
* 25,927,070,538 Ada were sold at the ICO
* This make amount is circulation equal to 31,112,484,646 ADA.
* The remaining Ada, 13,887,515,354, will be issued after the launch through minting.


**Additional Notes/Updates**

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin ""is more typical of a precious metal"" - Satoshi Nakamoto","From Satoshi's response in this [thread](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source)

""It is a global distributed database, with additions to the database by consent of the majority, based on a set of rules they follow:

- Whenever someone finds proof-of-work to generate a block, they get some new coins
- The proof-of-work difficulty is adjusted every two weeks to target an average of 6 blocks per hour (for the whole network)
- The coins given per block is cut in half every 4 years

You could say coins are issued by the majority. They are issued in a limited, predetermined amount.

As an example, if there are 1000 nodes, and 6 get coins each hour, it would likely take a week before you get anything.

To Sepp's question, indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.

**In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal**. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.""

We've lived together for five years in a duplex in a location we really like, but it's starting to feel cramped and we need more space. We aren't planning on having kids or anything, just for ourselves. 

So we have a chunk of money from our wedding that could be 3-5% down on a house (we would leave some for closing costs) and know our price range. We have looked at 7 or 8 homes and all of them have been totally wrong except this one that seems perfect. The thing in our neighborhood is it's high demand, but the houses are extremely old.. you either get nice house top of our price range, or disgusting house top of the price range, or disgusting house bottom price range. One house we saw is in a great location, has features that are good for what we need, and is actually sort of modern with updated windows and roof. We plan to stay a long time.

So we want to put in an offer but it's also scary. If we do this it will probably cost 500 more than what we pay in rent each month.. we can do it but we will not have much room for saving. We have student loans, car payments, etc. Our jobs are very stable so no worries there.

I guess all this really just leads to my question.. should we buy a house with a low down payment, pay the PMI and a higher payment until we hit that 20%? Or should we save for a year or two and hope interest stays the same or goes down? My dad's friend does mortgages and said that at the moment interest rates are going up and if we wait a while the extra interest we paid might be more than what pmi costs in a month.

All this background is to get an idea on what opinions are to do with this car. Should I:

1. Keep it and make regular payments until paid off and hope nothing goes wrong with the car?
2. Trade it in for a newer vehicle and take the rollover onto the new loan?

I finally have $10,000 saved. So, I want my money to earn more interest than it currently is sitting in my US Bank regular savings account. My plan is to open the Marcus account with $5,000 at 1.9% and deposit at least $100 per month. I earn around $20,000 per year from wages. I didn't understand the W-4 when I filled it out two years ago with my current employer, so I didn't get any Federal tax return this year and wound up owing a small amount for both Federal and State. So, I'm trying to avoid an unpleasant surprise like that again. I'm trying to create a better financial future for myself, but I struggle with understanding finance rules and strategies.",finance
solar,Roughly how much did I overpay? 7KW system in MA.,"Before I start I want to apologize if this type of post is annoying.  I searched /r/solar but couldn't find what I was looking for and I think my post has the potential to help other solar newbies.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I recently went live with a 7KW system in MA for $30,000 (i'm not factoring in Fed and state refund).   I admit I did not do enough research before purchasing the system.  I was vaguely aware I could get an equivalent system for much less if I was to buy the panels and inverter wholesale and then hire a contractor myself to do the install, but I was lazy and decided to ""trust"" the sales person with the idea that I was still going to save money and help the environment in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the details:

Panels: 24 x Hanwha qcell 295W

Inverter: SolarEdge HDWave.   I believe this has a max output of 6KW which I find a little confusing since I purchased a 7KW system.  From what I read this is not that uncommon and is sort of the equivalent to ""overclocking"" a CPU.

&amp;#x200B;

Those panels average about $225 each.  So 24 of those plus shipping is roughly $5750.   I estimate the inverter and other accessories to be about $2000.   So that's $7,750.   Let's round up to $10,000 just because I don't know if I'm missing other parts I would need.   Then let's say the install is $10,000.   That's a total of $20,000.   What the heck did the extra $10,000 get me?  Was it just for an overpriced support contract with Sunnova?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:   Thanks for all the replies!  I wish I had posted this before purchasing.  I do want to add that i'm getting a 25 year warranty through Sunnova that covers any potential damage to the home, panels, and inverter as well as 24/7 monitoring of the system production, so it's not just a manufacturers warranty.  Is that really worth the money?  I'm not sure, I guess time will tell.  My gut says if the install was done well in the first place you really don't need an extra warranty or monitoring service as you can do that yourself, but I guess it does give you some peace of mind.  I'm not sure how other companies support/warranty contracts work.  On the positive side, the system was up and running fairly quickly and i'm happy with the install.   I'll still save money in the long run.

personalfinance,Should I transfer my credit card balance once a year?,"Right now I owe about $1,000 on my credit card at 25% interest rate. I try to pay off about $50 a month but it seems like a big chunk of that money just go straight to paying the interest rate instead. I recently opened a checking account at a local credit union and they offered me a credit card with no annual fee. They said that if I have another credit card debt I can do a balance transfer it to this card there is only a 3% fee and there will be 0% interest rate for the first year. After that the interest rate is only 15%. 

&amp;#x200B;

That sounds like a really good deal and I'm thinking about making a balance transfer since 25% interest on my old card is a lot. I want to ask whether I can do another balance transfer after the first year when the 0% interest rate is over back to the old credit card and get another year of 0% interest? That would be nice because then I will be able to pay the debt off without interest but I'm not sure if it's possible.",finance

personalfinance,"Husband's student loans - thought we paid off, but no...","So, husband and I worked really hard to pay off his federal student loans two years ago, around the time we had a kid. His loan servicer was NelNet, which had 6 loans in total, $44k altogether I think. We did it through the NelNet website, paid them all off over several months, huge sigh of relief. 

Fast forward to January 2018, his mom calls and says ""hey, we've been getting mail about this loan. I've been paying the interest, but want to transfer it over to you."" Mails us a statement - it's a $10k private loan from Wells Fargo that he has no memory of taking out. There's no info on the statement about what year of school that loan was for, nothing he can figure out, no record of who signed up for the loan (him or parents). Admittedly, he did not keep exhaustive records of his student aid at the time. So, we logged on to the NSLDS to check his loan status there, and find another federal loan, about $3.7K, that wasn't through NelNet, and we don't recall seeing when we were doing the great pay-down two years ago. As far as we can tell, that one has never sent any communication about repayment, and he graduated from undergrad in 2011! 

We're really confused, worried his parents have been keeping mail from him, and want to make sure we don't take a hit for this. We both have credit scores in the 780s right now. We can pay off the loans, but he wants to make sure everything is on the up and up. What kind of steps should we take? Should we reach out to Wells Fargo about the private loan for more info / proof? Would settling be an option for that one? How do we strategize to make that happen? What about the other federal loan? Can we reach out to his undergrad institution for his full aid information?

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt Consolidation-Law Student,"Hi All,

I am a law student in my final year. I have a mid-six figure job lined up post graduation, starting 12 months from now. I currently am living off my summer savings and student loans, but I have a 18.5% interest rate credit card with about 15k in debt that I would love to consolidate.

personalfinance,Mortgage refinancing into the future?,"Growing up, I remember my parents refinancing their home to pay for upgrades, get renovations and then pay for my brother and my college.  They used to brag about getting a lower rate, lowering their monthly payment and getting a huge wad of cash back!

I feel as though the younger generation will never have this luxury, since interest rates are super low and will only go up.

Is there a different method of this type of self-payment that this generation can use for their children and future?  If it’s not in a mortgage, what can people invest in to do this type of work into the next few decades?   

Refinancing as interest rates fell, allowing them to pull cash out and keep payments the same or lower...  it feels like the last generation cheated.  Ha",finance

personalfinance,Should I rent or own?,"First time posting so sorry if this isn't formatted correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24 , have a moderate credit score (650 due to missing some student loan payments), make about $2600 a month, and have $10k in savings. I still live at home with my parents but I'm looking to move out around December. I was looking into apartments but my parents have been pushing for me to look into buying a house instead so I can build equity and not ""throw money away on rent"". I felt a good middleground would be a condo since I'm nervous about owning my own house right off the bat. 

&amp;#x200B;

By December I will have both of my credit cards down to $0, one of them a gas card and the other a regular credit card. My other monthly bills include cellphone $60, car loan $240 (but looking to refinance for a lower interest rate this month), car insurance $150, gas for the car so roughly $40, and food $150-200 so roughly $690 total. My annual performance review is also coming up in December and having being promoted to a new position I should be receiving a $2-4 an hour raise, a $50 monthly stipend for my cellphone, and potential end of the year and COLA bonuses. 

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that being said, I've been looking into condos in my area around the $75k range and have found some nice ones. If I went with the top end of my budget I could afford a 10% down payment ($7500), but I'm unsure I'd be able to get a mortgage that would allow me to only put down 10%. I've also looked into FHA but since December marks my 1 year with my current employer I don't believe I'm eligible for it. The apartments I've been looking at around the $750-850 price range aren't the best but would suffice for a year until I'm FHA eligible. 

&amp;#x200B;

So finally my question is: should I try buying a condo or should I just look into apartments for a year until I'm FHA eligible/able to put down a bigger down payment? Any and all advice is appreciated! Sorry again if my formatting is bad!",finance
btc,...was I just shadow banned from /r/Bitcoin ?,"I replied to /u/theymos , regarding the bitcoin core client's RPC command: `invalidateblock`.  I asked if this would have really allowed a node to manually fork if a block was discovered to be infected from the &lt;0.16.3 vulnerability.

My question/reply revolved around whether or not that would do anything other than stall the node, since the `getblocks` message only returns a list of block hashes for the ""best"" chain, so the node wouldn't receive any blocks until a fork beat out the corrupted one.

The cash is slated to arrive, but since the property is a hot buy they may need my income for the loan.

personalfinance,Need help figuring out how to set up my 401k and 457.,"Hi guys, so I read the wiki before posting, but there are way more choices than I expected and I really want to make sure I get this right so I wanted to try to get feedback and advice on my choices for my investment allocation.

A little about me, I recently got a full-time job working for a municipal government agency so I am enrolled in the municipal government pension, but I also have the option of a 401k and 457, which are offered through Prudential. My agency doesn't offer any matching because they pay into the pension. My salary is about $60,000. I thought it would be a good idea to open both a 401k and 457 so I can max them both out to $18,500 when I can afford it. I set the pre-tax contribution for each at 3% because my pension contribution is automatically set to 4.5% due to my current salary so the combined pre-tax retirement contributions would be 10.5%. I was concerned that if I contribute too much that I won't be able to afford to move into my own studio apartment ($1,500/month). I also didn't do any Roth contributions because I'm repaying my Federal Student Loans using Income-Driven Repayment and intend to use the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so I want to keep my AGI as low as possible for the next 10 years. I'm about to turn 28 and I would like to retire at 70 so I can get the full Social Security bonus.

I also have an option instead of allocating my investment into different funds to put it all in an actively managed portfolio program called GoalMaker. It seems to be similar to a Target Year Fund but the costs aren't very clear. Below is an example allocation for a Moderate Risk 16+ year plan.

In addition, I have an option when either my accounts reach $5,000 to transfer 20% in $1,000 increments into a Self-Directed Mutual Fund, which has a $25 annual fee. I'm not sure if this is worthwhile and this is something to consider further down the road, but I'll present the options. This list is very long so I won't be adding tickers.

btc,Why does BTC attract so many ridiculous hater people?,"Core minions will down vote this and say I'm a ""bcash shill"", but truth is BTC has some of the most ridiculous people I've ever seen in my life, honestly.

Sansom Mow, Saifeden Ammous, Giacomo Zucco to name some.

Giacomo Zucco is a Mussolini wannabe, what on earth was that presentation?? That was R.I.D.I.C.U.L.O.U.S, I felt embarrassed only to watch that.

Sansom mow and Saifeden only tweet hate and low quality. Saifeden cannot barely talk without offending and his ideas are very pedestrian economics 101.

Sansom is in full ""bcash is shit, bitmain is shit"" mode, his tweets are also ridiculous but have many ""likes"".

How can BTC people not call out these idiots? Do they even care to be linked to these people? What about the developers and scientists working there? I can't imagine these people feel comfortable to work for this sort of crowd.

It is as if the standard is to be the dumbest hater possible.

Surely we can do better and attract better people than that, btc became cultural degeneration.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"We want Solar Panels. But in our case, are they also economical?","My wife and I live in NC, I am 30 and she is in her late 20s. We both work and have a combined income of \~$110,000. We are considering purchasing Solar Panels for our home, which is  \~$220-240k home in Research Triangle area (Durham/Raleigh/Chapel Hill). There are a few homes in the nearby area which have Solar Panels, but the homes tend to be larger and either very recently constructed, or much older.

The system we are looking at is a 6.9 kW photovoltaic system with SolarEdge power optimizers. Cost of install would be \~$17,800 cash, or $\~19,500 financed. The financing option is the only one we are considering: 5.99% 20 year fixed mortgage. We anticipate \~50% tax and utility incentives within the first 5 months of the system being received, which we would immediately apply to the cost of the loan. After that is done, the loan re-amoritizes at the 18 month mark from \~$110/month to \~$61/month. After that, the monthly payment is permanently fixed at that rate until the loan is fully repaid, but there is no prepayment penalty.

I have investigated a Home Equity Line of Credit, and the interest rate is higher than we are interested in. It's also variable, which we want to avoid.

Based on current usage, The energy cost savings should average out to \~$65/month in year one. This equates to a cash flow benefit starting in the first year, even when we account for the additional homeowner's insurance cost.

Our only major concern is that if we sell the house in the next 10 years, we may come out behind unless we realize some extra sale equity in the home: We are virtually never in danger of being upside down on our mortgage (we currently owe \~$120k on the home in our mortgage at 3.625 APR, 14 years remaining on the original 20 year loan).

Thank you for any insights you may offer!  


Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded. Through this process, I have updated my mathematical model for calculating the economics of this system, and have gained valuable insight into how this should be viewed. The central question I still feel is unanswered is ""Can we expect increased home equity at a future point of sale?"" I don't think we'll ever get a solid handle on what to expect there, but we'll be accounting for that as a known unknown.",finance

I'm currently looking to purchase a house and my agent told me that his lender would connect me to different banks to get better rates. It sounded amazing that I wouldn't have to spend so much time applying and doing paperworks and stuffs like that.

personalfinance,Any advice for someone with 75k income and 80k debt?,"I'm doing okay, but honestly I feel a little discouraged sometimes by all the debt and would like to see if I have any better options for tackling it right now. 

I have 10k in an Ally savings account as an emergency fund. I have about 49k in student loans. 43k is federal, with rates varying from around 3% to 6.55%. The other 6k is a private loan with variable interest around 3.25% currently. I also have a 26k car loan at 2.25%. There's also about 3k in cc debt, though it has another 6 months or so before interest starts accruing. My credit score is around 750.

My take-home is about 4600 per month after taxes. Here are my expenses:

995: rent

530: carnote (yikes)

170: car and renters insurance

400: food/restaurants

220: minimum payment on fed loans (~95% of it goes to interest)

180: private loan payment

35: phone plan

37: phone payment (0 interest, couple months left)

110: cable/internet

200: electric/gas

100: water bill

100: average expenses for dog

100: average stuff to buy for around the house/yard

150: entertainment/fun money

Total around 3350, so around 1250/month in surplus funds. Right now I'm directing that towards the 3000 in cc debt so that it is gone in 2-3 months, before it starts accruing interest. At that point I'm unsure of whether I should start sending everything I have at the 6.55% student loans or split it between loans and opening an IRA.

Obviously the car is a ridiculous expense for my income situation. It was a major mistake buying something so expensive, and even though the car is great and very inexpensive to maintain I'd love to get rid of it for something more sensible. Unfortunately it's worth probably only 21-22k so I'm underwater by as much as 5k. As far as I understand when you're underwater like that it's usually better to just hold. In 2 years I'll only owe 14k on it and it's possible that will be closer to its value. 

Any help at all would be very much appreciated, thanks.",finance

personalfinance,I’m drowning and I need air,"I looked through the sections of this subreddit and got some cool info regarding avalanche and snowball methods of paying off debt. Heres my situation...I think that the avalanche method will work best for me but I have a quick question first. 

I have a card maxed out at 10k, paying 26% interest. Minimum payments are $225/month. I have another card maxed out at 5k but that is 0% interest for another 12 months. I want to tackle the 10k first. 

I went to a credit card debt counseling program in my hometown and they provided me a program that would lower my interest rate to 11% and set up auto payments for me at $250 a month. I’m happy they offered to chop my interest rate in half which would enable me feel more okay with making massive payments on this account. My goal would be to pay $400-500 per month. The only thing I don’t like about this program is that my minimum payments would not go down as my balance starts to decrease like it would if I just made payments directly to my credit card account. If there is a month where I pay off $600 but the next month I’m strapped for cash, I’m still stuck with that minimum $250 payment. If I didn’t do this program, I could see my minimums go down which would make it easier on me if I fell on hard times for a month here and there. 

Should I go with this program to lower my interest rate or just not do it and pay off my balance dealing with the 26% interest rate? An issue with the program is that it would close my account, which I understand could hurt my credit score. 

Reddit, what’s my best option? I’m serious about becoming debt free and this 10k card gives me daily stress I don’t need. I just want to know my best option for getting it done quickly and efficiently. Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Car financial predicament,"Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the back-story. In 2011 my mother leased a car for graduating college. The deal was she payed until the lease ends, then i'll proceed to buy it. At the time of the end-of-lease terms, she made an assumption regarding how the lease worked and ultimately I got pinned with a disgusting interest rate. My credit hasn't been developed since I was finishing a masters when I took over the payment of the car. My payment was $231 per month with 12.08% interest rate for 6 years. I've been paying this as I've been building my credit.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward. I now owe $5898 on the car. My father, being a mechanic, attempted to replace the timing belt and ultimately performed an inadequate job. The ""domino effect"" occurred and now the car is non-operational. Being that my career requires a car, I purchased a new car with my Excellent credit score &gt;750 and need to \[quickly\] take action regarding my old car.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I got about this? Do I take out a personal loan to get the title and attempt to sell the car to cut my losses, or do I refinance the car? any other suggestions are welcomed.

My husband and I are in our mid 30s. We bought our first home (duplex) 5 years ago and we live in one unit and renting out the other. We want to move to a bigger place since we are trying to add a few more family members, but we want to keep this duplex and rent out both units. We are looking at the new home range around 500-700k. I still have some student loans with pretty good interest rate. I'm not sure if we can afford to buy another house at the range we want. With our saving and investment combine (I don't want to touch any retirement funds), we are still a little bit shy from making the 20% down payment + 5% closing cost. We can take out a home equity loan against the duplex, to make the 25% to avoid PMI, but is that the right thing to do? What other things do I need to consider when taking out another loan? Would the banks even approve us? Lastly, should I hire a financial adviser to review everything?  If so, what should I look for in a good financial adviser?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my financial situation:

\-gross salaries income: 230k/year 

\-rental income from 1 unit: 22k/year

\-saving: \~90k

\-investing: \~40k (mutual funds, stocks, can be cash out for down payment)

\-retirement: max 401k monthly for both of us

\-mortgage (with tax, insurance etc.): 2568/month (\~315k left @4.25% interest, currently own 17% in equity)

\-student loan: 250/month (\~13k left @4.87% interest,)

personalfinance,Minor fender damage. Out of pocket or insurance?,"Hey everyone, I live in Ontario, and I have a question about an ""at fault"" incident. 

I was attempting to merge into the left hand lane before traffic started moving at a light. Pretty much what happened was the people in the lane I was merging interested, didn't want to lose their spot, and they drove into my drivers door. 

Now, we were moving at less than 1km per hour. The woman was just trying to block me out, but whatever. I was changing lanes, so that makes me at fault regardless. 

So her car (Chrysler 300) has some scuffed paint on the corner of her front fender. Isn't to the primer, but is noticible. We agreed not to go through insurance for such a small amount of damage. (I'll attach a pic of her vehicle). 

So they are getting a quote from a body shop at what the damage is going to cost.l, and ask me to pay it. Here's my predicament. If it is over $500 in damage, I can't afford to pay out of pocket. My insurance would definitely go up if there was a claim made against me, but I'd be able to manage the extra cost in insurance, even if I will be paying much more over a longer length of time. 

I took a picture of the damage. I just don't want them coming back wanting a new bumper and fender and all new paint job. I don't know the people, so maybe they aren't out to rip me off, but I always want my bases covered. 

What do you think? Should I pay out of pocket regardless of the cost, in order to keep a claim off of my insurance? Or take the insurance route? Never had to deal with this before in the 8 years I've been driving.

personalfinance,Student loan refinance questions,"I'm looking for advice on refinancing private student loans.  I have about 100k in private loans at an average of 7.5%.  I also have 25k in federal loans at an average of 4.5%.  
I make 78k a year and have been working since last December.  I have about 23k in savings as an emergency fund.  I live at home so I have no real expenses, my monthly take home is 4,000 with the loan payments totaling ~1300 a month.  Credit score is 736, and I could ask my father to cosign(790+ credit score I believe) if it would be helpful. 

My main questions are 

1. Fixed vs variable - which is best for going forward?
2. What can I do before applying to knock my rate down? Should I contribute some of the money I have saved to pay off some of the loans prior to applying? Should I wait another couple months to build stronger credit? 
3.  Is it much worse to do a longer term if I plan on paying above the minimum every month?  I think I would like to have the flexibility in case of some sort of emergency, but if it adds significantly to the overall payoff value than I can do a shorter term.

personalfinance,"Trying to get a handle on finances, feel like I'm being spread thin. Money management advice?","Hey y'al!!

I (25F) recently got married to my husband (31M), and we live in CA, and we are pretty much in the end stages of our recovery mode from the wedding.  But lately, I feel like my finances are all over the place.  I have a yearly salary of $142,000 and together with my husband we make about $260,000.  I currently bank with BofA - checking, savings, and recent auto loan refinance ($11,000).  Here is what is going on:

\- Recently, in addition to my 5% contribution to 401k (company matches up to 5%), my husband also had me open up a traditional IRA.  I put about $1000 in to get it started.  However, I just accepted a new federal job with their own 401k -- I have no idea how to even start with the whole rollover process (into IRA? this federal 401k?) and what option is best.

\- I tried to refinance some of my high interest rate student loans (about 5.8-6.8%) with SoFi, down to about 5%.  But I would still keep some of the lower interest rate loans (\~3%) with the federal servicing program that I have.  Is this even a good idea, especially since I took a new federal job that I could potentially have my loans forgiven? I tried to read up on it, but I couldn't quite understand the process.  This would also mean I have 2 different places I would have to make student loan payments on.

\- I also opened up a high-interest yield savings account with CapitalOne (interest rate is 1.85%) at the advice of a friend, and deposited about $10,000 into the account, as an ""ultra rainy day emergency use"".  I still have some money in my super-low-interest savings account at BofA though, for ease of access, although I'm not sure if it would be smarter to just put all of the money into CaptialOne.  

Honestly, these are three things that kind of eat away at my soul in terms of my finances. I feel like I have money everywhere, and I will have to remember all these due dates and passwords and... yikes.  I'm from a modest family, where money management could have been better, so I'm learning money management from my husband and from scratch.  I pay off my 2 credit cards in full every month, and we live in a place where its kind of unrealistic to buy a house (although I would like a Tesla one day haha).  I would like to get into investing one day, but I want to get a good handle on my money first, especially I'm still young.  I tried looking into getting a financial planner, but it was pretty expensive.... not sure if it was worth it.  I apologize for the winding post and any incorrect terms, but this is what state my head is in right now. Any wisdom would be highly appreciated!

TL;DR - I have a bunch of different accounts open with different amounts of money in them, and it's starting to get a bit overwhelming. Looking for ways to simplify things for a finance n00b.",finance

personalfinance,Do traditional TSP contributions made in a CZTE reduce your AGI?,"I am currently deployed to a location where my pay is subject to Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (federal withholding is refunded monthly).  I have hit the $18,500 contribution limit with my civilian employer’s Roth 401k + military Roth TSP contributions for this year.  For the rest of the year, I plan to continue making aftertax contributions to my civilian 401k since they are only subject to the $55,000 limit.  I have also just done a large in-plan Roth conversion on my 401k since my MAGI for 2018 would otherwise be much lower than typical due to the 5 months of income earned in the tax free zone.  This Roth conversion has in turn dialed up my tax liability to a little more than I’d earn in a typical year.

Can I further reduce my tax liability for 2018 by switching to traditional tax-deferred TSP contributions using basic military pay earned in the CZTE (since traditional TSP contributions while deployed are subject to the annual addition limit of $55,000)?  Some older reports online claim that it’s already tax free, so it wouldn’t.  However, I’m taxed every 1st &amp; 15th, then I receive a refund of federal withholding for the preceding month on the 1st in addition to being taxed that same day.  I would also be making TSP contributions from basic pay only (not tax exempt allowances).  My understanding is that pre-tax contributions regardless of when/where I made them in the year would simply be deducted from my gross income when it comes time to calculate my AGI on my returns. Furthermore, I’ve had a few friends claim that TSP contributions they made while deployed were automatically put in the Roth (some sort of idiot proofing).  Since DFAS doesn’t know that I’ve maxed the elective deferral limit, will the system even allow me to switch to traditional contributions if I haven’t triggered the $18,500 limit of the Roth TSP?",finance

personalfinance,[Taxes] IRS Withholding Calculator Suggesting 17 allowances?,"I took a new job in June 2018 and just recently got married. I make $90,000 yearly (previously $70,000) while my wife makes $55,000. I wanted to take this opportunity to update both of our W4s.

I completed the two-earners worksheet within the W4 - it recommended that we both claim 0 AND pay an additional $4,550 over the remainder of this year. It seemed a little ridiculous. But I read that it's basically an antiquated, single earner calculation when you file jointly as married.

To confirm, I entered all of our information into the IRS Withholding calculator, which spit out the following results:

&gt; Based on the information you previously entered, your anticipated income tax for 2018 is $19,165. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $19,897 withheld for 2018 resulting in an overpayment of $732 when you file your return. If you want your withholding to more closely match your anticipated tax, adjust your withholding on new Forms W-4 as follows:
Job 1 (which has a projected salary of $90,000): 14 allowances.
Job 2 (which has a projected salary of $56,000): 5 allowances.
Check the “Married” box on your Forms W-4

I've only ever claimed 0 or 1. Is 17 as crazy as I think it is? Do these results make sense, given how little information I've provided?

EDIT: Sorry for the lack of detail. I figured something was up based on the above results. /u/wijwijwij noticed that I filled out the calculator form completely incorrectly, combining my wages, Roth contributions, federal income tax, etc. from both jobs in one form. After separating it out correctly, I think I've got a more realistic solution. Basically, both my wife and I are going to file jointly, claim 0, and withhold $14 and $57 per paycheck respectively.

personalfinance,American Student Debt for a Dual Citizen,"Hello PF,

I recently found out that my girlfriend (who presently lives in Montreal with me)  left behind 20-30k in student debt from her time at a private college in Vermont 8 years ago. She is a dual Canadian-American citizen, who was a resident of Vermont but has lived in Montreal since. She is afraid to go back to the States in fear that her debt will be there waiting for her. She understands it was terrible thing to basically flee her debt, but at 20 years old she couldn't imagine how she could ever pay back such an amount. 

From my understanding, she does pay her taxes to the IRS each year so there has not been any clawback from them yet. The only other details she knows is that it was likely a mix of federal and private loans. Her family has not been pursued by any creditors to date.

How can I help her become free of the debt?  I fear that she might run into serious trouble if she ever returns to the States for any reason. I'm completely unsure on where to begin, as I'm Canadian and have never lived in the United States or dealt with student loans from there.

Any insight or help is much appreciated. Thanks!

The car payment and student loan are paid on time and good standing. The credits cards, not so much, but that's not the big issue. I've taken out multiple person loans with crazy interest rates. Like 6 of these loans. I was paying them, but couldnt get ahead. They ate my entire paycheck and I was struggling to make ends meet. 

I picked up a part time 2nd job to help, but it just wasnt enough. I closed my bank account and opened a new one with a different bank to stop those automatic payments. I've been paying the most important things to me: rent, insurance, car payment, student loan. My credit is destroyed. I know that. I have debt collectors calling me all day everyday. I'm in a stable place and want to get ahead of this or at least get a grasp on it to start moving forward and paying this off. 

I googled debt consolidation but I doubt I could get a loan to do this with my credit history. I make 4k a month from my main job and 500 a month from my part time job. Rent is 1000, car payment is 450, insurance and student loan together is about 400. Electricity and internet is roughly 200. I need help.

personalfinance,Question on CA state income tax for non-residents.,"In 2016, I was hired to do a remote programming project for a San Francisco based company. I was living in New York City. The company paid me ~$75K as a 1099 independent contractor. At no point, did I visit the state of California for any purpose during that time. At the end of 2016, I filed federal taxes and New York state income taxes. Recently, the state of CA has sent me a letter stating I owe CA income tax on that ~$75K even though I'm a non-resident. The biggest problem I see is that I already paid New York State income tax on that money. I don't want to pay another state income tax as well. If I have to pay CA, can I get back money I paid New York? Certainly I don't have to pay both states income tax for the same income and the same year.

personalfinance,Credit score dropped for seemingly no reason?,"Last time I checked my credit score on September 8 (using creditkarma)  I was at 731. Today when I checked my credit score I had dropped 23 points to 708. This seems pretty steep and I don't know why this happened. I pay off my credit cards fully every week. I've never been sent to collections,  there is no negative bank account information on my credit report, no bankruptcies, or legal judgments, and my last hard credit inquiry was made in November 2015 when I  received my first credit card.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two credit cards (visa, and amex) each with $1000.00 limit. I got the visa card in december 2015 when I was 19, and my only late payment was August 2016. The Amex card has been active since June 2018, my for all of August my credit score was still 731. I only got the card because it had much lower interest rates and a better rewards system.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I made about 124k+15k+30k+30k = 199k (base salary, bonus, stock vested, realized capital gain from investment) last year.

&amp;#x200B;

For mortgage calculation I was advised that we may only use the base salary, bonus, and 50% off stock vested = 154k / year.

&amp;#x200B;

Debt: 7k student loan, 9k car loan, 6k credit card debt on 0% APR. Monthly payment is $210+$345+$80 = $635/month

&amp;#x200B;

I have \~$200k in cash for downpayment. My agent just recommended me a $950k property, 2700 sq ft, 6 beds 2.5 bath (3\*0.75 bath). The property can likely generate ($800\*3 + $90\*30.4)\*0.8 = $4100 income/month from a mix of long term renter and airbnb. This property is within 10mins walking distance to a fortune 500 company, 10 minutes driving distance to bunch other startups so it has no shortage of well paid renters.

&amp;#x200B;

She advised me that if I pay off my loans with gift fund from my family member, I will qualify for a $760k arm 7/1 mortgage which I have some doubt. She ran my fico mortgage score earlier and it was in the low 760s. My fico 08 is in the 790s.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to make this work? If I got the house, it will be turned into an owner occupied rental. But according to my agent it's better for me to not use my potential future rental income to qualify for a mortgage which may hurt the interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some more info:**

The plan is to use renter and airbnb to pay for the P&amp;I. At the current rate that I am saving ($27750 in 401k, and about 100k cash / year), I would be able to reduce the mortgage principal balance to less than $280k in 7 years by making additional principal payment at 4k/month. At that time I would likely be able to have enough cash to pay off the house as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Rates on student loan and car loan is around 2%. My rate of return in investment is far more than that so it has been more advantageous to keep the loan and invest the cash.

&amp;#x200B;

I saved up about 330k (200k cash currently after liquidating a lot of stock rest in 401k and roth ira) in the past 2 years since graduation. So I do save - what I was looking at is a house that basically pays for itself in P&amp;I payment. Or, diversification in investment if you will. Of course there is a risk that the house had issues that needs fixing in the short term future, I would have to stop 401k contribution in order to pay for mortgage, tax and insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

Real estate price has been going crazy in my market with 10-15% yoy increase. A 550k property back in 2009 costs around 900k today. I could save for 2 more years in which case I only need to qualify for a \~500k loan, but I am just afraid that the local real estate market would just go like what it did in San Francisco, forever locking me out of a decent enough house in good area.

personalfinance,Quick question about when to refinance an auto loan vs just pay more per month to knock the principal down,"What's up everyone, been a lurker here for a bit, trying to be a sponge and learn as much as possible, but today I come with a question.
A couple years back I made an ill informed decision to buy a new car using a used car I had as the down payment. The financial burden never really caused me to flounder, but ever since I recently started educating myself regarding personal finance it's been a thing I kick myself over. I couldn't locate anything specifically about this in the sidebar, but if I missed a discussion about refinancing I'd appreciate it if one of you could point me in the right direction!


Situation details:

* Financed a new car back in 2014 @[cost I'll insert if I can find the original paperwork]

* Payments ~$650/month

* 4.5% interest

* As of today payoff is ~$11.3k

* KBB values the car at around $15k

* Credit score lower-mid 700s

It took me two years to learn enough about personal finance to realize that was a stupid decision and I'm living with that, but I'd like to hear your thoughts.


I'm not looking for a decision to be made for me, I just don't think I have a complete understanding of how I should crunch the numbers to determine whether I should jump ship on my current loan for one with a better interest rate or lower payment. Ultimately, my goal is just to pay off this damn car already and get on with my life of never financing a car or buying new again.


I appreciate any and all information and insight you guys can provide!",finance
personalfinance,"New CC with 0% Intro APR for XX Months for major purchase, good idea or no?","I'm thinking about buying a camper, something to the tune of 10-15k. I have 800+ credit score. I have almost 15k in savings and 13.8k on a car note @ 0% APR effectively for the life of the loan (49 months to go).

I'm able to comfortable save about 1000 a month after bills and while I could make this purchase outright, it makes me feel at ease knowing I'm sitting on what is to me, so much cash.

Anything wrong with opening a new credit card and putting a good chunk of the cost on credit? My reasoning is that I could get a card with 0% introductory APR for 12 months and easily pay it off within 12 months. That beats RV financing charges, plus I'd get some rewards on the CC as well.

The only thing I can see wrong with this is that it will throw my utilization off for awhile, but I have no intention of using my credit for anything major in the next year or so anyhow. Currently I have 7500 in credit 2% utilized between 2 cards (6200 &amp; 1300). Also that I would be charged  about 4-5 times the interest rate if I didn't have it paid off before the 0% introductory APR ends, but that really shouldn't be a problem.",finance
personalfinance,22 Y/o: Started first FT job and need retirement/investing help!,"I just started my first full time job with a $56,500 salary before a tax rate of ~28%. I've been researching investment options and trying to see what makes the most sense. I have a 2k student loan with interest rate of ~3%, a 10k car loan from BOMAD (0% interest) and no credit card debt. My employer doesn't match my 401k until after 1 year (and then its only 25% of 6% of salary for 4 years). Should I put more money into my roth? I was planning on doing 5% into each until after the year matches and then add 1% to my 401k.

personalfinance,"Is there a sort of ""Reverse Lookup"" where you can select length of term, credit score and desired monthly payment and be advised how much ""car"" you can afford?","Long-term seeking out of car -- always seeing the price of a car and can't mentally convert that into a ""per month"" payment.

EDIT:  Wow, I need to learn to phrase these better.  Goal is to think, ""well, I know that I have this credit score which should get me an interest rate at I and an X month goal and can pay Y down, and need to avoid paying more than Z a month... So I can ignore all of those vehicles that cost R because no amount of haggling is going to bring them to those parameters"".  I'm not intending to base a final decision on how much I can pay per month, nor would I go in to a dealership and tell the sales rep I'm seeking a car for blah a month -- that way lies madness.  I just want to be able to give myself a mental cutoff where even if I like the car, I can know in advance there's no way I could afford it with a reasonable payment plan.",finance
personalfinance,Budget for Late 20s Couple on East Coast,"My wife and I moved to the East Coast from the Midwest for her job and after 2 months of going jobless I received 2 job offers this week so I decided to get back to making a budget again. I felt inspired by a number of budgets posted by others and also wanted critiques in terms of anything major I'm missing or if any of the numbers seem really off.

&amp;#x200B;

Cash: $40,000 (Our E-fund is pretty high because we received more wedding money than expected and because I was jobless for the time being).

401K: $50,000

Student Loans: $240,000

Projected Monthly Net Income (after Taxes, 401K, health insurance): **$7320.00**

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE:** I wanted to address a few comments that people brought up below. First, I understand this it not an optimal budget. I created this budget based on our current expenses and as a way to see where we can improve and to see where we can come up with student loan payments for the future because the $0 IBR will change in May (Food is obviously a big red flag).

We live in DC area and my wife is a resident. The high rent and high student loans can be attributed to those things. The reason one student loan has a 500/month payment is because those are my loans (40K) which do not qualify for PSLF. We are not counting on PSLF, but we will focus on my loans first since my wife's income will see a big increase in 5 years.

I forgot pet expenses, which I've now added to the table.

Our food expenses are way too high for sure. We have been eating out a lot and we should adjust that in the future. The vacation budget may be considered a luxury for some, but we do consider it a necessity. My wife is currently going 2 weeks straight averaging 14 hours a day. In general, she averages 80 hours a week in a high stress environment. A nice vacation is definitely needed.

Thank you everyone for your comments, it really helps keep things in perspective and where to improve.

**UPDATE #2:** Again, I want to thank everyone for your constructive criticism. I understand our budget isn't perfect and it reflects some internal beliefs that may not align with r/personalfinance. Because of multiple job offers, I was able to negotiate a higher salary, so I've adjusted our projected budget based on that amount and based on comments/suggestions below. Feel free to let me know what you think!

&amp;#x200B;

|Rent|2400 (includes 2 dogs and parking for 2 cars)|
|:-|:-|
|Student Loan 1|500|
|Student Loan 2|0 (IBR-REPAYE)|
|Internet|58|

|Restaurants+Entertainment (changed group name to more accurately reflect what it covers)|500|
|Groceries|400|
|Car Maintenance|250 (both cars are paid off, so I like to set aside a car payment for maintenance or future car)|
|Vacation Fund|500 (taking a major trip every year is a necessity due to my wife's stressful job)|
|Gift Fund |100|
|Clothing (we don't buy new clothes often so i feel this is accurate)|50|

|Adjustable Monthly Expenses (Utilities, Gas, Gift, Pet, Vacation, Car, Restaurants, Groceries, and Clothing).  |**$2300**|
|Left over|**$1564**|

I added adjustable monthly expenses to the list which reflects the idea that I actually budgeted Gas and Utilities at high amounts rather than average and things like clothing, gifts, vacation, entertainment etc. are not fixed budgeted items. I feel pretty satisfied that with this budget we will have $1500 left over to throw at loans or retirement (since e-fund is pretty well funded at this point) and potentially more money for those things as we are budgeting on the high end rather than average spend end.",finance
personalfinance,Am I being too conservative while I save up for a house?,"I'm currently 27 and still living at home while commuting to work. I'm making $80,000 with the typical 3%-5% incremental raises annually. Hoping to get a promotion in the next year or two to increase that base. I live in the NYC/NJ area and my job will always be here, so it's fairly high in cost and taxes.

I can feasibly live at home, rent free, for another year or two. I wouldn't hate to rent in NYC for a little while either. I would say I'm anywhere between 5-7 years, maybe longer, from a time where I would really need/want to purchase a home.

**Given that timeframe, I'm interested in hearing thoughts on how conservative I should be with my income and savings in the future.**

* **Should I continue to be investing a portion of my income? If so, what kinds of assets or ratio of assets should I be looking at?**

* **Should I leave my investments intact and merely sock away my income into my high interest checking account?**

* **Should I consider a shorter timeline and look to sell some of my current investments to fund my purchase?**

Below, I have detailed the state of my savings to date. 
_________________________________________________________


**Retirement Accounts:**

I've been maxing my 401k, currently up to $80k.

I have $20k in my Roth IRA.

**Taxable Brokerages:**

I have $80k in mutual funds (three fund portfolio) in a taxable brokerages account.

I have an additional $60k in another taxable brokerage account of mixed stocks and funds.

I have another account that I thought would go towards closing costs some day, but that's passing $15k, so I'm starting to think that's going to be off more use than I anticipated. It's all my income from my side job, and I had only ever planned on using this for house costs someday.

I have $20k in recreational investments in Robinhood.

**Liquid Cash:**

I have a $30k emergency fund in a checking account earning 3.3% interest.

personalfinance,"22 y/o, looking to open second credit card. Looking for best rewards possible.","Credit score is 742. Right now I have a Discover It Chrome card (credit limit is currently $3600), which gives me 2% cash back on gas and restaurants, and 1% on everything else. I try not to eat out very often, and I own an electric car, so that categorized cash back rate is largely irrelevant to me. Additionally, I don't fly very often, so miles and travel rewards are also not very important. Lastly, I never carry a balance (I treat it like a debit card), so interest rates don't really matter to me at the moment.

Most of my expenses on my Discover card are groceries - and as far as I can tell, the only cards that have higher cash back rates on groceries are the ""rotating category"" cards like Chase Freedom. In trying to compare the Freedom vs. the Freedom Unlimited, I'm having a hard time determining which would be better suited for me, given the criteria I mentioned - 1.5% on everything vs. 1% on everything + 5% on specific rotating categories?

personalfinance,Vanguard General Brokerage Account - Short-Term Investment Fund Options,"I recently opened a Brokerage Account through Vanguard with an initial investment of $1,000. 

It says the funds are currently in the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (I suppose the default), even though the description says it requires a minimum investment of $3,000. 

Question 1: are my current funds actually invested in this account, or just holding  in their default setting (without interest). 

My goal is basically just to hold my money in a secure, short-term investment fund that bears more interest than a general savings account. 

It looks like I have some more options when I get to $3,000. I'll be able to choose from a Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund which has a higher expense ratio (0.11% -&gt; 0.16), but also a slightly higher return rate (1.99% -&gt; 2.13%), or with $5,000, go to an Admiral Shares fund that has a slightly better return (2.9%) and lower expense ratio (0.10%). 

Question 2: Any suggestions on choosing from the general short-term funds available....should I just wait until I get to $5,000 and go with the Admiral Shares option?

Banking,Thinking of changing banks,"Hey all.  Been looking around this reddit and some other resources and i've been thinking about switching banks but wanted to see your insights before pulling the trigger.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a wells fargo account holder, and have been for over 12 years (back when they were first union, before Wachovia). So for many years now ive had their next-to-nothing 0.001% interest rates on my savings account, but I also have my checking and oldest credit card, with my highest limit.

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at some of the online banking solutions such as Ally, and it seems to have good reviews, plus the higher interest rate.  Does it makes sense to make a jump to Ally for savings and checking, or just savings?  I don't really do cash deposits but maybe once a year, and don't generally end up in a branch.  I don't want to close the credit card account due to it being good for my credit score. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it make sense to keep the checking account open with WF, with enough money in it to avoid the low-balance fees (which I think is $500). Or no?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, some banks give incentives for new account holders. I don't see Ally having that. Is this something that might make sense to wait for or does Ally not provide this?  Or are there other online banks which might be better?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, since I am looking at buying my first house towards the end of 2019 (which is why im looking at my finances now), does opening a new checking / savings (no credit cards / loans / etc) be considered a hard inquiry on my credit score?

Right now, my wife and I are working on saving for a downpayment on a home.

Is there any downside in contributing all of my individual 1099 income to an individual 401k to avoid taxes - but still having access to it via a 401k loan? That way I would avoid paying state and federal taxes on the $10,000 ($8500 after Self-Employment Taxes). I know I can only access 50% - and that is fine by me. I will be rolling over my current 401k of $30,000 as well.

personalfinance,Taxes on a severance package and 401(k) cashout,"After five years of employment in management I decided to leave my previous employer, a Fortune 500 company, to focus on completing my undergrad before I hit my late twenties. I was provided a fairly generous severance package but have come to wonder how this will change my taxes when it comes to filing for 2018.

The severance package totaled approx. $12,000, about 23% of my annual income before RSU sales. The package was paid out as if it were a normal bonus the company commonly made to front-line associates for exceeding performance goals. As such, it was taxed at about 33.33%, as I actually received just above $8,000.

Additionally, I opted to cash-out my Vanguard 401(k) plan because the funds in the account were limited as it was. The total balance of the account, $3,818.05, was cashed out and, as far as I can tell, Vanguard did not deduct anything for tax payment.

Since leaving my previous employer I’ve accepted a position at the university at which I study.

I would assume that I would not owe additional taxes on the severance package as state and federal taxes were deducted upon payment however, I’d also assume I will, in fact, owe additional taxes on the 401(k) cashout. I’m just trying to get some idea of what to expect prior to filing.",finance

investing,US Housing market is headed for ugly time. Here is proof.,"Since then, news after news has come out showing that the housing market is faltering.

For instance – August was the fifth straight month that annual price gains in the 20-City Index (top 20 cities in the U.S.) decelerated.

This alone isn’t worth getting anxious over – but all the other housing data is coming in ugly as well. . .

Estimates show that for the first time in nearly 10 years, residential investment is set to subtract from annual U.S. GDP growth. And that the August ‘sales of existing homes’ missed analyst projections, as well as ‘new-home sales’ fell three months straight – the weakest pace in nine months.

But the real crisis here is that the housing markets stalling out from buyers shying away from the higher prices and higher mortgage rates (the 30-year fixed mortgage is the highest it’s been since 2011).

This is the real demand-side problem. . .

Many economists and mainstream pundits are baffled by this. The Trump tax cuts, a multi-decade low in unemployment, and an 18 year high in consumer confidence should have home prices and sales surging – right?

Yet they aren’t – so what gives?

Many who’ve studied the texts of the late Austrian economist – F.A. Hayek – knew that this weaker housing market was inevitable after the high growth years (browse through our Palisade Recommended Reading List to see his best work).

Because of the housing bust and financial meltdown of 2008, the Federal Reserve engaged in ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) and money printing via QE to subsidize mortgage lenders, housing construction, and home prices. The low rates allowed many deep in debt (including corporations) to refinance, and it also kept home prices from declining.

My biggest hurdle is how to handle my student loans. We want to eventually look at homes, but I need to get rid of something to make that happen.

I have 2 Fed Loans worth of around $23k. I'm making 415/mo for payments. This will be done in 2021 (smaller of the two) and in 2024 (the larger of the two). The interest rates are between 5.3-6%.

I have 1 private CHASE loan of $18k. I'm making $150/mo for payments. This will be done in 2034. The interest rate is between 8.25%.

I spoke with a representative for my Fed loans about some options. 1. I change my plan to graduated-rate (goes up every two years) and pay $268 until my wife and I file for taxes this upcoming tax season. We would file separately, then I would change to income-based and pay $168/mo with half of that being interest still. He said that over the course of 20-25 years of repaying it, it would be forgiven, but I'd be paying $16k in interest. 2. Stay on my current standard rate and at the end of 2024 have paid $4k in interest. 3. A forbearance on my loan for a year, but pay the interest that would be accumulating each month, about $95, to keep it ""even"". He was stating these ideas in relation to me wanting to pay down that CHASE loan. My other big payment is a car payment on a new purchase this summer ($422 for 5 years). I'm an art educator in a public high school. My income is around $44k a year (before taxes). With income-based repayment, I would need to reapply every 12 months. My wife and I filed jointly this past year, but if it is worth it to file separately and move to income-based repayment, I can take the difference of standard and income ($415 - $168), which is $250/mo and apply it directly to my CHASE loan. Would the $16k of interest on income-based be less if I can get the CHASE loan down and then up payments on the income-based fed loans?

personalfinance,Sketchy debt: Dad being contacted by a debt collector for a tool that was supposedly rented 3 years ago.,"TL;DR My Dad was contacted by a debt collector via phone and home mail address 3 years after a tool was supposedly rented. Had he been contacted earlier by the hardware company (all they tried was an email of his that's long since been deleted), he could have taken appropriate action with returning the tool. Now he has to pay a large fee for a companies lack of initiative it seems. The company who's contacting him is legit, I looked them up.

3 years ago apparently my Dad rented a tool, which to his knowledge he can't recall ever renting and if he did I'm pretty sure he would've returned it. Now he's being contacted by a debt collector for said tool. After being contacted by the debt agency via phone and home mail 3 years later, he voiced he had no clue what's up with the tool and opened a case with the debt collector. The hardware company then responded to the debt company's case claiming that three years ago, they contacted him via e-mail. However he no longer uses that email and it's long been deleted. His main argument here along with mine, is very simple. The company that claims he should owe the full fee for the tool obviously has access to his home and phone number, since this is how the debt company contacted him, and how the tool was mailed to him. If he had been contacted via these methods earlier, he could have taken appropriate action with the company that claims he owes the tool. It seems he's the victim of the companies lack of initiative, or lack of competence regarding a possible inventory mistake. Now three years later, they went ""oops let's try and get this guy"" hoping he would just abide by a debt company trying to intimidate him. What can I advise him to do to dispute this charge? Can the company send a debt collector after him this late after said rental? Should he request proof he even rented the tool in the first place? How do we know this company doesn't have this tool, and just goofed? The entire situation seems odd to me.",finance
personalfinance,Should I put 20% down or 5%? The lender has a no PMI option.,"My credit union has an incentive program that offers its members a no PMI mortgage option if you can only put down less than 20%.

personalfinance,Side Hustle Tax Question,"Thanks in advance for any help with this. 
My situation: Employed Full Time. Federal Employee.
Working as a ""consultant"" for a small company (part time/side hustle)

Details: There are three of us working on a small project. Person 1 is the co owner of the company. Person 2 and 3 are friends that were brought on for this one specific project. The 3 of us are putting in hours to this project. The company was hired as a subcontractor for this project. To explain: company A is the client. A hired B to complete the project. B subcontracted C to complete parts of the project. The 3 of us are working as company C.  Income from our parts of the project will be divided as follows: 30% goes to company C and 70% is split 3 ways amongst our small team. Company C is an LLC, and person 2 is also the owner of his own LLC. Person 3 does not have an LLC. 

My question: What is the best strategy, tax wise, to get each member of our 3 man team paid? We have been mulling over different scenarios on payments and disbursements. We want to complete all payments within the confines of IRS rules and applicable laws but we obviously want to be as efficient with our handling of the taxes. Is this a 1099 situation or does one LLC pay the other LLC and the second LLC pays person 3? Or are there other options on the table that we've overlooked.

I'm open to any and all suggestions and am willing to chat somewhere with someone more knowledgeable if that is easier than using the comment thread.",finance

investing,Why are REITs down so much the last couple of days?,"Usually there's a low-quality SeekingAlpha post or something, but I haven't been able to find anyone covering the REIT drop. My best-guess is cautionary pulling-out ahead of today's Fed meeting/probable rate hike.  
  
  
It has been said that the U.S. housing market, particularly in ""very hot"" areas in the west, is softening YoY. This year, the median sales price for a home in the U.S. has fallen more than it has since the 2008-2011 drop in home prices. It has also been said that the Fed may *not* raise the rate, and if they don't, it would probably be because of what we're seeing with the housing market, which is hardly a trend, but could be the beginning of a (IMO) mild/moderate pullback as mortgage rates continue to rise and we reach the point at which people cannot really afford housing.  
  
  
So raising the rate would be bad news for REITs, whose underlying companies have relied heavily on loans to purchase real estate and rent it out for profit. Still, 0.25% is hardly worth a 5% selloff... 
  
  
My interpretation of this ~5% downward movement this past week or so is that, at this point, morning of the rate hike announcement, the 25bp rate hike is **priced in**. So I'm inclined to increase my position in VNQ. What's more, if the Fed ends up not raising the rate, I would expect easy money as REITs return to 52H levels (and beyond!).  
  
  
I know I'm stupid, but am I crazy in my reasoning?",finance

I live in Europe atm, and interest rates here are below 1 percent per annum.

personalfinance,"Massive student loan debt, completely overwhelmed and have some questions","I graduated this year with a clinical doctorate in a field that requires a doctorate degree for entry level professionals. However, I am not truly paid to reflect the education and work that went into earning my degree. (For anyone interested, I have a DPT, Doctor of Physical Therapy. Our professional organization pushed for the DPT for entry level clinicians but actual real-world pay as a professional has yet to catch up to match this degree)

I was young and naive when I started school and not once was educated on loans, how much school truly is, and what I will face after my education. I honestly just assumed that with my degree and qualifications, I would be making good money and would be able to cover the cost of education with my work. I was accepted to a great private program for both undergrad and my graduate studies, and just rolled with the opportunities. However, I am now facing over $200,000 in student loan debt and don't even know where to begin. Every day I get to work my dream job helping people stand, walk, and live their fullest, happiest quality of life, but it seems like the financial payoff is not equal to the satisfaction I find in my daily work.

All of my loans are federal loans, all fixed interest rates. They cover the span of undergrad through graduate school. I am currently on the Income Driven Payment option, but realize that it might not be the best option for me, considering that my payments over the last year have not even touched the original cost of loans but just the already rapidly accruing interest.

There are so many questions and so many contradictory answers online, it's really overwhelming. Do I consolidate or refinance? Is it worth the risk of losing federal loan protections if I do refinance? And what payment plan would be best for me, especially if we are ready to start putting money toward this?  What about using our savings to just pay off a huge chunk now, versus letting it drag out over multiple payments?

Another consideration is that I recently got married, which may change some payment expectations from fedloan. I have no idea what a change in marital status does to my repayment plan but any insight or information regarding this would be appreciated.

Last piece of info---my new spouse is active duty military at the moment, but will be leaving the military next year. Are there any military benefits we should be aware of or that could be applied to our situation? It kills me that there is a GI bill benefit we could have used, had we met and gotten married just a little sooner :D

Any advice, insight, information, or tips would be incredibly helpful. This is daunting, frustrating, and really tough to face, but we're determined to do something about it.",finance

personalfinance,Why would State tax be higher that federal? Accountant issue?,"We were checking our 2017 tax prep by accountant and noticed state tax was higher. We told accountant and the tax prep was redone without any explanation. Those taxes were filed.

Now, from taxes filed by the same accountant, we got a notice from the state saying we underpaid on 2015 state tax, and there was interest on the bill. I asked him what the deal is with this. Accountant says it’s because state gross was more than federal. Also no other explanation.

I recall we also got an underpayment notice maybe in 2016, but could have been for federal as a small amount of unreported income. I cannot confirm for what, just that it was an underpayment thing.

I work in one state and live in another. My spouse works and lives in the same state. We live together. 

What do people think is going on? I never had this happen. But we also just started filing jointly in 2015. Same year I got accountant. But they filed 2014 for me on my own.

personalfinance,Should I take out personal loan to get rid of PMI?,"I have about $15k left to pay off of my mortgage to remove PMI. I called my mortgage bank and they said once I get to an LTV ratio of less than 80% PMI will automatically come off. 

From Citizens Bank (a different bank then my mortgage is through) I can get a personal, 36 month $15k loan at ~6-7%.

My mortgage is at 4.125%, and my PMI is 852/year or 5.68% (852/15000), for a total of 9.805%. Should I take out the loan and use it to pay off mortgage to get rid of PMI? It seems like a no-brainer.

If my calculations are correct, it should save me around $1262 over the corse of the 3 years, even more if I pay it off sooner or the interest rate I get from Citizens bank is less than 7%",finance

Bitcoin,Finished traveling around the world ... on 1 Bitcoin,"Hello BTC Redditors,

Just wanted to share a little announcement rather dear to me.

August of last year I left Portland, Oregon with a mission: see what BTC communities are like around the world...and make it happen with just 1 Bitcoin.

Finally made it :)

18 countries.

12 months.

1 BTC.

Bought it for $4,724 hard earned dollars. A month later in September I felt like a chump who bought a new car off the dealer's lot --- because BTC kept loosing value and sunk to $3,350. But I kept riding that rollercoaster.

In December the price hit $19k. Just a few days before Christmas too. I felt tempted to cash it all out right then and there, let me tell ya. But a few OG's I met in Hong Kong told me to keep saddled on that bucking Bronco -- feel the adrenaline of the ups and the heartbreak of the downs. So I stuck it through. Man, what a ride.

I put a little video together. Not super good at the editing, sorry. But here it is anyway:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjacVPEaCW8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjacVPEaCW8)

A few highlights:

\+ Met Vitalik Buterin in Shenzhen, China. Wow. Closest I've ever come to meeting an extraterrestrial. I don't mean that in a bad way, either. The guy towered above me (I'm not that tall); he was lanky and gaunt; I could see him thinking about 12 different things while talking to me -- each of them far more important than the small-talk-chitchat he was having with me.

\+ Met John McAfee in Singapore. What a character! Listen to this: I ask him what he thinks about the environmental impact of BTC mining (the hot topic at the time). He tells me ""I'll keep MGT mining BTC until the last polar bear drowns.""

\+ Volunteered at a diving school in Palawan, Philippians. It was a workaway type of place. The guy running it, Thad, was doing great things -- teaching local kids how to become dive masters so they could earn a good living diving with tourists. Great dude. A little paranoid when talking about him and crypto, but wow, in it from the early days.

\+ Myanmar (Burma). Holy damn. What a country. Incredible ancient ruins. Delicious food. And the friendliest people going through some of the toughest governmental financial bullshit. Corruption, wild inflation, demonetization. And people there would love to use BTC more often to free themselves financially (being part of the unbanked, after all) but they have some of the most fundamental difficulties: (1) shitty cellphone coverage and (2) rampant power outages.

\+ Colmar, France. I met one of my hero's .... Anthony Bourdain. Talked to him about food, travel, Bitcoin. A week later. One week after shaking my hand....he took his life. I keep wishing I would have said something. The right thing. Maybe I could have made a difference.

\+ Amsterdam.  Used a bit of my almost-running-out-BTC to taste true wormwood Absinthe. I saw visions of Bitcoin absolutely crushing governmental fiat and putting Jamie Dimon and Charlie Munger on the streets! Haha no, I wish.

\+ Finally made it! 1 BTC! Tonder, Denmark. Just across the border from Germany. I thought I'd make it to Copenhagen. I didn't -- but that's okay. It was a wild ride that opened my eyes in all sorts of ways. Sure I spent months and months sleeping on Couchsurfer's cots, eating the cheapest grocery store mark-down foods, and generally wishing I had cashed out in December --- but I would do it all over again, without cashing out either. Because being on such a strict budget forced me to meet people.

Often times we feel tempted to use money to avoid pains. If I traveled on a big budget I could have stayed in hotels. Instead I couchsurfed, met amazing hosts, and told them all about BTC -- which sharpened my own knowledge. If I was on a bigger budget I could have stuck around certain cities and gone to BTC meetup's only on their set dates. But being on a budget I had to reach out to meetup hosts and hope they'd make time to meet me, trade BTC for fiat, and perhaps even introduce me to their crypto friends -- and they did, every time, because the crypto community is awesome. Around the world I met absolute badass crypto OG's, movers-and-shakers, and newbies too. Learned something from everyone :)

I suppose my mission resulted in a resounding answer: crypto will set us free.

So cheers to a few specific cool cats out there as well as the community at large: Thank you.

personalfinance,Seeking advice/tutorial on to manage a reckless 71/M's finances and make sure maxing out government assistance,"Hello Reddit. I would really appreciate any information you can provide to help me manage a difficult situation. Suffice it to say that my father is a really horrible person, has hurt everyone around him including me, and all I am trying to do is help him stay afloat while minimizing contact with him.

&amp;#x200B;

BACKGROUND: (this can be skipped but I'm trying to explain what a crazy/reckless/willful/destructive person this man is even at 71 years old)

Just to give you a flavor so you understand how difficult it is to help/control him, my husband and I bought a house for him and pay the property taxes. He's been there 6 years. A few of the things he's done while there. (1) Cut out a window of the house because he wanted to enlarge it with a custom window. Then proceed to ask for what ended up being about $1000 for ""parts"" to build and add a new window. For 3 years there was a whole in the house he kept covered with a tarp during winters. Winters in the Poconos are pretty cold. (2) Although he has no money, he somehow accumulates massive amounts of junk (wood he bought and then left to rot in the rain, old machinery he gets I don't know where, old clothing he gets I don't know where) and then we have twice given him more than $500 for ""garbage removal"" (in addition to paying for the normal weekly garbage services). When he asked a third time we refused. So basically he does all sorts of money intensive and property destroying things without asking us and despite numerous protests/requests etc to just not freaking make house-altering actions. So this is to give you a flavor of how he doesn't listen but just shakes us down for money. We bought him the house and pay the property tax and otherwise try not to do anything except if he contacts in a dire emergency. This is because when we first started helping him out we did things like pay the electric which he abused (running electric heat instead of using the wood burning stove despite us buying wood...which he left to rot), running the electric heat while leaving the door and window open to get some air, running an AC in the summer even though it's only 70 degrees outside. We also initially gave him a credit card (he abused this running up hundreds of dollars a month at Home Depot for no clear purpose) and then some cash (he kept doing home-destroying things so we stopped giving him money so as not to enable this). So we have tried any way we could to help him not have emergencies and it doesn't work. Oh we have also bought him 2 cars which he complains about as in they're not good enough yadda yadda yadda.

&amp;#x200B;

Bottom line: At 36 years old I have spent almost half my life contributing to this man's support and I have really had it emotionally and financially. I really want to have nothing to do with him and want to make sure he is getting as much as he can from the government. I pay lots of taxes and I feel totally strung out and like I can't do this anymore and like I have pulled more than my fair weight for this problem and now society should step it up a bit more. Want to see how to lessen contact even more and make sure he is accessing all government benefits possible.

END BACKGROUND:

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where he's at. He gets $660 a month in social security net (I saw on the statement $50 is garnished to pay my mother back child support and $134 is""SMI Premium"" &lt;- what is this?). I initially helped him apply for food stamps and home heating assistance with the help of a social worker. He claims these have been cut over the years, so I don't have details as to what he is receiving and whether he is doing all the applications he can for relevant benefits. He lives in a house we own and we pay the property tax so he has no costs associated with rent.

&amp;#x200B;

He claims he has the following monthly expenses, but doesn't provide proof:

$147 auto insurance (doesn't this seem high? my auto insurance is about $600/year in NYC)

$61 internet (this also seems high to me....I wonder if he is buying more than the bare minimum)

$40 cell phone (ditto...seems like he could get by on a lower plan...and this is in addition to the free cell phone he got from the federal government via some program unless he doesn't have it anymore...but he certainly did in the past)

$120 gas money (this seems like a lot for gas each month. he can't work due to a criminal record...so there is nowhere he really has to go...and $120 seems like several hundred miles worth of driving each month...whereas he lives 6 miles from town so even to socialize he doesn't need to drive that far....)

$200 food and pocket money as he describes (he occasionally asks us to order pet food for him which we do because we don't want his numerous cats and 1 dog to starve...I know food is expensive but I definitely have gotten by on less than this per month just a few years ago when I was watching my own expenses so this also seems high relative to his income)

$100 electric bill for the month of August. For reference all appliances run off electricity (water, oven, etc), but to me this still seems high for a month with lots of daylight hours. I'm just sort of like wtf is he doing to run up that kind of electric bill.

$133 / month medicare supplement (well it's technically $514 per quarter)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So a few concrete questions:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) Does someone who only has around $660 monthly income at age 71 really have to purchase a $500/quarter ($2000/year!?!?!) medicare supplement when he is clearly living below the poverty line? My father is a classic narcissist so I can imagine he bought himself something fancy rather than take the government entitlement.

(2) Reality check for gas and electric monthly expenses in NE PA. Am I being too harsh or is he spending way too much relative to what is really necessary? I am not interested in telling him never to leave his house and to drive nowhere, but seems like even if he drove to town everyday there's no reason to be spending $120/month on gas (he has a regular V4 sedan, some Japanese car which should have reasonable gas mileage)

(3) Auto insurance of $147/month?!?! seriously?!?! what am I missing?

(4) Any advice on how to deal with this kind of intractable relative? How can I get the government more involved? I don't think the details of my abused childhood are interesting, but it takes an emotional toll on me that is really heavy every time I have to interact with him and I feel like I want to vomit every time I give him money. I'd like to minimize this for my own well being. I feel I have done more than what I owe this person and yet when I get a midnight text that he will die and needs a certain medication or has run out of food etc and I need to act I can't quite bring myself to do nothing.

(5) What is the SMI Premium of $134/month? I just don't get it. If my father is below the poverty line is it really necessary that he pay $134 \* 12 + $500 \* 2 = $3600 a year when his income (not even counting net just total social security of $844) is only around $10,000 per year?!?! I know the US is shitty for benefits, but is it this shitty or is he choosing to make the situation worse? How is he not eligible for medicaid for example?!?! (I know nothing about public assistance and need to know how to get educated about this).

Thanks Reddit and I apologize if this is not the place to post. I will gladly edit/add details if asked. Please give me any helpful advice you can!",finance

personalfinance,Which to focus on: Student Loans or Mortgage,"Taking some steps to improve our financial situation and am curious on your thoughts on where to focus. 


Relevant Info:

- Wife recently finished residency and started as a new Pediatrician at ~$130,000 per year. She'll be eligible for a few bonuses later on, will get a raise ($to $140k) next year, and then will be based on RVU's after that. 

- I am mostly a Stay at Home Dad. I was working FT ($52k), but was laid off this summer and we decided that I can just take care of the kid (7 months old). I do some odd jobs and will join the work force PT in the next year or so (her schedule is a bit wacky at the moment)

- We don't many kinds of debt: own the cars, no CC, etc., just student loans and the house. 

- We have about $150k in investments (mutual funds, mostly) and another ~$50k sitting in our previous 401(k)s (an issue for another day will be the best way to deal with these). Roughly $30k in the bank (emergency fund + savings. We have some house repairs to make in the near future that will probably eat half of this). 

My question regards Student Loans vs. Mortgage. At this point, they are pretty equal. 

- Her Loans: $318,000 at about 6.5%. Currently payments are $350 a month; this will change next year due to her increase in salary this year. 
- My student loans: $24,000 at around 4%. Payments at $305 monthly. 
- Mortgage: We owe right around $310,000 at 6.5%. We pay $1595 per month towards principle and interest (with property tax, insurance, HOA, CCD, etc., it's right around $2000). 


We've been discussing how to attack her student loans, but I'm curious if that is the best course of action. Since the house and her loans are roughly the same amount at the same interest rate, which is the better option?

Different thoughts:

- We increase our equity, not to mention we live in an area that is currently going through a huge building surge. Property values are expected to go up (but we'll see, of course). 
- We purchased the house on a physician's loan (before I was laid off, so we may have acted differently). We don't have PMI, but I read about refinancing as soon as we pay off what would have been the 20% down. At regular payments, we'll be there in about two years. We've been in the house less than a year. 
- Her student loan payments should shoot up pretty high next year (or sooner) (although I'm not sure how to know what they'll be until paperwork is processed). 
- Mentally, we've discussed tackling the loans first while she was in residency. Paying these off would be a huge mental relief. 
- We plan on moving in 5-7 years. If the house isn't paid off, we can still move and sell/rent the property. The student loans will follow us around and can't really make us money. 
- We may not be able to deduct her student loan interest (although I'm still learning about this), but could deduct mortgage interest. 


Am I missing anything else? Does one direction make more sense than another? Of course, we want to look at refinancing the student loans (although she consolidated them not too long ago). If one of the interest rates were to drop, we could decide how to proceed. Seeing how they're roughly the same amount at similar interests, I'm curious how we should think about this. 

Thanks!


TL;DL - we have $318k in student loans at 6.5% and $310 in a Mortgage at 6.5%. Outside of refinancing to change these numbers, which would be the best debt to tackle first?",finance
personalfinance,Need advice. Been working full-time as a part-time employee and want the extra benefits.,"I am kind of in a sticky situation and I have no idea how to proceed at this point so I was hoping I could get some advice here. I believe this is the right pace to post this.

I currently work part-time at my company, working close to 40 hours each week. PT hours are supposed to be 25 hours per week average. There have only been a couple weeks this year that I was not at or above 35 hours. My average this year is 36.71 hours a week. 

I have been with this company for 1.5 years and when I was hired I was promised as soon as they were able to, they would move me to full-time (which I know is never a real promise, but you know). Just for some backstory, I left my previous employer due to some personal reasons. I was a manager for 3 years working full-time, so I came to work at this company as part-time to basically have a job and advance here. 

Anyways, a full-time position opened up, I applied, and didn't get it. I later found out that If I would have gotten that job, they would have had to remove my PT job which would have left us understaffed. I also have been suggesting that they just turn my position into a FT position, but keep being told that ""things take a while here"". 

So my problem is this: I am working full-time hours but not getting the full-time benefits (which includes 1 extra week vaca, 1 week sick days, and 150-250 extra bonus every 3 months). I am hesitant to reach out to HR or anyone higher because I need the extra hours financially and I am afraid if it gets out I am working this many hours, they will reduce my hours down to 25/week. 

Is there anything I can do aside from apply to other FT positions in the company?

edit: I want to note that I am not complaining, just merely seeing if there is anything I can do. Don't know if it matters, but I am in Maryland, USA.",finance
personalfinance,"Balancing emergency fund with debt payments, how should I rebuild my financial situation?","Ive just completed nursing school and I am now employed at a hospital in Florida at the rate of $25/hour. I am limited to not exceeding 40 hours per week during my 10-12 week orientation period, after which I am able to pick up overtime shifts at $37.50/hour if I desire to.  
  
Here's a quick synapses of my situation:  
Myself, wife and 3 month old baby.   
$850/m rent from family friend, no lease.   
Wife stays home with baby but is not against a work-from-home or side-hustle opportunity.   
  
I work 3 days per week, ~13 hour shifts. This gives me 4 days per week to explore extra income to help my situation.  
  
Through the last 18 months of college, we've reduced our savings to nearly zero ($138 dollars as it sits).   
We've increased our credit card debt to nearly 90% utilization. Somewhere around $14,000 for me and likely the same for my wife. That last sentence was hard to type.  
  
I am expecting my new income to be approximately $4000/month gross. And I am hoping around $3300 after taxes (I claim 3 allowances, and there is no state income tax, $250/m health insurance).   
  
I need to rebuild my emergency fund obviously, but I also need to start paying off these atrocious credit cards. They are all pretty high interest, in the 18-24% range. I have read the avalance and snowball method and will be implimenting one once I get my first check in early October.  
  
I have a balance transfer card which I will need to pay down first before the 18 month zero interest rate expires. I have about 6 months left and it's around $5000. This should be easy to pay off.

personalfinance,"How much, proportionally to your wealth, do you keep around in cash?","I've been told by someone with more financial knowledge than me that it's good to keep some of one's wealth in cash, preferably stashed in some kind of account that earns interest (e.g. CD or money market account).

One reason is to hedge against market volatility and recessions; even if you a have a heavily diversified portfolio among conservatively managed funds, there's still a risk that your liquidity can suffer sudden drops. The other reason is to have cash at hand that might be needed for unexpected expenses, of course.

[This](https://www.thebalance.com/how-much-cash-should-i-keep-in-my-portfolio-357127) article sums it up pretty well. Even successful investors maintain a large portion of their wealth in hard cash.

Of course, even with money market accounts and CDs, the interest rate is fairly low, and you'd barely be beating inflation, and you'd also be paying taxes on the gains (and in some areas/countries, wealth tax on the cash itself). On the other hand, a large amount can be insured by FDIC or similar arrangements, so you're safe against anything except inflation.

What's less clear to me is what proportion of one's total wealth one should set aside this way. For example, let's say you had $1m in assets, with a stable job, no debt, no plans to retire, no plans to spend much funds except for day-to-day expenses and maybe a vacation now and then. *Ignoring emergency funds*, what kind of cash allocation might be sensible? 20%? 30%? 50%?",finance

I work part-time and currently earn about $26,000/year. I live in New York City, but my scholarship means that I only pay about $18,000/year on tuition and my dormitory. My scholarship ends in May 2019. I have subsidized federal student loans, but I have about the same amount invested in mutual funds.

The lowest that they said was $110,000/year, and nearly all of the positions are in New York City. These positions mostly align with my desired career path. They can't get me anything sooner because, according to them, companies don't hire this far in advance. However, none of them can guarantee a job.

Banking,Unauthorized transactions through authorized and verified means,"Hi folks,

I got a call last night about unauthorized charges on my account. When the specialist listed the charges, he said they were for Steam, the online PC game store, which is a service I've used for over a decade now. 

As it turns out, my 16 year old brother in law was using my computer at the time, was playing a game I frequently play using my Steam account, grabbed my wallet, used my debit card info, was asked to verify micro transactions, went to the card issuers website and was able to login with auto fill data, verified the transactions, then made the purchases. This 100% makes it look like these transactions were valid.

I said these transactions weren't valid, and the standard process ensued. I used to work for a bank, so I'm a little familiar with this process but not sure about this particular situation.

When issuing a chargeback from ""debit card security"" (falcon) you're required to fill out an affadavit stating what happened and you're disputing the charges. From there they issue a provisional credit and investigate the legitimacy of the claim. My concern is that they will quickly be able to see these authorized channels were used, and retract that credit. Thereby meaning I have to eat the charges.

My question is: I've seen on commerce.gov that unauthorized debit card transactions are 100% refundable. Does anyone know if that liability (under federal regulation)  falls on the bank, or falcon? Is the only way of pursuing this is by going through falcon and the affidavit? Or is the bank liable to roll back the charges on their end if the falcon investigation proves to be ""false""?

I've already tried working with the merchant. This type of transaction cannot in any way be reversed by them. Their policy is air tight to prevent abuse, even so far as to only issue reimbursements (for qualified events) in the account's digital wallet which cannot be converted to cash. I want to know the best way about doing this before I start that process and lose my money.

personalfinance,Credit Union threatening to raise interest raise over vehicle title.,"Maybe this is the wrong sub, and if so apologies, but I ran into a situation that I'm not quite sure how to handle. A few years ago my wife bought her leased vehicle and both her and I got a loan from my credit union to do so. I've been a member there for about 10 years and they offered a good rate.   
Fast forward about 6 months and they send us a letter saying that they never got the title from the institution that did the lease. We called the credit union and they tell us to call the other financial institution and tell them to send it over. We did that and told the credit union that we did and they said okay and that was all we needed to do.   
  
Fast forward about 18 months later and we get another letter from our credit union saying the same thing, but the loan is almost 2 years in now. My wife forgot to call them to see what the deal was but fast forward to today and the credit union leaves me a voicemail saying that they have an audit coming up and need that title and if they don't have it by a certain date that they are going to raise the interest rate on the existing loan a LOT.   
  
I haven't had a chance to call them back as they called right before they closed and I was still working. I'm furious though that this is how they handle it, by threatening to raise the interest rate on our loan by over 5x. My wife and I both work hard to keep our credit good and our interest rates low and are confused by why we are responsible to get them this when we've never even physically had the title. It's like they are wanting to punish us because they didn't do their due diligence. And, as a long time member who has used them exclusively for everything over the past decide except our mortgage, I'm a little irritated how this has played out. We always have money in our accounts, we always pay our loans on time, we have multiple accounts with them and have never had any issues at all.   
  
Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? Sure we can call the previous lease holder again and ask them to send it, but we've already done that and they said they sent it. Not only that but the credit union said back during that time that we had done what we needed to do. Now because they have an audit coming up they want to threaten us.

personalfinance,Should I trade in my vehicle to get a lower payment and/or better vehicle.,"First time posting here but looking for some advice. I just turned 21 years old, currently make 45k a year. I am not married and took over the payments on my parents old home which is almost payed off. I have no other debt besides one of my vehicles. 
I have a 2014 Frontier that I bought this past December at a 10% interest rate making the payments 310 a month. My credit score is now a 740 after building some history and my dad has advised me to refinance with our credit union or trade in my truck and get something of similar value to lower my payment. I went to my credit union and got approved for a loan for a used vehicle at 3.29%. The bank advised me to not refinance with them because they’re refinance rate is 7.5%. I have about $1000 in equity in my truck since I’ve been making double payments to help pay it off faster. 

Not to sure what to do in this situation. There’s nothing wrong with my truck but I wouldn’t mind getting another frontier if I could save $60 a month. (The estimated savings from the bank.) 

I have half of my years salary in a savings. My other vehicle is a  Nissan 370Z that I bought cash. Which is worth more than my Frontier - but I had purchased the frontier to have a bigger vehicle that I can daily drive.  It makes sense to me at least to trade in my truck and get something to lower my payments. I don’t want to sell my 370z and have decided to not use my savings to pay off my truck. 

But maybe I’m not seeing something or I shouldn’t go through with it. All advice appreciate thank you!

With that setup, the solar company was able to cover 88% of my energy bill costing me $211 a year. The system is also projected to produce ~$1800 worth of SRECs per year and I’ll get a federal tax credit of $8k. Is this a good deal? 

My other question is about SREC management. Is it better to pay electric bill with SRECs then use the extra towards the principal of the loan or just use it all towards the principal?",energy
personalfinance,I feel like I'm never going to save money,"I don't know what to do anymore, I cut down all my bills and spending enough so that at the end of each month I will be able to put $500 into my savings. The issue is every month something comes up that I didn't plan for that makes it so I cannot save that $500. 
 

Month 1 - my car needed new tires $750

Month 2 - my phone fell and screen cracked $200

Month 3 - had a plumbing issue with my parents house $900. I pay for emergency things like this because I live with them rent free so I help out when they have unexpected expenses. My goal is to eventually buy my own house but it seems like it will never happen. 

Month 4 - my car was towed by the city because they needed to do emergency road work. While towing it they broke my muffler and passenger side skirt. So I had to pay to get the repairs done. - $670 (I opened a claim with the city to get this back but it seems like a losing battle because there's no record of my car being towed since they didn't tow it to a lot. They just moved it to another parking spot a block away. I also got a parking ticket for $135 because they left it near a fire hydrant. When I went to court to fight the ticket I lost because I had no proof they towed it there)

Month 5 - needed a root canal and with my insurance I was still responsible for $475 out of pocket. 

Month 6 - someone did a hit and run to my parked car in front of my house. The damage was extensive so I had to go through my insurance to get it repaired. My deductible was $1000

Month 7 (this month) - my laptop (bought in 2012) is on it's last leg and I need it for work so I have to replace it with a somewhat decent one. I didn't purchase anything yet but the ones I'm looking at is between $600-$800.


I'm just so fed up with everything. I feel like I'm never going to accomplish my goals. I'm over 30 and still live in my parents basement because apartment prices are absolutely insane here. If my parents didn't let me live here they could easily rent this basement out for $1600 a month. My goal is to buy a house but I feel like it's never going to happen even though I make decent money (~45k). I'm looking at the cheapest areas here and the houses are still over 600k. And because I don't have a house it's impossible to date/settle down with anyone because it's not easy to bring people to my parents basement, I did a few times but they immediately lose interest in me.


I'm not sure where I was going with all this because looking at my post there's really no question. I guess my question is if anyone can offer advice to help me get out of this situation. Any tips that can help with part time opportunities or a side business to further increase my income? It seems like the only thing that can really change my situation is a higher income and I already get paid pretty good for my field so I don't see an increase happening with my regular 9-5 job.",finance
personalfinance,Question about 1099 vs W9 and the breakdown of costs/benefits for both employee and employer,"I'm currently on 1099 and want to understand what I'm paying for being 1099 as opposed to W2. I very much feel like I'm on the wrong side of this equation - first because my job is really not something I can do from home, which makes putting on 1099 illegal, correct? Second, I'm paying taxes and health insurance premiums, which is something my employer would cover if I was W2, correct (or at least cover a portion). 

Could someone help me break down this basic example? ""Base salary"" - $40,000; ""sales commissions"" - $20,000. Gross take home would be $60,000. Say I'm paying $15,000 in taxes (state/federal) and $5,000 in health insurance and deduct that from my ""base"", does that not cut it in half making my net take home $40,000? Does the employee benefit at all from being 1099, financially speaking? Is there a way to calculate what my employee is saving on my behalf by having me 1099 with a ""base salary"" of $40,000 as opposed to having me W2 with a salary of $40,000? I'm fairly young, so I don't have the luxury of a lot to write-off tax wise that I thinks comes with being an ""independent contractor"". Is my employer just cheating the system?

edit: changed W9 to W2 in the posting, not sure if I can change the title - I mean W2 (not W9, sorry for any confusion)",finance

I'm a 20 year old college student in WA state, I am on track to graduate with less than $3000 in student debt. In addition the sum of my other debts is as follows, a $2000 car loan, $500 on a credit card, and that is it. I am receiving $23000 from my Tribe due to a large settlement my tribe won from the Federal Government. I will be receiving the money by the middle of December of this year. My monthly income is roughly $3000, though almost all of that is either financial aid or work relating to the college and I am expecting to graduate in September of 2019. My expenses are only about $1400 a month. I pay $0 for tuition since I receive a 100% Tuition Waiver from the state. 

So the real thing here that I need advice on is, Where should I go from here with this extra money that I had neither budgeted nor planned for? I know to start off with paying off my high interest car loan and credit card debt almost immediately. But beyond that I don't really know what to do, My father who is a veteran mentioned looking at VA Home loans to potentially use the cash as a down payment on a home.

worldpolitics,Does the Federal Reserve profit from US debt?,"I've watched a few videos on YouTube lately regarding the formation of the fed in 1913. It states that it relates back to people profiting from national debt. Bankers such as Rothschild, Rockefeller and Morgan helped create this. So by my understanding, the government borrows money from this 'private central bank' which can print money. They then have to pay back this 'private central bank' the money they borrowed plus interest. The more they borrow the more profits this private bank makes. So hypothetically if you have illegal influence within politics you can set up scenarios like wars and financial crises that involve an increased level of federal debt. The more debt, the more profit. Am I missing something here? A lot of these videos get really angry and leave a lot of questions and details out and I don't know where to start in getting accurate information, I'm not studying economics or anything like that.",finance

CryptoCurrency,AM Crypto News Recap: Cryptocurrencies are mixed after yesterday’s rally as Chinese search engine giant Baidu publishes white paper detailing a ‘Super Chain’,"### Crypto News

* A Swiss-based startup headed by former UBS bankers, SEBA Crypto AG, has raised 100 million Swiss Francs (USD$103 million) to build a bank that offers crypto related services. SEBA Crypto AG plans to apply for a banking and security dealer license through Switzerland’s financial market regulator, FINMA. This license would allow SEBA Crypto AG to partake in crypto trading and investing on behalf of other banks and qualified investors.  
* A US federal district judge ruled that an alleged fraudulent cryptocurrency scam can be classified as a commodity and falls under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC sued alleged fraudulent coin, My Big Coin Pay, after the individuals behind the coin misled investors by releasing a series of false statements. The coin raised roughly USD$6 million from investors while claiming the coin was backed by gold.   
* According to two US financial experts, North Korea is utilizing cryptocurrencies in order to evade US sanctions. Lourdes Miranda, a financial crimes investigator, and Ross Delston, an expert in anti-money laundering and combatting financing of terrorism, believe that North Korea is making its own cryptocurrency while also using popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Earlier this year, former NSA cybersecurity official, Priscilla Moriuchi, said that North Korea is likely earning between USD$15 million and USD$200 million per year by mining and selling cryptocurrencies.  
* Australia’s Taxation Office has warned citizens of scammers impersonating tax officials and demanding tax debs be paid in cryptocurrencies. Scammers have called Australian citizens and threatened that if tax debts were not cleared urgently, the federal police would place them under arrest.  
* Chinese search engine and web services company, Baidu, has released the, “Baidu Blockchain White Paper V1.0” that describes a, “Super Chain” network system. Released Wednesday, the paper lays out the idea of developing a blockchain-as-a-service platform that would house six of Baidu’s current applications, including Totem, Degree Universe, Baidu Association, Treasure Chest, Encyclopedia Online, and Hubert. Baidu’s white paper claims that the, “Super Chain” is more efficient than a traditional blockchain and has an ability to perform with a higher degree of hardware utilization.  
* Marsh, a global professional services firm, announced Wednesday that it would be working with IBM Blockchain to expand its efforts to offer insurance solutions. Marsh will be launching a commercial version of its insurance verification program on IBM Blockchain in order to streamline the insurance certification process, adding speed and transparency for clients seeking to hire contractors.  
* State-owned Chinese bank, Bank of Communications, completed a massive 9.3 billion yuan (USD$1.3 billion) residential mortage backed security issuance using a blockchain network. In order to complete this issuance, Bank of Communications used its Jucai Chain blockchain network, which was first rolled out in June for asset-backed security issuances. Veem, a blockchain payments startup, has closed its USD$25 million fund round that was led by Goldman Sachs. Veem also received funding from other notables, including GV (formerly Google Ventures), Silicon Valley Bank, and Pantera Capital. Veem aims to offer a payments platform that includes both traditional SWIFT-based transfers and blockchain networks.  
* West Virginians have begun using a blockchain-based mobile app to cast absentee ballots in the upcoming midterm election, according to a report by Slate. Voatz allows citizens of West Virginia that are overseas and registered in one of 24 countries to cast absentee ballots via smartphones. Pilot testing for Voatz started in March of this year and was successfully completed in May after passing four audits assessing security of various components.

personalfinance,SEP IRA and the IRS,"Greetings.

&amp;#x200B;

My MIL is about 3 years into a 10 year repayment plan for unpaid federal taxes.  She is in her mid 60's and owns her business.  She has no retirement savings, rents a house from my wife and I where she lives/works, and has no appreciable assets to her name (also divorced).

&amp;#x200B;

Can she contribute to a SEP IRA or other retirement savings account/plan while paying the IRS?

&amp;#x200B;

My wife seems to think that because of the repayment plan being based on my MIL's income and expenses that any additional income from the business would need to be reported and given over to the IRS because of the failure to pay taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I was pretty sure that the IRS wouldn't take tax deferred savings that already existed if they aren't being drawn against, nor would they prevent you from saving for a future retirement because of past tax problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I could very well be wrong, but it seems short sighted for the federal government to prohibit allowed savings that would keep her off social assistance programs once she officially retires.

ethereum,Announcing EthHub and how you can help.,"Hi everyone!

A few months back I finally got fed up with the excess of misinformation being spread about Ethereum. I started to think of a solution and at the same time realized there was no single place for Ethereum users to go and read information about basic concepts, the roadmap, scaling solutions, monetary policy, dapp walkthroughs, common myths, or whatever it might be.

I discussed the ideas with some fellow Eth buddies and decided to finally set out and try to solve this problem. We are calling it [EthHub](https://www.ethhub.io).

Phase 1 is the content hub. It is open source and anyone can submit content via pull requests on our repo. We've been working on writing the original documentation and the initial page buildout can be found [here](https://github.com/econoar/ethhub/blob/master/SUMMARY.md). We will launch the site once these base pages are all ready to go. **If you see anything you're interested in writing about or even would like to submit a new page, we could use the help!**

We're doing this in our free time and not for profit because we think it's a necessary tool for the Ethereum ecosystem.

The best way to follow us and our progress for now is on our twitter: [https://twitter.com/ethhub\_io](https://twitter.com/ethhub_io)

personalfinance,Help with where to put extra money,"I’m trying to figure out best place to put some extra money at the end of the year. For background, my husband and I are both 35yo with 1 child and will hopefully be adding 1 or 2 more kids in the future. We had a very busy year so far in 2018 so currently don’t look great on paper. Purchased a new home a few months ago, and then purchased a farm as well (part of the family business) even though the financial timing wasn't great as it was a great opportunity.  We already have fully funded 6 month Emergency fund. Currently maxing out my work 403b at $18,500/yr and I have excellent match from work that is a percentage of my salary. Current value is $312,000, all in the Vanguard 2050 Index fund.   My husband has fairly small income but is putting 40% of each paycheck into his 403b (about $5000/yr). Current value is $44,000, also all in the Vanguard 2050 Index fund. We are putting $500/month to 529 for our son. We do the Dependent care and Healthcare re-imbursement accounts. 

Current Debt:

House Mortgage (Purchased 5/2018): 570,000 @ 4.375% 

*Payment: $3400/month 

Farm Mortgage (Purchased 6/2018): 281,500 @ 6.1%

*Payment: $22,230/YEAR

Personal Loan to Parents: 30,000 @ 1%

*Only term is must be paid off in 5 years. 


Farm will generate income from sale of the grain. This will likely be $10-12K, which will be used to pay toward the mortgage. Saving for yearly payment of $14K (to give a bit of cushion).  Payment due July each year, so setting a monthly amount aside to save for this. 


After all monthly bills/expenses and saving for above, there is about $2000 per month left over. So far I am just putting all extra into a separate Barclays account at 1.85%. There will be $6000-7000 of extra in savings by the end of the year (not exactly sure how much as we do need to work on furnishing our new house). A few more details:
*House appraised at $685,000
*Farm appraised at $325,500
*Not paying any PMI on either mortgage
*Do have the ability to re-cast our house mortgage any time
*Farm mortgage is through Farm Credit and they have said re-financing for lower interest rate in 1-2 years is very likely (but that is assuming interest rates don’t sky rocket though, so not counting on this).  


I figure my options are:

1. Open an IRA with backdoor Roth and set this up with a Bogle head 3 fund portfolio

2. Put extra toward the house mortgage to get closer to 80% of value to be safe

3. Put extra toward farm mortgage as it is high interest

Would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions. Thanks everyone!",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans - Nelnet approved consolidation on a defaulted loan but failed to pay US Dept ED. Now being threatened with Wage Garnishment. What can I do?,"I graduated school in 2010 and immediately left my home state, moved to another, and then started working. In 2012 I defaulted on my loan and went through the rehabilitation process and got it into good standing. I moved again and failed to maintain contact so the loan got into a bad state again. 

In 2016 I received a letter from the US Dept Education stating their intent to collect upon the loan. Once I received this I called them and they informed me to go to Myeddebt.com and file for consolidation. 

In January of 2017 it was approved and Nelnet agreed to consolidate the loan. After it was approved I went back to myeddebt.com and verified that I had no balance. 

In April of 2017, I noticed a change to my credit report that the loan they I just opened with them defaulted so I immediately called Nelnet. They saw no issue with my account and just told me to call US Dept Education. 

I called US Dept of ED them and they confirmed that they saw a credit to my eddebt account from Nelnet but also a loan in the same amount as in collections. 

I have called Nelnet constantly through the past year and a half and never get passed a frontline representative that can verify everything I have experienced, but are unable to help me. 
 
Just recently received a notice of intend to garnish wages and submitted all my paperwork supporting that I consolidated my loan as well as documents that showed the approved consolidation with a list of the dollar amounts of each loan which matched the dollar amount of each loan that US Dept ED wants to collect on.

This was denied and they want to go ahead with the wage garnishment unless I set up a payment plan with their debt collection or appeal the process in Federal District Court. 

I'm a total mess right now. I thought I was doing the right thing and made numerous attempts to fix the issue but never could get in contact with someone that could put 2 and 2 together. 

I've talked to a few lawyers who specialize in settlements but they can't seem to help in this situation because it is in their words, unique. 

I know and admit I screwed up after school. I followed their steps to correct it but it feels like a computer glitch somewhere is going to cost me $50k on top of the approved consolidation of $37K.

To me it feels like Nelnet failed to fulfill their contractual agreement with me to pay US Dept of ED.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance Experience,"We are a couple in our mid-thirties with fairly good finances overall, but my spouse's student loan from grad school had never been a priority since graduating almost 8 years ago. We finally refinanced her Federal Direct loans through Private refinancing and wanted to share the experience. The loan balance was roughly $122k @ 7.38% fixed. Both our credit scores are in the low-800 range. I applied as a co-signer.

We had been aggressively putting $750 extra per month since 2 years ago and more recently $1250 extra each month since 6 months ago. But even then our most optimistic timeline to aggressively pay-off the loan was roughly 7 years. We set out to seek a 5 year old term and bank extensive savings from cutting the interest rate down.

We looked at several lenders. Navy Federal and Pentagon Federal Credit Union, were the first contenders since I am a member.  Navy Federal's rates were quite high; 4.99% I believe. Pentagon's was slightly lower, but still in 4.15% range, I believe.

We did pre-approvals with CommonBond, ELFI and SoFI. Weirdly enough, CommonBond denied us due to only being able to consider either the applicant or the co-signer's income, but not both. ELFI pre-approved us, but SoFI pre-approved us for a better rate at 3.9%.

The experience of applying with SoFI was amazingly easy and blazingly fast! We went from pre-approval to final approval in a matter of 24-36 hours. While, we were in the 3-day cancellation window, I decided to check in with LendKey and it made all the difference! We ended up cancelling with SoFI and refinancing with LendKey in the end.

Here's why we went with LendKey. We were able to get pre-approved with a Credit Union out of the Midwest at a rock-bottom rate of 3.49%. The experience with LendKey was pretty good, but slower. It did take longer compared to SoFI. Roughly two weeks to get final approval. However, it was all worth it. The 0.4% in interest rate difference alone saved us $2600 in interest savings compared to 3.9% with SoFi.

All in all, we were able to refinance with LendKey @ 3.49% and expect to pay off the loan in 5 years straight and bank roughly $20k in interest savings. SoFi is also a great option, but try LendKey first!",finance

1. I am responsible for payments of tax on imputed interest based on the applicable federal rate. It is stated that ""the IRS treats the difference between the interest that would have been assessed using the current AFR and the zero interest assessed on this loan as compensation."" Given my current mortgage rate (3.9%), am I losing out if I take this interest-free loan, and pay taxes on this money?

personalfinance,Over whelmed by monthly payments and debt,"My whole life I was financially irresponsible, I impulse spent all the time and never had enough money to pay basic bills.  I opened credit cards, took out loans, and spent money as if I had millions. I also was unable to hold down a job and would frequently walk out of jobs when I was stressed. I also got a DUI during this time, leaving me with $2700 in court fees (I paid that off luckily) and a higher insurance premium. 

Three years ago I was diagnosed with type 1 bipolar disorder, and my doctor told me impulse control was a big problem with people suffering from this disorder. Since then I began a medication plan and therapy and I’m happy to say not only have I held a good paying job for two years but I have kept a budget ever since I got this job. The problem I am having is the debt I accumulated from 18-24 is killing me. I am paying every bill on time but it’s leaving me with enough money to get to work and eat $1 cup of noodles most days. And the worst part is I am only paying on the accounts that I managed to keep from defaulting. I am proud of myself for always paying my bills but I feel like I am sinking because a lot of them have high interest rates and I can only pay the minimum. 

I looked into a consolidation loan from my bank but my credit is so poor and I have so many delinquent accounts that’s just not possible. 

I am at a loss for what to do. This week I needed to refill my medication but couldn’t afford it so a nice friend commissioned some art from me so I could afford it. My phone had been broken for 3 months and my girlfriend bought me a new one because I had no way to fix it. I am 27 and live in my parents house with no end in sight. It’s soul crushingly depressing and I don’t want to fall into another depressive episode and risk my job. I have been doing so well for 2 years.

Other then my car, my debt is only around $10,000 (car is $15,000) so I don’t think I should claim bankruptcy... but I am not sure what else to do. I know this all my fault and I have no one to blame but myself, but I am at my wits end with my situation.

personalfinance,Refinance my wife's student loans before applying for mortgage,"My wife has $132K spread over 4 federal student loans, with an effective 7.9% interest rate. We just got married a month ago, and I'd like to refinance for a better rate.

She's currently on an income-based payment plan, with a minimum payment of $520/month. That minimum payment is set to balloon to $1,500 later this year, when she re-certifies and my own income will also be included in the calculation.

However, we're planning on buying a house in the next year, and I've read that our credit score can take a hit if we refinance her loans, which could lead to a higher mortgage rate. I also know that mortgage lenders look at monthly debt obligations when they determine whether or not to approve a mortgage, although I do not anticipate our monthly minimum payment would rise above the $1,500 we'll be paying later this year.

Would the potential savings in interest on her student loans be worth the potential hit we'd take on mortgage rates down the road?

In case it matters, I make ~$210K/year and my wife makes $120K/year. We would likely put down $100K down payment in order to buy $500K house.

&gt;!also references defiling and destroys a unicorn in a mostly seemingly random way intended for comedy but probably some odd form of symbolism considering Yennefer is a witch and Geralt disliked the situation in general.  “She \[Yennefer\] had a magnificent stuffed unicorn, upon whose back she liked to make love. Geralt was of the opinion that the only place even less suited for lovemaking would be the back of a live unicorn. In contrast to the witcher, who considered a bed a luxury and valued all possible applications such a wonderful piece of furniture offered, Yennefer was wildly inventive. Geralt recalled pleasant moments spent with the sorceress on the slope of a roof, in the hollow of a dead tree, on the balcony, and those of others, the railing of a bridge, a canoe, rocking unsteadily on a rushing stream and lastly while levitating thirty fathoms above the ground. But worst of all was the unicorn. One happy day, however, the thing collapsed beneath them. It ripped open and broke into pieces, causing the pair to burst into wild laughter.”!&lt;

Killing a unicorn is something considered an extremely evil act as they are an embodiment or purity and it kind of bothers me how they are killed in these tipple A games.  Going for least subtle to extremely subtle\~ to where I am probably reaching, but it still made me uncomfortable so I have an urge to share. I am not worried about the unicorn, as much as the strange occult like subtle symbolism of killing one.

Elder Scrolls: Oblivion

&gt;!\[Oblivion was the first game that has me slay a unicorn, and it was brutal. I then skinned it, and turned it into the best light armor in the game. ""the savior's hide"" which has its own evil implications.\]!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Diablo 3

&gt;!\[Diablo 3 has a more subtle, but possible more evil way of displaying the symbolism of killing unicorns. In the secret level whimsy shire you kill dozens of the creatures in an extremely bright setting, with odd music that seems in reverse. I looked into the music, as it added to the unsettling factor and came across this post, which I highly recommend any diablo fan reading. https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/u3w0z/diablo\_3\_potentially\_has\_an\_arg\_alternate\_reality/ It is an extremely good read about how evil this secret level may be. Besides that music in reverse, and going against nature is an occult homage to defying god.\]!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Monster Hunter World

&gt;!\[Finally Monster Hunter: World has you slay Kirin. This is not directly referred to as evil by the game at all, but made me uncomfortable none the less. Reason being, it is the final Elder Dragon you fight in the game and final 'assigned' mission in the game, but unlike the other Elder Dragons, Kirin has several things that set it apart from other Elder Dragons:  It is docile till attacked, it has no wings, it is probably the fourth smallest monster in the game and cant even stun you with a roar.  Being an elder dragon there is never an option to capture the Kirin, yet its armor set has a bonus to loot from captured monsters. \]!&lt;

personalfinance,22 y/o looking for help planning for the future,"Thanks in advance for the help guys. 3 months ago, I started working in San Francisco after graduating from college.

* Base salary = $80,000; paycheck every 2 weeks
* Guaranteed February pre-tax bonus = $20,000
* Rent + utilities = $1,350/month
* Monthly take-home pay = $3,700

By my understanding, I'm currently on track to max out my annual 401k contribution (23% of each paycheck for $18,500 annually). My company matches 100% up to 4%. I am exclusively using the Vanguard Institutional Target Retirement 2060 Fund (total expenses = 0.28%).

Every month, I also deposit $2,000 of my monthly take-home pay into a Bank of America savings account that I don't touch (currently planning on using those funds for emergencies or something like an eventual house down payment). I use the remainder for miscellaneous living expenses, birthday presents, etc. When I receive my bonus, I plan on depositing whatever remains post-tax into the same savings account.

I am covered under my dad's healthcare policy until I'm 26, so I haven't devoted any money to medical insurance. I was also really fortunate to not have to worry about student debt.

The ask(s):

* How can I better position my finances for the future/retirement?
* Is my 401k allocation fine?
   * Should I use additional funds outside of the 2060 Target Fund?
   * I only started contributing to my 401k with my second paycheck in July; is annualizing the right move, or should I up my monthly contribution to get as close to $18,500 as I can by the end of the calendar year?
      * What effect, if any, would either have on ""maximizing"" my company's match?
* Should/can I also add to a Roth IRA?
* Is there a better way to safely put my savings to work, since the Bank of America account's interest rate is so low (0.03% APY)?
* Am I missing or misunderstanding anything?

personalfinance,"19 y/o College student, want to responsibly stop relying on my parents","Hello all.

I am a 19 year old (soon to be 20) college sophomore studying accounting. Right now I am attending a public university and relying on scholarships, federal loans, and my parents to pay for tuition, rent, and school expenses. I am working part-time on campus and using that money to pay for my own food, groceries, and other personal expenses. I want to start moving towards being self-reliant and start building my credit, and I also want to be more responsible about my student loans. I will break down my current income, expenses, financial aid, and thought processes down below.

**Income**:

$100 per week. (10 hours per week @ $10/hour.) 


**Financial aid**: 

$6500/year scholarship from university

$2000/year scholarship

$4250 total, one-time scholarships

Federal Unsubsidized loans: $2000 (17-18), $4666 (18-19)

Federal Subsidized loans: $3500 (17-18), $1834 (18-19)


**Expenses**:

Groceries: $80-$150 per month, depending on how much I plan to cook vs. eating lunch on campus

Eating out: $20-30 per month. I get Chick-fil-A about once (sometimes twice..) per week. I plan my groceries around these purchases.

Rent: $769 per month. This one hurts.

Electricity: $12 per month(?). We just got our first power bill. Landlord covers $40 up front, rest is split 4 ways among roommates. $12 is my share.

Tuition and fees: $5800 per semester.


Basically, I am able to cover all of my food-related expenses with my income. My financial aid has been able to cover this year's expenses to the university and two months' rent. I may be able to cover December's rent by myself as well. My parents paid for my first two months out of their pocket.


As of right now I know that I can't just stop accepting help from my parents as my rent bill is just far too high. I also can't live somewhere else as 1). I signed a 10-month lease, and 2) I live in a very large city with terrible traffic and public transportation and I don't have a car. This is probably the part where I should mention that my family was immensely affected by a certain natural disaster that we were not insured for, and that is the reason I no longer have a car. That being said, I am actively applying and recruiting for potential summer internships where I could work full time for 8-10 weeks from anywhere between $15-$25/hour. I could put this money towards savings for next year's rent, my current loan balance, or into an IRA or any other form of investments. I currently don't have any invested as this is my first formal form of employment.

Additionally, I would like to look at building my credit. Right now I only use my debit card through my credit union. Now that I have a source of income, I think I could afford to get a card geared towards students, but I have absolutely no clue which one I should get.

My biggest concern is student loans. I have been way too irresponsible when it comes to monitoring the interest rates of the money I've accepted, so I don't even know that off the top of my head. I will spend one year post-graduation completing 30 hours of coursework to obtain my MS Accy degree, and the cost of that degree is really frightening. I know I'll have at least one or two internships before then to save some money but I know it won't be enough. I really don't like the thought of paying off these loans for the next 10 years.

I would really appreciate any and all advice concerning moving toward financial independence. My parents have enough to deal with debt-wise and I don't want to get in the way of that if I can help it. Thank you all.",finance

personalfinance,"New grad, new job: Max out 401(k), pay student loan debt, and/or...?","I (24/F) started a new job in the software industry ($130K/year) last month.  This is my first real job, so I don't have any previous 401(k) or assets. 

I was wondering if it would be a good idea to max out my 401(k) for 2018. (My company 401(k) doesn't offer matching until I've been there for a year, so that's not a consideration for this year...after that it's 100% match up to 5%.) I've contributed a small amount from my previous two paychecks, but I realized that if I contribute a bit more than 50% for the rest of the year, I can reach the $18,500 maximum for 2018. I've crunched the numbers, and determined that I definitely *can* do it, living expense-wise (I have about $10K in my checking account left from a sign-on bonus and previous paychecks)...the question is whether I should. Taking a huge chunk of pre-tax income and investing it seems really appealing -- but also pretty drastic. 

I also have ~$25K in federal student loans in repayment though I don't have another payment due until mid-December. (I've paid the small amount of interest off -- most of the loans were subsidized -- and put around $1000 towards the principal.)

Should I max out my 401(k)? Pay off loans? Open a savings account? I definitely plan on working on the first three, but don't have a good idea of how I should proportionally allocate that over the next three months. And should I open an IRA? (I also don't know so much about my company's 401(k) fees and how good or bad they are...what are good baselines for that?) I'll probably open an IRA by next year, regardless, but would it be a better option now?

I'm also eligible -- for 2018 anyway -- to contribute to a Roth IRA, so that's another option.

I also have an HSA through company health insurance that I contribute a small amount toward (~$140/month) with company matching up to $500/year. 

As a more general point -- I do want to start aggressively saving in a more organized/regular fashion once 2019 starts and I have a full calendar year to plan for, so suggestions welcome there too.

As a federal employee, I also get FERS, which is a defined contribution pension plan that pays 1 or 1.1 percent of your income per year of service (so if you retire at 20 years, you get 22 percent of your income for life).

Functionally, the pension seems equivalent in terms of investment security to contributing a large portion of your income to bonds, or another secure investment.

I did an online program at Full Sail University, which cost an arm and a leg (and FYI: Don't do it online. My professors kept reiterating the quality disparity between students online and students at the university was significant). It's an accelerated program, and I came within less than 6 months of getting my Bachelor's in Web Design, but some weird financial stuff came up at the end. They basically stated I needed additional money to cover the remaining balance of the final classes, which for some reason my loans alone didn't cover. As the program progresses, so too does the cost of each monthly class. At the time, I was getting unemployment due to a furlough (which turned into a full layoff eventually after coming back for a month or so), which I was able to swing into a student unemployment plan. Basically, if I attended full time at a college, I would be able to keep getting unemployment without having to pursue jobs. However, some changes in state law brought that to a close one year, and I ended up getting a job which promised to cater to my school schedule.

As is the case with any big business, they didn't.

Between trying to sort out the financial situation at my university and working a job with an unaccommodating schedule, I just decided to stop going. Due to the financial situation, I am unable to get a transcript as well until I am ""current"", which has prevented me from finishing up elsewhere, despite my current job offering a nice student reimbursement package.

The job I ended up getting at the time didn't pay well, and as a result, I requested forbearance on my federal loans. What was a relatively low student loan payment on my federal loans has ballooned due to a multitude of reasons. I requested forbearance ~~a couple~~ a lot of times since my job situation was not very secure. As of now -- with another forbearance about to end -- my total monthly payment between my federal and private loans is approx. $520/month. The private loan has an interest rate of approx 9%. With my tax return earlier this year, 1 of the 3 loans I had through the private lender I paid off in its entirety in an attempt to reduce my monthly payments. It helped, but not significantly.

My current job pays me quite nicely if it weren't for these student loans. It is commission based, so unfortunately it fluctuates, but I grossed approx $52,000-$56,000 last year. Because of the higher taxes that come out of commission, I netted around $35,000-$38,000 when all was said and done (EDIT: This is factoring in ALL deductions for health/dental/vision/etc.). What makes me feel bad about it is I know there are people with higher debts and lower income than me that have somehow made it work, but I just cannot. If I had gotten this job sooner to avoid the forbearances, or never gone to college, things would definitely be fine. Alas -- hindsight is 20/20, so let me just give a breakdown of my monthly expenses:

**Expenses:**

* *Rent:* $900/month (includes all utilities other than cable TV and Internet)
* *Student Loan Debt*: $520 between federal and personal
* *Car Payment &amp; Insurance:* $375
* *Gas*: $80-$120 depending on the month
* *Food:* $300-$350 between eating out and groceries
* *Haircut:* $20
* *Music Subscription:* $14.99
* *Internet/TV/Phone:* $130 after taxes
* *Cell Phone:* $60 after taxes
* *Credit Card:* $75/month (debt is all on one card now with 0% interest for about another year)

Total: Approx $2565/month

**Here's a list of the good things right now:**

* Utilizing all of the company match for the 401k (which according to the website is no where near enough for retirement, but something is better than nothing). The 401K will fully vest some time in Q3 2019
* Car Payment is done in 18 or so months (it *feels* like a positive because I've had this on a 72 month loan)
* All Credit Card debt is on one interest free card until Q4 2019 (approx. $2500)
* Typically keep my bank account around 1K-2K throughout the month, so there's always a bit for a rainy day fund

**Here's a list of the bad things right now:**

* **Almost no chance of a tax return this year.** I've paid off a lot more in student loans this year, but I've also taken a significant amount of allowances on my paychecks. If I do get a tax return, I'm not banking on it being much.
* Barely any leftover money to get ahead on any of the debt, or to just enjoy life beyond getting coffee occasionally
* As the industry I work in evolves, I anticipate my pay to take a pretty substantial pay hit within a year. The gravy train is definitely coming to an end sooner rather than later

I'm burnt out with this. I want to enjoy life. I want to have a relationship where I can afford a weekend trip without a problem, instead of having thing fizzle out. The Netflix/Coffee/Food/Bar cycle is awful, and an influx of money would definitely help from time to time.

Really what I'm hoping for is if somebody has any idea about my student loans and getting them lowered. $520/month is just too damn much. And if my job starts paying less like I predict, it's going to be impossible unless I move in with my parents (which is not happening). I looked into refinancing with SoFi, but they require that you have a degree. Citizens Bank was just awful, extend my debt 10 more years to save $20/month?? No thanks

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions? Advice? Additional details needed? Please let me know, and thank you for your responses.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1: Loans are split $32K in federal (interest ranges from 3.5%-7%), $11K in private (interest is at 9%)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: Thanks everyone for the replies! There's a good mix of quick changes for savings, and some that require more planning but would result in a lot of savings. As obvious as some of these seem to you, they clearly weren't to me. Food alone never seemed like enough, but with all these other suggestions, it feels like there will be enough savings factoring in all these cost cutting measures. I appreciate all the kind words, and all the bluntness

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 3: And so it begins -- begrudgingly switching my internet to a (supposedly) tax free package at $44.99/month. Approx. $85 in savings -- good start so far",finance

personalfinance,Should I buy a home?,"Hello PF,

&amp;#x200B;

Having a bit of a personal crisis trying to decide if my fiancé and I are ready to purchase a home.

We are in our late 30s w/combined yearly income of 215,000.

We want to buy a home in Washington, DC. The asking price is 700k for the home (those that know DC know this doesn't buy a lot), but the home is actually in a great area in DC that will only appreciate in value.  We have had a dream of home ownership for a long time, and this has been a goal of ours that we have been saving towards.   We finally found a great home that has all the bells and whistles we have been looking for (although it's a bit outdated and will need some repairs over time).

Here are the remaining details on our finances:

Assets:

\-100k investment account

\-20k in checking account

\-50k in Roth/SEP/401K

\-75K savings account

Debt (all my SO's):

12k -Credit Card (currently paying roughly $600 per month)

20K - student loan (currently paying roughly $200 per month)

Income:

\-165k salary

Expenses:

Food, Mortgage/Rent, Gym ($300), Utilities ($300)

The house/ mortgage:

700k offer

5% down (35k)

Closing Costs about 20K

Interest rate \~5%

$500 HOA (6k per year)

Monthly mortgage payment  /=5K

Prepaying PMI /=8k total.

&amp;#x200B;

We have been approved for the loan and we have locked in the rate.  My fiancé is the holder of the debt, and this concerns me as we prepare to purchase a home.

My down payment and closing costs would essentially take my savings account funds.

This is by far the largest investment/purchase we will ever make in our life.  Are we nuts?  Other info I should provide to get better feedback?

I have spoken to our FA (he says go for it), mortgage broker (go for it).  Yet, I am still super concerned.",finance

personalfinance,"Going to buy a house, just want thoughts on our budget","My husband and I are house hunting, and I just want thoughts on our current budget and what we think we can afford. We will have to make a minimum down payment as we do not have enough for 20% (probably should have planned better but it is what it is). My credit is good so we got approved for a loan, we're trying to stay below 260,000. A 3% down payment for that would 7,800, which we definitely have and then some (enough to cover closing costs and have a bit left over, hoping not to have to pay closing costs though). 

Our monthly income after taxes is about 6,200, although that is under estimating since my paychecks are usually higher than expected (overtime, shift differentials). My husband currently gets quarterly bonuses that vary but so far tend to be around 15,000 before taxes (was about 9,400 after tax). Those go towards debts and savings. 

Right now we pay 1,420 in rent, but if we got a house at top of budget (obviously we dont want to do that) mortgage would be close to 1,800 (including taxes, PMI, etc.). We are planning to stay in this home at least 5 to 10 years, thinking closer to 10  if not longer. So that gives us time to grow  into it and by that point we plan to be making more money (annual raises, etc). 

Here are our other monthly expenses:

Student loans (combined): 886 (majority are my husbands, planning to refinance those soon for better interest rate and payment)

Car loan: 346

Car insurance: 76

Pet insurance: 56 (worth every penny)

Phone: 177 (this is high, once we pay our phones off it should drop, which will be soon)

Credit cards: 150-200 (most of this is cards on special payment plan with no interest. We have barely any actually accruing interest)

Gas: 150

Water: 60

Gas/electric: 200

Internet: 65

Entertainment (spotify, hulu, etc.): 50

Groceries: 400 (this may be an overestimation, but we also do food delivery sometimes like HelloFresh and I don't want to underestimate)

Pet expenses: 75 (we have multiple animals)

Fun money (restaurants, nights out, shopping): 400

Misc supplies (cosmetics, meds, etc): 50",finance
personalfinance,Is this one of the rare times that a cash out refinance to pay off school loans makes sense?,"Okay, so I have dug into this issue a bit, but would love to get the advice of those wiser than me. I know the cash out refinance is not something to take lightly, and it is more often the case that it is not the way to go. But after running the numbers, I am wondering if my case is actually one where it makes sense. 

Long story short I want to my property's equity to pay off school loans. 

My Scenario: 

* I owe 106k in student loans; numbers reflect principle and interest:
    * 34k at 7.05% - Private
    * 12k at 4.5%   - Private
    * 60 k at 5.5%  - Federal

* My gross salary is 90k per year, but that will be increased to 95k in 5 mos. 

* My wife's gross is 50k per year

Our current property has multiple rental units on it and is cash positive:

* Mortgage (including taxes and property taxes): 1300/mo
* Income from rental units: 1550/mo
* We live in a large unit that would rent for 900 - 1000/mo 

* Home value (will need to get a new appraisal to be official): $170k
* Owe: 86.5k
* Current interest rate is at 5.5% fixed for another 4 years then goes to variable after for the remaining 7. 

* No other debts

* car insurance is minimal, not sure how much to be honest 100/mo?

* credit scores are excellent: 814 and 825

My thoughts: 

I am considering doing a cash out refinance to pay off some of my school loans. Obviously I want to pay off the 34k since they are at 7% plus. However, I am wondering if it would make sense to pay off some of the 5.5% if I can get a rate at or slightly below 5.5% for the refinanced mortgage. I ask this for several reasons:

* The tax right off for paying down student loans: will it help offset the burn from the closing costs involved in getting the refi?

* We are thinking about buying a second home within the next year and renting the units we are currently occupying (which would bring in another 900-1000/mo in rental income to what was listed above - Making the rental income 2400 - 2500/mo). 

* Because the property is cash positive, and in a market where demand is very unlikely to go away, I am not as worried about the risk that is involved with a refi to pay off school loans. 

* we do have a security fund both for us (3 mo fund), and another for our rentals (although I would like the rental security fund to be bigger )

* The psychological impact of seeing the school loan balance go down significantly will be worth something in itself. 

So that is where I am at. I am approaching this with a lot of caution since you read over and over again that is route is typically not the way to go. Any advice is most welcome, especially pointing out things I am not considering!

[22 M in Toronto]","This is really the only place I can share my story since I can't explain FIRE to any regular person. And yes I admit this is kind of a humble brag, I am quite happy with my situation. Also, I feel this is a bit different from the usual ""Bay area tech industry, 6 figure salary"" stories for some change. Funny enough, my brother is a $100k USD+ techy in a HCOL city with a fortune 500 company, but that's beside the point.

**Backstory**

I work in the hospitality industry at a restaurant which comes with a unique situation. I have no benefits, nor time paid off but get to choose exactly how much I want to work. No formal education other than a couple of college courses, but a lot of time spent independently educating myself to further my career.

I live in Toronto, Canada. Share a 700sqft 2br with a roommate in the downtown core. Live relatively frugally in some areas, but also splurge an absurd amount in others. I recognize I am very fortunate to be in the situation I am in, and also that there are many ways I can still improve my spending. Anyway, break down of my finances from past 12 months.

**Couple notes:**
 
1. **Insurance**, for now, is just renter's insurance and long-term disability insurance. I bought the latter due to the risks associated with working a physically dependent job. I also need to buy extended medical coverage soon, for things not covered by Canadian health care.

2. **I walk to work** every day, a nice perk of living in the downtown core, 15 mins usually. But the public transit costs are still quite high because I often go around the city for other activities.

3. **My hobbies**, outside of dining out, are mostly free or extremely cheap. I play sports at the community center which is usually free. I am competing in an amateur billiards league. The league is very affordable and I practice during the days when the rates are lower. A small perk of working nights I guess.

4. **My dining budget is obscenely high**, I know. In my defense, it is my only serious vice. Also, it is my profession, being well informed about the current state of the industry and food scene has helped me in my career.

5. **Education** covers the many books I buy and tastings I attend to improve my knowledge and hopefully further my career.

6. **""Purchases""** is a very broad category that covers random things I end up having to buy. I barely own anything, I never go shopping or own any boy toys. It's mostly things like my laptop breaking after 7 years or having to spend $400+ on formal attire for a new job, these are unavoidable. I rarely spend the full 1k, I save the rest if there is extra.

7. **I work 45-47h/wk**  between my two jobs when I am working. This averages across the year to 44h/wk because I take time off which is unpaid in my profession. Usually, 2 weeks in a single vacation and a couple other random days here and there add up to approx. 3+ weeks off.

8. **I declare my tips in full**, which is rare in the industry. This really helped me in getting my first lease since I have some proof of income. I also hope this makes it easier for me to get a mortgage, will have to meet with a broker soon to find out for sure.

9. **Do not quit your job and apply to a restaurant.** My story is a rose-tinted one, 99% of service staff do not make this much. Only several restaurants in major cities pay this well, and those positions are extremely competitive. That being said, if you know what you are getting into and are cut out for it, it is a satisfying and well-paying job.

Needing budget review/advice, not sure what to do about college savings, and if we should pause retirement savings to save up for a larger home down payment.

Family of 3 (25, 25, infant). Single income of $80K and spouse stays at home. We’re currently maxing a Roth and contributing 9% to 401k. Just changed from a PPO to HSA plan so loading that up with $300/month.

•	Emergency fund: $15K 

•	Retirement (401K + Roth): $42K 

•	Own 2 older cars: \~$9K 

•	Just started new job so not sure how much I will take home exactly, but perhaps around $5200 (before HSA &amp; 401k deductions) Monthly expenses are just under $5000.

**Monthly Expenses: $4838**

•	Misc (includes clothing, birthday gifts, shopping, etc):   **$150**   average

•	Retirement:   **$1000**

•	Charity:   **$705**

My general feeling is that we are comfortable now but I worry a little about saving for future expenses such as a car to replace our reliable but aging fleet. It would also be a stretch to replenish our emergency fund quickly if needed. **How does the overall budget look? Is it too tight? Are there any opportunities for reduction?**

**College:**

**I haven’t established a plan for funding college.** We will likely have 1-2 more children. The thought of paying for 3 educations, even partially, is overwhelming. My parents and grandparents fortunately paid for my education and I lived at home for some of that time to reduce cost. I would love to give the same gift to my children but it doesn’t seem feasible.  A 4 year public school degree will cost $200K in 18 years. Doing quick math, setting aside $100/month would only produce around $35K @ 5% in 18 years! I’ve read advice saying you shouldn’t save anything (or hardly anything) to maximize likelihood of receiving FAFSA/scholarship benefits.

**Is that a viable plan considering my income and situation?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Mortgage:**

My new job is 1 hour away from our current home that we moved into a year ago. The new area is about 20% more expensive so we will be paying more for housing but it also provides more opportunities. We had no plans of moving within 5 years when we bought a year ago but the job opportunity came out of nowhere. We are selling our house immediately and will get about **$16K in equity.** I don’t know whether to buy again immediately or move into an apartment to save up a larger down-payment. Here are the scenarios I've thought of:

1.  Buy again immediately: we are familiar enough with the area to do this, but would have a 10% down payment ($22K) but PMI. Total payment of $1386/month.

* Seems very expensive – not sure I could afford this

2.  Move into an apartment for a year to save up for a 15% down payment ($33k). Total payment of $1170/month. •

* Third Federal Bank currently offers a 5/1 ARM @ 4.04% with $295 closing costs. They also offer no PMI with a 15% down payment and the opportunity to re-lock the rate for another 5 years for $295. This can be done without limit for the life of the loan.
* I would lose out on lower interest rates now and also lose a year of building equity

3.  Move into an apartment for 2 years to qualify for fixed rate mortgage without PMI

* Lose out on 2 years of low interest rates and equity and really don’t want to live in an apartment for that long, especially if we have another kid

If we choose to wait (options 2 &amp; 3), we would do the following: 
a.	Spouse could work part time a few hours/week  for gross income of $150-350/month 
b.	Pause my retirement savings. My employer will not provide a 3% match until next year so I’m not be missing out on that benefit regardless.

**Which option should I take? Should I pause retirement savings temporarily to save up for a down payment? Is my mortgage choice of 5/1 ARM and re-lock opportunity a bad idea?**",finance

ethereum,"I'm making a 4X-ish strategy game on Ethereum, somewhat similar to the Civilization series","I believe that one way to make a successful gaming dapp on Ethereum to create an in-game economy between players, which allows players to earn ETH from buying and selling in-game assets/resources. There are several genres that generally develop in-game economies, some of which are RPGs, simulation games and strategy games. I've chosen to make a crypto game inspired by the popular Civilization series, with some changes to fit smart contracts ie not truly turn-based but rather time-based.


The slow pace of this kind of game is perfect for Ethereum, which requires players to wait after every turn before they see the effects of their actions; and makes block mining time a feature rather than a hindrance because you'll be much more thoughtful about which step you'll take next, be it acquiring territory, gathering particular resources, creating and moving troops, attacking enemies, etc.  in a hegaxon-grid-based world.


Now I'm in beta stage and looking to see if there is interest in this kind of game on Ethereum. I've deployed the contracts on both the Ropsten and Mainnet blockchains. If you want to test the game completely free you can try the Ropsten version, whereas if you already want to earn ETH, you can try the mainnet version. Or both.
I am thinking about adding more features like federations. Federations would allow players to team up diplomatically (much like guilds or alliances) for war or territory dominance purposes allowing better ether gains; and a deeper tech tree.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto News Recap: Cryptocurrencies are mixed as prominent crypto analyst Tom Lee says Ethereum has bottomed out and is set for a trend reversal,"### Crypto News

* According to the head of research at Fundstrat, Tom Lee, Ethereum is on the verge of a trend reversal that will see the altcoin rally up to USD$1,900 per token by the end of 2019. Tom Lee discussed in a note to clients of Fundstrat that Ethereum has experienced “overly negative” sentiment in 2018 and that will serve as a basis for its strong rebound to come. At the time of this writing, Ethereum is trading at USD$225 per token.  
* An analysis conducted by blockchain data analyst, Antoine Le Calvez, reveals that an early miner of Bitcoin has managed to sell approximately 30,000 Bitcoin between December 2016 and January 2018. Calvez cites that this individual is likely one of the earliest miners of Bitcoin.  
* Austria will issue 1.15 billion euros worth of government bonds in a federal bond auction that will utilize blockchain notarization. Overseeing the auction will be Austria’s Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OeKB), who will leverage the public Ethereum blockchain to carry out the blockchain notarization.  
* Chine city Nanjing’s arbitration body, the Nanjing Arbitration Committee, announced Thursday that its online blockchain platform for depositing and storing data in legal disputes has gone live for its testing phase. Users that can be upload data to the online blockchain platform includes evidence deposition platforms, financial institutions, and other arbitration committees. The system will allow parties to view digital evidence simultaneously over a tamper proof and distributed network.  
* Despite China’s blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings (ICO), Chinese investors still have an easy time purchasing cryptos and ICOs. According to a report by Bitcoinist, Chinese investors can easily buy mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin by logging into a platform for over-the-counter transactions and using apps like WeChat or Alipay to pay. Chinese investors can also convert their fiat currency to stablecoin Tether by leveraging direct peer-to-peer transactions, which can then be used to buy cryptocurrencies. 
* Swiss-based asset management firm, Tiberius Group AG, has announced that it will introduce a cryptocurrency backed by precious metals. Tiberius Group plans to issue their Tiberius Coin that will trade on a blockchain ledger and be tied to the price of copper, aluminum, nickel, cobalt, tin, gold, and platinum. CEO Giuseppe Rapallo said the Tiberius Coin will likely be offered at around USD$0.70 per token. The Tiberius Coin will be issued on LATOKEN, an Estonian exchange that meets “necessary regulatory standards.” 
* The world’s first advanced blockchain identity laboratory and Europe’s first dedicated blockchain research facility launched in Eidinburgh, the capital of Scotland. Called the Blockpass Identity Lab, the blockchain research facility will focus on exploring ways blockchain technology can be implemented to protect personal data online. The blockchain research laboratory is part of a £600,000 joint venture between Hong Kong-based Blockpass IDN and Scottish University, Edinburgh Napier University.  
* The United Nation’s Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) and their Development Program (UNDP) are partnering with the nation of Sierra Leone and technology profit, Kiva, to develop and launch a blockchain-based identification system. The project aims to “modernize the credit bureau” with Sierra Leone being chosen because the country only has one credit bureau that serves just 2,000 people. 80% of Sierra Leone’s population is unbanked.  
* The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have announced they are suing 1Broker, a Marshall Islands-based securities dealer who allegedly violated federal laws through a bitcoin security swap scheme. The SEC is claiming that 1Broker is not a registered security-based swaps dealer while they also failed to list its security-based swaps on a national exchange. Investors were only able to purchase this product with Bitcoin.  
* US based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet, Coinbase, has rolled out their new “Coinbase Bundles”, a product designed to simplify cryptocurrency trading. The Coinbase Bundle is a product that baskets five of the largest cryptocurrencies supported by Coinbase, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ethereum Classic. The Coinbase Bundle baskets these five cryptos in proportion with market capitalization with a minimum purchase size of USD$25.  
* Zebpay, once India’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, gave just a few hours notice in announcing that it would be halting all trading services today. In a tweet, Zebpay said that it would halt its exchange service while cancelling all unexecuted orders while crediting the funds to users’ wallets. Zebpay cited in a blog post that this decision comes in wake of the ban by India’s central bank that prohibits domestic banks from offering financial services to crypto exchanges.

btc,The Saifedean Ammous meandering on the Tom Woods Show (rather long with partial transcription),"There is something terribly misleading about Saifedean Ammous' arguments that I would like to see challenged by legit Austrian economists.  I don't know much about Mr. Ammous, but he is clearly a Bitcoin monopolist.

When Ammous was on the Tom Woods Show, Tom mentioned early that they would eventually talk about Bitcoin Cash.  A few minutes later, Tom in his usual manner courteously [asked](https://youtu.be/LdYCW0M4_jo?t=8m58s) about ""store of value.""  Saifedean Ammous answered that BTC is ""the best store of value ever invented,"" and he went on for almost 9 minutes explaining why.   Somewhere in there he said he would prefer if they don't waste their time discussing Bitcoin Cash, since it's so trivial to change Bitcoin Cash, while BTC on the other hand is ""set in stone.""    I found that to be one of the worst arguments ever.  There is nothing special about the 'Bitcoin Core' developers as compared to other developers.

Woods, being an economist, didn't let Ammous go so easily.  A few minutes later, Tom [presented the question](https://youtu.be/LdYCW0M4_jo?t=17m37s):

&gt; The folks with Bitcoin Cash are arguing that the **initial promise of Bitcoin** was not simply that it would be a store of value, but **that it would be a medium of exchange**, and that **people would use it in ordinary transactions**.  That aspect of Bitcoin [Core - BTC] seems to be breaking down.  
&gt;
&gt;You get two different responses.  One is, 'Well, we're coming up with some innovations that may help foster that again...' (OP insert: a reference to Lightning Network) and the other one is, 'Ah **we never really needed the medium of exchange** function anyway, it's best to think of Bitcoin as being **digital gold**, and **it's fine for it to be expensive to transact in**.
&gt;
&gt; I think at the very least the Bitcoin Cash people can say that their concerns are concerns that are rooted in the original vision of Bitcoin, and that **that vision is being changed in ways that aren't radical enough**.  In other words **if you really want to challenge the Federal Reserve, you've got to challenge it not just by introducing another store of value, you've got to introduce another medium of exchange**.

I appreciate the way Tom presented this.   Ammous' answer was... well, I've typed it out in full below.  If you don't want to read it all, you can click the above link and listen to it.  Anyway, here is his entire answer, with my emphasis on some fun parts.  See if you can find the misleading stuff:

&gt;That's absolutely wrong, because first of all, **the Bitcoin Cash people fundamentally confuse the idea of the method of payment or the payment of system with the function of medium of exchange**.  So the point of what makes a medium of exchange is the fact that people will exchange it with one another, and **once something is desirable as a store of value, people will want to be paid in it**, people will want to use it as a medium of exchange, and then it will get used as that.  
&gt;
&gt;Now the payment mechanisms in which it is delivered is a separate issue, okay.  So the platform in which the payments are made is something completely different from that.  In other words, the dollar is a medium of exchange. **Paypal** is a payment system... and this confusion.... the Bitcoin Cash people seem to think that **Paypal** is the medium of exchange and we need to built Bitcoin into a bigger **Paypal** that is a medium of exchange. But that's not true, and **that's not important**.
&gt;
&gt;Also, Bitcoin is not a **religion**, it is not a **cult**, Satoshi Nakamoto is not **God**, and he is not a **prophet** that has given us **holy scriptures** that we must preserve.  This is a technology that has evolved over time.  And **I don't like to get into all of these ideas of what Satoshi wrote**, and what he really meant.  Satoshi is just a human being like you and me.  If he had something to say about what's happening with Bitcoin, he's perfectly capable of making his own opinions felt, and telling people what he wants.  But he introduced this technology and it's going to grow.  And I'm sure you understand the concept of spontaneous order, that you know things that involve human action, they are not the product of human design.  So yeah he produced the initial design, but what Bitcoin has grown into is not something that he necessarily foresaw.  Not something that he had to foresee.  It's the product of **people using it** in the market and people understanding what it's good for and people using it to its advantages.
&gt;
&gt;Jokingly I like to use the example of Viagra.  Initially, the *original vision* of the people who made Viagra was that it was going to treat baldness or heart disease or something like that - it turned out to be much better for other uses.  And you don't see people going around angrily demanding that Viagra be used for treating baldness.  Maybe it does work for other things.
&gt;
&gt;In any case, I don't even believe that this is really true of Satoshi's vision, and **the Bitcoin Cash people can be really annoying** in the way they spread this **silly idea**.  But more importantly is, forgetting about all of the **religious scriptures** and looking into it.  The important question is, if you want to disrupt the Federal Reserve, what do you want?  This is exactly what Bitcoin matters for, in my opinion.  Which is that, you know, **we don't need a new Paypal**.  If we do invent **a new Paypal**, we shave off 50% or 90% of **Paypal** fees, that doesn't really make a big difference. That doesn't really excite me.  That's something that some startup could do one day, and you know great for them, they'll make a few billion dollars and it'll be a great thing.  But who cares...
&gt;
&gt;What matters is, **what we need is, a new form of central bank**.  We want to replace central banks.  We want to be done and rid of central banks that are able to control money.  So for me, regardless of what Satoshi wanted, what really matters is that now we have this technology that can allow us to have the monetary policy of really hard money, and monetary policy that nobody can change.  This is for me why Bitcoin matters.  So just to begin with **the entire notion that we're going to hard fork Bitcoin to increase the capacity is a complete non starter for me because hard forking Bitcoin makes it trivial to then go into hard forks that will change the money supply**.  This is why it's a complete non starter.  Even if I agreed that I would like for Bitcoin to have the properties that the Bitcoin Cash people want, the fact that they need a hard fork to do it is why it will never happen, and why it's a **completely stupid idea**.  Sorry for saying that, but it's an **extremely stupid idea.**
&gt;
&gt;You know the only thing valuable about this is, nobody can mess with the **money supply.  If you're going to go and change that** just so that you can double the transaction throughput, or quadruple the transaction throughput, or even multiply it by 100, that is one of the dumbest engineering trade offs that anybody could ever do.  Because even if you multiplied Bitcoin's on-chain capacity by 100 it would still not be enough to make all of the transactions in a small town of America, let alone the rest of the world, ok.  Bitcoin currently does what, half a million transactions a day?  That is the capacity.  So multiply that by 10 or 20 or 100 and increase the block size by 100 and what do you get?  You still have a system that can't handle as much transactions as a small little town in the US.  If you want a payment network that handles all the payments of everybody in the world, **it's completely unimaginable that anybody would want that on the first layer of Bitcoin**.  Anybody who says that anybody who thinks that must not understand how Bitcoin actually works.  Because the way that Bitcoin works, the way that Bitcoin transactions are confirmed is that every single member of the network has a record of every single other member's entire  your own computer for you to know every single person, what they are doing what they are selling and buying.  And that's just **absurd.  It's impossible.  It's impossible** for you to follow this.  
&gt;
&gt;Plus it won't even be workable because you have to wait at least 10 minutes for one confirmation in order to be sure that the transaction is not invalid.  So if you wanted to use this as a way to pay for your lunch, you'd have to wait at least 10 minutes in order to get one confirmation.  **It's not safe** to spend any transaction that doesn't have at least one confirmation, although I would recommend waiting for several confirmations at least if there's a big payment involved.  So the notino that everybody in the world is going to be using the Bitcoin blockchain itself to pay for all of their payments, is something that only people who are **completely ignorant** of how Bitcoin works from an engineering perspective could say.  It's absolutely absurd.  And frankly **I'm really... quite disappointed that we're wasting this episode discussing this idiotic idea** rather than getting into some interesting economic discussions.  This is really the problem with it.  And you know, it will never work on this level where we have 7 billion people running their own on-chain transactions and waiting 10 minutes for every single thing that they spend.  
&gt;
&gt;Secondly, it doesn't have to, because what do we need it for?  We don't have a big problem with **Paypal** or **Visa** or **Mastercard**.  Sure, you know, it would be great if we could reduce fraud on Visa and fees on credit cards and fees on Paypal and all of those things.  But let's face it, that's not the biggest problem in the world.  That's not the reason we get wars and inflationary governments, and that's not the problem that's allowing all these governments in the world to expropriate the wealth of their people and do all these horrible things with people's wealth.  The problem we have is inflationary monetary policy.  
&gt;
&gt;Bitcoin can solve that.  By, and this is the point that I try to communicate with my book.. even at its current level with only half a million transactions per day which is about the maximum that Bitcoin has done thus far, even at this level Bitcoin is able to process enough transactions to have a settlement layer for a global settlement system for... thousands of banks.  Currently maybe about 1000 banks.  So you could have 1000 central banks that are completely free market, that are completely independent of government control, none of whom can change the money supply, and all they can do is clear payments for clients.  In a free market, a free competitive market for banks, in which, you know, if any of these banks does something you don't like, you're free to go and move on to another one.  So if you do this, if you think of Bitcoin in this sense, that's when Bitcoin is really powerful.
&gt;
&gt;Who cares about **Paypal** or **Visa**.  We are here to compete with the Federal Reserve, with the IMF, with the Bank of International Settlement, and with the European Union.  And frankly, perhaps I wasn't exactly correct to say that you'd have to be stupid to believe those ideas.  You could also be motivated by... in fact, **if I were a central banker, perhaps the most effective line of attack against Bitcoin** to prevent it from playing that role which competes against central banks, that could take away monetary policy from the hands of central banks... the most effective way to do this **would be to increase the capacity or increase the block size** of Bitcoin to continue to hard fork it to make people stop thinking the policy is immutable, you know, introduce a change in the block size, and then move from the block size to, let's say, well we need to increase the money supply because we get Keynesians arguing for things like that.
&gt;
&gt;So that's what Bitcoin can disrupt.  Because it could replace that one central bank, with all that ability to create money and inflate the money supply and determine who gets to have money, you could replace that with an open free market network of thousands of banks, none of whom can affect the money supply... and all of whom are subject to free market competition.


There is a lot of misleading stuff in Ammous' long-winded answer.   I started typing out his whole answer because I knew Ammous was all wrong.  But of course, that's not the case.  To be honest, there are some kernels of truth in there.  Here are some of the things 
I didn't like:

* Ammous repeatedly says ""stupid,"" ""ignorant,"" ""silly idea,"" and he refers to religion, God, prophets, and scriptures.  He spends a bit of time making this analogy which is really non productive and a little disingenuous to say the least.  Nobody thinks Satoshi is God.  Whoever invented Bitcoin obviously knew something.  Ammous is coming in after the fact, like any talking head.   I think we should consider the intent of the invention.  And the whitepaper is titled, Bitcoin: A **Peer to Peer Electronic Cash** System.  Cash infers daily transactions.  Not a settlement layer.
* Ammous says he's disappointed to be wasting time talking about this - but it is he himself who is spending most of the episode talking about it.  I think he's not really being totally honest - I think he clearly does want to talk about this, otherwise he wouldn't spend so much time on it.   It seems to me he wants to summarily shut down these challenges.   If that's the case, then I ask, who *really* has the scripture here?  Seems like Ammous does, to me at least.
* Ammous uses the straw man argument that Bitcoin Cash absolutely must always have all transactions on chain, forever, and that there is never any other way on Bitcoin Cash.  This is patently false.  Bitcoin Cash chose the path of not rate-limiting transactions right now, in order to not prematurely commit to only one layer-2 network which can easily be captured by fiat interests (and which many have argued, already is).  To that end, yes, on-chain transactions remain the primary means of scaling on BCH right now.  Ammous wants you to believe that BCH will never have a layer-2.  This is a straw man.
* He repeatedly mentions Paypal and Visa.  This is another straw man.  Bitcoin Cash isn't Paypal or Visa.  No one is shutting down your Bitcoin Cash transactions.  Bitcoin is open source software under MIT license.  Paypal and Visa are nothing like that.

There is more I don't like in his response.  But, I want to move on to one decent point he makes.  It could be that we really do in fact need layer 2 in order to handle all transactions on the planet.   Who knows?  Anyway, I actually like the case that Saifedean presents for layer 2.  The problem with his argument is, **we clearly don't need it right now**.  Why must we absolutely constrict users, which has impeded adoption, and force everyone over to layer 2... right now?  And, where are the choices in layer 2 networks?

Now having looked at his whole argument, I really don't like the way Saifedean intends to shut down discussion.  It shows that he is attempting to monopolize Bitcoin and is actually competition-averse.  But he does make some good points nonetheless.

personalfinance,Replaced a bill with debt - still pay it off fast?,"I recently bought solar panels. The monthly payment is so far within $10 of what my energy bill had been. Therefore, the effect of just making the minimum payment is that I end up with one fewer bill in eight years. This is acceptable.

The interest rate is 6%. (This is my highest-interest debt). If I just pay the minimum, I will end up paying $4000 in interest.

If I pay an extra $500 each month, I only pay $1500 in interest, saving me $2500. 

But it seems like if I invest that instead, then I end up with an extra $2500 over just 5 months.

personalfinance,"Is parents care, happy wife, happy life possible with $100k Salary in Southern California?","Hi Reddit - 29year old here. Hoping to get some insights on what would you do if you were in my shoes. I have been losing my sleep for past month, unable to decide what my next steps should be. The mental stress caused by this is starting to affect my relationship and my work as most of the time I am either annoyed or stressed or just sad. Long story short, after spending 10 years in US with uncertainty, I finally have my green card. This has given me an option, for first time, to think beyond getting job just to survive here mentality. However, i am at this point very clueless on what i need to do to take me higher in terms of income. This is very important as for my current salary of $100000 in Southern California, i just cannot see how i can meet my goals of getting married within 3-4 years, buy either a house with granny flat or two adjacent townhouses, save money to take care of my parents (Dad-65, Mom-55) as i am the only child (they don’t work anymore and i am the only source of their income), and fund my retirement accounts. My housing need is so specific because i want to bring my parents to US but i cannot imagine all of us being in the same house as it would be a hugely uncomfortable situation for my girlfriend with whom i would be married by then. I just really don’t know what to do next which is making me feel like what i want out is simply not feasible. In addition to that, my workplace has turned into a toxic place where the level of incompetency and laziness is getting more prevalent. That is why i have been looking for new jobs as well but with green card i want to explore other avenues than my current IT job. Here are the questions that have been bothering me: should i buy a 1br condo, 2 br condo (based on my salary this the max i could afford without having roommates), should i postpone these plan to save 20% down on these or continue to just save more to buy a house or two townhouses? With house may be i can rent the rooms for next 3-4 years but then what? How much should i start to save for my parents? What would be a good salary to achieve all this? How can i make extra money? Is it all even doable? Should i cut off retirement funding or lock myself with 30yr mortgages? Would i be happier if i just give up of all these dreams and just be happy as things could be lot worse? I am sure this is dramatic but I just feel overwhelmed now but quite honestly i feel haven’t made a single progress. I want to make buying a 2br condo my immediate goal, but would it make sense? Here’s my current financial situation:
Cash: $17k
Company Stock:$23k
401k: $30k
No HSA, No Roth, No Other Debts as i rent right now and drive an old paid off car.

What made me anxious is even looking to get small 2b2b 320k condo with 3% down, 15 year plan, I’ll be in negative flow every month.

personalfinance,Balance Transfer Questions,"Question 1:  If you don't pay off a card that had a 0% balance transfer offer within the time period, does the credit card company charge you the going interest rate on ALL funds that were transferred to the card or just the balance remaining? And then, how often do they charge interest (once a month, once a day, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

2. Does anyone have any suggestions for opening a card and doing a balance transfer? I've never done it before. Also, will the fact that I bought and had to finance a car in June 2017 affect my chances of approval? And for how long will this affect future applications, like for a mortgage? 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Also, any recommendations on cards to apply for?

&amp;#x200B;

Background info: I have 3 credit cards. 2 rewards, one not. FICO Score: 755.

Considering opening a new card to take advantage of balance transfer offers.  I'd move funds from my 2nd highest-interest card to the new card, then move money from the highest interest card to the 2nd highest-interest card to take advantage of their current balance transfer offer.  Right now, I can pay  it off within the time periods (18 mos for the new card, until Mar 2020 for the existing) but am concerned about what happens if something terrible happens to disrupt my plan.

When I made my first payment, I had $139,000 in student loan debt. They are federal student loans with combined average interest rate of 6.06%. Currently I have $35,000 left to pay, and also have $35,000 in my checking account, what should I do? Pay it off in lump sum?

Currently I reside with my parents who have graciously let me stay with them until I get my debt paid off and settled somewhere.

personalfinance,Can I Quit My First Job?,"This ended up being more of a rant, but here goes nothing...

I'm a 23 year old female who graduated from undergrad a few months ago. I have $25,000 in savings and $18,000 in federal student loans. Eight weeks ago, I began my first ~real salaried position, making $45,000 before taxes. I also have a side hustle where I make anywhere between $500 and $3000 dollars monthly.

When I first began my full time job, I had high hopes. However, it seems to me that the position mostly involves doing secretarial work, and offers no possibility of teaching me 'hard' skills that can be utilized in another role. I try to have a good attitude, but I feel stressed out and bored at the same time while I'm there, and currently have no idea how well I'm doing because (despite my requests for a meeting) my manager has not provided me with any feedback regarding my work. There is high turnover, and my position is notorious for poor possibility of growth within the firm.

The position requires about 50-60 hours of work per week, on a ""Chinese overtime"" schedule - meaning that for every hour over 40 that I work, I make half of my regular hourly rate. So, $45000/2080 = $21.63 comes to $21.63/2 = $10.80. If I work the required 50 hours a week, I make $106 before tax, on top of my weekly pay.

I am incredibly thankful to be getting a regular paycheck, but my schedule provides me with little ability to apply to jobs or develop skills/connections. I am living at home while working at the job, and feel like I've gotten worked into a stagnant pattern in the past two months, and that I need to make a radical change in my surroundings in order to actually gain momentum in a job search. However, I am also terrified of the possibility that I may not get a job for months and months, and that this decision will end in financial ruin.

Part of me feels like a spoiled baby for even disliking the job (after all, it's a regular paycheck, and the most financially sustainable option by far would be to stay working). However, the other half of me is hyper aware of the options and opportunities that I am letting pass by while I am working 60 hours in menial labor.

I would like to use that money to open some sort of investment account for her first birthday. I need advice on what the best way to put that money away. I would like for it to be in her name, with my wife and I having control over the account until she turns 18, as would like to continue to contribute to the account and make changes if necessary.

It can be a 503b, but it doesn’t have to be. I believe my in-laws will probably set up a 503b in her name and contribute to that regularly as well, so if it makes more sense for me to open a new account with Vanguard, Fidelity, etc., or maybe even a higher interest rate checking account if that makes more sense at the moment with the market being at record highs. More money could be contributed if it were advantageous in terms of opening a different kind of account.

I am just looking to start setting some money aside for her future and I’ve only really recently gotten somewhat good at managing my own finances and investments.

Thanks for any advice!",finance
personalfinance,"Equity rich, cash poor. Does a HELOC/Home equity loan make sense?","Hey Personal Finance,
We currently own a house that we bought cheap and fixed up and are about to do some more renovations. The mortgage on the house is 230,000 and the house is appraised at 380,000. We need a new roof, as the current one is very old, and they offered us a 10yr loan at 9.99% APY which is terrible IMO, so I was looking HELOC/Home equity loans and those seem like a good vessel to put this debt in with a much lower rate ~5%. Does that make sense to do? 

We also have a lot of student loan debt (~90k), most of it is being paid really aggressively (~1500 a month) and we should be out from under it in 5 and half years. There is a chunk of it though ~8000 that has an interest rate of 6.9%, much higher than the rest, would it make sense to roll that into the HELOC/Home equity loan? 


Ultimately we want to sell this home in around 3 years and pay everything off, student loans an all. We would sell it now but, we think that there is still value to be gained through improvements. After the roof we want to finish the basement, redo two bathrooms, and replace a deck that we have. Would it make sense to roll those renovations in here as well and sell the house sooner?

I would estimate that after the roof the house will be worth 400,000 and after the basement/bathrooms/deck it would be worth 450,000.",finance

financialindependence,Is anyone else starting to get worried that a recession is lurking and will harm FIRE plans?,"The bull market has been going on for almost 10 years. Government debt, corporate debt and personal debt are at record highs. Real estate prices are starting to drop and it is taking longer to sell homes. Interest rates are rising and many emerging markets are dropping into recession. Of all these indicators, the scariest is that corporate insiders are selling their stock at a record pace and using stock buybacks to keep the stock high while they get out. This reminds me of the behavior right before the last crash. Is anyone else worried that a huge recession is coming that would set back anyone trying to FIRE by 5+ years?

financialindependence,Calculating NW for FI,"Background: totally new to FIRE, but I had realised that I might be able to retire early after doing a full gauntlet of financial calculations when trying to figure out if buying a home or renting was more long term cost effective. 25M wife 24F. We both make around 85k, but with total benefits and bonuses it is somewhere just north of 200k (pre tax). We have a NW around 330k right now and are saving around 80k per year in a low cost of living area. 

So I am trying to get a feel for what other people consider an acceptable NW for different retirement annuities. When trying to do the calculations there are just so many unknowns such as future inflation, changing market projections, changes in capital gains tax, changes in interest rate. Right now we probably spend around 50k per year on keeping us going, but would like something close to 65 or 75k for retirement (maybe?). Still pretty undecided about that especially with expecting that number to go up each year due to inflation. 

So, what do people think would be a good target NW amount for, say, 65-75k per year? And am I just worrying too much about all of the fluctuating variables?",finance

Stop all but the minimum 401(k) contributions necessary to keep a match, and throw all excess cash into the principal - or - continue to contribute to the retirement accounts at a high percentage, but rebalance down to ""safer"" asset mix (fixed income ; money market accounts ; limited equity exposures etc.)  With interest rates on the rise it seems to be a fine line to walk.

personalfinance,Basic tax questions after returning to work after long hiatus,"I was out of work for several years dealing with mental health issues and taking care of a family member. I recently started working again, although its only part-time and low wage. As I only worked one job before this long break, I never got a great understanding of the tax system and I've heard things changed in 2018 so I have a few extremely basic questions I hope can be answered

Firstly, I chose 2 allowances on my tax form because that is what I saw advised on several websites for my situation - single, no dependents, 1 job. I did not want a large refund and would rather get as close as possible so this seemed reasonable. On my paychecks though, nothing is being taken out for federal income tax. I thought the idea was to take the least amount out, getting very close to the actual tax total without going over like 0 allowances results in, with the possibility of having to cut a check at the end to pay the difference. I didn't understand then why nothing at all would be deducted, before realizing it could be automatically calculating I wouldn't be making enough money to qualify to have to pay taxes - am I correct in that assumption? I've been putting aside money from each paycheck just in case 

Which leads to the 2nd question, the standard deduction is apparently now 12,000 which I assume means you can only be taxed on money you make over that threshold. As I'm only working a few months this year at part-time, I won't go even close to that amount - but how does this change when I'm claimed as a dependent by someone else? Will I still be tax free if I only make around 4-5k? Do I lose anything by being claimed in my situation?

Lastly I saw that if you don't make enough income to pass certain thresholds you don't even need to file a tax return. Is this true and are there any negatives to not doing so? I know sometimes when companies you worked at go out of business and you're applying to a new job they ask for your previous years tax returns so they can verify your employment. I don't know if this is something I should still do regardless for stuff like this or if the dependent status affects the situation at all - I have no problem filing a return next year even if I'm not required, just curious how it works",finance
personalfinance,Fraudulent charges.,"I recently financed a vehicle with a bank in my state that is about 3 hours away. It was one of the recommended lenders presented to me at the dealership where I purchased the vehicle. I was completely unfamiliar with the bank but the interest rate and other terms were acceptable to me so I proceeded to secure financing through them. 

On September 21st I made my first payment on my new loan using my debit card(external account) over the phone. There was an issue with their website that day that prevented me from making the payment online as I would have preferred(has since been fixed). Cut to today, a week later, I am buying lunch and my debit card is declined. I called my bank and was informed they had shut down the card due to a charge the night before that was made 2.5 hours away in close proximity to the bank I just secured my vehicle's financing through. Whom I just entrusted with my debit card information in order to make my first loan payment. I am otherwise very careful with my information and have not made any new or irregular transactions online or in person. 

After canceling my debit card, and running through all recent charges with my banks fraud department, I called and spoke to a manager at the bank my financing is through. While he agreed that the timeline and location of the fraudulent charges were very coincidental he could offer me no solution or guidance on how to proceed. Simply said he could see who processed the payment and check to see if this had ever happened before (why would this person be employed if it had?). Made no assurances that anything would be done. Without any concrete evidence he did not seem inclined to do even do that. Which to some degree I understand.

After that conversation I called my banks fraud department again and informed them of the circumstances and they took note of how I suspect my information was stolen. I am now waiting on an affidavit to sign and return, disputing the charge in order to recoup my money. 

Going forward what are my options? Should I leap frog the manager I spoke to and try to contact someone higher up the chain? Should I file a police report? Can I get my loan transferred to another bank without major penalties? It was not a large amount of money but if possible I would like to prevent this from happening to me again or others.

 I was so fed up with my roommates I decided to look for a new place even though have a VERY cheap rent controlled place in SF - I find a new place thats reasonably priced and to the market and just barely affordable even though its 40% more than I pay currently. As this is happening, I check all my finances and discover I have a potentially large tax liability due to some  a problem with some past returns that I didn't know about. I visit tax pros who say they can work it out ( at a cost about $2k) - but I will likely end up with a monthly installment plan of an amount I cannot know (but they say will be reasonable) until filing is complete ( this could take months).  So...I have no way to know what the payment(s) will be..or how  budget for this new payment/liability.    


THE ISSUE AT HAND: 

Do I proceed to move into the more expensive new place even though I don't know what my finances are goin to be like down the road?  Or back out and stay put at current place to keep my expenses down (&amp; stay with the crappy roommates) and use the money saved to pay down the debt ( I will lose the deposit about 1.5 K )......  


My fear is the down payments on the tax bill will wipe out most of my savings, and in a few months time the added monthly payment will stretch me thin financially and leave me living hand to mouth - &amp; slowly depleting remaining savings. I visited two tax pros, but neither could find anything out in the time available.   


I've had some sleepless nights over this and I need to make a plan ASAP as the first is almost here....any one with a background or experience with personal budgeting / debt management / back taxes,...I would love to hear some ideas.

Speaking of jobs, my partner hates hers and wants to quit and do freelance (she’s talented, has the chops, I believe in her, I think she could bring in *some* income and grow in time.

I’m not sure what to do with the rest of the money sitting in savings, or the future money that will come over the next year… but I know savings is not the best place for it.

personalfinance,When it's appropriate to setup revolving credit as an emergency fund.,"TL;DR - Don't save up an emergency fund if you are relatively secure, use revolving credit instead. Maybe. 

I think there are situations where having available revolving credit to cover the unexpected is more effective than setting aside 3-6 months of expenses .  This is somewhat similar to prioritizing high interest debt ahead of building an emergency fund (as described in Step 1 of common topics), but taking it much further. 

For this to apply to someone they would need to meet some basic criteria:
* Have a relatively stable income that comfortably exceeds expenses.
* Be rational! DO NOT apply for revolving credit if you actually intend to use it! This is for emergencies, remember?
* In general, have a good money habits 

If this doesn’t describe you, then you probably *should* have a cash emergency fund.  If it does, well...

My simple view of the cash emergency fund is that it's effectively the same as adding 3-6 months living expenses to your highest rate debt, as the money could be applied directly to that balance reducing interest payments.  If you have any debt at all, including so called 'good' debt from a mortgage, your money would do much more for you reducing the principal balance vs sitting idle in a cash savings account. 

If/When the unexpected does occur, step 1 will not be to immediately go borrow 3-6 months expenses, but rather minimize the borrowing cost by only borrowing precisely what is required. Depending on the revolving credit product you choose, the interest rate can be very reasonable (my HELOC is floating at prime+1%).  Also, with the traditional cash approach, what does someone do after they exhaust the emergency fund?  For many I assume this would be go borrow money.

Considering the above disclaimers, I chose the revolving credit approach instead.  My rationale was that if I make it 3 - 6 month without an actual emergency, my money will be doing more for me.  I’ve been lucky with a stable job and income that exceeds my expenses, so I didn’t consider this to be much of a risk at all.

I’ve since been able to eliminate my debt and transition to aggressive retirement saving all while not having a cash emergency fund.  When my luck runs out, I have the option to slowly draw from credit knowing that cost of borrowing will be significantly less than the opportunity cost of a cash balance emergency fund over the years.

Lastly, I am considering recommending this method to others but would like to hear the flaws in my theory, or from others than may have done something similar and how it has worked out for them.

Her family has always struggled, but I love them all to death.

&amp;#x200B;

When she got her money(IMO, way too much money for a young adult to come into, when she has not had any experience dealing with lump sums), she decided to do good with it, but being an 18 year old, coming into $55k us something I don't think anyone can do responsibly. She bought a car, but had no credit, so My fiance decided to sign for it so she could get a low interest rate(I really wished she talked to me about it, but I was at sea at the time).

&amp;#x200B;

 What the expectation was, was that she would set money aside to make payments, and everything would work out! It did, for a couple months, but then she started getting a bit more open with her spending, trying to make everyone happy by buying stuff. Before she new it, she was spending at a rate that led her to running out. That's when shit started to go south. She doesn't want to get a job, she cant make car payments, and she knows its not on her name, which is so damn frustrating. It coming down to me having to make these car payments every month, so my fiance's credit doesn't get destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

 My fiance is devastated, she's so independent and asking for me for help financially is killing her. I love my fiance's family, and I don't want to destroy my relationship with them, But it is so unfair to her and me both to have to take this responsibility. My immediate thought was to either have my fiance take the car, but she lives with her sister while going to college, and shes afraid she'll get kicked out. It is also how she gets to school, and both of them share the same classes. My second though was to see what she can do about getting her sister to sign to own the car, and take the financial burden off my fiance. She won't sign.

&amp;#x200B;

 I really don't know what to do. I do have a stable job, but I'm flying my fiance out here, and I had to put about $2k on my credit card for repairs to my car, and I cant afford to take care of my car payment, credit cards, savings, and her car payment. I'm living check to check, which is something I haven't had to do in 3 years. I really need help figuring out what to do. Thank you all in advance.",finance

personalfinance,College student looking to better prepare for the future,"Hey PF, been wanting to make this post for a while now but could never find the time or organization to actually do it. 

lets start with numbers.

Assuming i work all 40 hours weeks( this fluctuates but is typically the case) i make 34.3k gross.

I live in NY, so that works out to around 26.2k take home. \~2200 a month

I just moved out on my own and have gotten very serious about paying down all my bad debt before my student loans come out of deferment. I don't have a solid idea of budget yet because I'm still in the process of moving in so we've been eating out a lot. Once we're moved in and have a kitchen to work with(apartment is being built inside someone else's home.) that will change substantially. Also my car insurance right now is being paid by my mother by her own volition. I've told her I'd take it on but she said it isn't a problem for her until i get a new car. 

currently I've allotted 620 a month to go to paying off debt, which includes interest payments on my student loans. in that 620 is also my cell phone and gym bill (118/20). so it's actually like \~480 going straight to debt. 620/month 

I pay 300 a month in rent(split from 600 with one other person). 300/month

another 80-100 goes to gas for my car every week.(long drive to school in an older SUV that is running strong but is up for replacement once i get my debts squared away.) 320-400/month

 

$100 a month go to savings which currently sits at 0$ right now because we just started it together. 

&amp;#x200B;

fixed amounts right now add to to $1340 (going with the lowest estimate for gas)

Every week I'll usually throw a bit extra onto one of my credit cards and we've been buying stuff for our apartment bit by bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once our apartment is complete the food bill will drop like  a rock and i think I'll be able to afford to put somewhere around $800-$1000 a month to paying off debts, if not more. I'm already organized so that I'm paying off highest interest cards first. I'm shooting to pay off everything within a year, I'm sitting right now at $8100 in ""bad debt"". credit cards and such. $435 of that is going to be Paid by my S.O because it was something we split for the apartment that is 0% interest for one year. The rest are credit cards that are accruing interest anywhere from 15% to 28 %.  I've tried getting approved for a personal debt consolidation loan but got denied. may try again in the future once I've made a dent in this and my credit score improves so I'm not getting hit so hard with interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at this now I'm realizing a solid chunk of my take home is missing and I'm thinking it's just miscellaneous shit that has been bought in the process of everything. Once everything is settled and we can start buying in bulk and cooking every meal i plan to sit down and create a real budget but this is the rough estimate of everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything i could do to further increase the likelihood that i have everything paid off in a year? 

My federal student loans are in deferment so i don't technically have to pay anything on them. should i stop paying on those and direct that money towards the immediate problem?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, like i said, i need a new vehicle at some point in the next 6 months. how should i start preparing for that? 

&amp;#x200B;

My income should get a bit of a bump in the next few weeks, i plan to just put that increase towards the debt. correct plan of attack here?

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimers- i go to school full time along with my 40 hr work schedule, so there is no time for a second job unless i wanted to become a lunatic with a horrible relationship. 

I have two or three hobbies that aren't cheap, however i keep them reasonably in check and it doesn't have any adverse effect on my current financial state, although the entry costs for one of them do have a small part to do with how i accumulated this debt to begin with. 

TL,DR: I fucked my credit in my first three years of college, now that I'm cognizant of the damage and danger of credit card debt i want to fix it and want to know if my current method of doing so is the most realistic and effective way of doing it. 

**Please do tell me if there is anything about this post i should fix. First time posting here and i kind of just built off of a template from some of the posts i read that fit closest to my situation.**",finance
personalfinance,What should I do with my son's 529 account?,"The stock buybacks followed by selloffs have spooked me. My son inherited $14,000 from his great grandparents on his dad's side a couple of years ago and I put it all into a college fund. Last year the fund earned over $800 only to lose $500 of that gain after the tax cuts went through. I became worried that it would continue to lose and cut into his principle so I moved the entire amount into the Savings portfolio, which is FDIC insured. Now, it is barely growing and my son is only 12 years old. I'm beginning to wonder if I should do something else with it, but I don't know what. We are not wealthy people. I rent a 2 bedroom apartment. I'm a single mom. Dad is not in the picture and this inheritance was one hell of a windfall for my son. I don't want to see it disappear in the stock market. My kid's $14,000 is chump change to those people. I know I'll incur a small tax penalty on the gains he's earned if I pull all of it out. The interest rates on CDs are still pretty lackluster but at this point I think the earnings would be better and safer than the 529 savings portfolio. What should I do?",finance

Long time, first time. I'm 24 and I've been paying my student loans off for about a year now and I'm looking through refinancing them into just one account with one interest rate. I recently got prequalified through SoFi with a 5.5% interest rate in a span of 5 years, with a minimum payment of $1130/mo.

My current interest rates range from as low as 3% to as high as 9%. I've been paying off the higher ones first but I feel like I'm not making a dent on the balance as a whole. Now I've been aggresively paying them off for the past year ($1500/mo) so I don't think paying $1130 would be an issue.

investing,Thoughts on this High Dividend/Holding Portfolio? (REITS + Strong Dividend Leaders),"So Im going to be making an m1 brokerage account (Normal). I opened up a Roth IRA With vanguard and put your usual boring ETF/Index funds stocks that I won't touch till I retire. Also pre-apologies of this being a long post.

HOWEVER, I did want to have something for the intermediate length term that I can watch and learn. I have my Robinhood account I put very little in (were talking like 20 bucks a month) to just play around with. This however is meant to just grow for the intermediate term, aimed at mainly doing dividends with strong companies for the long term. I wanted to have a piece of multiple sectors that I feel are long term plays but I wanted everyone's thoughts **(Suggestions are def. wanted! Im a beginner, this is just my feeling and some basic research i've done so im not claiming anything purely asking advice)**. Also remember this is NOT my roth IRA or 401k. This is something im going to be intermediately funding to learn more about the market and for intermediate to long term growth. I will not be putting all of my money in these or anything.

1. REITS: I do want some of these as they typically pay good dividends and are ""relatively"" stable, however the normal real estate ones don't interest me. This would probably not make up a huge portion of my m1 ""Pie"" but I do like some of these (Besides Reality Income Corp which is boring but strong performance). With interest rates rising I don't see this as a good buy right now....plus I feel like Millennial's probably won't be buying as many houses in the next few years. Just doesn't feel strong.......HOWEVER the following do feel like strong ones:

* Data Center REIT's:  Equinix/DLR and Coresite all seem appealing, I know in 2018 they've hit a dive........but that seems like maybe the best time to buy while they are a little bit low. I know rising interest rates obviously will affect them...but with everything in the world going digital and companies storing more data than ever I see this being strong in the future.  (If you had to pick which ones would you?). I also feel like Iron Mountain fits in here too (as they seem to be a pretty strong dividend wise....but i've heard some shakiness in their long term strategy from doing some research).
* Industrial REIT's: As retail places move more towards online (Amazon/Etc...) this seems like a very strong buy and hold (Good dividends, and I think online stores and shipping are clearly more the norm nowadays). Prologis is the one I know is amazons biggest one, but i'd like to hear of others too.
* Infrastructure REITS: Same reason as above, I only see this industry growing (as it currently is). SBAC and AMT are two that stand out (Although I don't believe SBAC pays out dividends, but it still seems like a strong growth option). I don't know much about the area but i'd like to hear of others.
* Senior Home/Health living facility REITS: SNH and VTR are two high dividend payers that I feel are pretty recession proof...I mean even as medicine advances health care facilities (especially senior health care facilities for all the baby boomers) I see are going to be even a bigger necessity.
* Timberland/Farmland/Specialty: These are specialty ones, I like Gladstone Land(LAND), they've had 2 large farmland acquisitions (I file this under the ""people gotta eat"", plus they are relatively inexpensive). FPI has had some issues it seems. As far as Timber I honestly have zero clue,  Weyerhauser has been mentioned as being pretty strong...but im not knowledgeable about it. It seems like it'd be a solid long holding. However I don't know how in-line Timber is affected by a slowing real estate market (or what I feel is going to be).
* Manufactured Homes/Apartments/Retail/Public Storage: Retail feels like it will be def. on a downturn, Im too uncomfortable about Manufactured Homes to want to invest in their REITS. Apartments ""feel"" like they may become more popular.....but I really have a tough time  knowing what their future is with rising interest rates. Also not knowledgeable enough on public storage (i've heard mixed reviews on their future).

1. Energy/Utilities: I'd like to have some solid high dividend energy stocks. Preferably some in renewable energy as well. However I am completely ignorant about this sector. Dominion and Duke seem popular, No idea on some of the ""Big oil"" companies. I'd like to throw in some in some renewable energy companies (Which Im sure are very low now since Trump doesn't seem to have any interest in them) but it's a matter of time (And might as well buy while they are low)
2. Tech: I feel like there is enough information out there on these and which ones are solid.
3. Bonds: No idea on these??? I think they would be good to have to diversify. I don't think they should make up a significant portion however.
4. Consumer/Industrials: I like Costco/Walmart here, as well as Coke/Pepsi. For Industrials I like UPS (goes along with the ""Shipping everything nowadays"" as well as 3M/Boeing and Waste Management. Also Caterpillar because eventually infrastructure WILL become a problem (it already is) so this seems obvious to stick in.
5. Other Suggestions: This is where you come in :) (Obviously i'd be pulling some from the Aristocrats).",finance

No rude/mean comments please.","Looking for advice...some insight? Maybe some wisdom or guidance from someone who's been in this situation..?

Please no rude or mean comments. I'm already feeling very down about my/our financial situation. 

Recently received notice of this year's new monthly fed student loan payment…$1,100 due for the next 12 months (IBR plan for a family of 4). I’m down, depressed and anxious about how this is going to work within our family “budget” and financial goals. We won’t have enough left over to save for retirement or a down payment for a house.

My husband and I are in our mid 30's with an infant and a toddler (daycare costs!). Home ownership no longer seems possible. Retirement goals are shattered. And forget about saving for our children's education funds. Travel or vacation? Not possible. I feel like a complete idiot. I hate myself for making such an idiotic and life-changing decision of attending grad school. Instead of getting ahead in life, I've set my family and our life goals back - in a major way!  

Here is a look at what our financial situation will be once my student loan kicks in next month: 

$6,600/month (combined monthly net income)

Our monthly bills:

\-	$1,700 (daycare for 2)

\-	$1,450 (rent for 2 bedroom in LA area, considered “cheap” in not so nice area)

\-	$800 (groceries)

\-	$300 (health &amp; life insurance)

\-	$80 (auto insurance for two very, very old but paid off cars)

\-	$500 (utilities: elect, gas, water, trash, internet, cell)

\-	$155 (husband’s fed student loan)

\-	$140 (diapers, wipes, formula) 

\-	$1,080 (my upcoming fed student loan)

$6,600 – 6,205 = $395 left over for the month (but didn't include gas for work/home commute and other misc expenses) that may come up.

And please, PLEASE no rude or mean comments. I'm already feeling very down, depressed and anxious about the negative financial situation I put myself in. Not only does it affect me and my husband, but our two little ones as well.

Edit:

\*We live in southern California and moving out of the area or state is not an option due to husband's job.

\*We are renting a 2bd (not a nice area either).

\*Neither of us has family in the area who could watch our children in lieu of daycare.

\*The only pro that I could come up with: I work for a non-profit...so there is PSLF (I need to do more research on this)

Bitcoin,Digitisation through blockchain technology,"Blockchain is a revolutionary new technology which allows for the recording of any type of transaction into blocks of data, such as a digital ledger. According to the IDC’s inaugural *Worldwide Semiannual Blockchain Spending Guide*, worldwide spending on blockchain solutions is forecast to reach USD 2.1bn in 2018 – more than double that spent in 2017.

Given that the UAE is setting itself up as a world-leading hub of smart technology, it makes sense that it would be looking to capitalise on these figures. Last month the UAE government launched the ‘UAE Blockchain Strategy 2021’, seeking to conduct 50% of federal transactions using this technology by 2021 in the hope of saving AED 11bn in document circulation every year. (Arabian Escapes)

Use of blockchain technology would also change the real estate sector dramatically, eradicating the need for paperwork. In fact, the Dubai Land Department has already taken the leap and become the world’s first government entity to use blockchain to record all contracts and registrations, while linking them with various property-related organisations such as water and telecommunications. The writing is on the wall; new technology is coming to the mainstream. Following on from the government’s launch of the UAE Strategy for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the UAE Blockchain Strategy 2021 will further revolutionise the real estate sector. The takeaway is this: if you’re an investor or buyer you should be following the blockchain trend closely, if only so you’re more prepared to operate within the new system.

personalfinance,Best way to extend me credit limits?,"I’m a 22 year old male. I got my first credit card at 18 through USAA and it has an awesome interest rate. It still does, but despite the account changing from a “Student” to a standard account and a credit score above 780 (according to CreditKarma) they still won’t give me a limit higher than $300.

I also have some other cards, had various big box store card from the days all us kids worked retail (getting my friends the succesful apps they needed.) Most of them had similarly laughable limits and were cancelled a year later due to infrequent or no use. The best was a walmart card that offered me a $7000 but with a horrendous interest rate on non-walmart purchases

I currently use a Chase/Amazon card which I recently got extended to *gasp* $3000 from the initial $2000 limit I had previously. As well as 4 other active cards with sub-1000 limits I use sparingly based on cashback offers. In general this works for me, but I’m moving toward starting a busines and before that has any hope getting anywhere I would like to become master of my own personal credit.


Anyway, I figure all the opened and unused/closed accounts don’t bode well for me. I also have no previous loans as I keep buying old cars and made it through undergraduate school without borrowing (scholarships, I was fortunate to have no worries as long as my grades stayed up.) The last important detail is I technically have no real income. Through school I worked for cash through handshake agreements with local businesses and odd jobs. That means no paystubs or W2s despite my “working” for the entirety of my time in school, making getting loans impossible.(I am aware of the many other pitfalls of such income, so please avoid advice about that.) Im currently making plenty of cash in a similar way but college is over and I need to find a big boy income.

So what’s the best avenue for me? Should I get on payroll somewhere and take some loans out? Is there any good way to increase my reliability in the eyes of a banker without paystubs?

**Capital:** 9.000€ in mutual funds that have averaged around 4% for the past 3 years, in addition to 75.000€ available for me only when I want to buy an apartment (the money is in a life insurance with very bad interests). The price range of the apartment will be around 350.000€. Interest rates will be very low on my loan as I work in a bank (less than my student debt).

**Questions:**

1. Where should I save my money every month? Considering that I might buy an apartment in 1.5-2 years, I am thinking there is no need to bear risks on it. Do you think I should put a small portion of it in a mutual fund? My regular savings account has an interest of 0.7%/year, which is where I am currently storing my savings from my first pay.
2. Should I pay down my student loan faster? People tell me the interest rate is very good and that it doesn't make a big difference rushing the payments... Thoughts?
3. When buying an apartment, should I spend all my capital on the payment? Assuming the interests on my future home loan is between 0,5-1%, what should I do with the capital I will have by then of approx. 100k€?

**Scenario 1:** Doubling my monthly student debt payments to save interests, saving all my money in a 0,7% savings account until I want to buy an apartment, spend all my capital on buying my house to have the lowest house loan possible. Pros: fast downpayment of my apartment. Cons: exposing myself too much to the house market?

**Scenario 2:** Doubling my monthly student debt payments to save interests, saving x% (how much?) of my money in a 0,7% savings account and the rest in low/moderate-risk mutual funds. When time comes to buy an apartment, inject no more than 20% of the house price from my capital (assuming a &lt;1% interest on the loan) and continue saving as much as I can in funds while paying down the loan simultaneously. Pros: building capital in funds while paying down an apartment, more diversified investing. Cons: ?

**Am I right in my reasoning, is scenario 2 much better, or have I missed something?**

Please please let me know if you have any other ideas on what I should do. Thanks a lot, reddit! &lt;3",finance
personalfinance,On our way to being 800k+ in debt...,"My SO and I are both medical students - he is graduating this year and I am in my second year. As many of you know, medical school is not cheap. Many students in our class receive support from their parents or family. However, neither of us have any real financial support.

He has accumulated close to $450,000 for his 4 years of school. He will start working next year, which is good, although you don't make much money as a resident (anywhere between 55k-70k a year). I still have 2.5 years to go, and I have accumulated about $200,000 so far. I am anticipating taking out another $200,000 for the next two years until I graduate (possibly more due to the costs of registration for board exams, flying out to attend interviews, etc.).

We don't have any debt besides that. We do not have outrageous lifestyles and we are both aware that with our interest rates, we could very rapidly accumulate more debt if we do not focus on getting rid of these loans (even federal loans for medical students are at 7%). 

It is very difficult to work, even part time or per diem as school and studying take up your entire life. I am hoping to try to do some extra tutoring or something on the side for the time being. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what we can do in the meantime? I don't know if re-financing my loans is an option for me at this moment. My financial aid office at school is completely useless so I am a bit lost, and want to try to nip this before it starts getting out of control (already seems like it kind of is).

financialindependence,Londoner attempt to FIRE,"Hi all, thought it’d be interesting I’d share my thoughts from the UK given that most stories seem to be US based.

26 years old, on a fire path since 2 years. Working in tech and on OTE £80K/y (or $100k).

Started two years ago with an accumulation plan through a direct debit that was taking £100/week from my account and putting it into a saving deposit. Automatically (that’s the best advice I can give to those looking to start).

Continued to build this accumulation plan as my salary increased and now saving about £1.5k/month.

Earlier this year I bought a flat (RE prices are high in London but due to brexit you may get good deals) for £330K, with a £130K deposit with the help of my family.

Took a 200K mortgage, fixed interest rate for 10 years, 40 years length. Monthly repayments are very low, but I thought I’d stay cautious and go for a longer deal as I’m doing this on my own and was afraid of how possible economic downturns in next few years may impact me.

Now however I can afford paying that and more and currently doing overpayments on my repayments for over 125% of the monthly capital. If I continue with this trend, I’ll be debt free in 12 years. 

Also doing overpayments means if anything happens to my current conditions (lose my job, decide to go into further education/MBA, take off year travelling) I can pause my mortgage payments as I already paid a lot in advance. And most importantly, overpayments save interests.

Goal is to build an investment/savings pot of £100K in the next 3 years (currently at £35k) and eventually purchase another property with a long term rental yield purpose.

Ultimate goal is be fire at 40, or at least FI by 35.

Even the 1 years have as recently as 2006-2007. Given the rising interest rates, it's possible those yields will peak above 4 in the near future.

Assuming they do rise above 4%, could one construct a 1-30 year mixed bond ladder and have a SWR equal to the lowest yield? If you lock in enough of these, doesn't this buy down your risk? Or are you know just trading it for the risk of inflation making 4+% too little?",finance

personalfinance,Prioritizing Debt Repayment Student Loans vs. Credit Cards (Loans are In-School Deferment),"After reviewing the Prime Directive, and the financial flowchart I'm struggle with which debt re-payments to prioritize. I am currently working full time, and in school full time at night. Because I'm a full time student, my loans are deferred - meaning no payments are due until 6 months after separation, which leads to the question:

Currently I have approximately $11k in credit card debt. This $11k is at 0% interest (the promotional period expires around May).

My student loans are $31,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 6.2%

After expenses (and 401k contributions) I have between $1,200 - $1,900 with which to save, pay down debt, etc. I currently have a 1 month emergency fund.

Two questions: 
1. with debts as high as mine are, does it make sense to increase e-fund to 3 - 6 months?
2. Mathematically, it seems that paying the student loans should take precedence, but credit-wise it seems that the credit cards may be wiser to pay. In this situation should Credit Cards or Student Loan payments take precedence?

I'm financially illiterate and could use any advice you're willing to give.","First off, thanks in advance. I see a lot of folks in similar circumstance post here and get great, solid, actionable advice. I've tried to absorb as much of that as I can, but wondering if there is something else I'm missing. 

I went to school for painting. It seemed like a good idea at the time. By the time I graduated, I had $80,000 in loans. I didn't realize it was so high until I looked into it after I received my degree. I also didn't realize that art wasn't just a low-paying industry, but how completely stacked the odds are against you of actually making it work. They don't tell you that in art school. Years after graduating, I started seeing all of my art school friends inherit large sums of money and then it clicked for me - fine art is unfortunately mostly reserved for the wealthier classes. 

I spent most of my years after college working various odd jobs while trying to make in roads into a career as an artist. It never took off as I wanted and needed it to, and that's ok. About a year ago I pivoted my career and taught myself graphic and web design.

I just got a full-time job starting at $40,000 as an in-house graphic designer. 

I've been paying the minimum amount on my loans to not default but it's just been towards the interest. My mom, also not having a good grasp on finance, insisted I take out a parent PLUS loan through her in order to do study aboard while I was in college “to follow my dreams”. [If I could turn back time!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsKbwR7WXN4)

I have $50,000 in federal loans in my name and $30,000 in loans in her name. The loans in her name are consolidated at 8% and I pay $215 a month towards them, but again this is just covering the interest. 

The loans in my name are not consolidated yet, but I will be paying $275 a month towards them once I start this job on an income based repayment plan. The rates vary from 3% to 6%

That's about $500 a month towards the loans, but with most of that going to interest. I've been broke for a long time, and know how to live broke so I feel capable of making high payments towards the loans, but I'd like it to at least be productive. 

This seems both high and unproductive. 

Is there anything I can do? Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Multiple Savings Accounts vs 1 High Yield,"This may be a dumb question, but please bare with me. 

I’ll use some round numbers for this example. I was planning on converting my Chase Total Checking and Savings accounts to the Premier level to earn more interest now that I’ve built up a decent balance where I wouldn’t ever get dinged by the daily minimums. I had also pocketed away a smaller amount at Ally based on their high interest rate. 

But then I did the math. 

Option A) Keep 10K in Chase Premier at .01%, 15K in Chase Premiere at .04% and 5K at Ally at 1.85%. Continue to contribute roughly 1400/month to Ally savings. 

Option B is keep the 10K checking in my  original Chase Total Checking at no interest (which is roughly my 2 months budget if I suddenly make no income and lose my subletter), but put all 20K into Ally savings, plus the 1400/month. Without a linked savings account or mortgage, I could not bump the Checking on its own to Premier. 

I am terrible at math, so maybe I didn’t use the interest calculators correctly, but even after 1 year, Option B saves me more money, correct? Is there any reason NOT to move the entire amount of my savings to one high yield account?

Please keep in mind I am not solely relying on the savings accounts. I have a pension building from my original union career, a 401K I max out at my new job with the option to buy stock at a 15% discount, and a small amount invested in stocks. I am putting other leftover savings toward all those areas, but for the time being, am able to funnel that 1400/month to build up my emergency fund. I work in the TV industry, so the pay is high, but so is the turnover. 

I THINK Option B makes the most sense, but is there anything I’m overlooking?",finance
personalfinance,"I quit a job that I made good money at, now I am screwed","Hi all, I am a junior in college at a large university. 

This past year and over the summer, I worked at one of the nicest hotels in town as a valet averaging about $14 an hour, and I worked about 25 hours a week. I got paid primarily in tips, so I pretty much walked away from a shift with about $50 each day. On lucky days, I would make as high as $175, and I thought I had a healthy amount in savings to not have to work a lot with classes. 

Ahead of the schoolyear, I landed probably my biggest break yet, an internship at the local newspaper that will give me a huge step forward in my career. I made the choice to quit the job at the hotel to be able to give my all to the internship, and also focus on passing classes. I also got a huge scholarship during my sophomore year, and didn't need to take out a student loan for my junior year. My federal aid and scholarship would pay for my tuition, while I would just need to cover living expenses.

I live in a house that costs $350 per month for rent with a $150 utility + furniture charge. All together I pay my landlord $500 at the beginning of every month. I get paid at my internship $9 an hour for 20 hours a week. So $180 a week flat. So I went into the semester knowing I could in theory live on a budget of $720 a month, spend $500 on rent, $100 on groceries, and have $120 for gas other expenses. 

Simply put, that's not what's happened. I am spending quite a bit on gas, and I am taking out cash to spend at bars just as every college student does way too much. So when it comes time to pay for rent, I have to draw out of savings. I can't keep going at that rate the rest of the schoolyear, or else there won't be any more money left in the account.

I have already considered asking the employer if I could work for them again, but that's unlikely considering they don't tend to hire people back after they quit. I also wouldn't be able to work many shifts that would get me tips, as I would be stuck with the ones where I'd just make my base wage of $5 an hour. 

I want to find a job that would help me with living expenses, makes tips so I can better pay for my life day to day, and also  would work well with my schedule at my internship. Advice?",finance

personalfinance,Spouse-to-be needs debt bailout and unsure if/how I should help,"Throw Away as this is private financial information. 

I’m a 40 yr old Federal employee in need of some guidance on my specific situation. 

Assets: 120K between government TSP (401K) and Rollover IRA; 10K in liquid savings account @ 1.85% APR.
Liabilities: 9K remaining grad school loan @ 4.08%; 23K balance remaining on new car loan 3 yr term @ 2.29% (bought recently with 7K downpayment and monthly payment of $750)
Income: 102K per yr
Expenses: I pay about $1050 each month on debt service, and $945 for rent. Food/entertainment/utilities/phone all kept very reasonable so that I am able to save about 1500-2000 per month. I also contribute 5% of my salary to TSP, which is fully matched by the government.
Credit: Excellent credit score at around 820.
Background: Grew up poor and have no safety net in the form of parental help (they’ll probably need my financial help as they continue to age).

I realize at age 40 that I don’t have a super impressive financial picture, although it’s also not terrible. The reason I’m not doing better ties back to a nasty divorce about 6 years ago during which I essentially walked away from everything in order to get out of a really toxic relationship. No regrets there, but it did result in a major reset that involved a lot of divorce debt (lawyers, new furniture, settlement, car, moving expenses, etc.). Also did some traveling that I should have skipped until I was on a better financial footing. All that’s in the past and I’m now determined to save and be more responsible. 

Now I’ll come to the main point of this post. I am about to marry a 33 yr old woman whom I’ve been living with for 3 yrs and dating for 4.5 yrs. She has the following financial picture:

Assets: None besides her defined-benefit pension plan at work.
Liabilities: 31K in consumer debt (recently consolidated all her cc debt which was previously APR @ 23%, now reduced down to 11%); 61K in student loan debt (rates unclear but she says loans are at 6-8% APR).
Income: 62K per yr
Credit: Good around 750
Background: Also from a poor family with parents who may need some help financially a few yrs down the line.

She knows she’s made some really bad choices, particularly in regards to the the 31K consumer debt. In the past six months she’s curbed her spending, consolidated the high interest cc debt, acknowledged the mistakes she’s made with living way beyond her means, and has felt a lot of guilt and embarrassment over the mistakes. I feel confident that she’s seen the light.

I’m hoping for some guidance on how I can intervene and help bail her out - or even whether I should intervene at all. The way I view it is we are a team and this is now my problem. For example, we may want to buy a home with FHA loan in the next couple years, which means even if I apply for the mortgage without her, our Debt-to-Income will be viewed jointly for that type of loan, which would probably result in us being rejected on account of her DTI. 

My ideas on how to help: I could take a loan against my TSP retirement account to pay off her consumer debt, which she would then repay to me with interest at the G Fund rate @ 2.5% or so. That would still leave a ton of student loan debt, but at least the higher interest consumer debt would be wiped out. TSP loans don’t count against DTI so that would really improve our ability to get the FHA. There is, however, the opportunity cost I would incur from taking that money out of the market and only receiving the 2.5% G fund interest rate instead of the much higher potential gains I would likely experience in the mutual funds. 

Another idea I had was to transfer her some or all of her 11% consumer debt over to a zero percent cc in my name, which she would then make monthly payments on to pay down within the term (we wouldn’t transfer more than she could realistically repay within the term, which would probably be 18 months). This may take my credit score down a bit, but probably not a ton and it would only be temporary.

Forex,Observations of a Developing Trader 2018 W39 Summary,"I was quite surprised at the response to my last post on this topic.  In the interest of:

1. forcing me to put the good, bad, and ugly on paper for all to see
2. perhaps giving others an inside glimpse into the progression of a new/struggling/developing trader who has a regular 8:00 - 5:00 job and a family
3. accelerating my development by exposing trading faults and challenges to the community and receiving feedback

I am going to work on doing a weekly post covering my observations and lessons learned from the previous weeks trading.  I measure my progress weekly as I am more of a swing trading style using the W, D, and 4hr charts mostly and try to not get caught up in the intra-day fluctuations too much.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Big lesson this week = FOMC.**  I really flubbed this entire week off of this one news event.  I had several trade signals fire off about 8-12 hours prior to the FOMC announcement and I took 4 of them knowing that I should not be that exposed with the FOMC coming up so soon.  Even though I was ultimately right, I got stopped out or closed them prior to my stops based on the volatility.  This nuked about 3% of my account value on those 4 trades.  

*Two other important lessons that are recurring themes for me:*

1. **Trade the strategy diligently and you can get out of the hole if you keep you calm.** There really is that much opportunity in the market.  After my FOMC flub I came right back into it a few hours later with a short EURUSD position that made up 2/3 of my FOMC debacle.  I also had a late Friday CADJPY long that when closed had me ending up down less than 0.5% for the week. My first losing week since the end of July. 
2. **Exits, Exits, Exits.**  I have a hard time with exiting too early.  I attribute this to when I was first starting out and finding my trading strategy. I had several instances where I would have a very large profit (mainly from having way too large of a position for my account size) and then giving it all back because I was not taking profits when the market would retrace/reverse.  After reviewing my journal the past several weeks I have really left a lot of profits on the table by not sticking to my exit strategy.  

One metric I track weekly that, for me, is enlightening is what I call the ImaBAD.  This evaluates what percentage of my trades are bad trades and what their impact is on the current weeks PnL.  In my journal I identify which trades I took that I should not have.  There are two main reason I have a bad trade:

1. I take a trade outside of my strategy
2. I am taking a trade that is in my strategy but has a lot of uncertainty because I have questions and themes around the situation that I have not answered of defined adequately.  

This weeks ImaBAD numbers: 

* Bad Trade % = 35%
* Impact = 51%.  

This means that 51% of my losses could have been avoided had I not taken those 35% trades.  That equates to almost 3% of equity vaporized because - ImaBAD. NOTE: FOMC flub is only a part of that 35%/51%.
