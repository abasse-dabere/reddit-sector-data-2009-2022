personalfinance,Is refinancing student loans with the current low interest rates a good idea?,"I am a recent graduate with about $120,000 in federal student loan debt, I make $80,000 a year before taxes and for now, I don't feel completely overburdened with my payments. I am just wondering if by refinancing with a private company with a fixed interest rate rate while the offers are so low, (between \~2 and \~6 percent), I would save money in the long run or if it's even a good idea. I have several low percentage and low value loans at around 3-4% interest and all around 1-2k with one of them at about 6.6k but my higher valued loans are for grad school at 10k, 11k, 20k, and 40k, each with anywhere from 6.0-7.6% interest rates, (these are the ones I'm most worried about paying off and how much interest will accrue).

Just wondering if I should stick with the federal loan servicer, if I should consolidate with the federal loan servicer, or if it makes sense to try to refinance now to try to save money over time?

I'm sorry if I don't have enough details in my post, I'm new to the world of personal finance and don't have a lot of guidance.",finance
dogecoin,"I'm kinda getting over the whole ""clandestine ops"" thing. It'd annoying and frankly completely useless. Either sides will do what they will and suppression never works. So from here on I'm gonna be more transparent.","I'm gonna keep it slow because I admit I don't know the big picture, I don't know if anyone does but I'm gonna continue doing whatever I feel is in the interest of the people.

1stly here ya go.

Look back at the art scam. What if you had the chance to buy 7000 pollacks 10 bucks a pop. Luckily you had a friend at the gugenheim and was willing to be in on it. The ballistic art style of pollack allowed for effectively the minting of a style of painting that by virtue of the ballistic layering at any angle made them unforgeable assets.

Let's rewind. What if the average pleb has the chance to buy 7000 of these and then get one shown and then auction at the gugenheim. And you so happened to have the credit (since our monetary system shifted from treasury notes to federal reserve notes thereby allowing for the biggest albiet very selective expansion of credit in the modern age.

You bidded this piece of art, an asset whose value was entirely subjective to 10 million.

All the while you knew you had 7000 of them at home.

The act of bidding up the single pollack to 10 million thereby caused your 7000 to explode in value while also exploding the entire pipeline of expressionism. This of course made the headlines which only reaffirmed the subjective value. 

In the east expressionism was also very popular at the time. The daoist style that emphasized movement masterful strokes of calligraphy in hyper minimalist monochrome with only a stamp as a maker's mark.

The expressionism of the east directly influenced expressionism and impressionism on the west but why did the art of the east not explode on value at the same rate? Why was it possible for anyone to beautify their homes with art of this style while the same style of equally matched skill became unattainable vessels of wealth on the west?

Right now the same thing is happening with crypto.

I'm in no way anti government but I do not believe that crypto should be taxed. It's a government service at all so why should it be?

When you make a big purchase you'll see a dip. It's not a coincidence. Use it to your advantage. Withdraw and only leave what you intend to use to ""play"" as you would chips at a casino.

The rest of however much you own is no ones business but your own.

Using your chips go ahead and bid up and down your holdings and place them back onto the exchange only when you intend to collect your profits.

Then repeat.

This is what everyone else is doing and it's only right that everyone be privy to this.

Like I've always said I'm only doing what I feel is in the interest of the people. Those on our side I'm grateful for your support. Those who object and have reason are free to dm me.

I'm not interested in being bought out or being threatened so let's keep things civil. If you feel like you have to resort to that you clearly are not fit to play the game and are admitting to yourself that even with all the power on the world a bunch of millenials are playing you. Let's keep things civil and well play your game since we effectively have no choice but to organize and beat you at the very game you used to exploit us.

To everyone else play safe and play smart. Keep an eye on the bigger picture.

A million thrown in at 16 to 17 is more money gained than a million thrown in at 17 to 18. These small percentages magnify wealth disproportionately. The goal is to neutralize the disparity in whatever way you can figure out.

This is all a game with rules and it's ultimately chaotic lawful. The laws just aren't the laws you'd expect. Crypto for instance is freely manipulated because there are no laws. Manipulate it at your leisure. 

One of the biggest crimes is the ""found art"" scam where a box of art is discovered once an artist is dead and then the move uncut gems happens.

That is a really good movie btw and gives you a great overview of how value is manipulated and how the mitm are always blamed when they are only acting in service of a system that has them just as trapped.

P. S. RH is a great data feed. They buy and sell flow. They have to make money. I buy flow data from them and I actually want them to make money so they succeed and stay afloat because they have the best data feed out there currently. Their transparently makes them the mitm which draws a ton of flack. If you want to debate whether rh is good or bad I'd say they are a tool and are chaotic neutral. The precision of the tools that they provide in my opinion make them good on a utilitarian sense. So I personally like them.

Flow like any other data can be weaponised. I. E. Poisoned to your advantage. The speed of which you can poison the flow and see the result is what I'm most interested in. Who else let's you buy a single doge at a time?

But watch uncut gems.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Followed the infographic - Student Loan Question,"Hi r/personalfinance! I was hoping you all could weigh in on a decision I have been trying to make regarding my student loans. I am heavily considering the avalanche method because my grad school IRs are variable(max is 6.6%). My loans have been on deferment and interest pause since covid, graduated in 2020 so never got to the repayment process yet. My loans did accrue interest while in school and my plan was to pay the interest off before it capitalized. However, since covid I have been able to amass a 6 month emergency fund as well as enough to pay off all of the interest that has accrued since grad school and secured a high paying job that I can get ahead of the loans a bit. I need some help with strategy for avalanche though.

Loans(all federal)

1 Principal: 17747  IR 5.31% Accrued $2573.38   Total $20320.38

2 Principal 20500 IR 6.0% Accrued $2929.24 Total $23429.24

3 Principal 20500 IR 6.6% Accrued $1871.14 Total  422,371.14

4 Principal 20500 6.08% Accrued $480.77 Total $20,980.77

Interest accrued so far: $7854.53

My thought is to ask for Mohela to extend my loan term to 25 years to set a lower minimum payment and attack the highest interest rate first(Loan 3). However, I cannot figure out if I should take the total interest accrued across all of the loans and just put it completely towards the highest rate and let the others capitalize the interest they accrued or  pay off the interest first that has accrued on each loan. I am probably splitting hairs but if I can save myself 2-5k across the life time I will do it. TIA!",finance
vet,Puppy throwing up,"I woke up this morning to my 12 week old labradoodle puppy having thrown up everywhere in his kennel. I took him out and fed him some food, but he threw it up immediately. I stopped feeding him and just gave him water which he again threw up. After hours of this I took him to an emergency vet who did some kind of imaging on his stomach which revealed nothing. They gave him an anti-nausea medicine through a shot and gave me some pills to give him for the next 4days to help his nausea. They told me if he continued to throw up to bring him back and they’d have to do an ultrasound. 

I got home an hour and a half ago and fed him about a half cup of food; he ate about half of it. He was playing fine and drinking water, but he just threw up again (only this time it was solid, I’m guessing since he had eaten not long ago). I’m not going to take him back to the vet tonight as he still seems okay other than the quick vomiting; if he continues to throw up tomorrow morning I will take him to his actual vet to get help and do the ultrasound. I’m worried sick rn and just looking for anyone who has experienced anything similar.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Here Are Some Bullish Thoughts For The Crypto Market Ahead Of The Upcoming November 3rd US Fed Meeting... Based On Re-listening to the September Fed Meeting On Economy and Interest Rates,"I was worried about the market reaction to the Fed tapering schedule which will be announced on November 3rd at 2pm, so I decided to re-listen to Powell's September speech. The tapering is estimated to start in mid-November or December which is largely expected by the market; however, Fed commentary around interest rate and inflation will be critical to determining if the bull market persists.

In regards to the September US non-farm payroll released after the last Fed meeting, ""Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, compared with the Dow Jones estimate for 500,000"", so this will make the Fed more dovish (i.e. more inflation, low interest, more accommodative) for this up-coming November meeting. Likewise, US GDP was lower than the Fed would like to see, further contributing to their likely dovishness.

The Fed is also getting pressure from politicians such as Warren who called Powell a ""dangerous man"" inferring that if he becomes Hawkish too soon, it will result negatively for a fragile recovering COVID economy. I don't think he cares what Warren thinks very much \[like most people\], but I do think it inadvertently pressures him to be more dovish.

For these reasons, in regards to interest rate increases at this up-coming Nov 3 meeting, Powell will AVOID providing any commentary relating to timing of rate increases occurring in 2022. Some Wall St banks are expecting 2 interest rate increases in 2022 due to inflation. However, I heard nothing from Powell's September speech to suggest he will raise once or twice in 2022. He said the hurdle for raising interest rates is significantly higher than the hurdle to start tapering. He did mention that all but one of the Fed officials expects interest rate increases starting in 2023; however, for 2022 Powell said interest rates can increase only after tapering completes (mid-2022) because it's senseless to raise interest rates while bond purchases are occurring. And he said the Fed is going to continue to monitor the economy before providing guidance on such rate increases.

In regards to actual inflation, the fed is unlikely to acknowledge its true extent in the midst of a COVID economy. Powell is being very careful with how he discusses inflation and interest rate increases. His commentary will focus on how inflation is manageable, related to supply chain shortages, and how it will be lower in the out years like 2023 once the economy is on firmer ground.

In regards to crypto, I think there is potential for a bumpy Monday / Tuesday (I'm scared every time the Fed speaks) but I see Bitcoin staying above $59K. Institutions understand the bull market too much to allow Bitcoin to fall any further than $59K, and if it falls to this level it will quickly be purchased. After this meeting on Wednesday, I believe Crypto is free to increase until November 22nd forming new ATHs, after which volatility from November 29 options expiry will start to set in and potentially cause a minor pull back from these new ATHs.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Saving Bucket used for Rent or Investing ?,"Hi r/personalfinance. I am a young professional in my mid 20s. At the moment, I have about $30k in my personal saving (not including 401k and my personal brokerage account). From my calculation, my living expenses (rent+utility+food) would be around $20k per year. I sometimes get really worried about my personal finance/spending since I am very poor with budgeting. 

My plan is to set this $20k aside only for paying the living expenses. However, keeping all the money in a saving account does not seem enticing to me (low interest rate). My question is, should I put this money in a market-based ETF/Mutual Funds to invest and sell when I need money to pay rent ? or should I just keep it in a saving account ?

My liquidity need should be low to moderate. I think I can cover any immediate need with the $10 left in my saving. Thank you all.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Why are there so few crypto projects that use a Federated Byzantine Agreement consensus protocol?,"So everyone knows the classics, PoW, PoS and i decided to some more deep diving into alternative consensus protocols and i've ran across the federated byzantine agreement algorithm.

Many might not have heard about this consensus algorithm but it's been around for a while now, the most known distributed ledgers that are currently using a FBA based consensus algorithm are the XRP Ledger, Stellar and the upcoming smart contract and EVM capable Flare Network.

Networks that use a FBA based consensus protocol are open which means everyone can set up a validator.

General consensus is achieved in a way that a validator validates transactions and compares them to a selected number of other validators that are considered trustworthy and are expected to not attack the network, if all validators agree that their validated transactions are accurate they're written into a new block.

Decentralization and security are achieved by the fact that every validator can choose his selected list of trustworthy validators himself nobody is required to select a specific validator, as long as there is a specific amount overlap between the trusted parties from Validator A and Validator B and their transactions are deemed valid consensus can be achieved, the only undesireable case where this consensus protocol would fail is if there is no overlap at all in which case you could end up with parties whose validations that are contradicting each other and consensus could not be achieved.

Security is achieved through the fact that every validator has a list of trusted parties, attacking the network is not possible due to the fact that a malicious validator or a small group if included in a genuine validators trusted parties by itself either does not have enough influence to change the overall outcome f.e. in order to issue a double spend. On the other side if a party would decide to set up enough validators the attack would fail due to the fact that the massive amount of malicious validators are not part of the necessary overlap.

Looking at it the FBA consensus algorithm is fast, secure and open for everyone to use. The fact that every one can choose a validator and select who to trust makes it incredibly decentralized at the same time it's a algorithm that doesn't cause a network to halt if some validators suddenly stop working or get out of sync.

I'm curious how a solid consensus algorithm can be so overlooked, is it because of the fact that there are no incentives as PoS and PoW offer some kind of yield.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,How will Bitcoin prices react to central banks’ reviews? - Crypto Prophet Chicky Nuggy deliberates,"Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are likely to jump this week on central banks’ interest rates announcements, predicts Nuggy.

The prediction from Chicky, the game-changing CEO and founder of this reddit account, comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Central Bank of Norway, and the Reserve Bank of Australia, are all reviewing interest rate policy this week.

Mr Nuggy says: “Market watchers will be all eyes on central banks as they look for further hints on asset-buying tapering as global inflation ramps up.

“The Fed is expected to announce a taper, the Bank of England an interest rate rise, Norway likely to hint about its second-rate hike of the year, and the Reserve Bank of Australia could shift its guidance after last week letting its 3-year bond yield surge through the targeted 0.1%.”

Nug continues: “There’s a growing consensus that we’re going to get tightening a lot quicker than markets had previously anticipated.

“This climate will boost Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as with their provable limited supply cap, they are an intrinsically deflationary asset class.

“The mounting concerns over inflation causing Bitcoin to appear more attractive as a hedge, also comes at the time as inflows from institutional investors continue to increase - bringing with them capital and expertise - and as providers continue to meet ongoing demand with new Bitcoin-related investment products.”

Mr Nuggy adds: “In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve saying it has no intention of banning cryptocurrencies is not going unnoticed by both retail and institutional investors. 

“That said, it’s highly probable that other cryptocurrencies will have more stringent regulatory oversight, yet Bitcoin could be viewed differently by authorities partly due to its gold-like status.”

In July, the Nugget successfully predicted that Bitcoin would hit fresh all-time highs this year, which came to pass last month.  He has also said that should the current conditions be maintained, additional new highs could be reached before the end of 2021.

He concludes: “Crypto investors will be eyeing the central banks this week amid a flurry of interest rate reviews. Prices can be expected to be positively impacted as Bitcoin and others are increasingly regarded as a hedge against inflationary pressures.”",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How to structure a portfolio for a Lombard Loan?,"How does one structure a portfolio of stocks aimed at securing a Lombard loan? In particular, how does one manage potential capital gains vs dividends/interest?

I would like my portfolio to experience the highest and most secured growth possible, while being able to generate income to pay the Lombard loan interest.

Here is a first suggestion, based on the following hypotheses:
- Interest rate: 3%
- LTV: 75%
- Loan need: 150k

- Portfolio size: 200k
- 50% SPY (1.5% dividend + 7% average annual return)
- 25% STWD (7% dividend + 0% average annual return)
- 25% ZURN (6% dividend + 0% average annual return)

I would end up in average with 3.5% growth (capital gain) and 4% dividend yield. So that would be in theory a good allocation as my dividends can pay for my loan interests. Any thoughts?

I am open to other ideas or more generally strategies to allow optimal portfolio allocation when you need to generate income.",finance

# [Dow futures rise more than 150 points as November begins with investors betting on a year-end rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures posted a strong gain in early morning trading Monday as investors bet on a year-end rally after markets navigated a typically tough seasonal period successfully.
*****
&gt; Dow futures rose 185 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.
*****
&gt; Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; “In our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery,” wrote Fundstrat’s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. “COVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.”
*****
&gt; After a tough September where the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.
*****
&gt; But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.
*****
&gt; For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22%.
*****
&gt; Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and October’s jobs report.
*****
&gt; As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be looking for the Fed’s comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,” Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. “In a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.”
*****
&gt; Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from September’s 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.
*****
&gt; The other big event for the week will be October’s employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after September’s meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.
*****
&gt; “Key to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.

CryptoCurrency,A tale of remorse and of dreams lost…..,"Of course when I say dreams lost I mean that I lost or didn’t win at the crypto roulette wheel.
Let me begin with my history of Crypto. I was aware of it early and had watched from a far, I knew of 2 Bitcoin pizza guy, of the use of the blockchain to secure a network and intermittently checked the charts and the value of BTC, Litecoin and later ETH noting their single double and triple digit values. 

I looked in 2016 and 2018 at ways of entering the market but no one I knew was in it and it all looked a little to daunting and difficult. 

Welcome 2020 and 2021 Hello Covid! It was mid-May 2021 and where I am we came out of lockdown for a while and could return to the pub. A work colleague who I regularly drink with had been at me to play with Crypto for months and, he had made a Lot of money through 2020 and showed me some of his wins and sharing knowledge of some of his other friends who had over a $million. It became a topic of discussion and he sent me a link to an exchange to gain $10BTC for signing up so I did, I watched the charts for a week or Two and that’s when the pump and the dump happened. 

My friend had recommended 2 coins BTT and SHIB. He said a $1000 should turn into $10k or $30k. I scoffed but saw the market bottom and dived in.    Shiba Inu @0.0000790. I looked at their site, “the Doge Killer” and noted Elons tweets and the 69,000% gains on Doge at some point. I even joined the Shib army. 

I FOMO’d again with another similar purchase this time at @0.00000767. I waited and waited, bought into other projects but not by as much. I saw the Leash and Bone, I also saw it freeze crash and not pay rewards. I took this and other FUD as a warning and got out on 17 Sept @0.00000845 with a small, small profit thanking my stars I had made it out. 

I then threw that money elsewhere.

I then watched first in horror and then amazement from the 4th October to the 29th October when my original buys would have 10x.

Saddened I was for the gains unrealised.

I was remorseful but not sad for I had instead invested some of those monies in ETH and FTM. My ETH has doubled and FTM has 5x. I doubt that I could’ve held to the top on Shiba and even if I doubled and pulled out I may have missed out on FTM and ETHs equivalent gains.
Sure the moral of the story is to HODL but for me only do so on something I can have faith in and something that won’t cause me stress.

I’m now a more educated and happy Crypto investor with a portfolio that has doubled and some solid coins that make me happy to be a part of and to commit to the network for rewards.",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,Today is the day I developed paper hands,"I have to sell the rest of my Doge today due to unfortunate circumstances. I first brought in at 1 cent and kept buying until it hit 20 cents the first time, I made a solid 10k. Doge is the reason that I have my current apartment, it fed me on countless nights when I didn't know where my next meal was going to come from. Without Doge I don't even know where I would be in life right now. 

I got into Doge because for the first time in my life I felt like I had a chance to win at something, to be free - hell that's the reason I got into cryptos in the first place, I wanted to experience financial freedom.  Doge went above and beyond in helping me reach those dreams.  Though I am sad that I have to part ways with my precious coins, it took me to the moon as promised

I love what this coin has been able to do for those in this community, I love the positivity and compassion that I've seen every day on this sub. I want you all to be able to experience my little slice of happiness in your lives. 

Don't lose hope, I don't know how many people laughed at me and called me crazy for investing in internet dog money. We'll all be on the moon sooner or later.

This isn't about winning a race, nor is this about being number one. This is about freedom and kindness. Remember that his coin has touched and changed the lives of so many people.

Thank you all, for everything

Be kind and don't forget the golden rule:

Do Only Good Everyday.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who wished me well, I’ve been dealing with a lot lately and greatly appreciate the positivity you have shared with me - you have made my day &lt;3

To those commenting negativity, why? Why are you so upset? Why? Do Only Good Everyday, thats the motto of this coin. That type of mentality will not make this coin the coin of the people. Be kind and spread love, you never know what another person is going through, your kindness can save a life.

CryptoCurrency,Ethereum is deflationary!,"Over the last 7 days the Ethereum network burned more ETH than it issued - yes, that’s right - Ethereum has been deflationary for over 7 days now. Due to the current PoW issuance (4.5%), a deflationary ETH was not something that was expected to happen until The Merge but due to the on-going high fees, the Ethereum network is currently burning almost 13,000 ETH per day or $55 million at time of writing - truly insane when you really think about it. 

 This is Ethereum’s ultra sound money design proving itself in practice, many people didn’t believe we would see a deflationary ETH before the network switched to Proof of Stake - but here we are. Also, contrary to popular belief, EIP-1559 has not increased gas prices and has in fact helped considerably with spikes in demand (such as during hyped-up NFT mints) which has led to a smoother network overall. Though it is pretty amazing that Ethereum has such consistently high demand regardless of the fee burning - people are collectively paying $50+ million a day just to get their transactions processed! 

\_

I thought this was a very interesting 2 paragraphs taken from the newsletter called The Daily Gwei.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 Because people are going to mention how crappy ETH is because of the high fees the author address this concern below:

I’ve seen some people hit back at Ethereans celebrating this deflationary ETH milestone by saying that these high fees are a negative because it prices users out of the network. Though, as all of you avid Daily Gwei readers would know by now, Ethereum’s layer 1 is doing exactly what it is meant to be doing as a settlement layer for high-value transactions. Obviously this is lost on many people in the ecosystem (especially the newer ones) and I constantly see viral tweets about how Ethereum isn’t the “future of finance” because of the high fees. This is obviously why layer 2’s are so critical to Ethereum - they allow everyone to access the Ethereum we all know and love without the high costs (and also without the relatively slow transactions).

Speaking of layer 2’s - they are obviously seeing a lot of adoption lately and I’m encouraged every time I see someone change their tune about Ethereum after using a one of them. In saying that, there is still a large UX barrier for most users onboarding onto layer 2 and that is the layer 1 bridging costs. Many users can not afford or do not want to pay a $30 to $50 bridging cost just to get onto a layer 2 - we need better solutions here such as batched onboarding, direct fiat on-ramps and CEX to layer 2 bridges. Of course, these things are coming, but until they are live I do expect some poor narratives to still persist around the high gas fees but I will continue to do my best to try and educate those that will listen.

The demand to use the Ethereum network has never been greater and I’m just really glad that most of the fee revenue generated by the network is now going to ETH holders (in the form of burned ETH) instead of miners. EIP-1559 is an amazing mechanism and really helps to ensure that Ethereum’s security, monetary policy, and overall network health remain sustainable far into the future - now we just need to work harder at getting more people to understand that Ethereum’s layer 1 is a settlement layer!",cryptocurrency
stocks,Do you sell your portfolio when moving to a state with income taxes?,"I have created a sizable return on individual stocks in the market over the last ten years. Right now my residence is TX, so no income tax if I sell a stock for profit, just the Fed rate.  I will move to Michigan in about 5 months. Michigan has a state income tax, so any stocks I sell as a resident will receive a federal and state tax before I get the profit. 

Does it make sense for me to sell everything, take my profit at the long term FED tax rate only, and then buy back into the market with all of the profit from the sale? 

Are there better options I should consider? 

I know this is obvious, I am trying to maximize profit with the least amount of taxes while still investing for the long term.

 Residential investment contracted for a second straight quarter in the  third quarter, weighed down by declines in home improvements and  single-family homebuilding.

Investment in private non-residential  construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 0.6% in September.  Spending on structures declined for a second straight quarter in the  July-September period, led by commercial and healthcare structures.

Spending  on public construction projects tumbled 0.7% in September after  increasing 1.2% in August.

cybersecurity,Guidance Request: Federated SSO and Session Logout,"Hey! I'm new here and figured I'd ask this community. I've been in cyber risk management and security architecture for the past five years. Recently migrated to a cloud native company so my on-prem mindset still holds a lot of weight in my thinking.

Today, we have a cloud hosted platform that third-party's can federate their users into (for this scenario, assume the user has successfully authenticated with their Company's IdP, which could also include MFA). After signing in via federated SSO within our platform the user is free to do what they're authorized to do. When they're done and wish to logout, there are two options - let the session idly timeout or the user can click 'Logout.' In both cases when the session is terminated all session ""material"" is invalidated. When the user attempts to log back into the platform, they will be taken back to a login screen but are presented with a 'Refresh;' upon clicking 'Refresh,' they are brought to a screen where they enter their user ID but no password. Upon clicking 'Login', they log back into the platform as if they never clicked 'Logout'; new session ""material"" is created and is used going forward.

My on-prem mindset says this is a risk/issue because we should be forcing users to re-authenticate with their full set of creds; however, our appdevs say this is by design.

I have done some research on the interwebs. Everything I read seems that this is by design because the authN token/assertion from the IdP remains valid. The user never terminated their session with their IdP, just our platform. We can send a value to the IdP to invalidate the authN token, et al., however, I have a sneaking suspicion that the user may get logged out of every other session relying on that IdP's authN token/assertion.

Is this an issue or is this how federation should work?",technology

Since my father recently died, my brother and mother (retired) are trying to refinance the family home (est. value $900,000, California) and take cash out for necessary repairs. 

The loan is for $400,000 at an interest rate of 2.875%, which I like, but the origination charges have a processing fee of $1,150 and a line reading ""2.257% of Loan Amount (Points)"", which comes out $9,030. Total closing costs with all other fees adds up to $14,714, which seems high. 

The same lender, a major bank -- probably the biggest bank -- had previously quoted an interest rate of 3.125%. The document mentions vaunted discount points in some legalese near the end (along with hazard insurance, credit report authorization). Is that why the origination charge would be so high -- more in upfront costs for a relatively lower interest rate? Or could the interest rate drop that much because of the market?",finance

What kind of rate would I be looking at since it would be backed by securities? Is it worth it? Should I liquidate my securities and pay the remaining loan out-right instead?

personalfinance,How to refinance federal student loans to help with a future mortgage application?,"Hello! My partner and I are starting to look into purchasing a home. Thank you for your advice!  


I make $65k per year in a low cost of living area, and have been aggressively paying off my federal student loans during the current period of 0% interest. I have $76k in remaining student loans. My partner makes $80k per year, and does not have any debt. We both have good credit, no other debt, and about $40k saved up for a down payment.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a good idea to refinance my student loans when the forbearance period ends to help with a mortgage application? My idea would be to refinance the loans with a long repayment period to lower my minimum monthly payment, and lower our debt to income ratio. I would continue to aggressively pay the loans with extra payments. Otherwise, the loans will return to 6% interest, and a minimum payment of $990 per month. Some other related questions:

* Will refinancing my loans negatively impact my credit history in a way that would hurt us?
* Would it be better to choose an extended federal repayment plan for now?
* How do student loan payments get reported during a mortgage application? Is it based on actual payments I've made, or based on the minimum payment listed by the lender? 
* How far ahead of time should I change my payment plan for it to be factored into our application?",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Nov 1 , 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 1, 2021**

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued their remarkable rally to once again reach new intraday record highs, with equities carrying on momentum from a record-setting October. Market participants continue to be encouraged by the stronger-than-expected start of the Q3 corporate earnings season, with companies posting robust results despite ongoing supply-side disruptions and labor market imbalances. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the Fed’s monthly meeting minutes, set to be released later this week, where I expect the Fed to officially start the tapering process, and the October jobs report, which is expected to show a pick-up in hiring after two disappointing months in a row.

According to a report by LPL Financial, November has been the best month for equities since 1950.

Though some of the heavily weighted index components from last week had disappointed against consensus estimates — with both Amazon and Apple shares dropping after posting weaker-than-expected results and guidance — other stronger results helped offset these misses, with names including Alphabet and Microsoft rallying to record levels on the heels of their respective reports. 

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will meet for its monthly policy-setting meeting, which is followed by a statement and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This meeting is expected to either announce or concretely set the stage to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing which has been running at a clip of $120 billion per month. Last month, the Fed announced that amid improving economic data, the process would begin before the end of the year and would come to an end around mid-2022. 

Given the market has been anticipating the start to tapering for months now, speculation around when the Fed will make a move on interest rates has become a point of particular interest to investors. This week's FOMC statement and press conference are likely to provide some more color to market participants around how committee members are thinking about the timing for interest-rate hikes, especially given the persistent jump in inflation seen in data including last week's core personal consumption expenditures report.

I just noticed that last week they took out one cent ($0.01) for ""Federal Withholding"" on my account. I called them up and they had no idea what it was and told me to talk to the IRS. I read a little online and usually this can be from backup withholding put the customer service representative had never heard of that. They were supposed to transfer my call but instead they hung up on me. I'm not even 100% backup withholding is my issue since I have a credit card with them so clearly they know who I am.

The most ""suspicious"" part of this is my mom was on my bank account and just got taken off of it at the end of September since she died over the summer. The only thing I can think of is something went wrong when they took her off and now thing I need to pre-pay my withholding on the interest (but I won't even make enough in there to get anything withheld).

Does anyone know who I should be talking to to figure out what's going on? Getting ahold of someone on the phone at BoFA was surprisingly difficult but I doubt going in person would really be anymore help.

personalfinance,Student Debt Vs Mortgage,"Re-posted with mod permission and requested edit:

I'm asking this with the understanding that there may be no single right answer, but the variables involved are confusing me: Right now, student loans are in defferment and while I need to confirm the dates, I believe I'm due to start up payments again in February, like most people. 

I may be able to eliminate the six-figure student debt by refinancing our home. Rates are good right now, but not that different from our existing rate, and our debt on the home is very low compared to it's current market value. 

Consolidating debt at a lower rate is obviously a good thing, and I would welcome the lowered monthly expenses, but if the housing market takes a turn, we'd risk being upside-down on our Mortgage and poorly prepared for any possible emergencies.  

I just haven't been able to infer a clear direction on this specifically from basic finance advice. The risks involved don't seem to be as easily calculated as just comparing interest rates 'apples-to-apples'. My general feeling/ understanding is that taking out any substantial amount against the house (our main asset) is too risky. Is this essentially correct?",finance
CryptoCurrency,SEC Risk and Recommendation section from their Stablecoin report released today,"**II. Risks and Regulatory Gaps Loss of Value:**

**Risks to Stablecoin Users and Stablecoin Runs**

An instrument can serve as a reliable means of payment or store of value only when there is confidence in its value, particularly in periods of stress. For stablecoins, this confidence could arise in part from its redeemability, and the belief that such redeemability is supported by a stabilization mechanism that will function effectively both during normal conditions and during periods of stress. Confidence in a stablecoin may be undermined by factors including: (1) use of reserve assets that could fall in price or become illiquid;21 (2) a failure to appropriately safeguard reserve assets; (3) a lack of clarity regarding the redemption rights of stablecoin holders;22 and (4) operational risks related to cybersecurity and the collecting, storing, and safeguarding of data.

Failure of a stablecoin to perform according to expectations would harm users of that stablecoin and could pose systemic risk. The mere prospect of a stablecoin not performing as expected could result in a “run” on that stablecoin – i.e., a self-reinforcing cycle of redemptions and fire sales of reserve assets. Fire sales of reserve assets could disrupt critical funding markets, depending on the type and volume of reserve assets involved. Runs could spread contagiously from one stablecoin to another, or to other types of financial institutions that are believed to have a similar risk profile. Risks to the broader financial system could rapidly increase as well, especially in the absence of prudential standards. The internal dynamics of a stablecoin run, as well as the potential implications of such a run for the financial system and broader economy, would likely depend on the volume and liquidity characteristics of reserve assets sold,23 as well as on broader economic and financial conditions. Some stablecoin arrangements are already sizable, and many stablecoins are growing. A run occurring under strained market conditions may have the potential to amplify a shock to the economy and the financial system.

**Payment System Risks**

Stablecoin arrangements’ transfer mechanisms (and potentially other aspects of the arrangements’ activities) between issuance and redemption can provide opportunities for efficient payment processing but also can pose risks to their participants and the broader financial system. Payment stablecoins face many of the same basic risks as traditional payment systems, including credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, risks arising from improper or ineffective system governance, and settlement risk.24 When not managed comprehensively, these risks can make payment systems less available and less reliable for users, and they can create financial shocks or operate as a channel through which financial shocks spread.

These risks have the potential to manifest in novel ways as a result of a stablecoin arrangement’s use of different technologies, transaction processes, and governance structures, among other factors. For example, unlike traditional payment systems where risk is managed centrally by the payment system operator, some stablecoin arrangements feature decentralized decision-making and complex operations where no single organization is responsible or accountable for risk management and resilient operation of the entire arrangement.

“Operational risk” is the risk that deficiencies in information systems or internal processes, human errors, management failures, or disruptions from external events will result in the reduction, deterioration, or breakdown of services. Operational issues in a payment system can disrupt the ability of users to make payments, which can in turn disrupt economic activity. If an operational problem results in a payment error or enables fraudulent payments, users could lose their money. Stablecoin arrangements face many of the same types of operational risks as existing payment systems but could have the potential to be more operationally resilient in some respects. However, they can also face novel operational risks related to the validation and confirmation of stablecoin transactions and the management and integrity of the distributed ledger. For example, incentives to validate transactions may not adequately motivate participants to respond to demand for processing transactions, resulting in network congestion. Operational risks may also be more difficult to manage or supervise in a stablecoin arrangement, especially when the supporting infrastructure is beyond the control of any one organization (including the entities involved in the stablecoin arrangement) and there is no clear entity to regulate. 

“Settlement risk” is the risk that settlement in a payment system will not take place as expected. Well-designed and well-operated payment systems ensure transactions settle reliably, giving users confidence that their funds settlement is certain and final at a given time. Stablecoin arrangements that do not clearly define the point at which settlement is final in their rules and procedures can pose heightened uncertainty and create credit and liquidity pressures for arrangement participants. For example, many distributed ledger networks are permissionless, requiring no prior approval for new users to participate in network activities. When open network access is combined with consensusbased settlement mechanisms, technical settlement may be subject to uncertainty for longer periods, with no single party accountable for defining or ensuring legal settlement finality, creating questions about the reliability and finality of payments.

In addition, “liquidity risk” can arise in a stablecoin arrangement from misalignment of the settlement timing and processes between stablecoin arrangements and other systems (e.g., if a stablecoin arrangement operates 24/7, but the payment system used for funding stablecoin issuance and returning fiat currency upon stablecoin redemption has regular business hours), causing temporary shortages in the quantity of stablecoins available to make payments.

These risks may remain inadequately addressed for stablecoin arrangements due to the lack of consistent risk-management standards among arrangements, the number of different key parties that may be involved in an arrangement, and the operational complexity of an arrangement.25 Moreover, if many entities are involved in operating the infrastructure where transfers take place, it may be challenging for the supervisor of the issuer to require that the arrangement’s rules support effective risk management and governance across the entire arrangement. 

**Risks of Scale: Systemic Risk and Concentration of Economic Power**

While small in comparison to traditional forms of private and public money, stablecoins have grown rapidly in the last year and may continue to grow rapidly at both an individual and aggregate level. For individual stablecoins, the potential for rapid growth may reflect economies of scale and scope; network effects that cause demand for a specific stablecoin to increase as more firms and consumers use the stablecoin; and first-mover advantages. In some cases, rapid scaling may be supported by access to existing customer bases and further enabled by access to end users’ data.

The potential for an individual stablecoin to scale rapidly raises three sets of policy concerns. First, a stablecoin issuer or a key participant in a stablecoin arrangement (e.g., a custodial wallet provider) could pose systemic risk – meaning that the failure or distress of that entity could adversely affect financial stability and the real economy.26 Second, the combination of a stablecoin issuer or wallet provider and a commercial firm could lead to an excessive concentration of economic power. These policy concerns are analogous to those traditionally associated with the mixing of banking and commerce, such as advantages in accessing credit or using data to market or restrict access to products. This combination could have detrimental effects on competition and lead to market concentration in sectors of the real economy. Third, a stablecoin that becomes widely adopted as a means of payment could present concerns about anti-competitive effects, for example, if users of that stablecoin face undue frictions or costs in the event they choose to switch to other payment products or services. Concerns about anti-competitive effects are thus likely to be greater absent interoperability standards for stablecoins and stablecoin arrangements.

In addition to the potential for individual stablecoins to scale rapidly, the aggregate growth of stablecoins could also have important implications for the financial system and the macroeconomy. If insured depository institutions lose retail deposits to stablecoins, and the reserve assets that back stablecoins do not support credit creation, the aggregate growth of stablecoins could increase borrowing costs and impair credit availability in the real economy. The perception of the safety of insured depository institutions relative to stablecoins could also shift during times of stress, with large and sudden inflows or outflows of deposits possible.

**Regulatory Gaps**

Today, stablecoin arrangements are not subject to a consistent set of prudential regulatory standards that address the risks discussed above. Moreover, the number of different key parties that may be involved in an arrangement, and the operational complexity of these arrangements, pose challenges for supervisory oversight. For example, even if a given issuer of stablecoin is a bank, insight into the activities of key entities in the arrangement depends on the structure of the relationship and the nature of the services, if any, provided to the issuer bank as client.27 To address these gaps, a consistent and comprehensive regulatory framework is needed both to increase transparency into key aspects of stablecoin arrangements and to ensure that stablecoins function in both normal times and in stressed market conditions.

**III. Recommendations**

As discussed above, stablecoins have multiple uses involving different types of participants and arrangements, which implicate a range of regulatory concerns. Stablecoins and stablecoin arrangements raise significant concerns from an investor protection and market integrity perspective. Stablecoin arrangements and digital asset trading activities may implicate the jurisdiction of the SEC and/or CFTC. Depending on the facts and circumstances, a stablecoin may constitute a security, commodity, and/or derivative implicating the jurisdiction of the SEC, and be subject to the U.S. federal securities laws, or implicating the jurisdiction of the CFTC, and be subject to the CEA. The federal securities laws and/or the CEA may apply to the stablecoin, the stablecoin arrangement, transactions in, and/or participants involved in, the stablecoin or stablecoin arrangement, and/ or derivatives of any of the foregoing instruments. The SEC and CFTC have broad enforcement, rulemaking, and oversight authorities over transactions and participants falling within their respective jurisdictions to address the investor protection and market integrity risks discussed above. To the extent within the jurisdiction of the SEC or the CFTC, trading, lending, borrowing, and other activity involving stablecoins must be conducted in compliance with applicable provisions of the federal securities laws and the CEA, as well as applicable regulations (See Digital Asset Trading Platforms and DeFi).

Stablecoins also present important prudential concerns, as discussed in Part II. These prudential concerns relate to the potential for stablecoin runs, payment system risks, and the possibility that some stablecoins may rapidly scale. Because responsibilities within many of these arrangements are widely distributed, and currently fall within the jurisdiction of different regulatory agencies, or outside of the regulatory perimeter altogether, there is a risk of incomplete or fragmented oversight. Stablecoin arrangements have grown, and may continue to grow, rapidly. And as these arrangements grow, so may the risks associated with them. The recommendations presented below are focused on the prudential risks identified with respect to payment stablecoins.28

**Legislation**

To address prudential risks associated with the use of stablecoins as a means of payment, the agencies recommend that Congress act promptly to ensure that payment stablecoins are subject to appropriate federal prudential oversight on a consistent and comprehensive basis. Because payment stablecoins are an emerging and rapidly developing type of financial asset, legislation should provide regulators flexibility to respond to future developments and adequately address risks across a variety of organizational structures.

Legislation should address the risks outlined in this report by establishing an appropriate federal prudential framework for payment stablecoin arrangements.29 In particular, with respect to stablecoin issuers, legislation should provide for supervision on a consolidated basis; prudential standards; and, potentially, access to appropriate components of the federal safety net. To accomplish these objectives, legislation should limit stablecoin issuance, and related activities of redemption and maintenance of reserve assets, to entities that are insured depository institutions. The legislation would prohibit other entities from issuing payment stablecoins. Legislation should also ensure that supervisors have authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins.

Insured depository institutions include both state and federally chartered banks and savings associations, the deposits of which are covered, subject to legal limits, by deposit insurance, and which have access to emergency liquidity and Federal Reserve services.30 Like other insured depository institutions, insured depository institutions that issue stablecoins would be subject to supervision and regulation at the depository institution level by a federal banking agency and consolidated supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve at the holding company level.31 The standards to which these institutions are subject include capital and liquidity standards that are designed to address safety and soundness and, for the largest banking organizations, also include enhanced prudential standards that address financial stability concerns. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, insured depository institutions also are subject to a special resolution regime that enables the orderly resolution of failed insured depository institutions by, among other mechanisms, protecting customers’ insured deposits, and according priority to deposit claims over those of general creditors, and limits any potential negative systemic impacts in the event of bank failure.

As discussed above, apart from a stablecoin issuer, other key entities in the stablecoin arrangement may be critical to a stablecoin’s ability to function as a means of payment and may help a stablecoin to scale (See Part I, Activities and Participants in Stablecoin Arrangements). As noted above, the core functions of a stablecoin arrangement – (1) creation of the stablecoin, (2) its transfer between parties, and (3) storage of the stablecoin by end users, as described in Part I (See Part I, Creation of Stablecoins, and Transfer and Storage of Stablecoin) – can be carried out by the activities of separate entities, within an arrangement that may be highly distributed and complex. Because the activities and functions in a stablecoin arrangement may be distributed across different parties, a prudential  framework that is exclusively focused on stablecoin issuers is likely to leave certain payment system risks inadequately or inconsistently addressed.

Given the central role that custodial wallet providers play within a stablecoin arrangement, and the risks attendant to the relationship between custodial wallet providers and stablecoin users, Congress should require custodial wallet providers to be subject to appropriate federal oversight. Such oversight should include authority to restrict these service providers from lending customer stablecoins, and to require compliance with appropriate risk-management, liquidity, and capital requirements. In addition, to address concerns about concentration of economic power, Congress should consider other standards for custodial wallet providers, such as limits on affiliation with commercial entities or on use of users’ transaction data.

In addition to stablecoin issuers and custodial wallet providers, other entities may perform activities that are critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement (See Part I, Activities and Participants in Stablecoin Arrangements). To ensure that stablecoin arrangements are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework, Congress should provide the federal supervisor of a stablecoin issuer with the authority to require any entity that performs activities critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement to meet appropriate risk-management standards, such as the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures32 as adapted to stablecoin arrangements.33 Legislation should also provide appropriate agencies with examination and enforcement authority with respect to the stablecoin activities of these entities. Finally, supervisors should have the ability to adopt standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins, or between stablecoins and other payment instruments.

Taken together, legislation along these lines would address the prudential risks described in Part II of this report on a comprehensive and consistent basis:

•	 User Protection and Run Risk: Require stablecoin issuers to be insured depository institutions, which are subject to appropriate supervision and regulation, at the depository institution and the holding company level.

•	 Payment System Risk: Require custodial wallet providers to be subject to appropriate federal oversight. In addition, provide the supervisor of a stablecoin issuer with authority to require any entity that performs activities critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement to meet appropriate risk-management standards.

•	 Systemic Risk and Concentration of Economic Power: Require stablecoin issuers to comply with activities restrictions that limit affiliation with commercial entities. Supervisors also should have the authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins. Limits on custodial wallet providers’ affiliation with commercial entities or on custodial wallet providers use of user transaction data may also help address these issues.

**Interim Measures**

The agencies believe that legislation is urgently needed to comprehensively address the prudential risks posed by payment stablecoin arrangements. While Congress considers how to address risks associated with payment stablecoin arrangements, the agencies will continue to use their existing authorities to address these prudential risks to the extent possible. In the absence of Congressional action, the Council may consider steps available to it to address the risks outlined in this report.

**A. Regulatory Agencies**

Given the significant and growing risks posed by stablecoins, the agencies are committed to taking action to address risks falling within each agency’s jurisdiction and to continued coordination and collaboration on issues of common interest across the federal financial agencies. For example, in evaluating a charter application, the banking agencies will seek to ensure that applicants address the risks outlined by this report, including risks associated with stablecoin issuance and other related services conducted by the banking organization or third-party service providers. In the context of those stablecoins that are securities, commodities, and/or derivatives, application of the federal securities laws and/or the CEA would provide important investor and market protections, as well as transparency benefits. Relevant authorities, including the Department of Justice, may consider whether or how section 21(a)(2) of the Glass-Steagall Act may apply to certain stablecoin arrangements.34 In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and consumer financial protection laws also provide a number of safeguards in the payments sector, including but not limited to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act.35 Finally, a stablecoin arrangement may also offer “money transmission services,” triggering federal AML/ CFT obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), supervised and enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

**B. Council**

In the absence of Congressional action, the agencies recommend that the Council consider steps available to it to address the risks outlined in this report. Such steps may include the designation of certain activities conducted within stablecoin arrangements as, or as likely to become, systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement (PCS) activities.36 Designation would permit the appropriate agency to establish risk-management standards for financial institutions that engage in designated PCS activities, including requirements in relation to the assets backing the stablecoin, requirements related to the operation of the stablecoin arrangement, and other prudential standards.37 Financial institutions that engage in designated PCS activities also would be subject to an examination and enforcement framework. Any designation would follow a transparent process.

**Illicit Finance Risk**

As with all digital assets, stablecoins can present money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks. The magnitude of these risks depends on various factors, including the application of antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls, the degree to which it is adopted by the public, and the design of the stablecoin arrangement. To further prevent misuse of stablecoins and other digital assets by illicit actors, Treasury will continue leading efforts at the FATF to encourage countries to implement international AML/CFT standards and pursue additional resources to support supervision of domestic AML/CFT regulations. Treasury will also continue to assess the illicit financing risks to the United States associated with stablecoins and other digital assets, including through the forthcoming National Risk Assessments on Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing, and Illicit Finance Strategy.

A critical factor for illicit finance risk mitigation, regardless of the features of a stablecoin’s design, is that international standards for the regulation and supervision of service providers associated with stablecoins and other digital assets are effectively implemented worldwide. Stablecoins and other digital assets can be used to transfer large amounts of value across borders very quickly. A rapid increase in cross-border payments could amplify ML/TF risks due to the uneven implementation of global international AML/CFT standards developed by the FATF.38 While the United States regulates and enforces AML/CFT obligations for covered service providers, most countries have either not put these standards into their regulatory frameworks or are failing to supervise them, leading to gaps in AML/CFT regulation and supervision for stablecoins and other digital assets. Illicit actors can exploit these gaps by using services in countries with weak regulatory and supervisory regimes to launder funds, store proceeds of crime, or evade sanctions in stablecoins or other digital assets.

The promise of a stable value can, particularly when paired with the reach of commercial firms such as telecommunications or technology providers, increase the potential that stablecoins scale rapidly. Criminals often use the most common and liquid forms of value for ML and TF, and mass-adopted stablecoins or other digital assets may be attractive to illicit actors, which could heighten ML/TF risks. Conversely, mass adoption of a well-regulated and supervised stablecoin with strong AML/CFT protections built into the stablecoin could provide greater transparency into illicit financial activity and could mitigate ML/TF risks, especially if the stablecoin takes market share away from riskier alternatives.

Like other digital assets, stablecoins may be used to transact pseudonymously, depending on the underlying architecture.39 However, in certain instances, stablecoin addresses and transactions on public blockchains can be paired with information, if available, that can enable regulators and law enforcement to identify address owners.40 Users of some stablecoins can transact without  the involvement of financial institutions subject to AML/CFT obligations, thus limiting collection of and access to investigative information and preventative measures used to identify illicit financial activity.

To encourage international implementation of AML/CFT standards, Treasury will continue to engage with the FATF to encourage countries to effectively implement the FATF standards for virtual assets. On October 28, 2021, the FATF published updated guidance on the implementation of the FATF standards for virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, which describes how the standards apply to digital assets and help countries and the private sector better understand how to effectively implement standards. As a result of the publication of the FATF standards, the FATF will now redouble its efforts on effective implementation of the standards on digital assets by member countries, and the United States will continue to support these efforts at the FATF and engage bilaterally to encourage countries to meet these standards.

In the United States, most stablecoins are considered “convertible virtual currency” (CVC) and treated as “value that substitutes for currency” under FinCEN’s regulations.41 All CVC financial service providers engaged in money transmission, which can include stablecoin administrators and other participants in stablecoin arrangements, must register as money services businesses (MSBs) with FinCEN. As such, they must comply with FinCEN’s regulations, issued pursuant to authority under the BSA, which require that MSBs maintain AML programs, report cash transactions of $10,000 or more, file suspicious activity reports (SARs) on certain suspected illegal activity, and comply with various other obligations.42 Current BSA regulations require the transfer of certain specific information well beyond what can be inferred from the blockchain resulting in non-compliance. While the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has provided guidance on how the virtual currency industry can build a risk-based sanctions compliance program that includes internal controls like transaction screening and know your customer procedures, there may be some instances where U.S. sanctions compliance requirements (i.e., rejecting transactions) could be difficult to comply with under blockchain protocols.

While regulations are broadly sufficient to cover stablecoin administrators and other participants in stablecoin arrangements, Treasury will pursue additional resources, which could enable FinCEN, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and federal functional regulators to increase supervision of these regulations. This could result in better private sector compliance and, where it does not, could lead to enforcement actions for non-compliance. Enforcement activity would signal to stablecoin administrators and other financial institutions in the stablecoin industry that they will be held accountable for failing to meet AML/CFT and sanctions obligations, will incentivize compliance, and may enhance pressure on some foreign jurisdictions to follow suit. To that end, FinCEN’s delegated examiners, the IRS, have been conducting compliance examinations on CVC administrators and  exchangers, including administrators of stablecoin arrangements and the exchanges on which they are offered, since 2014. These examinations have also included foreign-located MSBs doing business in the United States in whole or substantial part.43

FinCEN has taken decisive action when it identifies financial institutions that fail to comply with these obligations. For example, in 2017 FinCEN assessed a $110 million civil money penalty against the foreign-located CVC exchanger BTC-e for failure to comply with the BSA’s registration, AML program, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.44 More recently, FinCEN assessed a $100 million civil money penalty against the foreign-located, non-compliant futures commission merchant BitMEX for failing to maintain an AML Program and a Customer Identification Program, and failure to file SARs.45 That penalty was concurrent with the CFTC’s $100 million civil money penalty.46

Treasury in January will report to Congress the National Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessments, which assess the illicit financing risk landscape for digital assets, among other financial products and activities. The Risk Assessments are developed with input from U.S. government stakeholders, including law enforcement, the federal functional regulators, and the intelligence community, and use public or adjudicated case studies to demonstrate how illicit actors are misusing financial assets. The Risk Assessments inform the Illicit Finance Strategy, which is designed to identify goals, objectives, and priorities for disrupting and preventing illicit finance activities within and transiting the U.S. financial system.

**International Standards**

This report considers and builds on the work of international forums, including work that has led to recommendations, standards, principles, and guidance that may apply to stablecoin arrangements. The Financial Stability Board in October 2020 set out ten high-level recommendations that seek to promote coordinated and effective regulation, supervision, and oversight of Global Stablecoin (GSC) arrangements to address the financial stability risks posed by GSCs, both at the domestic and international level, while supporting responsible innovation and providing sufficient flexibility for jurisdictions to implement domestic approaches.

International standard-setting bodies are also pursuing work to examine the application of international standards, principles, and guidance to stablecoin arrangements. For example, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published a consultative report on the application of the PFMIs to stablecoin arrangements. With respect to illicit finance, the FATF in June 2019 revised its standards to cover digital assets, including stablecoins and service providers, and is working on updated guidance for how to implement these standards.

The agencies are committed to continuing engagement at the FSB and the standard-setting bodies to ensure comprehensive oversight of stablecoin arrangements, further common regulatory outcomes across jurisdictions, and reduce opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.

**TLDR:**  

In terms of overall market capitalisation for stablecoins, we have seen high demand and tremendous growth in the space due to the importance of the role played by stablecoins in DeFi. In Q2 2021, $BUSD experienced the largest growth in its market cap. This is likely due to the influx of users to the Binance Smart Chain due to high gas fees and network congestion on the Ethereum platform in Q1 2021. We take a closer look at the top 5 stablecoins by their market capitalisation. 

&amp;#x200B;

The top 5 stablecoin by market cap are $USDT, $USDC, $BUSD, $DAI and $UST respectively. The first 3 stablecoins are generally similar in that they are a form of fiat-collateralised stablecoin and have a centralised backing. The latter 2 stablecoins are a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and are also considered to be decentralised.

* Tether ($USDT) remains the most adopted stablecoin in circulation. For the case of $USDT, Tether Limited claims to back $1 worth of Tether for every $1 of USD, although there have been some controversies regarding this claim. As of July 2021, Tether executives are under federal investigation. The market cap for $USDT started to flatten in Jun 2021, but nevertheless recorded growth of 54% in Q2 2021.
* USD Coin or $USDC is the 2nd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation. $USDC is governed by Centre, a membership-based consortium that sets technical, policy and financial standards for stablecoins. $USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets and is redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars according to Centre. In contrast with the decline in Tether's growth, we see a corresponding increase in $USDC's market capitalisation. $USDC market cap increased by a whopping 133% in Q2 2021, in comparison to Tether's 54%.
* Binance USD (BUSD) is the 3rd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation and is similarly a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin issued by Binance (in partnership with Paxos), and is approved and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). $BUSD is used in the Binance Smart Chain and has also seen an uptrend in its market cap.
* $DAI uses an over-collateralised mechanism to maintain a $1 peg of $DAI to USD. Unlike the 3 aforementioned stablecoins, $DAI is a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and is decentralised. However, much of what collateralises $DAI involves $USDC. Critics argue this means that $DAI is backed by a centralised entity, making it susceptible to centralisation risks like the 3 stablecoins described above.
* $UST is the stablecoin used within the Terra ecosystem. The $LUNA token in Terra is used to support the $UST stablecoin peg. The market cap of $UST is relatively small compared to the top stablecoins because $UST is not widely used in other blockchains but only has utility within the Terra ecosystems in protocols such as Mirror and Anchor.

 

Algorithmic stablecoins are starting to develop this year but overall there are not too many outstanding projects. Stablecoins under the Rebase/Seignorage type models has not really performed in terms of maintaining their peg. Most of them have been priced below the peg price for a long time despite measures of price equalisation such as $ESD, $DSD and $BAC.

$FRAX, $UST and $sUSD are stablecoins with pretty good performance when it comes to keeping relative stability against the 1 US dollar. However, $AMPL, although dynamic around $1, has a very large fluctuation.

### Stablecoin Supply Ratio

Cryptoquant recorded an ATL for the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR), which measures $BTC market capitalisation relative to the total stablecoin supply to estimate purchasing power in the stablecoin market. Accordingly, when the price of $BTC falls, the amount of stablecoin purchases will increase to push the price of $BTC up and vice versa. But the growth of stablecoin supply in the spring of 2020 and 2021 has kept SSR near historic lows. This shows that demand for $USDT seems to keep pace with the demand for $BTC",cryptocurrency

Mistakes were made. My wife and I estimated owe 10k of state and fed tax combined by dnd of the year. I know that we can ask our employers to withheld significant extra amount for the rest of 2021 to make up the difference, but the problem is that even if we withhold all of the paycheck for the rest of 2021, it may not be enough. I also don’t like this way is because there is no way for us to estimate how much extra to withhold for fed and tax and for each of our employer. Clearly the payroll wants us to fill up a W4 which only allow a number to withhold, not percentage. Because I have no idea how much my last paycheck of the year would be (my paycheck is normally 3000 (biweekly) but my bonus will be 10k and hers is about 5k. If our net pay is only 3000, how does it work if I want to withhold 4000 for fed and 4000 for state? They withhold fed first or state first? 

I wonder if there is anyway for us to just mail a check to IRS and state just like “hey, here is our missed tax for this year, so that we don’t have to pay penalty during tax return). In such way, I can wait till end of year and calculate the total we missed and just mail them a check then file a normal tax return next year.

If I get PLSF, I’ll use the fund to pay the tax and the rest is bonus cash. If not that cash will becomes my fund to pay off the loan balance. I currently have 62 qualifying months. Is this plan reasonable? Or should I just refinance into a lower interest rate private loan?

Next, we plan on getting married in 6 months so if we file jointly payments for her loan will go up significantly and will eat into my income. But if we file separate, I can jump to a lower tax bracket. It’s unclear which is more advantageous. Unsure what to do here?

personalfinance,Payoff Strategy for Student Loans,"I’ve just finished paying off my own student loans and now am going to start tackling the parent PLUS loans that my parents took out throughout the course of my degree - the balance is about $40k today and the interest rates range from 6-8%.

I’m juggling a few options, but what I’ve landed on is refinancing the total balance through SoFi and paying them off as quickly as possible. Financially, I’m in a great position to pay the total balance off in about two years - I’ll plan to use my base salary for living expenses, and sales commission for repaying the loans (typically about $6k per quarter after taxes). In a normal year, I would usually save this in a HYSA, make a one-off student loan payment, or invest this supplemental income.

With SoFi I can choose a 5 or 10 year repayment term where the 5 year monthly minimum payment is ~$750 with a 2.365% interest rate, and the 10 year at ~$390/month @ 3.65%.

Now, if everything goes according to plan it seems like I should just chose a 5 year term to accrue as little interest as possible. What I’m wondering is if there’s any benefit to choosing the 10 year term with a lower monthly minimum in case things _don’t_ go according to plan or if I have another unexpected expense. That way my monthly commitment is much lower. 

I really don’t want to have any debt, but I’m also wondering if there are tax or other considerations I’m missing out on by not just sucking it up and paying the monthly payment for 5 years and being done with the loans then. 

Is it a bad idea to put 100% of my supplemental income towards paying off loans when I could be investing that money or saving it otherwise? The fixed interest rates I’m able to get through SoFi will probably never be lower. 

Is there anything else I’m missing in terms of the best approach here?",finance
financialindependence,Enjoying the 'free lunch' of Series I and EE savings bonds (with caveats),"I wrote a [post about these bonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/portfolios/comments/3y4d27/reminder_last_chance_to_buy_series_i_and_series/) five years ago and they have never seemed more relevant. With low yields on bonds and savings accounts, these Treasury-issued options are especially relevant. You can buy 10K each per year of these bonds (so that's 20K I + EE per year). That limit is higher than some people need, lower than others want, but quite a lot of money per year you can put toward them if you want to in taxable (non-retirement) space.

Also (we'll get into this more) I Bonds in particular are a great part of a FIRE portfolio because their cash-in dates are flexible -- you can, for instance, wait to cash them out in a low-tax year when you're working less or not at all. EE Bonds, meanwhile, make a great annuity that starts 20 years from whenever you start buying them. The fact that they're both tax-deferred also means if you're making a lot now and less later, well, you'll pay less in taxes. Series I Bonds also work as good shorter-term savings vehicles if you have over a year before you need the cash.

**1) Series I Bonds:** These will track inflation and can be held from 1 to 30 years. Sometimes they offer a bit extra (a fixed rate on top of inflation), but that's moot given that [TIPS have negative yields](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=realyield). So they are a lot like TIPS, but more flexible, offer tax deferral, are immune to interest rate risk, and: they pay more. These are a great deal IMHO.

**2) Series EE Bonds:** Don't be fooled by the low 'rate' on them - the key is that they double in value after 20 years, which is the equivalent of a 3.5% annual return. If that sounds low to you, [check out what 20-year Treasuries are yielding](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield). Plus if yields do go up, you can cash them out early, and invest in higher-yielding bonds.

The catches are few but to be complete: (A) you need to create a TreasuryDirect account, which means you have one more account to manage, and (B) you can only buy them in taxable, which may not make them ideal for people who are unable to invest beyond their tax-advantaged (retirement) accounts, then (C) they have some liquidity issues in terms of the one-year lock-up period, and not getting the EE doubling if you cash in early, but yields are so low right now that if they do go up and you do cash these out early you're not going to miss much.

But, you ask, *""Zero percent real return from I Bonds and 3.5% nominal return from EE Bonds? That's not a great return!""* Well, I could debate this, but I'll just say that compared to other bonds, these government-backed securities seem like the best deal out there *by far*. For example, as of today, 20-year Treasuries are yielding 2%. Compound that for 20 years and you get less than $5,000 versus $10,000 when your EE Bonds double.

But, you ask, *""Won't stocks more than double over 20 years anyway?""* Well, first, comparing stocks and bonds is a mistake, because their risk profiles and uses are so different. Second, bonds have indeed beaten stocks for 20-year periods before. Even taking the last 20 years as an example: it took US stocks 15 years to double and international stocks almost 20. So yes, over the last 20 years stocks came out ahead, but only in the final stretch ... the next 20 years, who knows?  So think of it this way: are you going to hold bonds now and for the rest of your life of some type? Are you planning to live 20+ years? If you answered yes to both, you may benefit from EE bonds!

Anyway, I'm (obviously) a big fan of both of these bond types and would recommend evaluating whether they would work for you. Posting this in part because I Bonds have come up a lot recently both here and over at /r/bogleheads, but also because EE bonds often get overlooked and are also worthy over consideration IMHO!",finance
personalfinance,Why you should consider adding Series I and EE bonds to the fixed-income portion of your long-term investment portfolio,"I wrote a [post about these bonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/portfolios/comments/3y4d27/reminder_last_chance_to_buy_series_i_and_series/) five years ago and they have never seemed more relevant. With low yields on bonds and savings accounts, these Treasury-issued options are especially relevant. You can buy 10K each per year of these bonds (so that's 20K I + EE per year). That limit is higher than some people need, lower than others want, but quite a lot of money per year you can put toward them if you want to in taxable (non-retirement) space.

**1) Series I Bonds:** These will track inflation and can be held from 1 to 30 years.

personalfinance,Need advice on paying off debt (OneMain Financial),"I have a loan from OneMain Financial which is a company that loans money to people. Not sure if they fall under a predatory company or not but their interest rates are very high. The loan I got was at 25% interest rate - I know, stupid but times were too tough and it was our last resort.

The question I have is this. I recently called them to find out about paying it off. My original loan amount was $18000 and the guy on the phone says that the pay off will be $19700. I understand that the interest rate is high but if I want to pay it off, wouldn't I be able to simply pay the principle since loans are based on amortized schedules?

The loan I got was by using my car as collateral and we got it approved a year ago.",finance
personalfinance,Extra on Mortgage?,"We paid off all our credit card debt (thanks Covid and no travel, gas, tolls, going out, clothes, etc) and now have margin each month of about $1500. We have two mortgages, our primary residence and a rental property which we are cash flow positive on about $300.

Our emergency savings is healthy, not quite 6 months but closer to three, but we also have a lot of family help if things went sideways.

We have great retirement already and no other investments now or in the immediate future.

Should we use this time to make extra payments on our mortgages or keep building savings? Honestly we wouldn't feel an extra 50 or 100 on each, and with no other investments to speak of, that money would just go to savings or vacation savings. Even an extra 100 dramatically impacts interest and takes a year or more off each loan. Is there a better use of this money? (We know nothing about investing so have kept our real estate as our sole investment). Only other debt is a car loan that is hefty both in interest rate and payment. We have a car stipend that covers about half of it)

Any other ideas? Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Series I Bonds are paying 7.12% for the next six months,"A common topic on this sub is to have a rainy-day fund in case everything goes wrong.   People have all sorts of suggested minimums that range from 3 months worth of living cost covered to 1 year+ (personally I believe in the 1 year base).  Having that cash is all fine and dandy… except when big-scale inflation comes along.  Like we have now.

So, your $10,000 in the bank will be worth less next month just letting it sit there. And less again a month after that, and so on.  No, the dollar value wont change, but you will be able to buy less groceries or pants with it.

Interest rates suck even for CD’s. Really, .55% is considered a good rate these days at a high yield bank, and a regular checking savings account pays you a whopping .01%.  That means your $10,000 earns $100. After a year.  And at the end of the year you can now buy $700 *less groceries* with it.  That means you are less safe after a one year period than when you started.

So, what do you do?  The answer is Series I Bonds.  As of today they are paying 7.12% (!) A Series I bond is a savings type with the US Treasury that is specifically intended to not lose value to inflation.  They adjust the rates every 6 months to counteract loss of purchasing power.  No one else can give that kind of safety.

Go to [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/RS/UN-AccountCreate.do) and set up an account.  Sure, the site is a bit janky but it does work pretty simply.  Connect your banks details and transfer funds over.

**Boom**.  7.12% as of today.

---

Caveat:  This is a long term savings deal, and perfect for rainy day funds.  You can't withdraw inside the first year.  If you withdraw in years 2-5, you lose the last 3 months of interest.  After that you can withdraw as you like.

Sure, it sucks to be penalized, but if after a year you need your funds, then it’s not a big deal.  After all, you weren’t earning a thing in a normal bank anyway, so there is no downside.

Oh, also:  You are limited to depositing $10,000 per year.  But hey, that's not bad at all.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Where are they yields coming from in defi?,"Let’s take a simple example. I deposit some AVAX into Aave for an APY of 12%. Where’s that yield coming from? There’s no way someone’s borrowing AVAX for a higher interest rate than 12%. Nobody borrows crypto right? Why would they? Borrowing fiat with crypto as collateral is what makes sense to me.

What seems even stranger to me is when I hear of random defi apps (yield yack, trader joe) that will give you 40%+ APY. How are they able to give you those kind of returns? 

I understand staking. I understand lending, but I don’t know why someone would need to borrow crypto especially at a high enough interest rate to bring about such a huge return. 

Is there any scaminess going on? Can I try putting my coins into one of these high yielding platforms? How could one tell a scamy yield platform from a legit one?",cryptocurrency

1. Charles released a new AMA from Ethiopia! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5au7JEPMaM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5au7JEPMaM)
2. The U.S. President’s Working Group on Financial markets has published its Stablecoin Report. No surprise: they want to regulate stablecoin issuers as insured depository institutions with federal supervisors and to curtail their affiliation with commercial entities.  They also want to curtail such affiliations for custodial wallet providers.

44. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

46. Wow! It’s looking like Meld has landed a partnership with a mobile provider in Nigeria with nine million customers. Not many details out at this point (Sept 30).

49. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It’s notable that Cardano’s Djed solves this.

51. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM.

52. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a “what if” scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised. [https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1445059673401528328](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1445059673401528328)

56. Brazil is looking to follow the El Salvador example and accept crypto as legal tender with a new bill to be voted within days.

64. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle. [https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1445465912375590913](https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1445465912375590913) [https://emmer.house.gov/2021/7/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-provide-certainty-for-digital-assets-under-securities-law](https://emmer.house.gov/2021/7/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-provide-certainty-for-digital-assets-under-securities-law)

73. Coinbase is launching an NFT market. How will this impact the CNFT scene? Coinbase tells us: “...initial launch will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards with multi-chain support planned soon after.” [https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html)

76. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

83. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan Müller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we’ll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)

89. In the Cap Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative Fireside Q&amp;A, Charles mentioned he is talking to Colossol Labs about the possibility of having the Mammoth DeExtinction Project take place on his bison ranch.

personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loans: Picking the Optimal Term and Interest Rate,"Hey all,

I can refinance $25k of my student loans with either of the below arrangements:

\- 10 years @ 2.95%

\- 15 years @ 3.33%

\- 20 years @ 3.69%

Theoretically, if I compare each period against each other and invest the differences, 15 years is the best option, but it seems tough to ensure I actually invest the difference when I have ample discretionary income. Like, if the ""difference to invest"" is another $69 in the first 15 years, then $243 in the remaining 5 years, how would I ensure I always invest that extra amount? Hopefully that makes sense.

And any other considerations I should make or other perspectives to have?

personalfinance,"Mom(67) 'retired' told me she has 70k in CC Debt,40k student loans What can I do?","My mom told me she has 70k CC debt with ~10% interest rate and student loans at idk what type of interest rate. She has not had a job in 20 years. She has a few rental properties and makes about ~1k a month from them. 

My mom has a history of being terrible with finances and I dont have any confidence in her to get out of debt. I am certain these debt numbers are actually worse than what she is telling me. What options does she have to reduce her interest rate/payments?

I am a single 29 male. I have some money saved up and have a decent job. I theoretically COULD help her out, but I am worried that if I did she would just end up in this hole again on her own... My mother told me she has about 20k that she uses to trade stocks. But shes the type of person to fall for pyramid and MLM schemes easily so I am sure that this is not a good method for her. 

I would guess she has ~100k in retirement savings.",finance

We are also going to address common pitfalls of both the current system and direct democracy.

- Majoritarianism (mob rule)

The majority is not required to participate in the political process. There are also instruments that allow the minority to shield itself such as credit default swaps on sovereign debt.

Voting doesn't happen on the law by law basis rather on bundles of laws that are created by competing taxpayer funded entities.

CryptoCurrency,"Today I reached a small personal goal with crypto, guess how I'm celebrating?","By doing nothing at all!!!

I'm not telling my wife, my best friend, my family or anyone except for the 3.7mill trustworthy users on this reputable sub ;)

I've been around this sub for a loooooong time (5 months lol) so I've learned a few things from others mistakes. Before I forget I did say this was a small personal goal I've reached, I am what most would say is a small fish in a big pond. It's just nice to see crypto help the little guy out when the big institutions are designed to offer debt with high interest rates to their customers...

Anyway as much as I want to be fist pumping my way down the street and chest bumping everyone who looks at me, I will stay composed and settle for a solitary ""noice"" to my reflection in the mirror 🥲.

Anyway I want to thank everyone who has spilled their advice and crypto story on this sub it has prepared me better for the crypto-verse. I have put my head down, stayed relatively quiet, DCA'd into projects that I've DYOR on (after hearing them be shilled on here haha) and slowly and steadily my debt is shrinking and my savings is growing. Such a great change of pace, it's put me in a great mood.

Ok rant over, I hope everyone is equally happy this morning, and as one Ethtrader celebrity always likes to say.

personalfinance,"Refinancing question...how does increase in home value influence the new loan, payments, etc, and who best to reach out to for such a refinance?","As the title suggests, I'm looking to refinance my home.  Goal is simply to get a lower interest rate and pay less money over the entire loan.  Lowering monthly costs is a bonus, but not strictly required, although increasing monthly payment is definitely not wanted.  NOT looking for a cash-out refinance.  The home has increased in value drastically since the purchase, and I'm not sure how that influences things, if at all.  

Loan Year/time:  2017, 28 year (we did bi-weekly instead of monthly payments to drop from the 30 year)

Location:  Southeast U.S.

Original home cost:  ~170k

Original loan:  ~150k

Interest rate:  3.9%

Credit:  Over 750

Current house value:  Unknown.  Smaller, older house on a smaller lot in same neighborhood just sold for 250k, so I would assume more than that.  Zillow seems to think 250-300k range.  Essentially, I expect the house has increased 70% or more in value, but I'm unsure how that influences things, if at all.

Thanks in advance for any help you guys have.",finance

politics,"Discussion Thread: NJ, VA, Special Congressional and Local Elections","Today, voters in numerous states head to the polls to cast their ballots for various positions in state, local and federal government. Regularly scheduled off-off year statewide gubernatorial and legislative elections will be held in New Jersey and Virginia, as well as special Congressional elections in Ohio's 11th and 15th districts. There are a number of local elections as well, most notably in New York (mayoral elections in major cities such as NYC and Buffalo), Pennsylvania (for state Supreme Court), Texas (8 ballot measures), Washington (Seattle), Massachusetts (Boston), and Minnesota (Minneapolis).

In New Jersey, incumbent Democratic Governor Phil Murphy is seeking reelection. He faces former state assemblyman Republican Jack Ciattarelli. Polls have shown a persistent lead for Governor Murphy and, if reelected, he would be the first Democratic Governor to win reelection in the state since 1977. The state House and senate are both also up for reelection. (**[Find Your Polling Location](&lt;https://nj.gov/state/elections/vote-polling-location.shtml&gt;)**).

The marquee race of the night will be in Virginia, where a unique provision under state law prevents incumbent Democratic Governor Ralph Northam from seeking reelection in a consecutive term. Instead, Northam's immediate predecessor, former Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe, is seeking election to a second term. He faces former Carlyle Group CEO Glenn Youngkin. Polls have shown a tight race throughout, though recent polling has shown momentum for Youngkin in the final days of the election. President Biden won Virginia by 10 points over former President Trump in 2020, but the state's gubernatorial elections have historically disfavored the party in power in the White House, the lone exception in decades being McAuliffe's win in 2013. If elected, Glenn Youngkin would be the first Republican to win a statewide race in Virginia since 2009. The state is also holding lieutenant gubernatorial and attorney general elections (where incumbent Democratic attorney general Mark Herring is seeking a 3rd term), as well as elections to its House of Delegates. (**[Find your Polling Location](&lt;https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/polling-place-lookup/&gt;)**).

In Florida, a primary election will be held in Florida's 20th congressional district. The seat was vacated following the death of long-serving former Congressman Alcee Hastings, who died in April of this year from pancreatic cancer. President Biden won this district by 55 points in the 2020 presidential election, and the seat is not considered competitive in the general election. The Democratic primary hosts 11 candidates. Polling is sparse/nonexistent, but frontrunners likely include healthcare executive Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, and Broward County Commissioners Dale Holness and Barbara Sharief, and state House representative Omari Hardy. The winner of the primary faces either Jason Mariner or Greg Musselwhite in the general election.

In Ohio, 2 special elections will be held in Ohio's 11th and 15th congressional districts. In Ohio's 11th district, Democratic Cuyahoga City Councilwoman Shontel Brown faces off against Republican Laverne Gore in this safely Democratic seat that voted for President Biden by a 61 point margin. In Ohio's 15th district, Democratic state House representative Allison Russo faces off against Republican Mike Carey in this safely Republican seat that voted for former President Trump by a 26 point margin. Neither election is expected to be competitive. (**[Find your Polling Location](&lt;https://www.ohiosos.gov/elections/voters/toolkit/polling-location/?)**).

There are also other competitive elections across the country, a few of notability listed below:

* In Boston, city councilwoman Annissa Essaibi George faces off against fellow city councilwoman Michelle Wu in the race for mayor. Acting mayor Kim Janey had sought election to a full term but was eliminated in the September primary, and subsequently endorsed Wu. The race is officially nonpartisan, but both candidates are Democrats and Wu in particular has attracted endorsements from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley.

* In Minneapolis, city council elections will be held under ranked choice voting. More importantly, Minneapolis voters will consider a ballot measure to eliminate a charter requirement for a minimum number of police officers. The question comes over a year after the tragic murder of George Floyd by then-Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin, which sparked a wider call to address systemic racism in society and for criminal justice reform in the largest protest movement in US history.

* In New York, mayoral elections will be held across major cities in the state. Incumbent NYC mayor Bill de Blasio is term limited and ineligible to run. In his stead, Democratic Brooklyn borough President Eric Adams faces off against Republican Curtis Silwa in this heavily Democratic city. The race to watch in New York, however, will likely be the Buffalo mayoral election, where incumbent mayor Byron Brown was defeated in the Democratic primary by India Walton. Mayor Brown is instead mounting a write-in campaign to try and keep his job. Walton, who identifies as a Democratic Socialist, has received a broad range of endorsements, from both of New York's US Senators Schumer and Gillibrand, downstate Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Congressman Jamaal Brown, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and local state legislative representatives. Brown has secured the endorsements of downstate Congressman Tom Suozzi and local elected officials. Polling has been sparse and uncertain in this election, given that mayor Brown is seeking reelection as a write-in, but suggest a significant advantage for Brown if voters are made aware of the option to write in his name.

* In Pennsylvania, the major election of the night will be for state Supreme Court, where Democratic superior court judge Maria McLaughlin faces off against Republican Commonwealth court judge Kevin Brobson. Incumbent Republican justice Thomas Saylor is ineligible for a retention election, as he will reach the mandatory retirement age of 75 in December. Pennsylvania's Supreme Court will likely play a pivotal role in this crucial presidential swing state as the state finalizes its legislative redistricting process. A PA Supreme Court decision in 2018 which invalidated a Republican gerrymander of congressional districts and implemented competitive and relatively fairer districts played an important role in helping Democrats pick up 4 seats in the state. Should Democrats win this seat, the state Supreme Court would stand at a lopsided 6-1 Democratic majority.

* Finally, in Seattle, incumbent Mayor Jenny Durkin announced she would not seek reelection. Former councilman Bruce Harrell and councilwoman M. Lorena González advanced from the top two primary in August to vie for this position. The race is officially nonpartisan. Seattle will also vote on its next city attorney. Incumbent Democratic city attorney Pete Holmes sought reelection, but was eliminated in the primary. In his stead, Democrat Nicole Thomas-Kennedy (frequently abbreviated NTK by supporters) and Republican Ann Davison will face off in this race tonight. Thomas-Kennedy attracted national attention for her abolitionist platform, which calls for decriminalizing sex work and gradual elimination of prosecutions for misdemeanor crimes (which fall under the jurisdiction of the city attorney).

stocks,Gaining Visibility on Paysafe (PSFE) Parts 2-4,"Here are Parts 2 - 4 of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qkgndd/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe/) covers Paysafe’s outlook on growth, and an expected miss for Q3ER.  I recommend starting with the [introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qkgndd/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe/) in Part 1, and following the links if still interested.

# 2. Debt

Paysafe’s recent acquisitions (two of which now [completed](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-completes-acquisition-of-viafintech/)) have spawned several misleading claims using faulty numbers to generate doubt about the company’s ability to manage debt.

For example:

* One article tried to make a specific case that Paysafe can’t cover debt due to Q2’s 46% free cash flow conversion rate. The author's acrobatic bias ignores the obvious fact that the Q2 balance sheet clearly states a year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate of 70%, not 46%. The CFO noted that Q2’s conversion rate was temporarily affected by a one-time tax payment that is to be partially refunded. (Notably, Q1’s free cash flow conversion rate was 96%. At $108 million, it was a 28% YoY increase.)
* Another article cries liquidity problems, citing, “Paysafe Ltds earnings cannot cover its interest expense. If the situation continues, the company may have to issue more debt.” By relying on websites that blindly auto-calculate debt service ratios, the article doesn't account for recent debt restructuring and dramatically misrepresents forward expenses by ignoring:
   * $84 million in one-time merger related expenses will not be repeated,
   * over $40 million in one-time debt restructuring fees will not be repeated,
   * newly reduced interest expenses resulting in roughly [$70 million](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/payments/sp-upgrades-paysafe-to-b-on-significant-debt-repayment/) in annualized savings.
* A third article mistakenly claims Paysafe, “will add another $1 billion in net debt to close the Latin America deals.”  In truth, the two deals mentioned total $550 million (SafetyPay at [$441m](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005095/en/Paysafe-to-Acquire-SafetyPay/) and Pago Efectivo at [$108.5m](https://www.alantra.com/ib-transaction/grupo-el-comercio-sell-side-advisory-pagoefectivo-paysafe/)). A third European acquisition, viafintech, may bring the total to $670 million, much of which can be covered between Paysafe’s $247.8 million in cash, their $270 million in undrawn revolving credit and their $360-$430 million in free cash flow. Total added debt will likely be less than half of what the article assumes. (In fairness, the author later admitted he read the transcript wrong.)

After paying down $1.2 billion in debt in Q1, Paysafe used its two notch credit rating upgrade from [Moody’s](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-Paysafe-to-B1-stable-outlook--PR_443474) and [S&amp;P](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/payments/sp-upgrades-paysafe-to-b-on-significant-debt-repayment/) to reorganize remaining debt, extend maturity and significantly lower average interest rates, reducing interest expenses by $70 million. The result, inclusive of new debt from acquisitions: credit upgrades were reaffirmed along with a $305 million revolving credit facility and the company will save around $43 million in annualized interest expense.

This means forward debt-related costs are on track to drop by more than half, from an estimated $165 million in 2021 to less than $80 million in 2022. Combined with $84 million in other non-recurring merger-related expenses, that’s over $160 million in cost reductions going forward.

Strong free cash flow and over $160 million in reduced costs can go a long way to quickly paying down debt. Add in the expected acquisition growth synergies and the company’s quoted path to a 35% EBITDA margin, and the picture looks even better.  Management noted, “the deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.”  The very realistic potential of 17-18% revenue growth could attain that target ratio in short order.

All this points to sustainable deleveraging, paving the way for more growth through M&amp;A. (It also doesn’t hurt that the company stands to take in more than half a billion cash from outstanding warrants, which will directly benefit enterprise value and inorganic growth potential.)

Carrying large debt is extremely common in the Fintech sector and Paysafe is by no means an outlier here. (Square, Repay, Fiserv, Shift4, Affirm, Bill and Paysign all have worse debt/EBITDA ratios and most of them still have negative earnings). In itself, debt leverage is not a bad thing, particularly if it’s manageable and generates more growth. That definitely appears to be the case here.

# 3. Profit

When considering how Paysafe is setting itself up for future profit potential, here are some points worth underscoring:

* Without $92 million in non-recurring costs, Q1 would have been very profitable, beating analysts consensus by as much +0.10 EPS.
* Despite Q2’s $40 million in non-repeating costs, Paysafe still managed to beat on earnings with its first profitable quarter as a newly public company.
* Roughly $167 million in H1 expenses will not repeat going forward:
   * $84m one-time share based compensation,
   * $40m one-time accelerated capitalized debt fees,
   * $43m estimated reduction in annual interest expenses
* Those reductions alone represent a potential +0.22 EPS, which exceeds analysts projections.  (Some platforms have reported analysts estimate 3-400% profit growth for 2022 with an average of 75% annual profit growth thereafter.  Fortunately, on Q3 guidance, analysts have been revising their forward estimates downwards which ultimately better positions PSFE to beat consensus down the road. This contrasts with analysts’ initial EPS estimates which did not appear to fully account for the one-time merger and debt restructuring costs.)
* Paysafe’s margins are also expected to expand as they work through deliberate measures to de-risk future growth.  For example, their integrated processing take rate has been compressed by strategic Direct Marketing exits in anticipation of new compliance rules. This is expected to abate by end of year.  Management notes: “we do expect EBITDA margins to expand in the back-half of the year and to continue that like a steady drumbeat going into next year as well” reflecting “continued strength in integrated processing, including the on-boarding of several new e-commerce clients in late Q3 and early Q4, stronger growth in digital wallet as well as sequential improvement in direct marketing.”
* Between Q3 and FY guidance, there is an implied guidance for a Q4 EBITDA of $153 million.  That represents a YoY EBITDA growth of 60.5%, which may offer a signal as to how moving beyond legacy de-risking headwinds can start to improve the margin picture going forward.
* Their fastest growing segment, eCash, has a high take rate of 7.2%.  For H1/21, they reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth which would reasonably point to a future business mix with higher overall margins.  Further growth in this segment stands to benefit from their new LATAM expansion, their new Glory Ltd partnership, as well as their recently launched US [campaign](https://www.skrill.com/es-us/enviar-transferir-dinero-mexico/?utm_source=tv&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=DIEGOSMT) to engage the US/Mexico remittance market (worth [$40 billion](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexican-migrants-home-record-40-billion-2020-75642052) annually). Also, their [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) deal expands eCash in 22 countries and their recent deals with [ZEN](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-extends-partnership-zen-com-080000606.html), [REPAY](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), and [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/) further expands their eCash network across the US and in 25 European countries.
* With a gross margin of 61-63%, upon execution of their two year strategy to “unlock over $100m organic adj. EBITDA” ([page 28](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)), management cites a potential “pro forma upside that could drive EBITDA CAGR to 21%.”
* One aspect of this margin expansion strategy is in the company’s ongoing integration of their various business segments into a single code on a cloud-based gateway, the Unity Platform. This streamlining will enable them to reduce costs and scale up quickly in new markets and in emerging verticals like travel, [trading in the wallet](https://coinquora.com/paysafes-neteller-adds-fiat-to-crypto-feature-on-its-platform/), digital goods, online gaming, and banking as a service.  Among the benefits of this new synthesis:
   * it increases operating margins through cost-saving efficiencies and eliminating redundancies (automating underwriting, 2/3 reduction in data centers)
   * it enables them to forward unsolicited cost savings to partners, merchants and users, helping them retain and gain new marketshare,
   * it eliminates on-boarding each service separately by making their entire suite automatically available through a single gateway, which builds in substantial cross-selling opportunities

# 4. Float

The number of institutional funds owning PSFE has grown from 187 to 300 over the last quarter. At this point, nearly all the major funds hold shares at a cost basis much higher than the current price. These include Wells Fargo, Blackrock, Citigroup, State Street, JP Morgan, Francisco Partners, Naya Capital and noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point), David Tepper (Appaloosa), Aaron Cohen (Survetta), Seth Rosen (Nitorum) and Leon Cooperman, (who personally owns over a million shares). Notably, most of these investors bought shares before Paysafe’s [recent history](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/) of value creation.  Cross-referencing the most up to date [record](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) with older filings, some [estimate](https://solarpvinvestor.com/topic/3255-paysafe-holdings-psfe/?tab=comments#comment-103030) the true available float is between 70-80 million shares. For what has historically been a low beta stock, theoretically, a reduced free float influences the proportionate affect of true short interest and could cause the stock price to move faster.

personalfinance,Buy a car before or after student loan payoff?,"Hi all! My little Chevy Cruze is pushing 150k miles and it’s about time for me to upgrade. While I would love to continue not having a car payment and drive my Cruze until it dies, I will not be able to. I commute 6 hours to/from work twice a month and need something more reliable.

I am set to pay off my student loans in June 2022. Is it better for me to finance a car before or after I pay these off? My credit score is 780 and I would hate for it to drop and lose my chance at a lower interest rate after payoff. 

For reference, I plan to buy brand new with a $10k-12k down payment. I was thinking of buying the new car January-ish. This will be my last big loan purchase for a while as we already have a home. 

ETA: 75k income before taxes. 13k of federal student loans averaging 4% interest rate (currently 0% until Jan 31st). Purchase price of car I am looking at is 25-30k with a 8k down payment saved already, aiming to have 10-12k.

personalfinance,Just moved into a home trying to figure out how to fund renovations,"Hello.

I was fortunate enough to purchase a home in a very competitive market at the same monthly mortgage cost as my rent.  At this point I had all of the good finance stuff going, maxing out 401k, getting company match and contributing 600 a month to my kids 529.  A 6 month safety fund + 50K earmarked for renovations.  We were going to renovate the upstairs which has some interesting stylistic choices that the previous empty nesters made when building the house but just had significant basement flooding during the recent nor’easter due to a sump pump battery failure.  I basically have to redo the whole 1100 square foot basement now, an expense I wasn’t expecting that will not be covered by insurance.  Where before I had cash on hand to renovate the second level (I was anticipating anywhere from 50 to 100k to do that) I’m now considering what financing options I have to pay for this stuff.  I don’t think I have enough equity in the home having just purchased it 4 months ago.  Any other guidance? I realize that one answer is to just wait and save more but interest rates are also incredibly low so I’m trying to see what’s out there.",finance

personalfinance,Is there a place for riskier investments in the name of diversification?,"A bit of background: I'm 33, household income is about $200k annually, we own a home with a 2.65% interest rate and the monthly payment represents about 20% of our gross income. No other debt. We're contributing 20% of our paychecks to retirement, plus employer match on top. In these retirement accounts, we're invested in primarily VOO / VTI. At the end of each month, we have between $1.5k and $2k ""unbudgeted"" money which is typically used for one-time expenses, splurges (like vacation, furniture, etc) or most often, savings. So as best I can tell, we're doing what we're supposed to and we're ""on track"". 

That last category of ""extra savings"" is the focus of my question. I have a few industries / sectors that I'd consider myself quite knowledgeable on, and I'm bullish on their long-term outlook. Up to now, I haven't allocated a single dollar to investments outside of total market index funds. And in hindsight, I've missed out on some large gains. That's not to say that they'd continue to do well, or that 100% of my picks would have ""beat the market"". But it feels overly conservative to not have any exposure to these opportunities.

Again, to be clear, I wouldn't be touching any of my retirement savings. This would be in a taxable brokerage account of ""leftover"" money that could have easily been spent on PC parts or dining out instead. Point is, this isn't money that I'm depending on for anything.

Anyway, just wanted to start a conversation and get some thoughts. The amount I'm considering would likely represent about 5% of my investments.",finance
personalfinance,"30 y/o, married, finally out of school, looking for planning advice","Hi all. I'm looking for some feedback about how my spouse (30M) and I (30F) should be prioritizing our finances right now, specifically between saving for retirement and saving for a down payment on a house. (Fwiw not looking for comments on previous choices we've made - just looking for advice on next best moves now! Thanks!) Sorry if this post is a little all over the place, too.

Background: My spouse has been working since he graduated from college back in 2014. Current salary is just over 100k. He has been contributing to his retirement accounts this entire time and his current retirement balance is about 161k. On the other hand, I graduated from college in 2015 and worked as a paralegal for just over a year before going to law school. During law school, spouse's salary was able to cover our living expenses, so I only took on debt to cover tuition (loan balance is 6.7k). I graduated in 2020 and finally started my career, starting salary was 135k. I just started contributing to my own retirement with my first job as an attorney in 2020. My current balance in my 401k is just over 9k. After just a year at my law firm, in August 2021 I took a temporary (one-year) job working for the federal government, which cut my salary significantly (down to 83.5k). This position will only last until August 2022, at which point I will return to private practice at a law firm. (Expected salary when I return to a firm is 170k.) I recently opened an IRA for myself and maxed out my contribution for 2021 (6k).

In addition to our individual retirement accounts (\~161k for spouse and \~15k for me), we have a Vanguard investment account with an account balance of about 12k; 92k in a high-interest savings account through Ally (being shut in due to covid made it much easier to aggressively save); and 6k in our checking.

We are looking to buy our first home in the next year or two--we don't have kids (or imminent plans to have them) and love our current apartment (rent is 1490/mo), so we're flexible on timing.

**Summary of our financial situation:**

\-current combined gross income is 183.5k, will be increasing to \~270k in August 2022

\-spouse has 161k in retirement accounts (currently contributing 9%), I have \~15k (not currently contributing)

\-12k joint investment account

\-92k in joint high-interest savings (currently auto-transferring $3500/mo into this account)

\-fixed expenses: rent (1490/mo), car (350/mo) (we are a one-car family and plan to stay that way for the foreseeable future), student loans (250/mo) (currently suspended, will resume Jan 2022)-other living expenses: \~$4000/mo (includes food, household supplies, gas, phone, gym, pet insurance, ""fun stuff"", etc)

\*side note: we have completely combined finances if that is relevant

**Questions I have:**

1. Since I'm so far behind on my personal retirement savings, is there more I should be doing right now to save? Because of the temporary nature of my position, I don't have an employer-sponsored retirement plan. When I return to private practice next year, I will go back to contributing to my 401k and will plan to max it out (I also expect profit-sharing into my 401k every year from my firm in the amount of about 5-6% of my salary). Since I'll be able to save aggressively when I return to private practice, do I need to worry now? If I should be doing more to save now, what should I be doing, since I don't have access to a 401k and already maxed out my IRA?

1a. When thinking about retirement, should I be considering any expected inheritance from my parents in my planning--and if so, should I ask them more specifically about their plans to have a more concrete idea of what to expect? My parents are both \~60 y/o and healthy, so I do not expect (or want!!) to receive an inheritance any time soon. However, I do know that my parents are very financially well-off, and when the day finally comes, I will be getting something from their estate. Is this something people factor into retirement plans, or are you just supposed to think about it as a ""bonus"" whenever it happens? (God it sounds terrible to talk about my parents dying as a ""bonus"" but I hope you know what I mean.)

2. My spouse and I have earmarked the cash in our high-interest savings account as an emergency fund + down payment savings, and we are contributing to it monthly to build up the down payment (since we already have enough for an emergency fund). However, because we haven't definitively decided a) what we want our house budget to be and b) what % down payment we want to make, I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around when we should stop contributing to this account and start just investing more each month instead. According to all the ""how much house can you afford?"" calculators, we will be able to afford quite a lot of house once I go back to private practice. However, we much prefer to spend less on a house and have more money in our budget for travel and saving. What is a realistic house budget for us based on that goal? The median home price in our city was $325k in June 2021.

3. The interest rate on my law school loan is about 6% the balance is about 6.7k. Because of the relatively high interest rate and relatively low balance, does it make sense to just pay the whole thing off when the student loan relief ends in January? Should I just make the monthly payments (75/mo on the 10-year repayment plan)? Refinance? Not sure what makes the most sense here.

4. Are there any other suggestions you have for us, money-wise, that we should be doing? I am just now trying to get a really good grip on personal finance now that we're finally both working in our careers and neither of us is in school, and I don't know if I'm making all the right moves.",finance

personalfinance,Where to store 50k house money for 2 years,"I have 50k earmarked for a future house purchase.  At the moment, it is sitting in a HYSA and it hurts my soul to see it doing basically nothing for me since interest rates are so low.  I just signed a 2 yr lease on a duplex so will not need that money for about 2 years.  Even if I were to start looking to buy before that, it'd be over a year from now.  I do intend to buy instead of rent my next residence, however that plan is subject to change based on political climate of my state (TX) as well as  whether or not my partner and I choose to have kids.

I am tempted to throw it all in SPY (so far I've seen +8% returns on my current SPY holdings),  I realize this is a riskier strategy however.  I wonder if there is anything that would have a lower risk but relatively comparable returns to SPY for a medium term investment of these funds.  I'm not entirely risk averse, but I don't intend to YOLO this 50k into meme stonks (I have a separate budget for gambling ;-) ).  Obviously I could split the 50k up and I have considered that, but I'm more of a set it and forget it type of investor so, that's why I'm leaning towards chucking it in one place.

personalfinance,Refinancing Federal Student Loans. When and with who?,"I have paid off all my private student loans and so all that is left are federal loans. They all are serviced by My Fedloan which has announced they will be ending the servicing of these loans. Right now we still are at 0% which I'm guessing will continue until January 31 when payments resume. 

Paying student loans is not an issue for me. I am lucky and was able to secure a job within a year of graduating. The issue I have is fedloan will be SPLITTING the loans and sending them to different places. This means I could have payments to 10 different servicers if they wanted to do that. I have around 50k in loans through them right now spread across ~15 loans with interest as high as 7%. 

Here is a section from nerdwallet about what's happening (7 days ago posted)

""FedLoan is expected to end all federal loan servicing after December 2021. All federal loans in the FedLoan portfolio will be split up and transferred to other servicers including EdFinancial, MOHELA, Navient and Nelnet. However, Navient is also expected to stop servicing loans after December 2021 and its portfolio will transfer to Maximus.""


Things to note :

I have less 20% debt to income ratio 

I have a stable high paying tech job

My credit is pushing 800

The last loan I transfered I got a 3% interest rate on. Down from 9% at the original servicer.

Not sure if it matters but the only other debt I have is my car which is under 30k.




My questions are:

Should I just transfer everything to a new servicer now ? This would mean I'd start paying interest earlier than if I left them with fedloan. 

Should I wait until the end of December or mid Jan and get the 0% interest for two more months? 

Wait till the end of January and hope they haven't already started the process of splitting up my loans?


I like the idea of 0% but I know I can get a low rate due to my DTI and credit score. So does it really make that much a difference if I move my loans and start interest a little early ? How much would it really save me to wait?

The other question is:

What are the best and safest places that refi student loans? I used Sofi for my last one and they gave me a decent rate.


I should add there is a chance I will knock down another 20-30k off my loans in March. Chances are that wherever I move my loans, they won't be there for more than 2 years.",finance
personalfinance,best way to pay down/off credit cards. Consolidated loan? Pull from retirement account? Other ideas?,"Hello, and thank goodness for Reddit, because I sure don't know what I'm doing. I inherited a nice chunk of money in the form of my mother's mutual funds. I created a chart yesterday so I could determine what mutual were doing best. They are earning between 9.9 (Tweedy Browne) and 15-16% , with the exception, T Rowe Price, Latin America that was in the red. It hasn't done well for quite a while but I've only got around $6000 in there.

I'm 67 years old, hope to go back to work in another month or so (health issues), do not yet draw on social security, and have around $30,000 in credit card debt. My credit score is 706; I know I need to at the very least move some debt from some cards to other cards in order to get and stay below 30% of available credit. Alternatively, or in addition to this:

I'm considering a consolidated loan to lower my collective payments so I could simultaneously pay debt at a higher rate (using the money I save), and of course the best interest rates go to people with excellent credit, or at least very good.  Once I have debt from current credit cards lowered via consolidated loan and with a substantially higher credit score that will result, I can refi my mortgage (currently at about 6%). This path would either require an interest rate around 10-12% for an 'easy' loan with very little documentation or lower interest rates but with a lot of documentation I'd rather not deal with right now.

Alternatively, I could withdraw some or all of the necessary monies from retirement investments, pay off all the debt, get my credit score to excellent quickly and not have to make monthly payments which is interest from credit cards. Credit card interest rates are appx 20-28% (I think. I can't find the interest rate for BOA cards -- just spent 30 minutes looking everywhere online, they'll send it in 3-5 business days…). 

OR withdraw monies from retirement, pay down credit cards with proceeds (thereby raising my credit substantially and quickly) and then taking a consolidated loan based upon Excellent credit and paying the retirement monies back using that loan. Not sure if this can be done, though.

Another alternative; withdraw monies from retirement, pay down credit cards with proceeds, obtain Excellent credit, then apply to refi my mortgage to a lower interest rate and pull out $30,000 in that transaction, and use that money to pay back retirement funds. Not sure if this can be done, though.

So: 30,000 in credit card debt.  Current credit score 706.  Credit card interest rates around 20-28%.

Pay with a consolidated loan then pay down credit card debt more rapidly?

Pay using retirement funds and wipe out credit card debt to raise credit score to Excellent?

Pay using retirement funds, obtain excellent credit, get a $30,000 personal loan with excellent interest rate, refi mortgage based on excellent credit and simultaneously pull out an additional $30,000, which will be used to return monies to retirement accounts.

solar,Project Solar Woes,"Edit: I'm cancelling this project, but have not yet gotten any response to my request to cancel.

**TL:DR** \- After signing purchase and installation agreements I've only received updates that mention  we're still in the permitting phase - since August. They've increased a price on me once and never resolved the issue after I pushed back. Have other people had luck finishing projects with Project Solar, or is the company spiraling? I'm trying to decide if it's worth pursuing this deal or if I should give up on solar until I'm comfortable spending an extra $10k+ on a local installer.--

Howdy. I responded to a few other Project Solar threads a while back when I was starting the process for my home in Colorado. Since then, things have gone downhill severely and communication has just halted. I figured I'd provide a timeline for anyone else considering Project Solar or experiencing similar issues.

I don't want to cancel this deal as the price is fantastic compared to other installers in my area, but I'm running out of patience and options. Any advice?

July 6th - 8th

* I replied to an email offering free site design and provided some additional information after speaking with a rep.

July 9th

* Grace from Project Solar sends site design video and the following specs:
   * Location: Colorado
   * Mount: Flush
   * Panels: Q-Cell 340W
   * Inverters: IQ7
   * System Size: 6.8 kW
   * Number of Panels: 20
   * Batteries: None

&amp;#x200B;

* DIY: $8,066\*
* Monthly: $53\*
* Full Install: $10,582\*
* Monthly: $70\*
* \*after federal incentive

&amp;#x200B;

* DIY: $10,900 §
* Monthly: $72 §
* Full Install: $14,300 §
* Monthly: $94 §
* § before any incentives
* I’m asked to pay a refundable $100 deposit to finalize the design and price.

July 14th

* Project Solar offers to waive the $100 setup fee if I want to move forward within 24 hours. Email stresses that I should only move forward if I’m serious about going solar with Project Solar.
* I submit the order and receive a communication from my new project manager, Susan, instructing me to set up an account and fill out a form.

July 16th

* Susan contacts me with an updated plan and asks me to submit site photos:
   * System Size: 7.82kWs
   * Total Price for Your System: $16,199 *(full install)*
   * Total Price After Federal Incentives: $11,987

July 19th

* While submitting photos I also ask about an electrical panel upgrade. Susan says the engineer agrees and that it will be an additional $1,800 for the upgrade to a 200A panel.
* Full price is now $17,999
* I agree and Susan sends a purchase agreement.

Aug 6th

* I receive HOA approval and sign the purchase agreement.

Aug 9th

* Susan tells me that they’ll move forward to the engineering phase and create an official plan for city and utility permitting. I’m advised that the process usually takes 7-10 business days and that any deposit I paid is no longer refundable. I’m also advised to move forward with any financing I need at this point.

Aug 24th

* No direct communication from project solar, but I receive and sign an agreement with the installer.

Sept 1st

* I reach out for an update as I haven’t heard anything in a while.

Sept 2nd

* Susan responds and tells me that there was a major restructure 2 weeks prior and she is now in a different role. My account was meant to be reassigned to a new project manager, but a technical error caused that to not happen and Susan has been out of town since. She says she’s contacted my new project manager, Andy, who specializes in permitting.
* New project manager, Andy, reaches out to apologize for the lack of an update and tells me we should have permit approval next week and utility approval soon after and that I can expect a more solid update next week.
* Andy calls me realizing she forgot an important item in the update. It turns out I need a main panel upgrade. I tell her that I was aware and had requested it. She seems relieved and then tells me that in addition I’ll need a new meter due to Colorado regulations, but the cost is included in the upgrade pricing.

Sept 3rd

* I receive a request to sign an addendum to the purchase agreement that raises my main panel upgrade cost from $1800 to $2200 with no mention of new meter or other differences besides a price increase.
* I try to call Andy, but the phone number in her signature errors out so I email her instead explaining the above and asking for clarification.

Sept 8th

* I follow up after not having received a response.

Sept 9th

* Andy apologizes for the slow response and says she’s been out for some personal reasons. She explains that the $1800 I was previously quoted and that the price has recently gone up to $2200. She apologizes for the change and informs me that they don’t up the cost - it’s a direct price from the electrician that gets passed on to me. (I’m not sure how it can be a direct cost since they work with electricians all over the country and it’s listed on their website).
* I respond asking how the price can go up after we’ve already signed an agreement. $400 isn’t a lot but it makes me nervous about other cost increases.

Sept 14th

* I follow up after not having received a response to explain further that the $1800 main panel upgrade cost wasn’t a quote, it was an amount listed in both the purchase agreement and installation agreement that have already been signed. I tell her that I still can’t get through to her listed phone number.
* Andy response apologizing for the delay and noting that she’s trying to resolve the issue with her number. She states that she’ll try and work with management to stay true to the original panel upgrade price.

Sept 27th

* I ask for an update after not having received a response.

Oct 4th

* I ask for an update after not having received a response. I mention that Susan had previously suggested permits would be applied for in mid august and Andy mentioned that they should be approved by the second week of September. I say that I’m worried I got lost in the shuffle again.

Oct 5th

* I notice Andy’s email address had changed and reply again to both emails to make sure she’s getting my messages.

Oct 8th

* I text Project Solar’s customer support number and explain the timeline and lack of communication. They say they’ll ask my project manager to reach out.

Oct 12th

* I reply to the previous text that I still haven’t heard from my project manager and they say they will talk to her.

Oct 14th

* I reply to the previous text that I’m still waiting on any sort of response from my project manager and they text back “Let me go talk to her.”

Oct 18th

* I email Andy and ask for a status update again, still no response.
* I email Project Solar support and explain that it’s been over a month since I’ve gotten an update on either my project status or a pricing conversation we were having.
* Support replies that Andy has just emailed me and, sure enough, she did. She thanks me for reaching out (as if I hadn’t been doing it for a month) and says they’re doing more reorganizing. She’s going to make sure someone is available to give me updates. They’re still waiting on permits and she’ll ask the engineer for a time frame. No mention of the panel upgrade cost discussion.

Oct 26th

* I ask Andy for an update since I haven’t received anything new yet. I remind her that I was expecting permits back in august, and then September, based on what they had told me and that we never closed out the panel upgrade cost issue.
* Somewhere in the past couple weeks I also tried reaching out to Susan since I had a phone number from her. I left a voicemail asking if there was any way she could help me out, but didn’t receive a reply.

Nov 2nd

* Still no responses.
* Edit: I did end up emailing support again and they told my that I have a new project manager that should be reaching out soon. I'm a little surprised they didn't reach out immediately as my previous project manager seems to have checked out a long time ago.

Edit 2:

Nov 3rd

* Reached out to the Project Solar owner on reddit to see if they could help.
* Received an email from the energy company that an interconnection application has been created in my name.
* Went to check website to see if any of the info about my project status has changed. Looks like they're redone their site in the last week and my project status is now back at the first phase - Data Collection. It's obviously further along than that, but the previous site also only ever showed me as being in the first couple of steps.

Edit 3:

Nov 4th

* After contacting the owner, I get a reply from Andy. They'll honor the original panel upgrade price and tell me that the permit is awaiting approval as it was previously submitted but had a code compliance issue. They stress getting this done for me by the end of the year.

Nov 15th

* I ask for another update and am told that they've asked the city for an update. I'm told to expect to hear back later in the day.

Nov 18th

* I'm told that the permit should be approved in 5 days. I ask what the timeline is after the permit is approved, but get no response. 

Dec 4th

* I ask for an update again. I can't find any record of a permit application on my city's website and start to doubt that it's ever been submitted. 

Dec 8th

* Andy calls and tells me that the permit is again being reviewed and that we're looking at 5 days for approval, then another 5 before install. 
* I'm finally able to find the permit on my city's website, but it shows that it was submitted this morning.

Dec 20th

* I ask for an update and don't get a response.

Dec 23rd

* I send a longer message saying that I can't see a way where this is completed before the end of the year. I express my frustration at the project being ignored for so long and that I'll have to wait until 2023 for the tax credit now. 
* Andy says they still believe that it can still be pushed through and that they're working on it today.
* Andy messages me again to say that the permit is still being reviewed, but they are going to look over the tax documentation and see if I can still get the credit for this year. I don't believe that is possible.
* I look at the permit on my city's website again and see that it was rejected on the 12th. Reasons stated were that the snow load and wind tolerances were below requirements for my city. 

Jan 12th

* I receive an invoice for the full amount of the project and installation, even though I only owe equipment costs before it ships and the install cost after final inspection.
* I tell Andy about the permit rejection and ask if the invoice means things are moving forward.
* Andy says they'll call my city again for an update.

Jan 14th

* I receive another message from my energy company with an interconnect application that I'm asked to sign. I fill it out and sign it.

Jan 20th

* I ask Andy for an update and say I'm not comfortable paying anything until the permit is approved. No response.
* I receive a notice from my energy company that they've received my application and all fees (paid by Project Solar) and that they've approved my project for installation. 

Jan 31

* I ask for an update that shows any sort of progress.

Feb 1

* Andy asks to call me the next day and I agree.

Feb 3

* I never received a call and say that I need to cancel this project because it isn't worth the stress.

Feb 4

* I  received another email from my energy company about a new interconnect application, but for a different name and address. I message Andy to let them know that I think they've accidentally attached my email to another Colorado project. No response. 
* I messaged the project solar owner again to let him know what's been going on and that I'm cancelling this project.

personalfinance,Front-loaded mortgage affect effective interest rate?,"There's been a lot of posts about whether people should use extra money to pay off their mortgage sooner, or if they should invest it. I've read lots of good arguments on each side. It has been argued that if you have a $500,000 mortgage at 3%, you should invest extra money in the market and expect an 8% return. That makes sense.

But what if I just bought my house and I only expect to keep my home for five or so years? The payments I'm making now are almost entirely interest. If I sell my home after five years, I've paid significantly more than 3% interest, right? 

Looking at my amortization schedule, 38% of my first payment is going to the principle, with 62% going to interest. On my 60th payment (year 5), 44% of the payment is going to principle, with 56% going to interest.

So my question is, assuming I sell at year 5, isn't my effective interest rate \*way\* higher than 3%? And if so, should I consider paying more towards the mortgage rather than investing in the stock market? Or will paying extra towards the mortgage just not make that much of a difference, since I'm paying mostly interest anyway?",finance

I’m in credit card debt and I need help. I have never been good with money but last year I lost my job and had to live off of credit cards to make up for living in one of the most expensive cities. I had already prior debt so now I’m even more so in the hole. I wish I could move out and find a cheaper place but that doesn't exist and I can't sign a lease with no job.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes I am on unemployment however all of that money doesn’t even cover my rent of $2000 a month. I have been busting my ass trying to get a job and I am at a loss as to why I can’t. Thankfully I don’t have a car at this time so there’s no additional pay out for that and I am using food stamps to eat. I have health problems so I end up spending more money each month on food which goes on a credit card. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please if anyone has any advice as to what I should do it would be greatly appreciated.

Here’s the breakdown. 

Rent: $2000

Utility/Internet/Phone etc: $300 avg. 

Loan: $410

Credit card #1: $169

Credit card #2: $180

**Average Total per month: $3200** 

The only income I have is unemployment that is **$1800** a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

On average I am loosing $1400 a month as the $1800 just doesn’t even cover my rent. I just don’t know what to do as I have looked at one loan option and the interest rate was 29% with monthly payment of something like $700. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've exhausted all my deferred options so I have to pay each month on my loan and credit cards and I'm only buying what I need and not splurging or ordering delivery etc. I've also signed up for rental assistance and haven't heard back yet as I am several months late on rent payments.

personalfinance,"USDA loan refinanced in May 2020, PMI left off CD now they want it paid back","Sorry I'm on mobile and on my lunch break so typing this up fast. I need some advice about how screwed I am on this. I also tried to post this in r/Mortgages but it wouldn't let me. 

As the title states, I refinanced my USDA loan last spring for a lower rate. Today, my bank account overdrafted due to my mortgage payment being $200 more than usual. I called them and they said there was an escrow shortage due to them paying the USDA PMI back in June. I asked why I hadn't been being charged that all along in my monthly payment. Turns out my CD didn't have the PMI on it at all. They haven't been charging me for it and they just discovered it and now they are trying to recoup the money from me. I recently went through Hurricane Ida and my husband and I lost a week of wages each and we spent our small savings paying bills and dealing with hurricane expenses. FEMA did not give us any money BTW. 

I can't help but feel like this isn't fair to us. We signed legal documents and the mortgage company screwed those documents up and it only seems fair they eat the cost. I told them I'm willing to pay the amount I was supposed to be paying monthly going forward but they should eat the PMI shortage. I was told that's not an option. I contacted my broker and he agreed this massive, Nationwide Mr. Company isn't going to miss ~$1000 and that my options are to keep escalating with them, refinance into a conventional loan or just pay them what they want. He was really shocked about this and said he has never seen this happen before bc so many people had to approve the CD before I signed it. Its like all these people dropped the ball and I'm left holding it at terrible time in my life right now. 

So is my broker accurate? Is refinance or pay them my only options? I have to call the company back after work and try to get a supervisor again. My call dropped in the middle of trying to get them to admit fault on a recording.


Update: I just got a call back from the mortgage company and they said they are not going to honor my CD's or change my monthly payments or refund my escrow account. Looks like I have to talk to an attorney now.

Final update: ended up refinancing into a conventional loan with no PMI. Got a lower interest rate, lower monthly payment and $2000 cash back. Now I'm going to report the old mortgage company to the CFPB.",finance

personalfinance,Planning for multiple financial goals as a single parent,"I am a single parent and I have just purchased my first home. Saving toward that goal was a long-time project, and now that it’s finished, I’m not sure what to do next. Here are some stats about my situation:

- I have about 80 K a year in income from my job, and this is a unionized position which will go up at a specified rate every year until I reach $100,000. I also have about $1500 a month in income unrelated to my job, due to a pension from my son’s late father.

- I have $25,000 in an emergency fund and about $50,000 in an investment fund. I haven’t done much with the money other than park it there. I had more money in savings, but I spent it on the down payment for the new home.

- We live in a high COL area for family reasons. Part of my motivation in purchasing a property was that I think the prices are going to get even more crazy and I want to make sure my son has a place to live when he is starting out his life. I think my eventual plan would be to retire somewhere cheaper, and give him the condo I just bought.

My financial goals going forward are as follows:

1) Save for my own retirement. I know that you should not save for a child’s education at the expense of this but I’m not sure how to prioritize it given that I will have a pension from my job, and given that the pension I’m currently receiving will continue indefinitely, so I will have some income coming in other than government benefits irregardless.

2) Save for my child’s education. He is five now. I have about $15,000 in an education fund for him already. I would like to put in the maximum to get government matching, but I’m not sure if there is more I should be putting aside. I’m not planning to save other money to buy him a car or something like that because I do plan to give him the condo eventually and that will be his big ‘getting started in adult life’ help.

3) Pay off the mortgage. I know that there is some debate about this. Given how low interest rates are, perhaps I should not worry about aggressively paying off the mortgage and I should instead invest the money. However, my monthly expenses would go down significantly once the mortgage is paid off, so there is an opportunity cost as well to not trying to move up the property ladder like most people do and to just staying put and paying it off.

I don’t have a car, so even though I’m in a high cost of living area, we have been OK so far financially.

personalfinance,Paying into 401K or paying off debt,So my fiance is still in college and has a car loan at 14%. The amount on the loan is small and if I were to quit contributing to my 401k and HSA (which as of right now has enough to cover full deductible for next year) I would be able to pay off her car and my car ( interest rate 5.64%) in 1 year. My company matches 5% of what is put into my 401K. I'm curious if this is a smart move. This would increase our debt to income ratio and help me to prepare to have her on my health insurance after we are married ( which is in next September). I have been inputting into the 401K for 3 years almost. I just want to take off these loans and better prepare for finishing my student loans once she is out of college.,finance
personalfinance,"My student loans have been in collections for several years. I’d like to pay off on full, but simply don’t know how to.","My fiancé and I are closing on our first home, and our interest rate and mortgage payment is a bit higher than we were anticipating. This is largely due to my credit score, which is held down by my old student loans. Also because of this, we aren’t eligible for FHA and are taking a conventional loan.  A few years ago I recall looking around on the department of education website to see how to make a payment plan, but wasn’t able to get very far. 

Our monthly payment is going to be about $2400. Between my fiancé and myself, we’re bringing in about $5000 or so a month in take home pay. This is doable I think, but won’t leave much room for savings, aside from our 401ks which we contribute just enough to max out the employer match. 

The lender told me that if I were to pay off my loans, we would be able to refinance into a FHA loan in a few months, which I believe would lower our interest rate as well as monthly payment. 

In about 6 months, I’ll be receiving a stock payout from my previous employer. The amount of this, after withholdings, is nearly 3 times the amount I owe in student loans, so I definitely think my best bet is to just pay them off at that time. 

But I just don’t know how. 

Does anybody know the exact website or phone number to reach out to to get this started?",finance

Avax,"I FOMO’d into Wonderland TIME so you don’t have to! TIME Staking (🎩, 🎩)","(Not a shill post, rather the aim is to share my experience during these crazy alt days. MODS, please delete if not appropriate.)

So with all the FOMO going on and alt coins pumping, I decided to look for something that seemed “too good to be true” and super high APY on L2 Chains. Enter Wonderland $TIME.

A project headed by Daniele Sesta of $ICE, $SPELL &amp; $MIM. Essentially it is fork of Olympus DAO’s $OHM token and (3,3) tokenomics. 

Can I tell you what that means? Absolutely not, why do any research, better to just FOMO into projects without giving it a second thought!!

(Jokes. I did do some research into Daniele and that was all I needed. He’s basically a People Maxi and after listening to some interviews I was sold. The Frogs will Occupy DeFi. This (3, 3) notation is game theory shorthand for a maximum positive outcome between participants borrowed from Olympus DAO) (🎩, 🎩)

All I know is, when I invested, the Staking APY was around 67k%. That was enough to attract the degen in me. Little did I know……

“Money you’re willing to lose.”

We all say it and advise it. Are we actually ready to lose ANYTHING. 

Seems not. I aped into making it the number 3 coin in my portfolio. 

I bought in when the price was sitting at $7957 per coin. 

In traditional fashion, after my purchase, the price instantly bombed to just above $6000. 

Fuck. 

I was angry. Disappointed. Told myself “you fucking donkey” many times over as it dropped places. I just stared at my screen as it was the top loser for days on end. It was nerve wracking. But it also occurred to me, how safe my other blue chip investments of BTC + ETH felt in comparison. That was interesting. This felt like real seat of you pants flying. 

Enter, interest rate of 69,420% APY!! 

Yes ladies and gentlemen. This amazing coin pays out every 8 hours. That’s roughly 0.59% of your coin paid back every 8 hours, Compounded! 

(ROI 5 day rate, 9.3%)

Within a week, because of the APY alone, I was back in the black, thankfully, and then the price of the coin recovered a little (still not to what I bought at.) so I am now up on this investment. I may continue to hold this coin but this one I am watching so very closely because of it’s volatility and risk profile. 

This is not a shill post, rather the aim was to share my experience. It felt like gambling! Still, keeping a small portion of this portfolio maybe? any profits go to Blue Chips. That’ll be my “taking profits” while leaving the main assets like ETH unsold.

(Keep in mind this us all happening on the L2 AVAX Chain)
(Edit : Correction, L1!)

In short, stick with Blue Chips and buy ETH! Or, who knows!!

As I write this I am up 11%.

You don’t own enough ETH! Or AVAX, 

This is not financial advice. 

Don’t spend what you cannot afford to lose. 

Adjust your risk profile and appetite accordingly. 

DYOR. 

No FOMO.

personalfinance,5 and a half year old toll collection?,"Hey all,

This is a weird one. Until June of 2019, I lived in NJ, when we moved to Tennessee. 

I have had an EZ Pass account to pay for traffic tolls since 2013, and because NJ is wildly expensive, had a $250/month EZ pass bill that electronically debits from my bank account. 

I just received a letter from a collection agency stating that I owe $64 - a $4 dollar toll and a $60 fee to the Delaware DOT for non-payment of a toll incurred on 4/22/2016. 

First, is there a statue of limitations on this type of debt? The violation apparently occurred in Delaware, I lived in NJ at the time and I reside in TN now. 

Second, I have no idea if I was even in that area at that time - it was 5.5 years ago. EZ Pass doesn’t allow you to go back that far and access your statements to a) see if you were in the area or b) if you were actually charged for and paid the toll already via EZ pass. 

I have never received an invoice from the Delaware DOT, nor any other documentation indicating the potentially missed toll. 

It’s my plate number in the letter, and it’s conceivable that somehow my EZ pass didn’t get picked up, but I have no idea how to rectify that now that this much time has gone by...

I know not to ignore the letter and to contact them in writing disputing the debt and requesting any verification they may have. I have zero problem paying the toll if it was my vehicle, but I’m a little miffed that a) it’s been 5.5 years, leaving me with almost no way to defend myself b) I’m being charged a $60 fee c) I never received any other notice of this from Delaware DOT, despite mail forwarding being set up for a year after our move. This notice was mailed directly to Tennessee so clearly they are aware of our new address...

I plan to buy again but am fortunate to have the option to stay with my parents in between selling and buying — so I don’t *have* to rush but I would like to minimize the time spent in my childhood bedroom and be prepared to move fast should a house I like come on the market. 

I read that lenders review your account balances for the previous 60 days and am trying to figure out if I stand to get a better interest rate if I let the $100k proceeds sit in the bank for a couple months before applying for pre-approval or if the effect is negligible since I’m already pretty low risk from a credit perspective. 

I’m not looking to qualify for a bigger loan, my main focus is on the interest rate. Could I expect to see a significant difference in the interest rate if I apply for pre-approval prior to selling my house vs waiting 2 months after receiving proceeds from home sale?  


Potentially relevant things:  

Single, steady $115k income  
$20k cash in bank  
$8k stocks  
$120k in retirement  


Debts:  
$20k car note 
$133k remaining balance on mortgage  


Home likely to sell for about $285k (conservative estimate of proceeds from sale = approx $100k)  

Moving out of state, targeting homes $300-$350k

&gt;  
&gt;BlackBerry UEM, a comprehensive endpoint management solution with industry-leading security, enables employee productivity across an organization’s devices, applications, users, and use cases.  BlackBerry UEM is used by many of the world’s largest organizations, including governments, financial services, healthcare, and more.  The solution has the most government certifications in the industry, including FedRAMP, NIAP, DoDIN APL, and NSA CSfC.  
&gt;  
&gt;“UEM gives employees the flexibility to work from anywhere, and organizations the confidence their corporate data is always protected,” said Alex Willis, Vice President of Technical Solutions, BlackBerry. “We are delighted to partner with Okta, a leading provider of identity management, to deliver advanced security and a superior employee experience to our customers around the world.”

They said that the overall debt of 13500 can be lowered to 9800. Not exact numbers but basically that. I have 11500 in private student loan debt (Sallie Mae) and 2000 in credit card debt. I do not have a job atm. I graduated last year. I have been paying my loans and have a good track record along with a decent (at least I think) credit score of 720. Losing that credit score is a big con for me and I am not sure it is worth it. 

I decided the same day that I signed up with them to cancel because of the other Reddit posts so I called back to cancel but she said that I'll end up calling her back anyway because Sallie Mae won't negotiate anything with me or allow IDR payments. To be fair I am an idiot because I did not do my full research before calling nor have I called Sallie Mae yet about not being able to pay future payments. She didn't cancel my contract with NDR and told me to contact her back tomorrow when I properly speak with Sallie Mae.

My reason for writing this post is whether or not NDR would be worth it for my situation since I don't have a job. I obviously know nothing about finance but I would really like some help on this matter and even budgeting tips would be appreciated. I also have Federal student loans that are almost 20k. In January they will end and I will have to start making payments on them starting Feb.

22. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It’s notable that Cardano’s Djed solves this.

24. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM.

25. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a “what if” scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised.

The so-called “Pandora Papers” reveal globally widespread cases of wealth concealment by public officials and bring up the question of whether blockchains like Cardano should take this into account when dealing with nation-state regimes as partners.

29. Brazil is looking to follow the El Salvador example and accept crypto as legal tender with a new bill to be voted within days.

37. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle.

49. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)

CryptoCurrency,Revealed: The Cryptoqueen's £13.5m London penthouse,"Just read this about onecoins scammer over at bbc. How these shitbags can sleep at night is beyond me. 

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-59062959](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-59062959)

A money-laundering trial in Germany is shining a light on the purchase of a luxury London penthouse by cryptocurrency scammer Dr Ruja Ignatova. Jamie Bartlett and Rob Byrne of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast explain how she used British-based lawyers and wealth managers - who continued to offer their services after she disappeared.

&amp;#x200B;

A former porter at the exclusive Abbots House apartment block in Kensington remembers meeting Dr Ruja Ignatova in 2016, as she returned from a shopping trip with her Bulgarian bodyguards.

&amp;#x200B;

""These two poor men came behind her like overloaded donkeys, struggling, and a bit out of breath - they must've had 20 bags each,"" says James (not his real name).

Dr Ruja had been splashing out on designer-label goods - Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Calvin Klein - without regard for the expense.

A little later, James got a look inside her four-bedroom penthouse flat, complete with swimming pool.

""She had an Andy Warhol painting stuffed in the cupboard, and that broke my heart because I went to art college,"" says the ex-policeman.

That was a print of the actress, Elizabeth Taylor. Another Warhol, Red Lenin, hung above the fireplace. To the left of a sofa in another reception room was a print of Queen Bubblegum by Michael Moebius, showing Queen Elizabeth blowing a bubble.

Private Eye later estimated the flat contained works of art worth £500,000, bought from London's Halcyon gallery.

James wondered whether Dr Ignatova was deliberately spreading her suspect wealth into assets that could be easily moved, to avoid them being seized.

Short presentational grey line

On 17 September Dr Ruja's German lawyer, Martin Breidenbach, went on trial in Münster, accused of money laundering for transferring 20 million euros to a London law firm to fund the purchase of the luxury property.

Two others are also in the dock, facing charges connected to the siphoning of millions of euros from Dr Ruja's €4bn scam - which consisted of selling something that didn't exist, a fake cryptocurrency she called OneCoin.

When the lease was signed in August 2016, financial regulators in at least one European country had already issued a warning about OneCoin. A few months earlier, Dr Ruja had pleaded guilty to fraud and other charges in a German court, after bankrupting a metal factory she'd bought and leaving 150 people jobless in 2011.

But this wasn't widely known.

Lawyers at Locke Lord, a US law firm with an office in London, did express concern about the source of the 20 million euros being transferred - this is apparent from internal emails revealed later in a US court case. But Dr Ruja's companies passed the firm's compliance checks, so they proceeded with the purchase of the property, along with Aquitaine Group, a Guernsey company offering tax haven services to wealthy clients.

&amp;#x200B;

The penthouse had been refurbished by luxury property developers Candy &amp; Candy after a fire that broke out while it was the London home of the singer, Duffy. The estate agent was Knight Frank. But quite who had bought the flat remained unclear to the outside world, thanks to British tax haven secrecy.

According to the property deed its owner is Abbots House Penthouse Limited.

This is an anonymous Guernsey shell company - one of 12,000 such companies that own properties in England and Wales - meaning that Dr Ruja's name would not have to appear on the UK deed, or in public records in the Channel Island.

Other Guernsey firms were appointed as directors (or ""nominees""), and a couple of months after Dr Ruja's offer was accepted, Aquitaine was listed as the company's ""resident agent"" in Guernsey. The London address of Locke Lord, meanwhile, appeared on the penthouse's Land Registry documents.

This appears to have been enough to conceal Dr Ruja's purchase of the property from the City of London Police, which told swindled OneCoin investors in September 2019 that they were ""unable to identify any OneCoin assets in the UK"".

The truth was only revealed two months later, in emails read out in the money-laundering trial of a former Locke Lord employee in the US, Mark Scott.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Filing past taxes for my deceased mother,"My mom passed away unexpectedly in September. I’m her executor. Turns out that she has not filed her state and federal income taxes in over a decade. Some years she sent in a payment with an extension request, other years it appears she did nothing. Her only sources of income since 2012 were a small disbursement from her IRA and social security. Her only deductions would have been a small amount of mortgage interest. I haven’t found any paperwork at her house so I’m going to have to try to recreate her tax situation year by year by contacting banks etc and seeing what they have on file. What is my best option in this case? Should I go straight to the IRS or start gathering what I can before even talking to them? What should I definitely not do? Most resources talk about filing her last year’s taxes but this goes wayyy back. How much time do I have to do this as creditors have 150 days to make their claims, is that the timeframe for the IRS or are they special? I appreciate any advice.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Banks Tried to Kill Crypto and Failed. So they are slowly Embracing it,"Banks have always been against Crypto and were previously  involved in spreading FUD but went successful . Now we can see Banks embracing crypto.

In 2014, as regulators in New York were exploring ways to control Bitcoin, executives at Wall Street’s biggest banks fretted that regulating cryptocurrencies would also legitimize them — and that could threaten the finance industry. So they tried to sow doubt.

At the World Economic Forum in Davos that year, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank, called Bitcoin a “terrible” store of value that was also being used for illicit purposes. At a meeting to discuss violations of Iran sanctions, H. Rodgin Cohen, the finance industry’s pre-eminent lawyer, warned the state’s regulators that the federal government was “very worried” about Bitcoin and its use. ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-thinks-bitcoin-worthless-171125840.html))

Those efforts failed. New York’s Department of Financial Services began issuing licenses for Bitcoin businesses in 2015.

There are now more than 75 million users of Bitcoin, up from around three million seven years ago, and the number of digital currencies has exploded. Globally, 220 million people use cryptocurrencies [source](https://crypto.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

Now the banking industry is racing to catch up. Banks want to compete in this new world and profit from it. Their approach is two-pronged: experimenting with cryptocurrency offerings and lobbying regulators to create rules that work in the banks’ favor. Some are offering cryptocurrency investments to their wealthy clients. Others are weighing trading desks for Bitcoin. JPMorgan even started its own digital currency in 2019.

Cryptocurrency start-ups are beginning to offer credit cards and loans. People and businesses around the world are embracing digital currencies at a rapid pace. Even governments are getting involved. El Salvador recently said it would [accept Bitcoin as legal tender](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/world/americas/bitcoin-el-salvador-bukele.html). And the Federal Reserve, following in the footsteps of central banks around the world, is evaluating [launching its own digital currency](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/business/economy/fed-digital-currency.html).

Digital currencies, which let individuals bypass banks in money transfers, sales and business collections by connecting people instantly without an intermediary, are threatening to take away that central role banks play.

stocks,What does a FED taper do to bond ETFs?,"TLDR: if someone could direct me to a “wiki” on monetary policy and it’s direct and implied effects (somewhere between an “ELI5” and PhD level), that’s be great.

TLDR2:  Are BND and TLT too risky right now?



I repeatedly read various conflicting news on interest rates, yields, and bonds… but it generally is emphasized—ad nauseam—that bond prices and yields have an inverse correlation.

So the premise is the FED will eventually hike rates.

1.  If/when that happens, doesn’t the price of *existing bonds* plummet?

2.  Doesn’t this make various bond ETFs worth less?

3.  I’m assuming ultra short-term bond ETFs approximate either inflation-adjusted value of dollar and/or approximate whatever the real rates of return are over time?

4.  Do 10 and 30 year bond rates change much when the FED “raises interest rates”?

5.  What—specifically—is actually raised when the FED hikes rates?  Is it the daily overnight rate, the 1-month, or…???

6.  So is what is actually happening overall that it is more expensive for *banks* to borrow money, so they borrow less, and therefore give fewer loans, and are able to charge higher rates themselves on loans/lines of credit?

7.  As it pertains to the stock market, is there a such thing as a company with zero debt?  (I realize virtually all companies have lines of credit to do things like fund payables accounts and what not… but I’m talking about zero revolving debt).

8.  How does the taper/eventual rate hike affect private syndicated loans (such as the ones where a bunch of mutual funds/hedge funds/private equity lend money to a business because they need an amount too great for banks and/or have lousy credit)?

9.  In corporate default/insolvency/bankruptcy/liquidations, what is the order of precedence is making payments to the following: corporate bond holders, bank creditors, employee payroll, and shareholders?

10.  Regardless of periods of low-to-hiked interest rates, doesn’t inflation exist in perpetuity over time, and the economy expand?  Are there any asset types which simply WILL go up in price over time?",finance

# [Dow futures are slightly lower ahead of the Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt;U.S. stock futures were muted in morning trading Wednesday as investors awaited a decision from the Federal Reserve on its move to start withdrawing the support it has been providing.
*****
&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 51 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were about flat and Nasdaq 100 futures rose slightly. All three major averages closed at record highs on Tuesday.
*****
&gt;Lyft jumped nearly 13% in after hours trading on better-than-expected third-quarter results. Zillow fell more than 11% after announcing it will close its home buying and flipping business. Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond rose on a partnership announcement with Kroger but the nearly 70% after hours surge that followed was likely fueled by a short squeeze.
*****
&gt;Activision shares tumbled, falling nearly 12% after it said the launch of two games would be delayed. The company also issued a weaker holiday outlook thought it did beat profit estimates for the quarter.
*****
&gt;Investors are focused on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce the timeline for a gradual reduction in its bond-buying program Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day meeting. They’ll also be listening for clues on when the central bank plans to raise interest rates.
*****
&gt;Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to stress that the reduction process known as tapering does not equate to tightening policy. Traders are pricing in a more aggressive path of interest rate hikes than the Fed is anticipating, so Powell may try to talk the market down.
*****
&gt;However, the Fed also will have to show that it is not ignoring the rise in inflation that has taken price increases to their fastest in 30 years.
*****
&gt;“With the S&amp;P 500 up 13 days in the past 15 ahead of the Fed beginning the process of draining the punch bowl, there certainly is a lot of confidence that strong earnings will overcome everything,” said Peter Boockvar, Bleakley Advisory Group’s CIO. “That said, global monetary tightening is taking place, not just with the Fed, and that should not be ignored either.”
*****
&gt;Equities rose Tuesday as companies continued to deliver strong earnings reports. Of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far this earnings season, 83% of them have beat consensus expectations, according to FactSet. That’s despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, commodity inflation, central bank policy and Covid risk.
*****
&gt;“Stocks are like the Energizer Bunny, as they continue to soar to new highs and show no signs of tiring,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “We understand all of the worries out there, but the bottom line is earnings continue to come in way better than expected and are helping to justify stocks are current levels.”
*****
&gt;In regular trading on Tuesday, the Dow rose 138.79 points to 36,052.63. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%. All three major averages closed at records for the third session in a row. The small cap Russell 2000 rose slightly and closed at an all-time high.
*****
&gt;Those highs are making a potential year-end rally more conceivable to investors.
*****
&gt;“The primary market trend appears higher,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist. “In the eight periods since 1950 where stocks were up more than 20% through October, as they are this year, the S&amp;P 500 tacked on additional gains by year end 100% of the time with an average gain of 6.2%.”
*****
&gt;Investors also will get a look at the jobs market when payrolls processing firm ADP releases its report on private employment at 8:15 a.m. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the report to show that companies added 395,000 positions for October.

personalfinance,Car dealer arranged auto loan from a different bank than mine,"I recently purchased I car from a dealer that is quite reputable in this area and also sells certified used cars from a specific brand. I was pre-approved for an auto loan from my bank (see below) and went to the dealer who also works with my bank (as per both my bank and the dealer). The dealer asked for the approval letter (and in the process asked what the interest rate was, but see below), I gave it to them. They said they will file another credit application because ""we always do that independent of whether you have already been pre approved"". My experian account then showed a new credit request through my bank and a different bank. Weird, why 2 requests? Mind you I had already had a credit request through my bank a week prior to that. So this was the second time I essentially requested a loan from my bank. Anyway, the finance person at the dealer then proceeded with the process and finalized the loan with the interest rate that was on the pre approval letter.

Now 2 things:

1. The pre approval was for a car (say car 1) that was cheaper, different make etc. Interest rate 4.59%. Coincidentally, I had contacted my bank the day before purchase to change the loan amount because I wanted a different car (car 2, a car that my seller was selling). Interest rate 4.34% now, but I was told to wait a day or 2 to get the approval letter. The bank person said I could to the dealer anyway because they work together, so I wouldn't have to wait for the new approval letter. I went to the dealer, didn't like the car and asked to see car 3. Car 3 is a little more expensive than car 2, and I proceeded with the purchase. I did not contact my bank to adjust the loan amount once more. The dealer saw 4.59% on the pre approval letter and did not believe me that the rate for car 2 was lower (""that doesn't make any sense""). I asked since they are working with my bank,, if they can't contact my bank. They said they'll ""take care of it, no worries"". The purchase was done with 4.59%.

2. And this pisses me off the most. Yesterday I received mail from a completely different bank, i.e. neither my bank nor the other bank that showed up in my experian account. Apparently, I got the loan from this bank. Nowhere on the papers did I see which bank I got the loan from, especially because despite of the 2 credit checks, I still thought that the dealer would go through with my bank, because why wouldn't they? I specifically brought it up, they asked for the letter from my bank, so the expectation was that I would buy the car with the loan from my bank. At no point did anyone mention this third bank.

It looks to me like the dealer did a backdoor deal with their bank with simply copying the interest rate that my bank had approved for car 1. I wonder if the 2 credit checks they sent yielded better interest rates than 4.59%. Because if not, why not tell me? Why make the process so intransparent. I feel deceived and lied to. I kind of rushed through the process because this is a car I wanted for my wife, but I work super long hours and 6x a week that I just wanted to be done with the purchase process. But, what this dealer, again they have a brand name in this area, did was not right.

Just wanted to rant here. Thank you for listening.",finance

Almost 700,000 people are holding Bitcoin in the Netherlands, which is 5% of the population.  (statistics are noted at the start of April) And almost 3,500,000 people are considering jumping on board. (Source: https://markteffect.nl/nieuws/150/ruim-3-5-miljoen-nederlanders-overwegen-te-investeren-in-bitcoin )

&gt; From 1 July 2021, ABN AMRO clients in the Netherlands with a total balance of more than 150,000 euros in their bank accounts will pay 0.5% interest on the amount above this threshold. This will apply to both private individuals and business clients. The interest on deposits under 150,000 euros will remain unchanged at 0%. 

[https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/04/rabobank-to-charge-customers-interest-on-savings-over-e100000/](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/04/rabobank-to-charge-customers-interest-on-savings-over-e100000/)

&gt; Rabobank has become the latest Dutch bank to charge customers if they have savings of above €100,000. The bank will now levy a rate of 0.5% on savings of over €100,000 from July 1. The change, the bank says, will impact on just 4% of its customers. ING and Volksbank have already introduced negative interest on savings above €100,000, while ABN Amro has a limit of €150,000. The move, Rabobank says, has been prompted by continuing low market interest rates.

[https://nltimes.nl/2021/04/11/ing-starts-charging-negative-interest-savings-eu-100000](https://nltimes.nl/2021/04/11/ing-starts-charging-negative-interest-savings-eu-100000)

&gt; ING customers with more than a hundred thousand euros in their account must pay a savings interest of 0.5% on this from 1 July. The bank will then lower the negative interest threshold from € 250,000 to € 100,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;The negative interest applies to both business and private ING customers with more than € 100,000 in their accounts. ING emphasizes that the interest applies per account and not per customer. Spreading money over several (savings) accounts at the bank would thus offer another chance to escape the negative interest rate. On the other hand, there are higher costs per month for holding multiple accounts.

personalfinance,Pay off low interest debt or build up savings?,"I currently have 22k in student loan debt at a 2.6-2.75% fixed interest rate.  In the upcoming year, I think I'll have somewhere in the ballpark of 20-25k in ""extra"" take home income.   So naturally the big question on my mind is: should I direct that income towards paying off the student loan or should I put that in savings?

With the interest rate so low I feel like it may not be worth paying off early, given the lost opportunity market in other higher yielding investments (although safe investments such as HYSAs / bonds have crap returns at the moment).  Right now my emergency fund is sitting at 2k, which is enough of a shield to keep me and my SO comfy, but it could definitely be better as that only just covers a month of rent.

The main thing I'm thinking about with the savings, other than a larger cushion / breathing room / ability to follow opportunities, is that I may be open to the idea of buying a house depending on some things that happen with my SO and I's life in the next year or two, so building this savings now could be good effort towards a down payment if we choose that option.  But, at the same time, I live in a VHCOL area (Washington DC), so it wouldn't get me anywhere close to 20% on a mortgage a year or two from now, which makes me more conflicted.  Also the idea of being debt free sounds quite nice, even if the debt is very low interest rate, and I'm guessing that paying it off earlier would be good for my credit (?).

Also just for context, this figure is after maxing out tax advantaged retirement accounts and I have no other debt.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-chairman-powells-odds-at-confirmation-complicated-by-trading-scandal-180153752.html



The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it would start slowing its pace of asset purchases, the first step in paring back its COVID-era easy money policies.
“In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the committee’s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases,” the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in its updated policy statement Wednesday.
Since the depths of the pandemic, the central bank has been directly buying U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to signal its support of the economic recovery. As of now, the Fed is pacing its purchases at a clip of about $120 billion per month.


But the Fed said Wednesday it will gradually slow the pace of those purchases by about $15 billion per month, as part of a plan to bring its so-called quantitative easing program to a full stop by the middle of next year. The taper will begin “later this month” and will continue at that $15 billion pace through December, although the FOMC clarified it could change the pace of taper as needed.


The Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook,” the FOMC statement reads.
The FOMC still maintained short-term interest rates at near zero. The decision on rates and taper was unanimous.
The Fed statement continued to double down on its view that high inflation readings will prove to be “transitory,” noting that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.”
Anticipation for a Fed taper has ramped up discussion over the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee’s next steps: raising interest rates.
Fed officials have made it clear that the timing of taper has no direct implications for the timing of raising short-term borrowing costs from the current setting of near zero.


But markets appear to be getting ahead of the Fed. As Powell and other Fed officials all but signaled that taper was coming, bets on interest rates reflected expectations for a more hawkish cycle of Fed rate hikes through 2022.



Headed into Wednesday afternoon’s announcement, Fed funds futures contracts priced in a strong chance that the central bank will have hiked rates at least three times by the end of 2022. Those expectations ratcheted up in the four weeks leading up to the Fed’s taper announcement.
The central bank’s next policy-setting announcement is scheduled to take place Dec. 14 and 15.
Still, Fed officials have emphasized the need to close the jobs shortfall of 5 million workers (compared to pre-pandemic levels), policymakers have insisted that near-zero interest rates should still support employment as it tapers.
“I do think it’s time to taper, and I don’t think it’s time to raise rates,” said Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Oct. 22.
In his press conference, Powell could field questions about whether or not the Fed's tapering plans are connected to future interest rate hikes. But Powell will also likely face questions regarding the central bank's ongoing trading scandal, as well as Powell's own updates on whether or not he's in consideration for another term as Fed chairman.",finance

The after incentives price does not seem that bad at all considering I will have \~100% electricity offset.  


My only issue is financing. While I can pay $12,411.47 in cash I rather keep that money and invest it elsewhere for higher returns but after looking at the state of solar financing I'm tempted on just paying cash.  


Project Solar offers 5.49% APR 20 year term through a partner and they also put a lien on the equipment, no dealer fees. However, it shows up as a lien on the property which can be removed if I need to refinance. As it stands, I don't need to refinance my house, I'm at a 2.75% interest rate 30 year mortgage.  


I could go with Project Solar and pay it off earlier than the 20 years. Payments after incentives: $85.31 / mo  


Or I could get a fixed rate HELOC for 4.5%, however I rather not go that route since I don't want to touch my homes equity (I just removed PMI and I am at 80% LTV).",energy

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Nov 3, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 3, 2021**

The market continued its march higher, with all three major indexes remarkably posting fresh intraday highs. The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve’s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. 

As was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. 

The Fed said in a statement, “In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. 

The best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed’s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.

Still, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that ""Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory."" In September, the Fed had said inflation was ""elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors."" 

In a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, “The inflation that we’re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It’s due to bottlenecks and it’s due to shortages and it’s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don’t see troubling increases in wages, and we don’t expect those to emerge.”

He reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, “It is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don’t think it’s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.”

On a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.

personalfinance,Advice on my financial plan?,"Throwaway account for privacy. 

After reading through the posts and wiki, this is what I’ve come up with… 

I inherited just under $500k recently. My plan is to invest $400k in Vanguard, through a financial advisor (.03% fee) with index funds and bonds (80/20) and keep the remainder, about $90k, in HYSA as an emergency fund/vacation fund/ home renovation money. 

I’m 32 years old, currently make $97k per year and have no trouble covering household expenses, paying bills, etc. I currently have $75k combined in savings and a retirement account through my job. 

No credit card debt, no student loans.

$145k on mortgage with 14 years left at 2.1% interest. 

$30k owed on a car, interest rate 2.8%, and 3 years left on loan. (Yeah, wasn’t a frugal choice)

Total expenses are about $1500/mo not including deductions taken from my pay for insurance, HSA, or retirement contributions. 

I plan on reducing my retirement (TSP) contributions at work from 15% to 5% in order to keep taking advantage of the employer match. I plan on using the growth of the $400k for retirement and college/ other expenses for one child. (Not having anymore kids.)

I don’t plan on moving homes any time soon, or ever. I get about a 3% raise every year and aim to retire as soon as possible, at 57. (After 30 years of civil service)

Is it silly to bank on this inheritance as my key to not continue substantially saving? Is there anything I could do “better”? Should I pay down some of the auto loan and refinance my car? I am of the mindset to enjoy life but prepare for the future, so I think I could probably try to save more but then again, I don’t really see the need. Thanks in advance!",finance

investing,Need help with retirement investing,"We started late in investing because life happened and early on we were burdened by student loan, credit card debt along with a ridiculously high mortgage and need advice. 

EDIT: my mistake⬆️,  we no longer have student loans,  credit card and high interest rate mortgage shown above.  I should have added this statement to my original post.  We ONLY have a mortgage at this time at $1600 month. 

We're both 56 years old and plan to retire at 67.  We plan to max out both ROTHs, HSA, will have $5800 in SS income and contributing up to the company match on 401k.

We'd like to invest in the following: FZROZ@60%, FZILX@20% and FSRNX@20% in one account.   Then VYM, SCHD, SDY and HDV for high yield dividend ETFs in another. 

We're concerned that we won't have enough growth if we go with the recommended FXIFX and/or FIHFX but we can't afford to lose it all either.  Any recommendations would be great.  We're super late to the retirement game but still want to live well.",finance
personalfinance,Property purchase - cash vs finance?,"Sold my old home and am moving to different property. I have no debt outside of my car payment which is $266/mo for my late model truck I had a nice down payment on. I pay $200/mo for phone service for us, and $180 for tv &amp; internet.   


I make $75,000 a year and my spouse makes $50,000. I have $190,000 in liquid from saving and sale of my old property. The purchase is $146,000. Yes, I could buy it out. But I'd rather not. I want to put about $60,000 in to the property.   


I am preapproved for 15 year mortgage at 2.5% and up to 30 years at 3.125% - conventional. With no money down.   


Would I be better off doing a large down payment to get my payment down? Putting my money in a high interest account and just making a larger monthly payment?   


I'm going to do cash with my contractor for the property improvements. I'll do as much of that as I can to keep costs down but there is a lot I cannot do nor do I want to deal with building inspectors on - lol..   


What do you all recommend? I hear the two extremes from the people I know. It's either ""Finance it all, thats a great interest rate."" OR ""Just pay cash for the whole thing then finance your property improvements if you need.""

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance - Jumbo with high LTV,"My original mortgage a couple years ago was for $760k at 4.25%. I got this mortgage with a bank that offered me 100% LTV through a special mortgage program offered to certain professionals (physicians, lawyers, etc.) with no PMI. 

My current loan balance is $720k and I’ve been looking to refinance to reduce the interest rate. Most lenders are not interested because LTV is above 90%. I have been in discussions with a few lenders willing to do a VA refinance as I’m eligible as a military veteran but the VA funding fee is 2.3% which is around 16.5k plus other closing costs. The best offers I’ve been given were 2.99%. Excellent credit and very high income so my debt to income is not an issue whatsoever. 

Would you consider refinancing if it would take you nearly 4 years to break even? 

Honestly I’m not sure how long I desire to continue living in this house but I could see myself being here 4-8 more years possibly. 

My spouse and I are leaning towards not refinancing at this point (mainly because she’s sick of how long the process has taken as we’ve been going through this since early-September).",finance
personalfinance,How to help my widowed mother with her living situation?,"Hey all -- having a bit of a problem. My father passed away last year and unfortunately didn't leave my mom with a lot of options. Where she stands right now...

* Unemployed, a little too old to be working and I doubt she can hold a job with her mental state anyways. Can't get her to apply for disability for any issues so it's just not happening
* $130k in the bank, at least $68k more on the way, maybe more but depends on estate 
* Her home needs some foundation work, but we're looking at a conservative home valuation of 250k-300k on her home assuming normal wear and tear apart from that. (it's older). Currently owes 130k on it, interest rate is insane at 8-9 percent. I have a structural engineer coming out soon since the companies that repair it have given me widely inconsistent data on what it would take to fix.
* not sure where she is going to be living in the longer term since she's getting older and this has a lot of stairs, but there's just no good places to move her right now I think and moving would be a lot of effort
* 800/mo in SS benefits. In a few years she can switch to my dad's benefits at $2000/mo at age 66ish.

About me

* ""Decently large"" investment portfolio. I could afford to pay off her house easily I imagine. I'm being vague on numbers for several reasons.
* Shitty job, kind of want to quit and take some time to find a new job so I don't want to burn up all my cash.
* live in an overpriced apartment, like the area i live but no real reason to stay up there if I quit in January.
* $70k in student debt

I've been tossing around a few ideas on what to do here. InFrankly I just want to get my mom ""stable"" so I can resume living my life. She's very hesitant to spend any money on the house and I'm not going to be able to do that unless I can guarantee some level of stability.

* I buy the house, then she stays there rent free. I'd just want to have some ownership stake in it. Downside here is that I pay capital gains on when the house is sold. (Not that bad I suppose). Alternatively I can live there -- either figuratively or literally. I basically have lived here for the last year and a half anyways 70 percent of the time.
* I buy the house, my mom pays rent. However, to be ""fair market value"" rent, I'd be charging about what she pays in mortgage payments today which sort of defeats the purpose
* We do nothing and just keep making payments on an 8 percent mortgage rate. I hate the idea of this where rates are so low. I then move her when that time comes. (I'm shooting for 2-3 years at least. I need to just watch her health)
* We cosign the loan together. This could potentially make it harder on me if I decide to buy a home in a few years
* I pay for the repairs on the house under the premise I get this money back someday or on the sale of the home (I have an estate attorney, I can always run it by him). She then does anything above.
* Other options???

Overall, I'm really lost. I'm desperately trying to avoid shoving my mom in a small crappy apartment. I have no problem supporting my mom, but I just want to be sure that I'm supplementing if I can vs full out lifeline support. (I know she'll be on government money as she gets older). This is something that continues to eat up my time and money. But I need to get my mom to some stable living arrangement  so I can go back to trying to live my life. I've given her a lot of my time to help her get through this, but it's sort of come at the expense of my mental health, physical health, and social life (I spend a majority of my time with her lately). Any advice or links I can read?

Thank you so much!",finance
stocks,Why the stock market doesn’t care about tapering,"&gt;The central bank said in an unanimous decision that it would pare its US$120 billion per month bond purchases by US$15 billion a month.

* There is plenty of time before it's gone

personalfinance,Question on Where to Invest Extra Money,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to start a dialogue on where to park any extra money I may get from my federal job, and why those particular places. This post is purely educational for me, and I would like to hear your thoughts regarding what you would do.

About me:

* I am a recent non-target Michigan college graduate in 2018 with a BA in Economics, and I am finishing up a part-time evening-led Master's in Accounting in December 2021.
* I have been working at my family business since I was 14. I got a corporate job in the automotive industry in 2018-2019, and I got laid off in 2019. Pivoting from there, I got a corporate job in the Department of Defense, and I have been there since 2019. Please note I continued to work at my family business on the weekends.
* I am currently saving up for my first house, looking for a place in metro Detroit, and I do not hold any student debt (scholarships, my own money from my job, and my wonderful parents that helped me out), credit card debt (paid monthly in full), or car loans (paid my car off in full in 2020).
* I generate a total of $87k in salary in 2021, and I max out my Roth 401k, Roth IRA, HSA Accounts, Emergency Fund, while I pay for my Masters and save for my house fund, leaving me roughly $25k (give or take) total for personal living expenses (which I manage with a zero-sum budget allocation).
* I have a net worth of roughly $423k (including gold ($6K), my car ($15k), house/emergency fund ($44k), and my retirement accounts ($358k))

I will get a larger sum of salary next year, and I was wondering where would you all invest the money? I want to keep my lifestyle in terms of money the same, and that means that I could invest the extra cash in the stock market. I was leaning towards cryptocurrency or tech index funds.

Thanks for the help",finance
personalfinance,How does federal income tax withholding work?,"I started a new job on 10/4/21. I had a sign on bonus which had a federal tax withholding rate of 22%. I understand that bonuses have a flat 22% withholding rate but I’m getting lost in the withholding rate on my regular wages.

I've had 2 paychecks for regular wages since I started, and I'm bit confused regarding the federal income tax withholding. I had submitted a W-4 and claimed 1 dependent (child). 

The first paycheck was for 3,076.93 with 0 pre tax deductions and 221.54 was taken off for federal tax withholding. This is about 7.2%. Where did this number come from?

The second was for 6,153.85 with 4,717.91 pre tax deductions and 0 was taken off for federal tax withholding. Why was there no federal income tax withholding on this pay check?

I was under the impression that withholding follows the actual
Tax brackets but this doesn’t appear to be the case.",finance
NFT,Metacats is launching on Polygon November 5th,"Hello, everyone! I would like to announce here on Reddit that my project, Metacats, will be launching on November 5th. It is a solo project where I have developed the art, web application, and smart-contract. It's been a while in the making, and I'm very happy to finally release it in just a few days.

The project consists of 10,000 randomly generated 8-bit cats created from over 1 million total possibilities. Each cat is randomized, and you will not know which you will receive until after minting. Currently I am working together with an artist to help develop the second generation of Metacats, which will adhere more to PFP standards and will also not be 8-bit!

One of the core utilities of the project is that I am going to donate 15% of all funds received to World Federation for Mental Health. This is one of few globally active groups dedicated to promoting advancement in awareness for mental health, as well as prevention of mental health disorders. I thought this was a great cause. As someone who has seen others suffer from mental health issues, as well as having dealt with it before myself, it's a cause that's very close to my heart.

personalfinance,"Refinancing for lower interest, down payment assistance","I am using a program my state offers for down payment assistance which gave me a high interest rate along with the interest rate being fixed. The down payment assistance is a separate loan for 15k while the mortgage is its own loan. I was told I have to ""do something"" with the down payment assistance loan if i wanted to refinance, which i guess means pay off. But what would my other options be? If i refinanced with a different agency, could I somehow consolidate these loans? I'm not entirely sure what my options are. My rate is 3.9% i have 3% equity on the home.

personalfinance,Should I Pay off Student Loans Now or Start Investing??,"I've been trying to research and figure this out for days but I think I just need some outside opinions!

Which option is better:

1. Pay off all undergrad student loans. Have small emergency savings left. Apply for new loans for grad school.
2. Pay off some undergrad student loans. Have larger emergency savings and slowly begin investing. Apply for new loans for grad school.
3. Wait to pay off undergrad student loans until after grad school. Have healthy emergency savings and invest heftily.

\---

Since all of my student loans from undergrad have been in forbearance and I've been living super frugally, I currently have enough money in my savings account to pay those loans off completely! If I paid them off completely there would probably be just enough left over for a small emergency savings stash.

I've been considering going to grad school which would involve taking out more loans. My main question is whether or not I should pay off my undergrad loans (either completely or knock a hefty chunk out of them) since I'll hopefully be getting more loans for grad school.

If I don't pay them off now and wait until after grad school then I could start investing a big chunk of my savings now. I'm worried about the amount of interest my undergrad loans would earn if I just leave them sit there while back in school. But if my new investments earn more than the interest on the loan then it shouldn't matter, right?   
My student loans are consolidated but I don't know what the interest rate is. Unless I'm missing it, the site just hows 0.00 because the loans are in forbearance. If I remember correctly from before COVID I think it was like 4 or 5%.

Also if there's some other option that I didn't think of or if this isn't the right place to ask this question please let me know!",finance

24. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM.

25. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a “what if” scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised.

29. Brazil is looking to follow the El Salvador example and accept crypto as legal tender with a new bill to be voted within days.

37. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle.

49. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)

personalfinance,401K Investing: How does my plan sound?,"Hey all,

Recently I just started a new job and I need to pick my 401K funds. Unfortunately all of this is super new to me. Little about me, I am currently 24M making about \~125k base salary. My company offers both Roth and Traditional but I am planning on doing a Roth. I checked out vanguard investment risk quiz, and am thinking of putting 10% bond and 90% stock. Here are the funds offered through Vanguard:

&amp;#x200B;

|Fund Name:|Expense Ratio:|Yield since inception (year, yield)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Vanguard Retirement Savings Trust III |0.3%|(2001, 3.15%)|
|Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund|0.05%|(2001, 4.14%)|
|Vanguard Balanced Index Fund|0.07% |(2000, 7.15%)|
|Vanguard Equity Income Fund |0.28%|(1988, 10.33%)|
|Vanguard Institutional Index Fund |0.035%|(1990, 10.60%)|
|Vanguard U.S. Growth Fund |0.38%|(1959, 11.30%)|
|Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund|0.12%|(2001, 10.52%)|
|Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund |0.07%|(2011, 13.67%)|
|Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund|0.05%|(2001, 10.95%)|
|Vanguard Explorer Fund|0.41%|(1967, 9.94%)|
|Vanguard Cash Reserves Federal Money Market Fund|0.10%|(1989, 2.96%)|
|Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund |0.2%|(2000, 5.32%)|
|Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund|0.23%|(1978, 8.18%)|
|American Funds EuroPacific Growth Fund|0.82%|(last 10 years, 10.24%)|
|Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund|0.11%|(2010, 5.99%)|
|Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund|0.05%|(2000, 9.97%)|
|Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Fund|0.15%|(2010, 11.39%)|

* There were other target retirement funds but I just picked the one where it mostly represents when I might want to retire.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Plan:

10% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund

20% Vanguard U.S. Growth Fund

10% Vanguard Explorer Fund

30% Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Fund

10% Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund

20% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. How is this general break down? Is there any fund that I should switch out for a different fund?
2. What is the difference between small-cap value index fund vs small-cap index fund?
3. Is it better to just go all in target retirement funds since the returns seems a lot more promising and the ER is pretty low.
4. It seems like none of these funds track the S&amp;P 500, should I set my IRA to track the S&amp;P 500 instead?
5. Lastly, is it better to switch Vanguard Total Bond Market with something like Vanguard Equity Income Fund or Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund? It seems like both funds are fairly secure and also provide higher return than total bond market.

Thanks!!!",finance

XRP,The letter I sent to all my Federal Representatives as a member of the Class action lawsuit against The SEC,[removed],cryptocurrency
Ripple,The letter I sent to all my Federal Representatives as a member of the Class action lawsuit against The SEC,"While a degree of governmental oversight is necessary in even the most capitalist of free markets, Picking winners and losers in the manner the SEC has is indefensible. The current lawsuit the SEC has leveled against Ripple has undeniably hurt the very people that this Federal governmental body was set up to protect. As my duly elected representative it is your duty to represent the will of your constituents. I therefore ask that you act to make this entirely frivolous lawsuit the last of it's kind by the SEC. The claim that XRP is a security is Ludacris on the face of it, and even the argument that XRP used to be a security, but no longer is one; shows an absurd double standard that makes clear a bias when compared to Ethereum's example. It is beyond my own mental capacity to see how the SEC is at all acting within a reasonable standard. Therefore I ask you to act. End this lawsuit if it is within the legal authority of your office to do so by any direct or indirect means. Regardless, I do expect you to contribute to such an effort at the very least. To do so is not all I request of you however. Indeed, What I would truly desire, ideally is a complete and independent investigation into this matter. I'd be rather plead at a complete audit of the SEC frankly speaking.

&amp;#x200B;

I encourage you to look into this matter regardless of partisan divide. I don't see how it could be a partisan issue personally, or rather I see no reason for it to be. Let me assure you that with over 50,000 Americans joining the class action lawsuit against this affront to normal American investors, that a lack of action in this matter issue will most certainly cost you my vote. You have my word on that, and if I pride myself on anything it's that I am honest, even when the truth is painful. As a moderate I'm sure I can convince a great many of my friends in Illinois who are on both sides of the aisle not to vote for those who have so little concern for the average American investor. For both large and small investors have been hurt by this I can assure you.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that you consider my words as a reasonable elected official, being aware of the importance of power residing in those who are elected by the will of the people. Please be aware the SEC is not an elected body, and that you as a member of congress are the only means by which the average citizen citizen can exercise and control of this corrupt and abusive unelected body. As it has done the opposite of it's duty I expect action, and not excuses. As a member of the aforementioned Class action lawsuit, I am perhaps minimally biased, but I ask you to be aware that The SEC is most certainly biased in this matter as well. If you choose to take both these perspectives as imperfect, please seek an unbiased explanation of these proceedings. I do expect be treated as an infallible source of information, but if we were to disagree fundamentally on this issue be aware That your reasons for doing so must be impeccable for you to retain my vote in the future.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,What will happen to crypto after CBDCs are introduced?,"What do you guys think will happen to crypto after CBDCs are introduced? I don’t think it will hurt bitcoin much if at all. Because it has so much institutional investment already. 


But I do think that it will be very bad for DeFi. Unregulated stablecoins absolutely will not come away unscathed. That’s for sure. Look at how many regulations and how much red tape there is for traditional banking. You may think that DeFi fixes this. But the regulations and red tape are not a bug, they are a feature. It’s by design to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. DeFi proponents claim that it will reduce friction in banking but the friction is absolutely by design. 

I do not think you will be allowed to use non KYC stablecoins in the future. If you go to a bank today, you need an ID to sign up. And banks need to be compliant. There’s a reason offshore bank accounts are called offshore, they can’t legally operate in the USA and not report to the government. The government isn’t in the habit of reducing regulations. In fact it’s quite the opposite. I think physical cash is a thing of the past, and CBDCs will be forced on us to everybody’s entire transaction history is on record. And a CBDC will absolutely be freezable by the IRS/Fed. 



That’s why I’m bullish on monero because crypto won’t survive if it tries to be compliant. Because it’s impossible to be both compliant and decentralized. What crypto right now currently complied with AML/FATF regulations? When govts crack down monero will be the least hurt because it’s already a de facto criminal coin.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Inflation will ruin you in the long term. Invest in Crypto while you can.,"Inflation is at its 30 year high in the US. It's way worse in some other places and it's not going to get better anytime soon. The worst thing is, inflation compounds. Ever looked at those compound interest charts from retirement savings accounts? it's the same thing with inflation but in reverse. You're losing money at a rapid pace.

Investing in a solid Crypto project can literally be a lifesaver for you. Not only do you get better interest rates on Crypto and better returns, you are also safe from inflation. The 6% USD inflation rate this year might look small today, but when this inflation is compounded year on year, you're losing  a huge chunk of your savings and your salary.

Just a few hundred dollars into Crypto today is most likely going to be hundreds of thousands of dollars in a decade. Do yourself a favor and invest in Crypto.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Husband is being poached for a job across the country…tons of opportunity but not sure it’s the right move for us. What would you do?,"Hi! My engineer husband is being poached HARD by a startup company in Silicone Valley that he works with in his current position. A startup = instability in my mind, but this company did just land a hundreds of $$millions contract with a major national retailer, so signs are pointing to it being a successful startup anyway. 

My husband currently makes a $100k base salary with bonus potential up to $130k - he has been averaging around $115k annually. I am a SAHM 75% of the time to our 1.5 year old and am pregnant with our second. I do have a unique gig 25% of the time where I pull in about $40k annually. Unfortunately this gig is hyper-local so that income would be gone if we moved. 

Right now, we live in a medium COL Midwestern city - however I’d say our personal situation is low COL. We have no debt besides our mortgage, no daycare, we are able to max out our Roth’s each year, and my husband puts away about 12% into his 401(k). We bought a house 6 years ago, so although prices have skyrocketed in our neighborhood, our mortgage is very low as is our interest rate. In the last 2 years since he got his current job (after he graduated with his masters so it was a big jump), we’ve been able to save up a $25k emergency fund, create a $20k stock portfolio, started savings accounts for our kiddos, and sunk $50k into our house for necessary renovations (roof, windows, siding, furnace). 

During negotiations with this startup, he said he would need a base salary of at least $300k to make a move like that worth it for us. He found a cost of living calculator online and that’s the number it literally spit out. It would be compensating for our giant jump in cost of living, my loss of income entirely, and sweet enough to not be a lateral move for us, frankly. 

They told him he was crazy and that no engineers make that out there. The best they could do is a base salary in the high $100ks with another $100k of company shares, which if it IPOs eventually (not sure if I’m saying that right) could make us very wealthy. 

It’s tough because on one hand this job could by itself be a great thing with the shares aspect if it takes off, especially because he’d be getting in early. And it also could open up a ton of other opportunities for him - I mean it’s Silicone Valley and he’s an engineer. 

But he’s not a single guy, and we are very comfortable right now. It would be such a drastic change, especially considering our mortgage alone for an equivalent house out there would be 5x more. I don’t even know if the startup has a benefits package, and with a birth on the horizon plus two small children, that’s super important too. 

Is the answer here obvious? What would you do?

Edited to add: I forgot this bit, but my husband currently works from home which we love love love having him around all the time. However working remotely would not be an option at the startup, so he’d be looking at a commute up to an hour each way every day which we don’t love

Edited to add #2: wow, thank you so so much for all the input! I didn’t expect this to blow up so much and I really appreciate each and every point that’s been made. If you couldn’t already tell from the tone this post had, I’m personally not at all on board with this potential move, and the responses here have given me a lot of validation for feeling that way. I’ll be showing my husband this thread later and I know he will appreciate all the input too! 

Also LOL: between my pregnancy and my toddler my brain isn’t the most on point these days so thanks for the many reminders that Silicone is much different than Silicon! 🙃",finance

CryptoCurrency,From bank account to crypto - here is my story,"This is the story of how crypto changed my life. I'm almost 30 and actually barely saved any money until I was 25. Then things changed in my life and I realized that it doesn't make sense for me to live from day to day and spend everything on material things. I need to plan for the longer term was my thought.

At that point I had heard something about crypto, but I didn't look into it further. That's why I started just depositing regularly into my savings account at my bank. After about a year and displeasure with the low interest rates, I decided to switch to fund savings. It wasn't much better, as the bank's fees ate up a lot of my gains. Nevertheless, I stayed with this option until June 2021.

However, since I had been dealing with crypto more regularly since December 2020, I decided to finally buy some in the summer of 2021.

So I deposited a small amount on a trading platform. I was hooked immediately. How could I have ignored this for years? I switched to an exchange after a short time because the fees were much lower. And I started reading this subreddit. 

Fast forward to today:
I stopped daytrading (too much stress), started holding+DCA and even staking since a few days. I even took little peeks at whitepapers. It is still a long way to understand the technique behind it. But it is getting better day by day.

To sum it up:
I haven't made much profit yet (still much more than at the bank) but it's all green. So everything is good. I have learned from the mistakes I made in the first months. Also because of all of you. The information and exchange of opinions that goes on here is incredible! Thanks to each and every one whose posts have been a help to me!

I couldn't be more excited about what is going to happen the next few years! Bullish!

personalfinance,Should I Refinance Public Student Loans to Private?,"I wanted to seek some guidance and avoid making a potentially dumb move. 

With student loan repayments starting soon, I’m considering taking my $47,283.69 in public student loans and consolidating them with a private company for a lower payment and ultimately pay them off faster. Obviously, they’ve been in forbearance with the pause on student loan payments, but at $76k/year of gross pay, my payments are something like $700 a month and it’s just way too high on top of other bills. This is an income driven repayment plan that I renew each year. I am not sure what my interest rate is, but I want to say it’s at 5%. 

My concerns are two things - they’d lose the public protections if they did go private and if student loan forgiveness ever happens,I’d probably miss out. 

Not to get political, but I don’t see student loan forgiveness happening. Biden has repeatedly stated that he doesn’t believe he has the power (he did order a review from the Department of Education back in February, but we never hear anything after that) and the Senate would never allow it (I can’t see Democrats picking up any seats in the midterms and the two constant hold outs won’t go for it). 

So what do you think? Refinance and get a lower payment or keep making those high payments and hope something changes? It’s a gamble either way.",finance

# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.
*****
&gt; The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&amp;P 500′s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.
*****
&gt; Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.
*****
&gt; Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%
*****
&gt; And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.
*****
&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “The Fed’s tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,” said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.
*****
&gt; “The Fed’s tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,” he added.
*****
&gt; The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program “later this month.” This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it’s provided since the pandemic took hold.
*****
&gt; The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.
*****
&gt; “The Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today’s meeting, which is why we aren’t seeing a ‘taper-tantrum 2.0,’” said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.
*****
&gt; ″[W]e’re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,” said Oanda’s Craig Erlam. “The economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,” he added.
*****
&gt; On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week’s number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.
*****
&gt; October’s hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.

Forex,BOE keeps interest rates unchanged 🇬🇧,,finance
stocks,It’s good that the FED starts the taper,"I believe it’s for the greater good that the FED has decided to start the taper. The $120B that we’ve seen in treasurys and mortgage-backed securities has started to feel unnecessary. 

Even though what it has done for the stock market, the constant buying of financial securities would have really started to hurt if the purchases would have kept going. We would have seen even bigger inflation than before and things would’t have looked ”transitory” any longer.

Sure, we’ll face interest rate hikes after the taper is over which will likely be around July of 2022. There will most likely be one rate hike in 2022, around fall. 

This will naturally hurt stock valuations because companies cannot expand their businesses as well as before because they need to spend larger amounts of money towards interest rate payments, thus limiting the amount of innovation and R&amp;D they can do. 

But IMO, this is good. Investing is for the long haul. Having huge amounts of money printed is not sustainable. It might hurt short-term, but ultimately, it’s all good. 

The taper and rate hikes are important if we want **long-term** success. Once taper is done the company’s ability to make money will be the biggest thing to drive the stock market up, not the amount of money FED pumps.

**Always think long-term. That’s investing.** 

That’s my two cents.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Taking out a loan for stable coin returns,"You should only invest what you're willing to lose. I get that. But is there really an issue with borrowing money from a bank for a loan, buying USDC or some other stable coin, staking it on somewhere that offers pretty nice returns (like 8% on celsius) and using the interest earned to pay it back?

Of course the interest rate on the loan would have to be lower than the 8% in this example but hypothetically this should work out right? And yes your total 'profit' would just be the interest gained from staking subtract the interest paid/owed on the loan. So not a lot of profit. But it seems to open the door for guaranteed gains which is a short step from just scaling up.

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance,"This is my first time refinancing a home in Florida and I'm very, very close to taking the final steps to select a lender. I'm seeing interest rates ranging between 2.875% / 2.974% APR to 3.25% / 3.264% APR with closing costs landing about $4k+. I have a ridiculous 5% on my current loan and I'll be able to remove the PMI so it's going to be win on anything.

The best rates that I've seen are from companies that I've never heard of, like Success Mortgage Partners, Better Mortgage Corporation or American Pacific Mortgage. US BANK and the other banks/credit unions in my area that I've talked to are between 3.033% to 3.32% APR.

I'm beginning to think that I'm always going to find bad reviews for lenders regardless of the company. Has anyone heard of those three lenders and how was your experience? Does it *really* matter which lender I pick as long as the numbers line up and they're not in the news for fraud?",finance
personalfinance,Need Some Advice About Personal Loan For Buying A House- Don't Know Where To Start...,"Hello All...  I'm in need of some advice about what to look for and/or ask about and just where to go to seek out some sort of extra financing for a house and hoping some of the fine folks here could point me in the right direction.

To make a long story as short as possible...

I'm disabled (agoraphobia mainly) and have lived with my parents my entire life.  For almost a decade, I took care of my Dad as his health started failing him (mobility issues, Alzheimer's, dementia).  Some years back, his health took a steep decline in short order and I could no longer care for him properly on my own and he needed to enter a nursing home.  We tried our best, but after losing Dad's social security income to pay for the nursing home, my Mom had to let our house go into foreclosure (that was in September of 2019).  My Brother was living with us at the time (post divorce - she cheated) and didn't have the greatest credit, but him and I together were able to get a FHA loan to purchase a house for the three of us, so we all moved here.  Said Brother now tells us he wants to live on his own.  Current house doesn't really work for just Mom and I and we'd really struggle to afford it with.  The mortgage would be doable, but all the utilities and odds and ends would make things really tight.  Brother can easily afford it on his own.

So, Brother is doing a home equity refinance in just his name and should be able to get $50k - $60k (huge uptick in the market since we bought it), which he is going to give us to get a new home for Mom and myself.  Aside from everything within out budget in the area being in a 55+ community and my needing to obtain approval to live there with my Mother, the big issue we're running into is being a bit short financially.  We're close and can probably handle the purchase price on a home, but everything needs a little work (ie new AC (needed here in Florida), roof, floors, etc...).  So, we'll probably need some sort of small personal loan or something like that and I have no idea what to look for or where to look for it.  Some info...

- Live in Florida
- Mom is mid 60s.  Good income, but bad credit (594 according to Experian) thanks for foreclosure.  A few credit cards and a shared auto loan with no missed payments.
- I am late 30s and disabled.  Great credit score (835), but only income is SSI (under $800 a month).  One credit card and shared auto loan with no missed payments.  Do have a mortgage in my named now (shared with Brother), but that will come off my credit report once Brother completes refinancing.
- Is my understanding that Mom would qualify for FHA loan come next September, but Brother is really NOT keen on waiting that long for us to move out.
- Income wise, Mom makes about $3.3k net per month with working from home part time and social security.  I get $794 in SSI.
- Car loan is $257 per month and in both my and my Mom's name.  Outstanding debt on that is approximately $15K right now.  I only have $500 in credit card debt on the one card.  Mom has approximately $2.5K in credit card debt, but one that gets paid off each month that we use for groceries and household stuff (usually about $700 a month).
- Should have somewhere between $50k and $65k in cash from refinance and Mom's savings to put towards new home.
- Going to need probably between $10k and $20K to really compete in today's market and put towards any alterations new home will need.
- Realistically, we will have no problem paying back that size of loan with a decent interest rate over five years or more.

I don't want to hamper either of our credit ratings by just applying willy-nilly, so, given our situation, is there any hope of us obtaining any type of loan?

If so, what do I want to ask for and where would I want to go to seek it out?

I would be very grateful  for any advice or suggestions anyone here could offer.

Thank You Very Much",finance

btc,One Bridge,"Hello everyone! As many of you know we have been working on a bridge that connects SmartBCH to Ethereum for some time, we are still solving a few challenges before we move it to mainnet. Recently a similar bridge led by anonymous developer Yumeko, that uses the same open-source code and also connects SmartBCH to Ethereum appeared. The community quickly pointed out several issues on the security of this other bridge and drama ensued on the Telegram groups. Shomary, an amazing developer, recently joined Yumeko bridge, apparently unaware of the early issues with it. And now we risk dividing our community among two bridges. I don’t want to go again over the previous issues, instead, we can focus on moving everyone into a common goal.

**First I think is important we understand why having two competing bridges is an EXTREMELY bad idea**

Two competing bridges will divide liquidity, they will also create confusion and make things more difficult for users. As an example, if ETH is bridged by two different bridges, we end up having 2 tokens at the SmartBCH side that represent the same Asset on the Ethereum side. So then DEXs need to decide which one to list, and users that get them will also have to learn from which bridge it came. One ETH token won't be like the other. Liquidity is also divided into different DEX LPs of the same token. Perhaps you could add a letter to represent each token bridge, say yETH, but that still creates confusion and still divides liquidity. In previous discussions, we saw a great opportunity on just calling the bridged tokens by their local names, just as BCH remains BCH while on SmartBCH, ETH should remain as ETH while bridged on SmartBCH. We keep things simple and make things easy for everyone.

I recently had the opportunity to quickly discuss some of these things with Shomary over a Reddit post and thankfully I can see we agree on most things! So let's first go over the 99% of things that I think most of us would agree on:

# What we can all agree on

1.- **Just like Sha-bridge is not a business, the bridge to Ethereum and others should NOT be a business, but a decentralized protocol**. It should not seek to gain profits from users, instead, it should just be a service for users. A business out of a bridge could for example at any moment decide to change rates against the better interests of the community, or simply ""sell the bridge"". A business running a bridge also becomes a target for regulators and gov agencies. That would not happen if the bridge is simply a decentralized protocol. This is extremely important, and a make it or break it feature. The bridge needs to be for everyone and always have fees as small as possible. Not a product but a decentralized protocol.

2.- **Communications should be open**, work for a decentralized project should not happen behind closed doors.

3.- **It needs to be decentralized and it needs to be secure.** Centralized companies will become targets of governmental agencies and hackers.

4.- **It needs to be for everyone. Fees should be as low as possible.** Low fees will attract new users from multiple other chains. More transactions means stronger network effect and also increase the value of the base layer, for multiple reasons including reduction of the total supply.

# The one thing we don't agree on?

After Shomari confirmed that it is not a good idea to depend on an anonymous dev, we already agree on 99% of how the bridge should work. There is just ONE thing left we need to agree on and that will result in a unique decentralized and much stronger bridge. **We need to agree on who the Federators should be! If we can agree on this everybody wins!**

To decide on Federators first we need to understand what makes a good Federator. For each Federator you will want someone that is very technically capable so that it does not depend on third parties for updates, configuration, and the like. Even good companies get hacked, imagine having a federators in the hands of someone with only a moderated level of server management knowledge.

**Federators should have aligned interests**, they do not benefit directly from fees on the bridge, but from the movement of value into the chain. They could eventually be able to cover part of the costs of bridging reducing the costs for users. Yet they benefit from the increased activity on the ecosystem. Example more users, would mean higher volumes on Dexes, or just higher transaction volume. Hint. Miners.

About the number of Federators, while the Yumeko bridge proposed a high number of Federators as a way to improve over its previous versions of the same bridge, there is actually an optimal number. The reason to avoid a number too high is that it greatly increases costs that ultimately need to paid by users; while at the same time it does not necessarily improve security. More people just means a bigger surface attack.

**Example of great federators for an efficient 3 out 5 signatures Federation system:**

1. Mining pools
2. SmartBCH devs
3. Bridge DAO
4. Coinflex
5. Bitcoin .com

We already have a level of trust in these possible federators, and they have aligned interests to maintain the bridge secure, and accessible to everyone. Remember these are just examples, not necessarily they will want to participate, yet it is my hope they will consider it.

**3 out of 5 signatures will be needed for a bridge transaction to be completed**. There is No need to reinvent the wheel, a similar system is already in place between BTC and RSK.

**Yumeko bridge proposed to use 10 or even more members as Federators. Not a good idea!** This result in higher costs for each transaction because when a token is moved, each one of the Federators needs to do a transaction on Ethereum to sign that the transaction did happen (consider Ethereum transactions costs \* number of Federators). Imagine having 10 or 20 Federators, and then someone wanting to move say 10 USD worth of value. Do you see how the math does not work here? Besides an increased attack surface, that is still vulnerable to civil attacks. Further, funds to cover the transactions are directly accessible by the Federator on each server. Consider thousands or even millions of transactions happening.

**Also, the option proposed by the Yumeko bridge of Voting to select federators (to solve their previous version of the bridge) is a bad idea.** **It adds unnecessary complexity and creates new attacks vectors, including civil attack types.** Again, the federation needs to be simple, well established, and with aligned interests.

***Those giving security to the bridge should have a lot of experience with security.***

# Moving forward

If we can agree on the correct validators, we will have created a single and stronger decentralized bridge! With safely deployed contracts by a well-known community dev and trustworthy validators, we only have one detail left. The front end, or the website that we use to access the bridge. Yumeko registered tokenbridge.cash, users would have to trust Yumeko to remain honest. Josh proposed using IPFS as an alternative, a great idea! Yet there is even a simpler solution. The bridge is a decentralized protocol so anyone can access the contracts. You can trust Yumeko site if you want but you don’t have to! Users could bring up their own web3 front ends to the contracts, swaps could add the bridge web3 code, and interact directly with the contracts. Devs can build mobile phone apps. No need for permission! no need to trust anyone! The contracts are audited, the deployment is secure, and Federators understand security.

I really hope that our comments are well received by the Yumeko bridge team, we look forward on helping create the most decentralized, secure, and efficient bridge on crypto!

Regardless of where you stand on its role in climate change, certainly the kind of dialectical approach is what breeds better technology. And often I think objections are set aside a bit easily, even if nuclear has a good track record of health effects per unit of energy output. Attacking ""the greens"" or fuming over ""regulations"" will not do.

People point to LNT being untenable, however, even if that would be true, that debate is already too late into the process of disaster. If these three points could be addressed more fundamentally, I'm sure that would go a long way in public acceptance.

For safety, for example, how would you prevent radioactive particles from becoming airborne and spreading, even in a worst case scenario? I read up briefly on molten salt reactors, and their solution is very attractive (apparently, the fissile material hardens in place when it comes into contact with the outside air). On the other hand, the union of concerned scientists [report](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/ucs-es-AR-3.21-web_May%20rev.pdf) isn't satisfied with that, and asserts the corrosive properties of the salt make it very unsafe (it gets 3 minuses in the report). Also, it begs the question on what non-molten salt designs propose to fundamentally protect the unsuspecting population from harm, even in the worst case scenario of military or terrorist attacks, for example.

As for proliferation, seemingly civilian nuclear power is a less attractive option than specialized reprocessing. But, again, in a worst case scenario of, say, a group of rogue actors, how would the new designs protect against proliferation? How would breeder reactors be guarded from making bombs more easily?

As for waste, the common objection is storage capacity needed for tens of thousands of years. Others, however, say this could be reduced to a few hundred years. Is this true for every design?

I sincerely appreciate any answers. I would also like to be pointed towards any resources for the layman, such as books or websites, that addresses concerns objectively and at length.

personalfinance,Is buying a car really stupid for my situation?,"I want to purchase a new car in the next 6 months. I am 21 and in College, with no student debt, living with my parents.

vet,There is a stray mom cat that I have been feeding and I am worried that I might be getting too involved,"In my apartment building there are a lot of stray cats but one in particular was very friendly ; She would get close to us, she would let us pet her and she never ran away when we got close . 

She ended up getting pregnant twice : the first time someone moved the kids and we never saw them again and the second time someone moved the kids again but thankfully they time me and my family took them in fed them and made them pee until we found her after that we gave them back to her and she recognized them so we let her take them 

but the thing is we got REALLY attached to them, so since then we started ; leaving them food all the time, making sure they always have food ( now that they are 1.5 month old we get them dry cat food ) , water and milk and playing with them. We even bought them a litter box for peeing and a mouse for them to play with .

 I read online that mother cats stop their kittens from drinking from them so they learn how to hunt but here comes the problem we keeping leaving food right infront of them all the time which could mean that they never have to hunt which means they might never learn how to hunt which could mean that they might not be as strong as the other cats or that they could starve.

So am getting too involved and should I leave them less food",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,To hold or upgrade to a new home now?,"My husband and I currently own a 2/1 condo in an extremely walk-able, close to everything neighborhood in Arlington, VA. We bought 4 years ago and since then have completely renovated the entire condo, including expanding the kitchen, all new flooring, and a new bathroom. We had estimated that we were going to stay here for an additional 5-10 years, and recently put 40k in Index Funds. However, within the last few weeks both our jobs have gone fully WFH, and we are feeling pinched in the space. We currently have around 40k additionally in different savings, that we could pull from, on top of the index funds.

The big question is whether we jump on a cooling market (relative in the DC metro area), and lower interest rates to buy a larger place now. We would sell our current condo, estimating about 100k to put towards the new home, and most likely need to cash out our different accounts to cover closing/ selling costs. OR should we hold for another year or two, build up our savings more (so as to not have to cash out the index funds), and gamble that interest rates don't jump too much.

The housing market in this area is insane, so I'm worried that holding could mean both interest hikes and houses that are currently in our range growing outside of our range. We both have very stable jobs, and save around 35k annually on top of maxing out retirement accounts, so while emptying out our savings isn't ideal, we are not too concerned about it. Appreciate any advice you all can give!",finance

personalfinance,Credit inquiries,"Hi, I was just wondering how much credit inquiries actually impact things? Specifically new credit cards or refinancing a car loan.

For more context, my current CK score is 634. I'm in credit card debt, I'm shooting for 680 to get into a 0 APR balance transfer card, I dont qualify for one now. 

I already have 8 inquiries on my report (I read they fall off after 2 years, in that case 2 will be gone in Jan and 1 more in feb). will adding 1 or 2 more impact things? I assume it will take a few months of me paying off my cards to qualify for a balance transfer deal, is that enough time for the impact of another inquiry to settle? 

Other than adding another credit card to help build my credit back up, I don't plan on taking out any loans in the near future (just bought a house in april). However, I am considering helping my fiance by refinancing her car payment with her as a cosigner, but I'm scared that they might deny us and then I have another inquiry on my credit report.. I was also considering refinancing my own car for a lower interest rate (if I even qualify for one), my current rate is 5.86%. Hers is more like 18%.

Also a bonus question: I have a store CC that I'd paid off but it has an annual fee, I want to cancel it but how bad will it impact? It's 5k limit and just over 1 year old. It's not my oldest credit card.",finance
personalfinance,Should I be looking to put savings towards a home or paying off loans?,"Hello, 

I'm wanting to plan ahead and have recently moved to across the country (From IL to PA) to pursue an amazing job. So far I love the job and think I'll be a good fit here. I plan to stay here long as possible or at least 5-10 years. 

Prices for renting/housing is insane right now and we currently pay 1800 + Utilities for a 2BR 1BA condo. I have to let our landlord know by June 1st 2022 if we want to renew our lease or not. 

I'm 24 and making 71k salary with good growth through my company annually (15-20% average pay raise per year) I'm planning to pursue a First Time Buyer program for my first house in the area, so my down payment can be low but still would have to pay PMI or a 5% down conventional loan. 

I have been dating my girlfriend for 4 years and we have talked about marriage and our future. I know about the whole dont buy a house without married, but she has a lot of loans and I can qualify for some beneficial first time buyer programs if I purchase alone and then have her as renting the house. She makes 46k currently but looking to change her career. We split expenses as best we can but I help out more since I make more. 

A financial institution prequalified me for 300k without a problem. Based on assets and credit (only 15k car loan with 1% APR and 11k student loans with 4.5% APR). The 300k pre qualified loan would require minimum 3% down-payment. 

Houses are more expensive in my work area but looking to move little farther away to commute to save on mortgage cost. If I am able to find a home at ~200-250k, my mortgage, PMI, taxes, and other expensive for it would be approximately $1200-1500 a month. But most houses we are looking at is 300-350K with the current housing prices. 

This being said, I can pay off minimums on my car and student loans and save enough to have 15k by March 1st. Going to get another prequalifed loan at that time (hopefully cheaper housing by then) and purchase a home in that range which is ~25% cheaper compared to my rent which isn't gaining equity. 

So should I look to purchase a home with this plan next year between March-May and get out of my renting lease or stay another year renting to save more money? 

Factors to consider is housing prices, interest rates, equity of house vs renting, and whether I should save up more money or not. Other option is just pay off my loans but I feel those aren't that high of interest rate. I am no rush to pay off my car and I could pay more towards loans. 

One last thing is before my salary increases annually, I can qualify for some first time buying programs for country to save money on closing costs and lower interest rate. I'm exploring this option as well.
I just don't like renting and would rather own a home in every way, shape, and form. I use to fix up rentals and flip houses with my dad, so I have experience fixing up houses that need more work. 

Based on this information, any advice or comments are appreciated! I want to be prepared come Spring.",finance

- I might have kids sometime down the line

Im single with no kids, but have extra income after maxing out 401k, backdoor roth, megabackdoor roth, HSA. I probably funnel $80k into a taxable brokerage account each year after all is said and done. My understanding is that I can contribute up to $2400 in my state of LA which gets deducted off state (not federal) taxes. So the initial state tax savings per year isn’t too much.

What other taxes would I pay on that remaining $7000? Federal taxes? What percentage would it be? Would it depend on my tax bracket?",finance
CryptoCurrency,How desperately I need crypto vs Difficulty to Invest in it.,"Hey Everyone.

Lately, i have been seeing a lot of posts on social media about how low a 1000$ investment actually is and that wont make anyone get rich. Perhaps that is right but I want to make a point on how hard it is to invest even 200$ for some people.

&amp;#x200B;

**First, about me:**

I am a Medicine student in Turkey, Istanbul. I am living in the most expensive city in my country.  I will be writing anything i write in this  $ currency but my family is earning TL, Turkish lira.

**Few notes:**

* **1 Dollar is equal to 9.73TL** (closed market) as of me writing this text. It is very possible that it will go up.
* **Minimum wage is 290 USD**, though most places do everything they can to pay their employees even less than that.
* My all income is from my parents, my personal investments and my monthly credit that government gives. I do not have a job and I have no way to get into one as school is very heavy.
* **My income is 175 USD.** As USD/TRY rate goes up, this will problably be lower in the future aswell.
* All my bills are paid by my family. My monthly expenses, the Four Walls, if I dont do anything fun, is a whopping **102 USD** This leaves me with **73 USD.**
* In all these expenses, nothing unplanned is counted. I calculated this like I am eating  plain Pasta every single day.
* My family said they trust me and they will give me some of their savings so I can invest in Crypto. All this money is a whopping 200 USD.

As you can see, what I have left after a whole month will not even cover up the gas fee for an ETH transaction.

**Why I want to invest, desperately:**

If you have ever heard about governments money policy here, you will know that they do everything they can do lower interest rates. This shits on our economy, inflation skyrockets, losing value against USD and makes almost everythings base price go up. Government is a shitshow, so no foreign investors aswell.

All this made me realize: My savings will be useless if I dont do something about it. It is always melting against huge inflation. So, crypto was a lifesaver. I have been mining ETH for a long time aswell, so I have always had my toes dipped in it.  **But it has been so hard because:**

1. There have been months I had to sell Crypto to pay for my basic needs as something urgent came up.
2. Anything i buy, has to go through 6  exchanges if its not avalible in TRY. For example If coin i want to buy is on Kucoin: My Bank--&gt;Binance TR--&gt; TRY-&gt;USDT-&gt;ALGO--&gt;Kucoin--&gt;Buy the coin.  Good amount of money melts in fees or in little amounts of crypto, i pay fees even when i turn them into KCS or BNB.
3. If i want to do leverage trading, 100 USDT is the least amount of money I need to get in. My whole portfolio other than my mines and locked stakes is 60USDT. 100 USDT would turn my life around right this sec. My only viable option to invest is HODL. For some the best, though my point stands.
4. Diversifying my portfolio means i get super less amounts for every cryptocurrency. I need to consistently find 10x coins before they moon if I want fast returns.
5. If my portfolio goes down for 2 dollars, i lost 1 day worth of meals. Basically, I always have a 10x leverage on any trade i do.
6. Most Crypto related real life stuff, like CRO VISA card, is impossible to get.

There is also 1 positive side which is when i win, i win big. Moons, BAT etc. is more profitable.

All this has made me stop moving to crypto as well as many others I know. This is why adoption will be way hard in countries that have the same difficulties in Crypto.  How about you? Do you have any unique difficulties in crypto?",cryptocurrency

Furthermore, shortly after the gold war was confiscated by the government they raised the price from  $20.67 per troy ounce (which they paid each person) to  $35 per ounce. 1 troy ounce = 1.09714 ounces.

If you refused to turn in your gold, well: "" Under the Trading With the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, as amended on March 9, 1933, violation of the order was punishable by fine up to $10,000 ($167,700 if adjusted for inflation as of 2010) or up to ten years in prison, or both. ""

CryptoCurrency,I took out a 40k loan just over a month ago to buy bitcoin here is how it’s going:,"So I made a post a bit over a month ago it was about taking out a 40k AUD loan to buy more bitcoin which I withdrew off the equity on my mortgage at 2% interest if anyone was wondering how I kept the interest rate so low. 

So how is it travelling? I pay an extra $150 a month on the repayments which I have managed to pay without working more. How? A simple combination of buying less alcohol and bringing my lunch to work 1 more day a week instead which has actually cut down more spending and helping me lose a bit of weight which has been a really positive outcome. 

The price of bitcoin? I bought my 40k worth at around 59k AUD which with this purchase pushed me over the 1 BTC mark which I was rapt with. The price today is around 82k AUD so I’m around 38% AUD up on my investment. In addition to this I have staked my BTC at around 4% so I am making passive income on my investment. 

My plan? Whenever I feel we are starting to get to the FOMO stage I will sell 40k worth of BTC and pay back the amount that I borrowed. Even if it only goes to 108k AUD (which we all believe it will go a lot higher) I would of doubled my money. 

If it goes to a bear market? I have been easily been able to service the extra repayments by just making a couple of small sacrifices and I am happy to wait a couple of years if need be. 

I understand this is not for everyone however would just like to share my experience so far. Cheers legends !! 👊

personalfinance,My Guide for Home Mortgages &amp; Refinancing,"I really wanted to make a “guide” and talk a little bit about my experience as a younger homeowner geared towards the mortgage process, tips/tricks, and things to look out for when buying/refinancing a home. There is so much information out there, but a lot of it can be hard to understand for some people and can get confusing. Buying a home is the biggest purchase you will make in your life, so you want to make sure you understand it completely so that you can make a sound financial decision.

This guide will be geared more towards refinancing, but most if not all this information will be applicable for the initial mortgage loan process. I am *not* a financial advisor or a mortgage professional – just your average-joe homeowner with an engineering background.

I apologize as this will be a little long winded, but here it goes…

**So just some initial background on my original mortgage:** 

* Credit Score: 760+
* Purchase Date: December 2019
* Purchase Price: $287,500
* Down Payment: $28,750
* Loan Amount: $258,750
* Loan Type: 30-year conventional
* Interest Rate: 3.75%
* Down Payment: 10%
* Monthly Principle &amp; Interest: $1,198/month 
* PMI (private mortgage insurance): $66/month
* Taxes/Insurance: $545/month
* Total Payment: $1,809/month

We bought our home in the tail-end of 2019 in a super-hot market in a metro area in the mid-west. Honestly got lucky to get the home for what we offered ($13k under asking) at the time. We did the whole pre-approval and worked with a local mortgage broker for the loan. This was after some minimal shopping around for mortgages. Over the last couple years, we have been paying our monthly mortgage payment as well as paying an additional $175/month towards principle to help reduce the life of the loan and to try and get rid of the PMI faster. 

**Fast forward to Fall of 2021…** 

It was around this time that I really started to consider refinancing our current mortgage at the time. Rates were super low and home values were increasing rapidly, so I thought 1) I could reduce my payment and 2) I could get rid of the PMI I was currently paying. So, I started to shop around with some different lenders and brokers. 

I first started out with the Costco Mortgage Program. This can be a good place to start if you are a member. They have pretty good rates and cap their lenders to a maximum lender fee for their Costco members. I worked with 3 lenders who service Costco members and got quotes from all three. I then asked for an official loan estimate from two of them. After they pulled credit, they sent me the official loan estimates. Once I had these, I used this document to negotiate with the different lenders. One lender offered an interest rate of 2.875% (2.893% APR) and the other offered a 2.625% (2.666% APR). So, at this point the 2.625% rate was the best I had so far – so I would use this estimate to “shop” with some other lenders. 

I then contacted my previous mortgage broker to get an estimate from them. He was a really nice guy who actually taught me quite a bit about mortgages and suggested I went down from a 30-year to a 20-year mortgage. He explained it really well walking through the loan amortization schedule between the two different loan terms. Reducing your loan term means you can build equity of your home much faster and pay less interest over the life of the loan. It was at this point, if I could get the rate low enough, I was highly considering a 20-year loan. He ended up sending me a loan estimate after I showed him my other estimates saying that he could match/beat that rate. Long story short, it did not match/beat the other lender’s rate as he had to charge points and with his broker fees ended up increasing the loan amount to keep the rate the same as the 2.628%. 

After looking around at some other banks and credit unions who couldn’t beat the APR I had from the one Costco lender, I was just about ready to lock in my rate with them when I stumbled across Better Mortgage. I went to the Better website and put in some of my information for live refinance quotes and could not believe the rates they were offering. They offered a 2.375% rate with $268 in lenders credits with no points or lenders fees! Also found out that my current employer offers an incentive to finance with Better, and that came with an additional $1,500 off closing costs! They also were valuing our property significantly higher than what we purchased it for with no appraisal, therefore the PMI would be removed. I quickly took this information and sent it over to the Costco lender to see if they could beat it. She was shocked that they could offer that rate with no points and basically told me to lock that in ASAP as they could not touch that. I quickly locked in that rate with Better shortly after that. 

**Better Refinance Loan Details:**

* Refinance Date: October 2021
* Loan Amount: $247,000
* Loan Type: 20-year conventional
* Interest Rate: 2.375% (2.405% APR)
* Lenders Credit: $268
* Employer Closing Cost Credit: $1,500
* Monthly Principle &amp; Interest: $1,295/month 
* PMI (private mortgage insurance): $0/month
* Taxes/Insurance: $545/month
* Total Payment: $1,840/month

In summary, I reduced the life of the loan going from a 30-year to a 20-year and removed the PMI, while only having an increase of about $39/month to my total monthly payment (nearly $145 savings if I include the extra principle I was paying before)! Other than having to set up a new escrow account, my out of pocket closing costs were less than $500 as well. I had a great/seamless experience with Better, and would not hesitate to use them again in the future.

**Now to the guide portion of the post…**

&amp;#x200B;

# Mortgage and Refinance Guide:

# 1) Familiarize yourself with the mortgage and refinance process

I could go on forever here about the mortgage process and what to look out for, but the best thing you can do is take some time and visit the following sites:

* Mortgage Education: [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/mortgages/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/mortgages/)
* Refinance Specific: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/refinancings/#nocost](https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/refinancings/)

These two credible government websites have a plethora of information that will 100% help anyone who is new or wants a refresher on the home buying/refinancing process.

# 2) Understand Amortization Schedules 

Mortgage amortization is how a home loan is paid down, which is basically the gradual shift from paying mostly interest every month to paying mostly principal. This is a great concept to understand when comparing loans of two different interest rates OR comparing loans with different terms (e.g. 30-year and a 20-year). 

I highly recommend you use an amortization schedule calculator. Bankrate has a pretty decent one found here: [https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/amortization-calculator.aspx](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/amortization-calculator.aspx)

# 3) Understand the difference between a mortgage quote and an official loan estimate

**Mortgage Quote:**

* A mortgage quote is basically just a quick and dirty rough estimate that the lender will give you with pretty minimal information
* The lender does not need to do a hard credit-pull to give you this (this will not affect your credit)
* This will usually give you an interest rate, some fees, title costs, etc. Again, this is all rough estimation

**Official Loan Estimate:**

* An Official Loan Estimate is an official document from the lender that explains in detail all aspects of the loan. 
* To receive an Official Loan Estimate, you will have to apply with the lender, and they will do a hard credit-pull. They are required by law to send the estimate within 3 business days. 
* These are what you want to use to send to different lenders when shopping for the best rates/fees. 
* Keep a keen eye on the APR %, as this is a much better number to use when comparing loans from different lenders compared to just using the Interest Rate %. 

# 4) Understand Escrow accounts and how your property taxes and homeowner’s insurance are included

* An escrow account is an account set up by your lender that includes your property taxes and homeowner’s insurance
* This will be billed to you in your monthly mortgage statement
* This means your lender will be the one who pays your property taxes and insurance on your behalf
* Get an idea of what your monthly or yearly property taxes and homeowner’s insurance currently is (refinance) or what it will be (new home purchase), and use that number when shopping rates

Link to a good escrow explainer: [https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-is-mortgage-escrow/](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-is-mortgage-escrow/)

# 5) Give each lender the same information

The best thing you can do to compare different loans with an apples-to-apples comparison is ensuring you give each lender the **same exact** information. 

**This should include:**

* Loan Amount
   * *For initial mortgage:* (purchase price of home) – (down payment) = loan amount
   * *For refinance:* current principle owed on loan
* Property Insurance
* Homeowner’s Insurance

# 6) Shop different lenders

This is arguably one of the most important things you can do when trying to get a mortgage. Shopping different lenders can help ensure you get the best rate and the lowest closings costs. Try to use lenders against each other so that it sparks a “bidding war” for your business. 

**I suggest shopping with the following:** 

* Mortgage Broker
* Chain/Local Banks
* Credit Unions
* Online Mortgage Services (e.g. Better.com)
* Your current loan servicer

# 7) Understand and Compare Official Loan Estimates

I highly recommend you use a loan comparison tool. There are many on the internet but included below is a good one. Also, below is a great website that explains Official Load Estimates and how to read them. Keep your eye on APR% and closings costs, and ensure all your information you provided is accurate between estimates

* *How to read an Official Loan Estimate:* [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/loan-estimate/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/loan-estimate/)
* *Refinance Calculator:* [https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/should-i-refinance.php#top](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/should-i-refinance.php#top)

# 8) Don’t be afraid to ask questions

* When in doubt, ask your lender if you have questions on the loan estimate. Most lenders are more than happy to help but keep your guard up, as some lenders tend to have shady tactics and can take advantage of people who they think may not know much about the mortgage process. 
* Challenge each lender about things that may have been cheaper on other loan estimates
   * For example, I was able to get one of the lenders to reduce their title fees by showing them another lender’s title fees were less. Sometime lenders work with multiple title agencies that have different fees
   * For example, I was able to get $400 of lenders credits from one of the lenders by showing them another lender’s loan estimate. So that would be a $400 reduction from your closing costs!

# 9) Understand points and closing costs

I won’t go into too much detail here but will link below two really good sites that explain points and closings costs really well. 

* Closing Costs: [https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-guide/closing-costs/](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-guide/closing-costs/)
* Points: [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-are-discount-points-and-lender-credits-and-how-do-they-work-en-136/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-are-discount-points-and-lender-credits-and-how-do-they-work-en-136/)

# 10) Watch out for “junk” mortgage fees

These are fees that lenders will try and throw in with the loan. Most of the time they can be negotiated or completely removed. These fees can include the following: 

* Application fee
* Underwriting fee
* Mortgage rate lock fee
* Loan processing fee
* Broker rebate

# 11) Working fast and understanding what “Rate Locking” is

You want to work fast during the mortgage shopping process. Rates can change on the daily, and if you haven’t locked in your rate with a lender yet, your rate could change. A rate lock basically means that your interest rate will not change between the offer and closing. 

* *More info on rate locks:* [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/whats-a-lock-in-or-a-rate-lock-en-143/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/whats-a-lock-in-or-a-rate-lock-en-143/)

personalfinance,"Getting a loan for $2,500","So I've had help in this sub in the past and it helped me get out of a horrendous loan on my first car, and I'm trying to avoid another major mistake (regardless of the low amount).

TLDR question: Who should I finance with? Is there a way to get less then a 10 percent APR on a 2500 dollar loan? I have a lengthy credit history and I have a 738 credit score so I'm not concerned with approval odds just need a reputable lender that allows early payments.

My girlfriend is looking for a cheap car she has $1,500 now. I'm perfectly fine with financing the remaining $2,500 for a car however I wanted to know if there's a lender that will finance such a low amount with a decent interest rate?

She and I have decent paying jobs and can pay it off probably in less then 4 months (she'd be paying however if something were to happen to our relationship or her I would take over at that point).

Now I know the best option would be save the remainder up and just face the time it takes to do that vs. the loan however that's not an option. She needs a vehicle as I may be going to prison next month and will be forced to sell mine so she has to have transportation given where we live is.",finance

CryptoCurrency,This sub is definitely a place for your Libertarian rants: Especially since crypto can leverage those ideas (taxes),"There are legitimate reasons to not want to give money to your Government.  Especially if your government spends trillions on killing people across the world.  
Crypto was created in order to give people tools to become self sovereign.  A self souveriegn person can decide to chose how they want to spend their money.  No one signs up for a government and no one has any say about the billions spend on stupid shit.  Crypto gives them that say.  
 Please read my post about the war tax resistors movement:

During the vietnam war, Alexander Haig, a general in the army and an advisor to the white house said the following about Vietnam war protestors:  
&gt;**""Let them march all they want, as long as they continue to pay their taxes.""**   

That statement basically sums up what war tax resisters do, instead of marching in big protests, they do not pay their taxes.   War tax resistance is the refusal to pay some or all taxes that pay for war, and may be practiced by conscientious objectors, pacifists, or those protesting against a particular war or certain weapons of war (nuclear).   War Tax resisters are distinct from ""tax protesters,"" who deny that the legal obligation to pay taxes exists or applies to them. War Tax resisters may accept that some law commands them to pay taxes but they still choose to resist taxation.   The USA's military budget is bigger than the next 7 or 8 top ten big spenders combined.  It is estimated that about half of federal taxes goes to current and former military spending and its adjacent industries.  USA only spends about 3% of taxes on education.  So their is ample reasoning for these people to not want to pay war taxes.   Some war tax resisters will either pay 50% of their taxes or a symbolic 1$ or no tax at all.  Some will often use the tax money they don't spend, and give it to charity.  In this way, they demonstrate that the intent of their resistance is not selfish and that they want to use a portion of their earnings to contribute to the common good.  For instance, Julia Butterfly Hill resisted about $150,000 in federal taxes, and donated that money to after school programs, arts and cultural programs, community gardens, programs for Native Americans, alternatives to incarceration, and environmental protection programs. She said:
&gt;I actually take the money that the IRS says goes to them and I give it to the places where our taxes should be going. And in my letter to the IRS I said: ""I'm not refusing to pay my taxes. I'm actually paying them but I'm paying them where they belong because you refuse to do so.""

  So what role can crypto play in this ?  Well often war tax resisters openly declare to the IRS that they are protesting paying for war taxes.  They will often be a part of war tax resister groups and will simultaneously attend a protest on tax day, making their decision pubic.  These people are not trying to hide.  For some more high profil war tax resisters the IRS does send stronlgy worded letters with a bill for the tax amount.  Some will have their wages garnished, if they own property the IRS will try to seize it or seize bank accounts.  **Enter crypto.**  War tax resisters can put their net worth in unseizable money.  If you hold private key no one can take your crypto.  No order from the IRS or a judge can create a situation where you can lose possession of your crypto, it's the ultimate tool for war tax resisters.  It's the perfect asset to have since there are a lot of ways to spend Bitcoin and other cryptos without having to go through the government or anyone.  Hell, one could even just do face to face in person cash transactions and they wouldn't even generate a tax liability.  I believe war tax resistance is going to get more popular as crypto becomes more mainstream.   You might ask ""why doesn't the IRS prosecute people?"".  They have in the past,  but their recent strategy has been to not create a media event surrounding the war tax resisters.  They have said in the past that the media attention of a trial only gives other people the idea to do it, and it's not worth the negative media attention.    
     Personally I have avoided paying taxes because I live a very modest lifestyle, one where I have a near zero tax obligation. It is illegal to not pay your taxes and I would never tell anyone that they should break the law.  However certain laws have been morally wrong in the past (segregation in the US and some might consider prohibition as well).  Some might say, when it comes to laws, that it is up to the sovereign individual to decide if its morally righteous or not to pay war tax or not.  Crypto is about taking control of your finances and becoming the arbiter of your destiny.  
     Up until now,  living modestly has been my way of participating in the war tax resistance movement.  However, I'm very thankful that i've stacked all my sats without kyc, because, should I ever decide to cash out, and have a tax liability, I definitely want the option of acting my conscious and not directly funding the killing of innocent people across the world.   But again that is illegal and I can't recommend doing that.  
 You can find out about war tax resistence [here](https://www.warresisters.org/war-tax-resistance) and watch an interview with one [here](https://www.democracynow.org/2005/4/15/war_tax_resistance_refusing_to_fund)
    
TLDR:  If you dont want to fund wars, you can use crypto  to buy non KYC BTC in in person cash trades, then sell the same way

**Before the mods just knee jerk delete this post**,  I am not advocating for anyone to break the law.  I am merely pointing out that crypto would help a certain protest movement with their objectives.  War tax resistance is widely discussed on reddit in several subreddits such as /r/postive_news, r/Libertarian, r/RadicalChristianity and many others.   So the mere discussion of what is possible with crypto should be allowed.  We talk about how people use crypto to buy drugs or gamble in places where it is illegal, we sould be able to discuss the how and why of crypto and the war tax resistance movement.    You can see examples on reddit [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Positive_News/comments/g9rzer/meet_the_new_generation_of_tax_resisters_refusing/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/humn1x/growing_up_with_the_war_tax_resisters/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/RadicalChristianity/comments/43w2iq/how_quaker_war_tax_resistance_came_and_went_twice/)",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Nov 4, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 4, 2021**

The good times keep on rolling! The remarkable rally in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued, which each index recording fresh intraday highs the day after the Federal Reserve’s decision to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing as the US economy reaches the “substantial progress” benchmark outlined by the Fed back in December 2020.

As was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. 

The Fed said in a statement, “In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. 

Specifically, the Fed said it would begin reducing its asset purchases this month by a total of $15 billion, and then by another $15 billion in December, but said the outlook for the pace of tapering in the future would depend on ""changes in the economic outlook."" Fed Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his prior stance that the ultimate end of the tapering process next year would not automatically signal the start to interest rate hikes. 

New weekly jobless claims came at a fresh pandemic-era low, with further improvements in the labor market coming as companies continue to compete to attract and retain workers amid elevated demand. New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:

* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:** 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week
* **Continuing claims, week ended October 23:** 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week

I recently left, and went to work for a medium SaaS company that is trying to make the switch to Kubernetes and micro services for their workloads.  Our infrastructure is on AWS, and they've spun up a Kubernetes environment and are trying to figure out infrastructure as code, but they are having trouble managing it because it was largely manually installed.  They have a working in-house CI system they like, and they're familiar with Terraform, but any other tools seem more piecemeal instead of a part of an integrated strategy.  It makes scaling impractical at best.

I've been asked to help with containerization, automation, and observability.  ie. make this Kubernetes thing work like we need it to.

24. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya.

25. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a “what if” scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised.

37. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle.

Coinbase tells us: “...initial launch will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards with multi-chain support planned soon after.” [https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html)

49. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

56. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan Müller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we’ll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)

62. In the Cap Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative Fireside Q&amp;A, Charles mentioned he is talking to Colossol Labs about the possibility of having the Mammoth DeExtinction Project take place on his bison ranch.

CryptoCurrency,Recently I dun f@#!ed up really stupidly. Get bigger brain from my mistake.,"So I converted some of my ADA to Tether on Kraken so I could then transfer it to my Metamask Wallet. That all went fine. I did this so that I could then use the Polygon bridge app to transfer said Tether to the Polygon chain.

First I set the amount of Tether to the max amount. Then I clicked Transfer. The usual notice about what's supported and what isn't popped up and I clicked continue. The gas fee estimate was around 45$. I clicked continue again. and then again to take me to the Metamask confirmation window.

This is where the mistakes started happening. I went in to edit the priority of my transfer. I put in the lowest Gaslimit, The lowest Max priority fee, and the lowest fee possible. I clicked save and then confirmed. This didn't work at all. I got an instant error and nothing went through. I tried this a couple of times. The same thing happened. Then I tried raising the numbers slightly. Then things started happening. Polygon transfer was processing. However, The transaction failed again. I thought ok well my transaction just wasn't accepted because my fee wasn't high enough to be accepted for the next block, I'll just try again with the same figures until I get accepted.

After five fails I googled to find out what I was doing wrong and I figured out it was my Gaslimit. OK, so I'll try again and won't change the Gaslimit, just the lowest Max priority fee, and the lowest fee possible. It worked! But where is my Tether? Why is it not on my Polygon Wallet? Oh ok, it can take up to 8 minutes. Nope still not there. It's still sitting on the Ethereum chain. No Idea why but it is.

While I was trying to find out what wasn't working I had noticed that my ether balance dropped. What I didn't realise is that every time my transactions failed due to the ""out of Gas"" error I was actually paying the Gas fee without my transaction going through. For some reason, my brain had the information that I would be reimbursed for the failed transactions. Nope!

Luckily it wasn't a huge amount but enough to turn a good day into a bad one. Plus I feel a very dumb.

Anyhow have a nice morning, evening, night or day for you folks on the other side of the world. Cheers!",cryptocurrency

*****

*****
&gt; Recovery stock Expedia saw its shares roar higher by 11.6% premarket a day after the company said renewed travel demand boosted its top and bottom lines higher than analysts had expected.

*****
&gt; Market participants digested the Federal Reserve’s plan to begin tapering its pandemic aid by the end of November, putting the central bank on track to end its asset purchase program by the middle of next year.
*****
&gt; Investors also received a fresh labor market reading Thursday as first-time jobless claims totaled 269,000 last week, the lowest pandemic-era total and lower than expected.
*****
&gt; All three major averages are on track to end the week higher. The Dow is up 0.9% on the week, while the S&amp;P 500 is 1.6% higher and the Nasdaq Composite is up 2.9%.

personalfinance,Question on our companies traditional and roth 457 accounts,"Both my friend and I work full time for our state government. We have a pension, and on top of that also have a 457 account where we can contribute to a traditional or a roth option. My friend swears it is smart since we are both in our 20s to max out the traditional option. Could not agree more - since to build wealth you need time and money. However, he went on to say ""yes, it is nice because your contributions to the traditional do not get taxed. So we average $2k net pay every 2 weeks, so put in $1k and that $1k will not get taxed federal taxes..."" Woah I said, that is not how that works. If I for example put $1k into the traditional 457 account I would still on average be paying $500 to the IRS and $100 to the state. These numbers would be the exact same if I contributed to a roth option, the only difference would be that I would pay an approx. $120 up front because that is how Roths work. 

My friend replied with ""no, I swear my paystubs showed I paid half in taxes this year compared to last year (when he contributed $0 to anything)."" So he is determined he is right. Any insight into this?",finance

I have a very specific question regarding the loan rate to expect with and without a co-borrower.

My spouse and I are planning to take out an auto loan and we want to co-borrow. My credit score is in the 799-850 range and my spouse's score is in the 740-799 range. 

My question is: Will I get a higher interest rate if both of us applied jointly for the loan as compared to just me applying for the loan (with the higher credit score bracket)?

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Journey,"I wanted to reach out to both veterans and newer folks about the Bitcoin ethos, explain that ethos, and how given enough time, it will reshape one's worldview. I see a lot of veterans getting frustrated when someone comes along asking how to swing trade Bitcoin, what a good ""exit plan"" is, or why the ""smart people"" haven't caught on, et cetera. Newbies are confused why this elicits so much frustration, and I suspect longtime hodlers may not even know why all this bothers them so much. Given that, I wanted to set forth what I see as the Bitcoin ideals and how they reshape your worldview.

There are two major ideals of the Bitcoin ethos. Those are decentralization and strong time preference. You can arrive at these ideals independent of Bitcoin, of course. And if you have ever wondered why Bitcoiners hold in high regard the opinions of those who are strongly anti-Bitcoin, such as Warren Buffet or Peter Schiff, it's because these people have some of the Bitcoin ideals without accepting the underlying protocol of Bitcoin. I will briefly discuss the two ideals and how those ideals change your worldview.

&amp;#x200B;

**Decentralization** \- here is an unspoken truth that many understand but few can express. No one has a clue what is going on or what they are doing. Humans are irrational. Even people who realize this are they themselves irrational. We operate on the basis of many things, including emotions and our subconscious. We may act in a way and be unable to explain why we are acting in that way. We are pathological. We are subject to biases. We cannot fully comprehend or adequately observe things in the world, particularly numbers and time. At the end of the day, we are finite creatures with brains that have limited capacity and shortcomings.

Behavioral economists have done multiple studies showing how poorly we make decisions, particularly economic decisions. There is plenty of literature out there showing how apparently stupid people are. Now here is the secret no one wants you to admit. This applies the same to you, the homeless man on the street, and even the CEO of a billion-dollar corporation, or a chairman of the federal reserve, or the President of the United States. None of these people, despite what they may have you think, have much of a clue what is going on at any given moment, much less can they design a society or an economy, and they certainly cannot predict the future. No single person can. For that matter, no single person can single-handedly make something in our economy. As a famous example, take the ""story of the pencil."" You will find numerous youtube videos explaining this story. In sum, no single person can create a pencil. Instead, a single pencil is the product of innumerable economic connections that span the globe. No single person plans these connections, and indeed, no single person *could* plan these connections. They, instead, spontaneously occur as a result of the actions of individuals pursuing their own self-interest.

While a single person is irrational, multiple people acting out of pure economic incentives are rational given enough time. Society and the economy will naturally coordinate toward optimal outcomes without the need of a designer. There is, moreover, certain wisdom in crowds. For example, a famous experiment was done in which people were asked to guess the weight of a bull at a fair. I believe none of the guesses was spot on. There were people who were close, of course. But there were also people who were widely off by a lot. But here is the remarkable part; when the guesses were averaged, the average number was either exactly correct or off by only a few pounds.

So, what is the conclusion you should draw from this? When someone asks about swing trading, they are presuming they are smarter than the crowd. They believe that they can guess the price of something and be more correct than the collective wisdom of the marketplace. That's simply not true, and the fact a person thinks otherwise only demonstrates how unaware they are of their own shortcomings. Most traders (think over 90%) lose money on average. Those who don't lose money likely are only lucky. So from an investing standpoint, it's important to reduce the number of choices you need to make. In the best-case scenario, your average decision will be equal to the market and the collective decisions of others. The worst-case and most likely scenario, you will underperform. That is why Warren Buffet, for example, said the market ""is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient.” The chances that you bought the right investment at the right time and for the right amount are nearly zero. But you should instead buy the right investment and let time take care of the rest.

What does the decentralization revelation reveal for policymaking? Well institutions and their leaders are just as clueless as the rest of us. The idea that they could supplement their ""knowledge"" for that of the market is ignorant at best, and dangerous at worst. But they don't see it that way. Indeed, they tinker with our lives and our economy in order to ""improve it."" The fed runs the money printer as a solution to every problem. Housing bubble caused by cheap credit? Solution: more cheap credit. Global pandemic with 1% fatality rate and lockdowns putting people out of work? Solution: print money. There is not a problem they believe can't be fixed with the money printer. It's silly really. But they would have you believe they are the smartest people in the room. Why? Well, they need that illusion because without it you won't trust them. But they also believe they are the smartest people in the room. They were trained at the best colleges, graduated at the top of their classes, and clawed their way to the top of some of the most prestigious institutions in the world. They played that game well. But at the end of the day, they are still just irrational humans like the rest of us. They are subject to biases. They are subject to irrationality. They are subject to political pressures. They are subject to economic pressures. They will fail you. Humans will fail you.

Bitcoin is a decentralized algorithm. It has been ticking along for 12 years now. It does not care what the opinions of others are. It does not care if the great majority of the public wants cheap credit. It does not care who is the President of the United States, or if there is even a United States of America. It's an algorithm that continues to operate irrespective of these things. Unlike people, it is predictable. Unlike people, it's not irrational. It is a simple algorithm. That's it. It is supported by the actions of millions of people around the globe who, acting out of self-interest, support and protect its algorithm. It has a fixed supply that cannot be altered without near-unanimous approval. In a world of excess and irrational people, it is a solid rock. So when someone asks ""when should I exit out of Bitcoin,"" you know they don't get it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Strong time preference** \- Anything worth doing does not come easily or fast. In a fiat world, your money melts away. Although this is not perceivable over a short-term basis, it is baked into your mind and your behaviors and those of your parents, and their parents before them. You are incentivized to spend money as quickly as possible. Businesses are incentivized to cash in on the next cheap junk that appeals to the lowest common denominator in order to make a quick buck that's melting away. After all, they have to stay above the rate of inflation and grow faster than the dollar loses its value. It sometimes feels like no one is building for the future anymore.

Strong assets that are liquid, such as Bitcoin, can change this behavior. It will incentivize people to save. It will incentivize people to hold. It will incentivize them to be patient, and not to buy junk or seek fleeting pleasures. For the first time in a long time, Bitcoin gives people the ability to think long-term and plan ahead, not only a decade but for generations. I will be able to give my Bitcoin to my grandchildren. The network will exist 100 years from now. It will exist 1000 years from now. Bitcoin will never be worth zero. In fact, more people are going to demand it as time goes on. More people are going to trust Bitcoin as time goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

So, just a few thoughts. Take them for what they are worth. I am, after all, just another irrational human. Best wishes.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,The maths is hurting my head! overpayment v savings - extra flair added I hope,"I am trying to work out the potential benefits/downsides of saving in a s and s isa with Vanguard compared to overpaying the mortgage in a lump sum each year/monthly. What is the best way to compare overpaying vs saving an amount each month to put in an s and s vanguard isa? I understand if you can get a higher average interest rate in s and s then it can be better to save. I am struggling to calculate the figures for a comparison.

I am 30 years old, mortgage interest rate is 1.99% fixed for 5 years ( 4 years left to run) on a 25 year product ( so would be remortgaging after 5 years) Cost of property was 140K for a 2 bed flat. Loan to value is 45%.

I don't have a high income, around 20K per year but I am on the lookout for for different jobs. My expenses are low with no children or partner. I have approximately half my monthly wage left to invest. I also have supportive parents if I lose my job. I also have the option to get a lodger in my flat to earn more montly income. I have done this previously and can earn up to 400 extra pcm.

I have 5.5K in an Vanguard life strategy fund

3 K emergency funds

1K in current accounts

2 K in crypto

Please can you advise how to work out the potential upsides to investing if the isa makes 5-10 % versus overpaying up to 10% of the mortgage loan each year?

Thanks in advance!",finance
CryptoCurrency,I don't care paying crypto taxes: in my country there's free healthcare and higher education for everyone. Not all the countries are like 'Murica.,"I've seen people from the slums entering college because they didn't have to pay. Free technical books rentals at uni's libraries, free housing for the poorest students that come from other cities (have to prove income to be eligible), free lunch and dinner (in some unis only, in others you have to pay from 50c to 2 USD, though) and some undergrad research scholarships.

We've got free cancer and AIDS treatments. Free ambulances. I've seen poor, old ladies that sell corn at Sunday's vegetables fair that had a life-changing eye surgery that made them see again. If they had to pay for it, they'd go blind long before their death. FFS there are cochlear implants and organ transplants for free in some cases.

Paying 15%-25% over 10x+ crypto profits? Man, just take it.

I'm not saying there aren't problems. You have to study to be accepted in the universities and if your parents had money in the first place, you could prepare yourself better going to the best private high-schools. The lines for some health procedures are long enough, but if your condition is chronic (AIDS, cancer) or life-threatening (e.g. a car accident), you're assisted on the spot. Violence is still a big thing, mainly due to a huge wealth gap, and hopefully there are people fighting to give better conditions to as many people as possible. Not everything is perfect.

I'm also not saying that all tax money is rightfully used - I'm not such a fool. But I can't imagine living in a country where I had to pay a hefty amount to call an ambulance. If I had to pay for my college degree in the old days, probably I wouldn't have gotten any, as my parents were quite humble.

Being libertarian or communist or capitalist, we live in society, and people tend to forget a good society is one where the maximum amount of people has their basic needs met. 

People also tend to forget that things they take for granted, such as the structures for calling the cops, sewage treatment, electricity on the bulbs, water in the taps etc. are generally paid with taxes. Don't want to pay taxes? Fine, get your own private security, buy yourself a water reservoir and build your own power plant. Might as well declare independence.

Imho, not wanting to pay taxes doesn't put you far away from people in the Pandora and Panama papers. Want to make sure taxes are rightly used? Participate and get engaged in social participation programs. Get involved. Be part of your community.

If you live in a country where there are such social security structures, don't mind paying taxes. If all your neighbors are fed, probably you are fed, too.

TL;DR: I don't mind paying taxes over 10x+ if people around me will be assisted one way or another.",cryptocurrency

Primary Savings: Around 109,000 with I think 0.4% interest. I don't touch this and I'm not willing to. The peace of mind of having a year's salary, maybe two if I'm frugal, is invaluable to me. I value the mental health benefit of having it there. I am willing to save other funds if investing is advisable.

Secondary Savings: This is an account I tuck away fun money and my mortgage/utilities payments into, just to separate it from my checking to make budgeting easier. The interest rate is 0.05%. Current balance is $7000. I stick $800 from each paycheck to cover mortgage, and usually $1000 for fun stuff. What's left over is enough to live comfortably on until the next check. Currently saving for a Vacation to Nice and Genoa next summer if restrictions lift somewhat. Additionally, there is no limit to how often I can transfer money between this account and my checking. This is primarily why I think I can contribute more. I can still save enough for little luxuries, and still secure myself for the future.

Debt: I have paid off student loans and my car. My car is reliable and not too old, so I don't anticipate major issues in the next few years. I'm not a car guy, so I plan on driving my little Honda into the ground like my last one. My only debt is my mortgage. I have about 244k left at 2.75%. Monthly payments are about $1200. Utilities are usually &lt;200. I use my credit card for most purchases, but I don't carry a balance. I don't like to fuck around with those interest rates.

Employer Match: 6% and an annual 3% contribution

Retirement contributions: I contribute 15% pretax to my 401K. I use fidelity and currently use an aggressive savings plan since I'm relatively young.

Current retirement balance: Around 186,000

I think that's all that's relevant, but let me know if more info could help. Oh and unmarried.


Edit: I was young and dumb when I just picked a health plan that seemed fine and have rolled with it since I started this job. It's been great for me, but I don't know if it includes an HSA. I will look into that. The advice so far seems to be that I should max that bad boy out if I have it.

Edit 2: No children and no desire to have them in the future. They're expensive and somehow always have jam on their hands?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Mr. Robot, a TV series in 2016, predicted the creation of CBDCs.","Mr. Robot is a TV series based around a hacker and taking down the US financial systems. I won't go into the details of the series, but in Season 2 Episode 11 (Aired Sept 14, 2016) there was a conversation between 2 people. The CEO (Phillip) of the largest financial company (Evil Corporation, yes really is called that in the series) and a person in the white house (Jack). This isn't the full transcript, but these are the parts that predicted the CBDC:

Jack: I cannot do it. It is unconstitutional.

Phillip: Look, with Ecoin equal to one dollar it'll free up the economy.

...

Jack: It's unconstitutional. You can't make your own currency. That is the federal government's job.

Phillip: I am not the problem here. The problem here is hard cash is fading rapidly. 

Phillip (cont.): That's just the way of the world right now, and Bitcoin is spreading. And if Bitcoin takes over, we are all in a world of hell. 

Phillip (cont.): It is unregulated, it's already reached its transaction volume maximum and it is partly controlled by Chinese miners.

...

Phillip: With Ecoin, we control the ledger and the mining servers. 

Phillip (cont.): We are the authority. 

Phillip (cont.): I will make sure that you have visibility into every single wallet that's open, every loan, every transaction, which means we can start making new assets, which means we cab start rebuilding the banking sector with your your having to inject even more politically unpalatable federal funds into it.

Jack: The president will laugh at my face.

Phillip: But he'll know this is the right thing to do.

Phillip (cont.): This is going to be controlled by a good, old fashioned American company. 

Phillip (cont.): You want to regulate it? Be my guest. Regulate the shit out of it.

Phillip (cont.): I'll give you back doors, side doors, tracing, whatever you want.

Phillip (cont.): Just don't shut it down.

Phillip (cont.): This was always the future, Jack.

CryptoCurrency,What makes crypto so special?,"In other words, how is the crypto market not just the ""stock/forex market of the future"" or is that actually its entire value proposition? I'm working through this as I type so my thoughts may be incoherent or incomplete, but bear with me.

Investing in a cryptocurrency and investing in a company are very similar. In both cases, people are betting on specific infrastructure, ecosystems, vision, and implementation of solutions within a particular niche. For example:

* Betting on Amazon is betting on its vision for eCommerce. 
* Betting on Tesla is betting on its vision for EVs and sustainable energy. 
* Betting on Bitcoin is betting on its vision for a digital store of value. 
* Betting on Ethereum is betting on its vision for a platform for decentralized apps.

With crypto, discounted future user adoption seems to be the primary fundamental analysis driver. With stocks, it's discounted future cash flows. However, cash flows are essentially a proxy for user adoption adjusted for customer acquisition costs, retention rates, upselling rates, etc. Each customer is converted to a base-dollar unit based on this analysis and expected increases in either customer base or increases in that dollar value equivalent are what drive public investment. 

Similarly, a currency is equity in a country. Central banking systems rely on demand for their respective currencies to survive and they employ monetary policy to stimulate spending and investment, control inflation, and ensure a healthily growing economy. Monetary policy is a central bank's specific implementation of a specific solution to sustaining economic growth and driving investment in its currency. 

DeFi has the potential to make these central banks redundant, sure, but ""tokenomics"" is just a shiny new word for monetary policy. DeFi platforms rely on demand for their respective currencies just like any central banking system. Buying ADA is betting on Cardano's specific tokenomics just like buying USD is betting on the Fed's specific monetary policy. The only substantial difference here is that a crypto's demand isn't tied to any particular nation's economy. Not to mention there's no guarantee that the world's crypto platform of choice will be decentralized.

A cryptocurrency takes traditional financial concepts, digitizes them, and strips away a few layers of bureaucracy, but it's precisely *because* of that bureaucracy that crypto is able to make certain assumptions and abstract away a lot of the monetary policymaking process. At its core, it's the same as any publicly-traded company or central bank: a specific implementation of a specific solution for a specific use case that relies on user adoption and public investment to grow. 

I'm not doubting the future of crypto, mind you. Just wondering why the popular sentiment seems to be that crypto is *fundamentally* different than the financial systems we currently have in place, save for a few quirks. It seems to me that the end goals and the mechanics of each are one and the same, but crypto simply employs a far heavier use of technology to reach that goal because it doesn't need to worry about maintaining ""backwards compatibility"" with physical assets. Am I right in this?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Opportunity Cost/Used Car Loan - Longest Term Possible,"So, I was thinking of financing a used car (Toyota Camry) between 10-15k in value in the mid-term future.

Would it be possible to finance this at a low interest rate - like 2-3% for a really long period (5-7 years or longer) to get a really low monthly payment?

The opportunity cost of buying a car in cash is that my cash then cannot be used to buy index funds.

The reason I want to do this is I would rather pay it off slowly and put all of this cash into VTSAX. Since the market will likely return 7-10%, I think this is an easy way of getting a net win.

Before you ask, I am already maxing out my 401k, Roth, and HSA. I just want to throw more cash into my taxable brokerage account.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, Novemeber 5, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 5, 2021**

Stocks continued its remarkable rally, with all three major indexes hitting fresh intraday highs today as market participants celebrated the October jobs report, which showed a better-than-expected pickup in employment. This is a great sign given labor market imbalances caused by the pandemic have been a focal point for market participants. 

According to the US Labor Department, the pace of employment greatly improved after two disappointing months, with the report citing declining coronavirus cases and increased demand for workers for the uptick. Here are the numbers:

* **Change in non-farm payrolls, October:** \+531,000 vs. +450,000 expected, and a great improvement over the +194,000 job added in September
* **Unemployment rate:** 4.6% vs. 4.7% expected, 4.8% in September 

During a press conference, President Joe Biden said of the Labor report, “Our economy is starting to work for more Americans. Thanks to the economic plan we put through in Congress earlier this year and a successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace. In this historically strong recovery, unemployment has fallen again today,” President Joe Biden said during a press conference on Friday.”

Though payrolls have grown every month so far in 2021, the economy remains more than 4 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels following plunges in employment between March and April of 2020. And the civilian labor force was still down by nearly 3 million individuals compared to February 2020 as of October. 

Earlier in the week, as was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Peloton (PTON) slid more than 30% after the company reported disappointing earnings.
* Amazon (AMZN) is seeking approval from U.S. communications regulators to deploy more than 4,500 additional satellites as part of the company's effort to deliver broadband internet to areas around the world that lack high-speed service. Amazon (AMZN) said in its filing the satellites ""will serve households, hospitals, businesses, government agencies, and other organizations around the world, including in geographic areas where reliable broadband remains lacking.""

* EV start-up Rivian, which has the backing of Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motors (F), is set to go public next week at an estimated valuation of $53 billion. The company will benefit from having Amazon buying a bunch of electric vans, but the valuation seems rich in my humble opinion

personalfinance,Scarcity mindset vs. abundance mindset,"Edit: Thank you SO much for everyone's kind, insightful, and experienced words!! It's given me a lot to think about and I understand that part of my anxiety is because I've only been in the personal finance space for a short time and I'm inexperienced in manipulating large sums of money. My student loan rates are pretty high since it's grad school, between 4.5-7% and I recently got a refinance estimate of 2.79%. I don't have retirement plans going, which is the main reason I'd like to refi so I can start focusing on that since length of time is a factor. I appreciate everyone who shared their own stories and came out the other side, so I don't feel alone, I really needed that! :')

Hi all, I'm looking for some advice on how to shift my attitude/thoughts from scarcity to abundance in relation to finances.

This is my context: I'm 28F (no kids) $140,000 salary and $192,000 in Federal loans from professional school. Over the last 16 months I've set side $100K to pay off in January when repayment begins. My take home every month is $7-8K and I set aside 5-6K payments to loans. I live minimally under $2000 expenses monthly in HCOL city. 

The remaining $92K I plan on refinancing over a 5 year loan to pay monthly (not aggressively). My extra money will go towards investments.

Yet...I feel like I'm drowning,stuck, and trapped by the debt. I know logically I've made amazing progress, I have a solid plan, my income is a blessing, and yet I can't shake the feeling that I don't have any money, or it's not enough, or not going away fast enough. And then I feel guilty for feeling this way. 

My goals having 2 kids, investing in real estate, FIRE movement by 50. Even though it's totally possible by numbers, I'm terrified that it's not. 

I grew up with very poor immigrant parents. I make almost 3x as much as my fiance in income, yet because he doesn't have debt, he already has one investment property. He's so positive about money and our goals despite making much less. Totally the abundance mindset that I want to have.

How can I make this shift in thinking? Do I need to be debt free to not feel this way? Does anyone relate at all?",finance

So my brother convinced me to buy some stock several months ago. I opened a wells trade account through my existing checking account, and successfully bought several hundred dollars of stock.

The problem now is that Wells Fargo has claimed I cannot sell that stock, as they didn’t have the required proof of identity. After getting the run around, I found out they want my social security card (and said it’s a national requirement). I know my number, but do not have an official copy of my card (although I offered an official form from the NM SSN office with my number on it that was stamped and notarized). 

So basically they let me buy but won’t let me sell. From what I gather this is not a genuine federal requirement, as services like webull only require a number.

We’ve noticed a few errors on his previous pay stubs before but somehow missed this. 

He emailed payroll today and they told him to make sure his w4 was filled out correctly.

We looked back at his paystubs and the last time he had federal taxes was before updating his w-4 in March. We updated his w-4 in March because we married and had a child at the end of 2020. The only thing I noticed on his w-4 was that he didn’t have box 2-c checked and of course had box 3 set as $2000 (for our dependent). I claim nothing on my w4. 

So my question is, what did we do wrong on his w-4 to suddenly not have federal taxes deducted? My grandfather always had me complete my taxes by hand through college so I’m fairly decent with the language. Now I’m curious where I messed up.",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing 30yr vs 20yr on a “not forever” home,"I’m 26 years old have owned my home for 2 years. I bought it for $235k and with only 3% down, but thanks to home values skyrocketing it’s worth about $300k now and I can get rid of my PMI if I refinance.

I currently pay $1800/mo, 3.5% interest rate (I refinanced down to that a year ago) Doing another 30 year seems crazy but would get me down to $1570/mo at 3.25% interest, or I could pay almost the same at $1830 for a 20 year at 2.875% interest. 

The lower payment is very enticing because I just took a major pay cut and bring about $800 less home per month. I can afford $1830 though so should I just do it? Is a shorter loan term always better?

This isn’t my forever home and I’d like to sell in 5-10 years. Otherwise it would be a MAJOR remodel to make this somewhere I’d want to live forever. It’s an 80+ year old house that needs some repairs and updating, so shelling out the money for that would sting less with lower monthly bills. I know I’d save a ton of money on interest over the life of the loan, but how much does that matter if I sold in 5 years anyway?",finance

* Fixed interest;

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds. Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

By definition, it is clear that decentralised bond has the same meaning as traditional bond. Some of the differences include the time to maturity, the yield, and the ability to combine to create many different products and serve different purposes.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,There is zero chance that any decentralized stablecoin will survive long term,"Unregulated stablecoins absolutely will not come away unscathed. That’s for sure. Look at how many regulations and how much red tape there is for traditional banking. You may think that DeFi fixes this. But the regulations and red tape of traditional banking are not a bug, they are a feature. It’s by design to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. DeFi proponents claim that it will reduce friction in banking but the friction is absolutely by design. 

You will not be allowed to use non KYC stablecoins in the future. If you go to a bank today, you need an ID to sign up. And banks need to be compliant. There’s a reason offshore bank accounts are called offshore, they can’t legally operate in the USA and not report to the government. The government isn’t in the habit of reducing regulations. In fact it’s quite the opposite. I think physical cash is a thing of the past, and CBDCs will be forced on us to everybody’s entire transaction history is on record. And a CBDC will absolutely be freezable by the IRS/Fed. They will not allow decentralized alternatives to a CBDC to exist.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Would getting a car loan help?,"I have never had a car loan personally but one was taken out in my name by my parents. In the subsequent years, bankruptcy was filed and the car loan was charged off of my credit. Since then(been almost 10 years), I have been denied car loans or given ridiculous interest rates(15%+). My FICO auto score is around 620 or so. My question is: would actually getting a car loan for a smaller amount(10k financed) and paying it off help bring that score up so I can qualify for some of the better interest rates?",finance
personalfinance,Paying off house vs mutual fund,"Good evening,

I owe $363K on my house. The goal is to pay it off in 10 years. My interest rate is at 2%.

I need an opinion on putting the extra money towards my mortgage or apply that money towards a mutual fund tracking the S&amp;P 500. I’m extremely disciplined, so I would not use that money for anything else. According to the math, it would help me pay off my house in 8-9 years.

Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Roth IRA Bank Questions,"Hi everyone! I’m fairly uneducated on a lot of this but I was wondering which bank is best to open up a Roth IRA. Is there a difference between the interest rates, and are there different types of Roth IRA’s you can recommend. I’m a student in my low 20’s with a good amount of capital saved up. 

Also if you recommend a 401k instead please let me know.

Thank you in advance! Means a lot!",finance

personalfinance,"To buy, build, or repair? That is my question.","I am 30 years old and married, only had 1 kid when we moved in. I have no CC debt, 2 car loans totaling about 20k and 12k in federal student loans. I also have 40k in my 401k but id rather not touch that. I bought our current home in early 2019 for $163k, put only 3.5% down and still owe pretty much the full amount. When I bought this home I was earning about $43k annually. Now we have a second kid and feel like our house is a little cramped (3 bedrooms and the nursery has become my office since i am now permanently remote) but the bigger issue is that our roof, furnace, and air conditioner will need to be replaced within the next few years and will probably total 30k to 40k. I now make $67k annually and dont have to commute. We are looking to buy, build, or renovate. 

Our neighbors just sold for 265k and our house has considerable interrior upgrades compared to theirs so im probably sitting on 100k+ of equity. We live in the midwest and have found some great homes for 300k-330k. We talked to a builder and can build a good house in our area for 350k but it wouldnt be our forever home, but still very big upgrade. I can also take out a home equity loan to make repairs on our current home but I dont know if its worth it. 

I feel like the new build will give me less bang for my buck especially considering i would need to sell now to lock in my equity and rent until it is built. Buying a home looks great, i just dont think i can afford a mortgage payment over 1600 a month ( i pay 1050 now) without making significant sacrifices. I worry that repairing my current home is just delaying us from moving from this house anyway. 

If we keep the current house and make repairs, should i consider making it a rental property when we move out? (Our neighbors pay 1850/month for their rental compared to my 1050/month mortgage) How does that work, does a bank just give me a 2nd mortgage for a new house? 

If we sell, how much equity will i really walk away with after closing costs and how much should i put as a down payment on a home or new build?  How much will my mortgage payment be on a $300k-350k loan?

Does one idea seem to be much better than the others? 

I have very little knowledge of finances and appreciate any advice.",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 8th, 2021","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 8th, 2021.

# **Stocks could soar to new heights in week ahead — even though inflation data may come in hot - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/stocks-could-soar-to-new-heights-in-week-ahead-even-though-inflation-data-may-come-in-hot.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could take aim at new highs in the week ahead, even as investors face fresh data that could show the highest year-over-year jump in consumer inflation in more than 30 years.
*****
&gt; Stocks touched record levels Friday, after a monumental week that included the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it will wind down its bond buying, the first big step away from the easing measures it put in place to fight the pandemic.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 2% for the week, endig at a record 4,697. The Dow, also at a new high, rose 1.4% to 36,327, and the Nasdaq jumped 3% to a record 15,971.
*****
&gt; “The important drivers of the market, I think, remain intact — earnings and interest rates,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “I think the Fed gave the equity market what it was looking for... which was an awareness of inflation without an overreaction to inflation. Meanwhile we’re still digesting what’s been a really strong earnings season.”
*****
&gt; The Fed expects to fully wind down its $120 billion-per-month bond purchases by the middle of next year. At that point some economists expect the central bank to start raising interest rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell assured markets the central bank still sees inflation as temporary, but that if it proves to be hotter, the Fed would act.
*****
&gt; “I think investors are sounding the all-clear for the equities market here, at least in the short-term, and it’s hard to argue with. We have more concerns when you take a six-month view,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; “The biggest concern is inflation which we don’t think is transitory,” he added. “I would look for a rate hike almost immediately after the tapering process is done which is mid-2022.”
*****
&gt; # The stickiness of higher prices
&gt; Donabedian said the concern is that sticky inflation could force the Fed to move sooner to raise interest rates to battle rising prices.
*****
&gt; The producer price index and consumer price index are reported Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Economists expect both reports to remain elevated for October. Headline PPI is expected to rise 0.6%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; CPI is expected to be the hottest post-pandemic print yet. Headline CPI inflation is expected to rise by 0.6% or 5.9% year-over-year, the fastest pace since December 1990. Core inflation, excluding energy and food, is expected to rise 4.3% year-over-year.
*****
&gt; “The acceleration in shelter costs is stunning so if you get that, along with energy price increases, we could see a 5.7% [headline gain],” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
&gt; Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said markets are already expecting the elevated inflation prints.
*****
&gt; “Markets right now have a certain amount of tunnel vision. Easy money will continue for awhile and even though the Fed has told us they’re not refilling the punch bowl, the party is going to go on for quite some time,” he said. “Right now the path of least resistance is higher.”
*****
&gt; # Fed officials not on same page
&gt; Central bank speakers will also be a highlight in the week ahead, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell appearing at two events. On Monday, he is at a Fed conference on gender and the economy. He speaks Tuesday at a virtual conference on diversity and inclusion in economics, finance and central banking, co-hosted by the Federal Reserve Board, Bank of Canada, Bank of England and European Central Bank.
*****
&gt; There are plenty of other Fed officials speaking as well, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, New York Fed President John Williams and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly.
*****
&gt; CIBC’s Donabedian said the group of speakers could be important, and it will be key to listen for nuances to their views on rising prices. “You do get some different twists on inflation. While it’s not going to look like an FOMC feud at all, it will look like members are not on the same page on inflation,” he said.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching Congress for any progress on the Biden spending plan, which is meeting opposition in the Senate.
*****
&gt; “It looks like we’re going to get some sort of vote in the House on the two big fiscal packages,” said Donabedian. He said he expects the House to pass both, and the infrastructure bill should be signed into law.
*****
&gt; “It does leave open whether the Senate is going to want to make major change to the social spending bill, and there’s a chance that that flops,” he said, noting it has less than a 50% chance of failing.
*****
&gt; The earnings season is winding down but there are still a number of reports in the coming week, including The Walt Disney Company on Wednesday.

&gt; # Best and Worst Performers Since the COVID Crash Low

&gt; The major indices have consistently been hitting new record highs over the past few days with the S&amp;P 500 having now more than doubled off the COVID Crash low on March 23, 2020. As for individual stocks, there are currently only nine S&amp;P 500 stocks that are below their levels from March 23, 2020, and expanding the universe to the S&amp;P 1500 which includes small and mid-caps, there are currently 41 stocks that are below their levels from that date. Obviously, March 23, 2020 may not coincide with a particular high or low point on these individual stocks' charts, but declines since then would be quite painful to handle given that the broad market has more than doubled over the same time frame.

&gt; As shown below, eHealth (EHTH) currently is the biggest decliner versus March 23, 2020 levels having fallen over 60% with a large share of that decline occurring this year. The only other stock that has been more than cut in half since the bear market low is Tabula Rasa HealthCare (STRA). TRHC has been declining since the spring, but a large share of that decline is actually occurring today after it reported an EPS and sales miss in addition to lowered guidance on earnings last night. Today, the stock has fallen nearly 50% in reaction to those weak earnings. There are a handful of stocks on this list that are up on a year-to-date basis with Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) the only ones that are up double digits. While below their levels from the bear market low, TR and FDP are also two of the only stocks that are simultaneously above levels from February 19, 2020 which marked the last high prior to the start of COVID Crash bear market.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-Below-Bear-Market-Low-1a.png))**

&gt; As for the stocks that have gained the most since the COVID Crash low on 3/23/20, meme mania darling GameStop (GME) still tops the list having rallied 5,492%. That is twice the rally of the next best performer, SM Energy (SM). As for the rest of the top performers since the bear market low, there are another 15 that have gained over 1,000%. One of those is a member of the trillion-dollar market cap club: Tesla (TSLA). Another one of these top performers, Tupperware Brands (TUP), is also one of the only stocks that is actually lower on a year-to-date basis, and those declines are significant at a 43.81% loss. TUP got below $2/share at its lows during the COVID Crash, but then surged back into the mid-$30s in late 2020. It has since moved back down into the teens.

&gt; # Rolling 10-Year Returns Suggest Modest Gains Ahead

&gt; The chart above of the S&amp;P 500 Daily Rolling 10-Year Returns Since 1940 indicates the rolling 10-year average return for the S&amp;P 500 is 6.64% as of the close of October 2021. For the 10-year period ending on October 29, 2021 the average annualized return for the S&amp;P 500 was 13.9%. The highest 10-year annualized return for the S&amp;P 500 since 1940 was 17.2% in August 2000 just after the dotcom bubble burst. Recent 10-year annualized highs occurred in March 2019 at 15.1% and on October 1, 2021 at 14.8%. As you can see from the chart whenever the rolling annualized 10-year returns get into the 15-range the returns over the next 10 years are more modest and trend lower. Gains over the next 10 years are likely to be lower and more in line with the historical averages in the range of 6-9% per year.

&gt; # Best Consecutive Three-Month Span Begins With November

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950) and NASDAQ (since 1971) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950), Russell 1000 (since 1979) and Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in all years ranges from 1.7% by S&amp;P 500 to a solid 2.5% by Russell 2000.

&gt; In post-election years, November’s market prowess is essentially unchanged. DJIA has advanced in 14 of the last 17 post-election years since 1953 with an average gain of 1.9%. DJIA has been up 11-straight post-election year Novembers. DJIA’s last losing post-election year November was all the way back in 1973 (-14.0%, Arab oil embargo began 10/19/1973). S&amp;P 500 has been up in 13 of the past 17 post-election years. Small caps perform well with Russell 2000 climbing in 8 of the past 10 post-election years, averaging 2.8%. The only real blemishes in the November post-election year record are 1969 (DJIA –5.1%) and 1973 (DJIA –14.0%, OPEC oil embargo).

&gt; # Typical November Trading: Firm Beginning, Tepid Across Mid-Month, Rally to Close

&gt; As the top month of the year for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979) and second best for DJIA (since 1950) and NASDAQ (since 1971), November has historically and frequently been a solid month for equity bulls. In the most recent 21-year period, average gains have even been improving for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. However, strength has not been evenly spread across the entire month.

&gt; As you can see in the following seasonal chart based upon daily performance over the last 21-years, November has typically opened well with nice gains spanning the first four trading days. Following this move higher the major indexes have tended to trade sideways and modestly lower until the last seven trading days at which point, they have historically sprung back to life and surged higher to close out the month. If you missed our Seasonal MACD Buy signal in October and/or are looking for a dip to add to existing positions, November may provide that opportunity.

&gt; # 36,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average started trading more than 125 years ago and yesterday it closed above 36,000 for the first time ever. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 (small caps) all closed at new all-time highs as well.

&gt; “We understand all of the worries. Labor shortages, inflation, the pandemic, the Fed, Washington drama, supply chain bottlenecks, and a slowing economy,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But the other side of the coin is earnings have been really good and the stock market is looking forward to better times, not looking in the rear view mirror at the bad news.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has hit five separate 1,000 level milestones in 2021, the most ever. Yes, the percentage between each level gets smaller higher you go, but this is still an amazing feat.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.3.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; What now? Well, the bull market looks poised to continue its run. In fact, when the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 20% for the year heading into the seasonally bullish month of November, stocks have never been lower—higher all eight times. The returns get better as well, up 3.7% versus the average November return of 1.7%. Not to be outdone, the final two months of the year have been higher all eight times as well, up 6.2% versus the average final two months return of 3.2%.

&gt; We’re thankful for the strong stock market performance this year, but there may be more to come before year-end. We continue to expect stocks to outperform bonds and maintain our overweight to equities.

&gt; # Historic Run For Consumer Discretionary

&gt; Recently we have made note of the massive outperformance of the Consumer Discretionary sector. Prior to this week, the bulk of the gains were a result of the rise in Tesla (TSLA), but this week, breadth has significantly improved as we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot. With more stocks in the sector participating in the rally, price has continued to move higher.

&gt; Yesterday marked one month from the recent low in price for the sector. Through yesterday's close, the sector had gained 16.11% over the last month. Moving higher yet again today as of this writing, the sector is now up 17.5% from the low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-SCOND.png))**

&gt; In the chart below, we show the rolling one-month performance of the sector going back to late 1989. As shown, the surge in the past month ranks in the top 1% of readings on record. It has been the largest one-month gain since April of last year when the sector was coming off of the bear market low. Prior to that, the only other period of the post-GFC era to have seen as large of a rally in one month's time was January 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-SCOND-1M.png))**

&gt; With the sector having gone on a historic run over the past month, it begs the question of how much gas may be left in the tank. Historically, when the sector has gained at least 15% in a one-month span without having done so in the prior three months, forward returns have been in line to slightly below average, although they are also not outright negative with positive returns better than half the time. Several of these prior occurrences happened around the time of the Dot Com burst, and performance following those periods was broadly negative.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-S5COND-Table-2.png))**

&gt; This week the sector has also crossed above a 13% weighting in the S&amp;P 500, overtaking Health Care as the second-largest sector in the index!

13. As promised at the Cardano Summit, Emurgo has already made seed investments into Milkomeda from dcSpark, Adanian Labs, &amp; ADAverse. [https://twitter.com/emurgo\_io/status/1442210147405684745](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io/status/1442210147405684745)

17. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano. [https://twitter.com/seal\_kiman/status/1443593563846193155](https://twitter.com/seal_kiman/status/1443593563846193155)
18. Adam Dean gives us a great post-mortem on the network load created yesterday by the NFT drop(s). [https://twitter.com/adamKDean/status/1443599818845081600](https://twitter.com/adamKDean/status/1443599818845081600)
19. Wow! It’s looking like Meld has landed a partnership with a mobile provider in Nigeria with nine million customers. Not many details out at this point (Sept 30). But, that certainly sounds like it could be gigantic. [https://twitter.com/MELD\_labs/status/1443548879966949382](https://twitter.com/MELD_labs/status/1443548879966949382)

21. Grayscale releases a report on Cardano which shocks many due to its (actually) fair reporting. [https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1443625454146097152](https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1443625454146097152) [https://twitter.com/cardano\_whale/status/1443786596721967104](https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1443786596721967104)
22. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It’s notable that Cardano’s Djed solves this. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-seeks-to-regulate-stablecoin-issuers-as-banks-11633103156](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-seeks-to-regulate-stablecoin-issuers-as-banks-11633103156)
23. The Biden Administration has announced they are investigating the prospect of regulating stablecoin providers like banks. [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/stablecoin-regulation-cryptocurrency-banks-biden-treasury-bitcoin-circle-tether-binance-2021-10](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/stablecoin-regulation-cryptocurrency-banks-biden-treasury-bitcoin-circle-tether-binance-2021-10)
24. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM. [https://twitter.com/thr33strikes/status/1444898320070086659](https://twitter.com/thr33strikes/status/1444898320070086659)
25. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a “what if” scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised. [https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1445059673401528328](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1445059673401528328)
26. The so-called “Pandora Papers” reveal globally widespread cases of wealth concealment by public officials and bring up the question of whether blockchains like Cardano should take this into account when dealing with nation-state regimes as partners. [https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/)
27. Remember! There is no mobile Daedalus wallet. There is no browser extension version of Daedalus. These are fakes! They will steal your ADA. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853)

29. The “Zombie Lobster” collaboration between Charles Hoskinson and Paul Oakenfold is actually getting coverage by the EDM media outlets! [https://edm.com/news/paul-oakenfold-album-cardano-blockchain](https://edm.com/news/paul-oakenfold-album-cardano-blockchain)
30. Sounds like we are getting close to the Cardano Summit NFT winners being announced. It’s still unclear how many actual winners there will be. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445672250435248131](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445672250435248131)
31. dcSpark releases some mockups from the experimental version of its upcoming Flint Wallet. The mockups seem to indicate that the wallet will allow for dApp interaction from hardware wallets.

32. Charles is interviewed in the Harvard International Review. [https://hir.harvard.edu/charles-hoskinson-1/](https://hir.harvard.edu/charles-hoskinson-1/)
33. We now have a PAB (Plutus Application Backend) pre-release. Hopefully that means PAB soon! [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1446589902674665473](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1446589902674665473)
34. The Biden Administration has revealed that it is considering an executive order to establish a government wide approach to crypto regulation. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/white-house-weighs-wide-ranging-push-for-crypto-oversight](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/white-house-weighs-wide-ranging-push-for-crypto-oversight)
35. The New York Times is now talking about the difficult balancing act the Fed has before it with high inflation and less than promising jobs data creating conflicting priorities. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/business/economy/fed-jobs-full-employment-inflation.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/business/economy/fed-jobs-full-employment-inflation.html)
36. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle. [https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1445465912375590913](https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1445465912375590913) [https://emmer.house.gov/2021/7/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-provide-certainty-for-digital-assets-under-securities-law](https://emmer.house.gov/2021/7/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-provide-certainty-for-digital-assets-under-securities-law)
37. Caitlin Long revisits the articles she wrote years ago about fears of circulation credit in crypto markets. Spoiler: it came and crypto did it to itself. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1446874905241210880](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1446874905241210880)
38. COTI is a licensed payment institution in Singapore. This could get very interesting given their status as the issuer of Djed and the ongoing Monetary Authority of Singapore Blockchain Challenge in which Cardano is a finalist. [https://cotinetwork.medium.com/coti-lists-as-a-payment-institution-in-singapore-666c6fcaaab4](https://cotinetwork.medium.com/coti-lists-as-a-payment-institution-in-singapore-666c6fcaaab4)
39. Goldman says Evergrande is nothing compared to the potential $8.2 Trillion problem with local government financing vehicles in China. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2021/09/30/goldman-flags-82-trillion-threat-worse-than-china-evergrande/?sh=3296c9d515cc](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2021/09/30/goldman-flags-82-trillion-threat-worse-than-china-evergrande/?sh=3296c9d515cc) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/beyond-evergrande-chinas-property-market-faces-a-5-trillion-reckoning-11633882048](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beyond-evergrande-chinas-property-market-faces-a-5-trillion-reckoning-11633882048)
40. Cardano isn’t wrong about Africa. It’s just first. Google is investing $1 Billion in African internet access over the next five years. [https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/) [https://twitter.com/ghostchainer/status/1445964578257395714](https://twitter.com/ghostchainer/status/1445964578257395714)
41. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) delivers an opinion piece that investors should be allowed to make their own decisions without SEC paternalism. [https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/11/perspectives/sec-commissioner-investors-regulators/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/11/perspectives/sec-commissioner-investors-regulators/index.html)
42. COTI has another AMA that reveals there may be more news soon for Djed. [https://twitter.com/theCOTIinvestor/status/1447546724868935684](https://twitter.com/theCOTIinvestor/status/1447546724868935684)
43. Heads up: scammers are posing as Yoroi support staff! [https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1446554949782016009](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1446554949782016009)
44. Catalyst Fund 6 has 711 projects on the ballot! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1448015757216976903](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1448015757216976903)
45. Coinbase is launching an NFT market. How will this impact the CNFT scene? Coinbase tells us: “...initial launch will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards with multi-chain support planned soon after.” [https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html)
46. Eric Rosengren (who recently left the Boston Fed) let’s us know that the Fed/MIT CBDC project is pretty far along and will release a working paper soon. This would obviously be impactful for all of crypto and for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/ivqFo9C2Jdo?t=409](https://youtu.be/ivqFo9C2Jdo?t=409)
47. The first project that actually looks like it may one day be a virtual world launches on Cardano and it already has a community built parcel explorer. [https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/](https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/)
48. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa. [https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830](https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830) [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08)
49. The Fed may begin tapering it’s Treasury and mortgage backed securities purchases in mid November. This is relevant for the whole economy including crypto. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/federal-reserve-releases-minutes-from-its-september-policy-meeting.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/federal-reserve-releases-minutes-from-its-september-policy-meeting.html)
50. Sounds like the Milkomeda sidechain is making good progress. [https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1448447729689059332](https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1448447729689059332)
51. Apparently, Putin kind of accepts that crypto might choose to exist. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/putin-defends-cryptocurrencies-amid-global-regulation-push](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/putin-defends-cryptocurrencies-amid-global-regulation-push)
52. Don’t forget: today (Oct 15) is the October Mid-Month Development Update! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1448715241961963520](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1448715241961963520)
53. Sounds like Binance was not allowing ADA withdrawals for some period of time. [https://twitter.com/Katsumoto87/status/1449723293632634882](https://twitter.com/Katsumoto87/status/1449723293632634882)

55. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan Müller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we’ll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)
56. Here’s video of the Fireside chat with Charles, Dynal Patel, and John O’Connor at the Cape Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative in South Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4&amp;t)
57. A brief update dropped from Charles this morning in Africa. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1450124410095030280](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1450124410095030280)
58. Duncan &amp; Sebastien have an interesting discussion on Github that fuels Cardanophobia on the part of ETH maximalists about three weeks later. [https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/3247](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/3247)
59. The Cardano Foundation is changing its delegation strategy. They will go from primarily delegating to promote decentralization to a new framework focused on delegating to promote ecosystem buildout. [https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-foundations-new-delegation-methodology-supporting-the-architects-of-the-future/79594](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-foundations-new-delegation-methodology-supporting-the-architects-of-the-future/79594)
60. Shahaf Bar-Geffen gives us some more details about the Djed launch. He says IOHK is doing the coding and COTI is doing the business side. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlPmIgJ0tE0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlPmIgJ0tE0)
61. In the Cap Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative Fireside Q&amp;A, Charles mentioned he is talking to Colossol Labs about the possibility of having the Mammoth DeExtinction Project take place on his bison ranch. There are probably some obvious NFT or tokenization use cases there. [https://colossal.com/mammoth/](https://colossal.com/mammoth/) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4)

investing,Congress passes $1.2T infrastructure bill,"Congress has passed a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, delivering on a major pillar of President Joe Biden's domestic agenda after months of internal deliberations and painstaking divisions among Democrats.

The final vote was 228-206. Thirteen Republicans voted with the majority of Democrats in support of the bill, though six Democrats voted against it.
The bill now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law, following hours of delayes and internal debating among Democrats on Friday, including calls from Biden to persuade skeptical progressive members of the Democratic caucus.
The legislation passed the Senate in August, but was stalled in the House as Democrats tried to negotiate a deal on a separate $1.9 trillion economic package, another key component of Biden's agenda that many Democrats had tied to the fate of the infrastructure bill.
The legislation will deliver $550 billion of new federal investments in America's infrastructure over five years, including money for roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package includes a $65 billion investment in improving the nation's broadband infrastructure, and invests tens of billions of dollars in improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion would go to building a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers, according to the bill text.
Biden called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just before midnight to congratulate her on the passage of the infrastructure bill, a source familiar with the call tells CNN. On the call, Pelosi thanked Biden for his help in getting the bill over the finish line as well.

Bitcoin,"JPMorgan bullish on bitcoin: Long-term rise to $146,000 expected if volatility drops significantly","Invesco [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) \- JP Morgan recently released a report that delves into digital assets. In the report, JP Morgan predicts that Bitcoin could rise to $146,000 in the long term if Bitcoin volatility diminishes and institutions begin to prefer Bitcoin to gold in their portfolios.

&amp;#x200B;

JP Morgan believes that bitcoin is competing with gold for investors' attention as a hedge against inflation. The bank also believes that bitcoin is also a scarce product, meaning that it will rise even as inflation erodes the value of other assets.

&amp;#x200B;

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JP Morgan, said, ""There seems to be renewed interest in buying bitcoin as a hedge against inflation as investors' concerns about inflation resurfaced in September and October this year. In particular, gold has failed to respond to inflation expectations in recent weeks, which has strengthened the appeal of bitcoin as an inflation hedge.""

&amp;#x200B;

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou added that given the younger generation's preference for cryptocurrencies, the competition between cryptocurrencies and gold is set to continue as they gradually start investing. ""Given the sheer size of gold's investment, any outflow from gold to cryptocurrencies implies a lot of long-term upside for bitcoin.""

&amp;#x200B;

However, JP Morgan also noted that for Bitcoin to achieve its long-term price target of $146,000, then its volatility would have to fall significantly. The bank noted that bitcoin is about four to five times more volatile than gold, and volatility would have to fall significantly as institutional investors flock to the space.

&amp;#x200B;

The bank noted that bitcoin volatility would have to fall sharply before institutional investors would flock to the space.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin was not very volatile after the Federal Reserve announced its interest rate resolution on Wednesday and is now trading at $62,449, down about 0.95 percent on the day.",cryptocurrency

Just to put a decent deposit down. 

I feel like having that first home is less of an investment  and more a neccesity so it would be a good thing to have 
taken care of at a young age. 

House prices increase by an average of about 5% a year in UK at least. 

Crypto has increased by about 300% in the last year.
But with a house I'd be getting 5x leverage and I don't leverage trade for crypto. So I'd be getting around 25% on my initial investment. And interest rates are super low so hrs mortgage would be cheap as chips.

Also the fact crypto has gone up a lot lately, makes it less likely to happen again soon right? So I am tempted to go for the house, stop paying rent as well which will save me 1k a month. 

On the other hand, I could miss out on some glorious gains to come. So maybe I'll keep a fraction of my crypto, sat 20%. Bit of a predicament, ideas??",cryptocurrency

However - with everything going on in China recently, the relentless US spending and size and the risk all the PE money is chasing just to ensure some return has me worried.

About three years ago, I traveled through China extensively and felt that they had one of the biggest real estate bubbles in the world. The interest rates and economic growth only needed a small catalyst to expose the buddy system that had created these large developers and regional government and lending partners.

If Chinas manufacturing index, real estate bubble, crack down on various industries this year come to bear fruits and experience a prolonged recession, it will affect Australia, Europe, Southeast Asia, Japan and ultimately the US.

investing,Richard Bernstein - 5 Conditions of a Bubble are Present: Are we in a Bubble?,"I first want to state I don’t know if I agree with Rich or not but I value his insights and he makes a compelling argument. Second, bubbles are inherently difficult to time and identify because they can persist longer than we may think is rational. I have only been loosely following Rich and his team for a few years because they seem to offer good contrarian points of view and those are valuable to get. Anyone that has long term experience following Rich may be able to provide feedback on his track record. 

RBA’s team has identified 5 characteristics found in every financial market bubble and they lay out how each one is present in today’s market in the US. I’ll lay out their 5 points and the underlying rationale for each with supporting charts from RBA. 

1. Increased Liquidity 

The Federal Reserve has provided enormous levels of liquidity in response to COVID as evidenced by the simple growth in money supply. However this liquidity has been trapped in the financial markets due to bank’s lending and capital restraints implemented post-GFC. Since bank lending is supposed to be the mechanism through which monetary stimulus gets into the economy, their lack of high margin lending from low interest rates has inhibited money from leaving the financial markets. 

[M2 Money Supply](https://imgur.com/a/eNzFzhp)

2. Increased Use of Leverage

The increased use of leverage is indicated by the number of investors who have borrowed money to invest in the stock market. RBA references a survey from MagnifyMoney that showed 40% of individual investors have borrowed money to invest in the stock market. Almost half of those that borrowed has borrowed at least $5,000.

[Individual Investors Debt survey](https://imgur.com/a/M0uuYHR)

Investors have also added leverage through the increased use of options. Option volume still remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. 

[Retail Option volume](https://imgur.com/a/ArLgTut)

3. Democratization of Markets

Every bubble has a component of “everyone gets to play”. Chat boards, increased ease of trading, and meme stocks all make this quite evident. Below shows how trading has shifted to individual stocks, leverage is on the rise, and Google searches are driving option volumes. 



[Democratization of Markets](https://imgur.com/a/BGGEoeI)

4. Increased New Issues 

Investors’ desire to hold stocks or the bubble asset grows and the amount of new issues in a market grows significantly during bubbles. Cheap financing and issuance costs are driving the flood of SPACs and IPOs. Many of these new issues are tremendously speculative and serve the issuer more than the investor. The number of SPAC IPOs and the size of them have both popped. 

[SPAC volume and size](https://imgur.com/a/etMKycD)

5. Increased Turnover 

Trading volumes tend to rapidly increase during bubbles like day trading popped during the Tech bubble and flipping houses became the rage during the housing bubble. 

[Total Trading Volume is elevated](https://imgur.com/a/pylJXwh)


RBA goes on to emphasize this does not mean the entire market is at risk. They point out only 3 sectors have outperformed the market over the last 3 years (Tech, Comm Svc, and Cons Disc). The rest of the sectors and small-caps have been left behind. 

[Sector Performance](https://imgur.com/a/I8TvxAl)

Lastly, the bubble assets usually take a long time to recover. It took the NASDAQ 14 years to recover from the Tech bubble. 

[NASDAQ post Tech bubble](https://imgur.com/a/oWtA3B7)

However, they also demonstrate timing the bubble is not necessary. You could have been 3 years early selling bubble assets and buying the undervalued segments of the markets and still came out ahead during the Tech bubble.

there are valid criticisms to these points but we as humans can often justify why this time is different when it may not be. So are we in a bubble or are markets really changed forever?

personalfinance,Start savings/investment advice (US),"From the sale of our previous home I've cleared all personal debts (except for a car payment of $250/month which I'm thinking about refinancing and paying ~$400/month). All of my bills (mostly just mortgage and electrical/gas, etc.) will come to ~$1800/month (this is my ""half""). I'm paid biweekly and net about $2300 per paycheck, so I've got a plenty left over. 

I've also got additional cash that I'm going to get from exercising stock options with my company (we're a small company and our stock is rather volatile, and given the nature of my business - biotech - I don't think it's a good idea to hold onto stock for very long but rather than sell it as soon it's profitable to do so).

I have an IRA currently as well as a 401k through work, so I think what I'd like to do is put my extra cash into something that will earn interest and not just stuff it into a mattress or have it languish in a savings account (which feels like throwing away money lost to interest rates being lower than inflation). 

I do want a good amount of this to be liquid so that I can access it if there's an emergency. I've also got two kids and for expenses like braces, etc., and ultimately college, I want to be able to access it.

What are some options I should be considering?

I'm at the mercy of people who don't seem to know what the hell they are doing and all I want is money that is legally mine so I can invest it for my youngest.

**""We're doing everything in our power to combat inflation. We're using all possible measures that we have. The only thing left to do is pray""**

CryptoCurrency,Sooner the better...,"As we all know, the sooner we can move over into the blockchain cryptocurrency system, then the sooner we can get rid of the FIAT system altogether. One of my major issues (among many) with FIAT currency is the ability to remove large amounts of cash from the system and hoard it somewhere, never to be spent again (inflation is a hedge against this sort of thing but not reliable at all). That is lost productivity and efficiency that is not circulating in the economy and also a potential liability if someone in the future finds that cash and injects it into the economy all at once (it would have to be A LOT of cash but still is a very real possibility).

Smart currency, by definition, manages itself. So there won't be any lost productivity or efficiency since the blockchain will fix that for us.

The Federal Reserve Bank's role of attempting to control prices and keep the economy stable is extremely volatile and unreliable, and since the Fed controls the dollar by removing cash and inserting cash into the economy with little to no oversight then you can look at the Federal Reserve Bank as a more inefficient, terribly managed, irresponsible version of a ""blockchain"" for the dollar.

**But it's even worse than that.**

Saule Omarova, the nominee for Comptroller of Currency (under Secretary of Treasury- Janet Yellen), wants to control the banking system entirely through something she calls ""The People's Ledger,"" which will give the Fed the ability to take money out, and insert money, into your bank account at will in order to ""control inflation, stagflation, and inequality."" This is literally an absolute, terrible version of a centralized cryptocurrency, and if she gets her way that could threaten the potential of moving society over into the blockchain.

Monthly expenses:

Housing: ~700$, 600$ for my share of rent and ~100$ for utilities (wifi, electricity, and rent insurance)

Transit: ~100$, MAYBE. I don’t own a car and use public transit, which is free in my town (socialism is good). This is a liberal estimate for the occasional Uber, chipping in for gas when getting a ride with a friend, and buying a train ticket to go somewhere a bit farther to visit out of town friends ~once a month. 

Groceries: ~120$ I’m vegetarian which really cuts down on grocery costs, and I also love to cook. 

Eating out: ~120$, this is the occasional meal with friends, a pizza when I’m absolutely too lazy to cook, and getting a cup of coffee during breaks 

Misc Toiletries and other necessary things: ~60$ again this is a liberal estimate, things like buying toilet paper or dish soap, maybe some new underwear or socks, also the cost of laundry 

Student Loan: 97$, I have one private student loan remaining at a pretty low real interest rate (it might even be negative after accounting for inflation and tax deduction). So I will pay the minimum on this loan for the foreseeable future. 

Retirement: 500$ My employer does not offer any 401k/3b or similar plans, so I’ve been saving enough the prior year to deposit 6k in my Roth on Jan 1 for the new year. 

Self Care/Fun Money: ~150$, I’m not forgetting to “live” as I do book myself a massage once a month and also do things once a weekend with friends (e.g. get a drink, watch a movie, go bowling) but we tend to like the free things like going hiking. 

Total monthly expenses: ~$1850, let’s round round up to $2000 just for this exercise, to account for overspending and savings towards larger goals (maybe a vacation etc)

I’ve already saved up 12k for a six month emergency fund. Right now I’ve been investing the remaining 3k/month in a taxable brokerage with index funds and have almost 100k in the account alone (being really disciplined and not selling during the Covid crash helped!).

ethereum,The case against toxic eth maximalism or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Orange Coin,"**Background**

To be clear, this post is about eth maximalism as it relates to antagonizing btc. I’m not criticizing eth maximalism as it relates to other smart contract platforms as I believe that’s firmly warranted. Rather, I’d like to take a btc-focused perspective to clear up what I believe are common misconceptions on this and related eth subs, why I think the maximalism is unwarranted and what’s in it for such maximalists to be more open-minded. 

Recently I’ve read (and posted) in some threads re: the flippening (which I feel have become more frequent) and some common btc critiques seem to be that it’s slow in its evolution or boring and eth does everything better so btc is doomed to fall off the leaderboard. Others then chime in with affirmations which reverberate off the echo chamber; dissenting viewpoints seem to be ignored or not welcomed. To me this feels like a bunch of tribal apes walking around with one mutterring “blue coin good, orange coin bad!”, and the rest of the apes cheering and clapping, with some clapping against the ground or doing a mini-handstand of sorts with the feet kicking up, and others joining in to yell “orange coin is meme coin like dog coins!” (or other such FUD, the proverbial poo fling of the crypto world). 

&amp;#x200B;

**What’s special about btc?**

I do not mean to insult by using the ape analogy, it’s just a funny image and I am one of you apes (and I don’t mean this in the WSB-style of ape of which I’m not a big fan, I’m just keeping with the theme mentioned above). I first got into crypto by buying btc a few years back and then quickly discovered eth. Eth excited me much more and while I didn’t sell or stop buying btc (or eth), I favored eth to where today it’s about 2x of my btc stack. After btc’s resurgence earlier this year I started listening to what that guy Michael Saylor had to say and started going down the btc rabbit hole in a much more earnest way. I don’t want this to be a deep dive into “why btc” as this post is already getting too long, and I’ll instead leave some recommended reading and listening links at the bottom, but the main conclusion I want to highlight is that btc is the best store of value and hardest money that’s ever been invented, in large part because of its extremely predictable and reliable monetary policy (its supply schedule and fixed scarcity). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why does that matter?**

The global economy is in many ways being manipulated by central banks to an unprecedented degree, and as fiat purchasing power dissipates, investors look for safe stores of value to maintain (or hopefully increase) their purchasing power. Gold, at \~$11trillion or 10x the current market cap of btc, has historically been one of the best stores of value, but investors are beginning to favor btc as a superior store of value, a digital form of gold for today’s digital world. 

However, there are hundreds of trillions of dollars in additional asset classes which are also used as stores of value - sovereign debt (bonds issued by nation states, such as US treasury bills), real estate, equities, etc, and many of these have a much poorer real return when considering real inflation (which is on the rise, due to the money printing by the central banks). Bitcoin is increasingly eating up the market cap and monetary premium (i.e., the ‘increased’ market value of an asset such as real estate that is placed on it because investors believe it’s a store of value or investment, above its intrinsic market value as a house to live in) which accounts for its growth and why its market cap and price will continue to grow, as game theory predicts that if consensus grows that btc is the best store of value - it’s in everybody’s best interest to buy it while they can / before its price continues to rise. I believe this accounts for some of the explosive price growth that is being predicted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Where does this leave eth?**

I believe investors favor btc as a store of value over eth because frankly, eth has a lot more moving pieces and a much less predictable monetary policy (because the exact issuance and burn mechanism are not well known, and because there are changes being introduced in the first place), and these are seen as added risk which they seek to avoid. As a store of value, btc, plainly, is the best store of value there is (and I’ll stay out of the ‘currency’ / ‘medium of exchange’ war though I do think lightning and other layer2 solutions are very promising for btc). Where does that leave eth? Well, eth can have nearly everything else! As the best (at least for now\*) smart contract platform / decentralized world computer, the possibilities are nearly endless, and eth should also accrue tremendous value and continue its meteoric rise alongside btc. It’s incredibly hard to quantify and predict what that value will be - all I’m saying is that btc isn’t going to fall out of favor, and while the flippening may well happen - it is very far from guaranteed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why does this ruffle the feathers of eth maximalists?**

I think for 2 main reasons:

1. Identity and values - Generally, I think beyond those who are in it strictly for speculative investment reasons, eth attracts engineers and developers who appreciate its technical merits and possibilities, and therefore find btc boring. Btc tends to attract libertarians / political science types, economists and others from the world of finance and business. I’m generalizing here and there is of course plenty of overlap and counter examples, but this has been my observation based on consuming plenty of content over the years. These 2 camps are often not very interested in what the other is interested in, and fail to see the big picture of what makes each of them special. 
2. Financial - I think Michael Saylor used this analogy in one of the podcasts I listened to: imagine when Apple and Microsoft were really going head to head in the 80s and 90s, if instead of that rivalry being based on just consumers’ preference for their platform of choice, those consumers were also each given shares of stock in each company. Now there is a lot of financial motivation to get really riled up about the other side. I think the same thing happens in crypto, where big believers of particular coins have a lot to gain and lose by the rise and fall of various coins, and that can intensify their reactions when a “rival” coin is getting all the attention and/or price appreciation.  


**What’s in it for you to be more of a mediumist?**

1. \*Financially, a hedge in case eth loses its dominance as a smart contract platform - I believe eth and what is planned on its roadmap is enough to maintain dominance and increase the lead against anything out there today. But just like many tech giants who have fallen over the years, what if something new comes along that may possibly be truly better? We may think it unlikely but it’s not out of the real of possibility. I believe btc on the other hand has a much, much surer bet of remaining the preferred store of value digital asset - while it only does 1-2 things (today), it does them extremely well. While both btc and eth are going to continue to surge over the long run, btc is much more likely to keep its value while eth, frankly, may one day be dethroned - you can see this in the way that barely anyone is trying to replace btc for what it does well, while eth is continuously surrounded by competition, some of whom are even giving it a bit of a run for its money in some ways (though none of whom have a better story for the trilemma, at the moment). Therefore, holding some btc in your portfolio is a way to continue to grow it at incredible rates, but I would say in a slightly safer way than it is to hold eth and in a much safer way than it is to hold any other crypto assets outside of btc and eth.
2. Sleep better at night - instead of being threatened or angered by positive developments for the orange coin, you can now be happy too!
3. Follow really interesting developments - as mentioned, while there is little changing in terms of new use cases on btc, there is a tremendous amount of change in how the world is adapting to btc - some really interesting game theory, economic, geopolitical, human rights / values discussions and changes taking place. If that’s not of interest, that’s fine, but there is a lot going on .
4. A healthier community - it’s a shame that a post such as this, or really, nearly any mention of eth on r/bitcoin would be instantly deleted and the user likely banned, but that’s because they’re on the other side being scared of the blue coin for good reason. We can at least be a healthier community with a more open mind without needing to bring up FUD or talk badly against the orange coin because the orange coin is actually pretty cool.

Feedback and discussion are welcome, but please, let’s try to keep the poo flinging to a minimum.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is The New Real Estate,"BTC is ""the new real estate""

&amp;#x200B;

When the Bretton-Woods agreement happened, the legacy finance system we know today was set in motion, and all global currencies were to be pegged to the US dollar with exchange rates set. This, combined with the removal of the gold standard, set in motion an inflationary economy based on a simple principle:   


Infinite growth based on the exploitation of finite resources.

&amp;#x200B;

Logic dictates this will fail. Not if, but when.  


The rest of the world was duped into believing that ""by decree"" US dollars were valuable. See also, [fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).  
Now, [fractional reserve banking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5xDzTvW6E) combined with Fed QE is eroding the dollar faster than ever.   


Many people that want safe haven assets use real estate, with a philosophy that there will only ever be a certain amount of inhabitable property or land on this planet, and while the number of people in the world continues to grow exponentially, the demand for such product will increase over time and become more valuable with a larger number of individuals competing for a finite amount of that resource. Supply and demand.  


Now, papa Elon and others have plans to take us off-world. I believe there is a greater than 0 probability that people will be able to buy real estate on other planets within my lifetime (I'm 31). I'm not saying that is super likely for the average person, but there is a greater than zero probability.   


With the fixed supply of BTC written into the code, there is a 0 probability that more BTC will ever be produced beyond 21 million. There is an almost certain probability that someone, somewhere, at some point in the future will lose their keys. That just makes everyone else's coin worth more as Satoshi pointed out in the BTC whitepaper. BTC is the only mathematically verifiable, cryptographically secure, finite resource in the known universe.  


According to Savills, the total value locked in the global real estate market was $326.5 trillion in 2020.  
Offshore financial havens are said to hold up to $36 trillion in cash, gold, and securities.   


As the US Government continues to overspend and inflate the US dollar, and global confidence continues to decline, all of this capital is going to begin to look at alternative places to be stored.   


We are still so early.

personalfinance,Buying a car cash vs leasing it and investing the money,"Hi all,

I am currently in the following position. I want to buy a car that costs around 51k USD. I can either pay it cash right away, or I can lease it at a 2% interest rate and then buy it outright at the end of the leasing or returning it to the dealer.

Normally I would say that buying it outright is cheaper, but what if I:

A. Lease the car at 2% interest rate for, say, 36 months, 0 USD down payment, 870 USD dollars per month and some 22k USD residual value
B. And then invest the 50K USD right now on some ETF with an expected return rate of, say 8%

I understand that the 8% is not guaranteed etc etc, but I can bear the risk and the 870 USD per month are sure considerable, but they don’t stretch my budget that much.

Am I missing something, or the expected return of investing and leasing is greater than buying the car outright? Of course, at the expense of more volatility.

If I invest 50K with an 8% return, I can expect about 63K USD after 3 years. These are 13K USD of expected return. If I did the maths right, this means that the leasing (with final purchase) would cost me the following:

870 USD x 36 = 31310 USD
+
22500 USD
————
53810 USD total car cost after the 3 years leasing period is over and I buy the car
- 13000 USD (expected gain from investing the 50K at the beginning of the leasing period)
———
40810 USD total car cost

Sure with the stock market it could go either way, but if it drops I simply don’t sell my ETFs and wait longer…as long as necessary: I don’t need that money now.

Am I wrong? Thanks for any input",finance

CryptoCurrency,Passive Income in Crypto vs Traditional Savings,"Here’s something I don’t think gets nearly enough attention. The difference in the amount of money one can make through rewards/interest in crypto is so far beyond what is possible in a traditional savings account. With everything from staking rewards to shitposting on this sub to earn moons with actual value to Coinbase earn opportunities, there really isn’t even a comparison to earning passive income in traditional banking. Especially since some banks have gone to NEGATIVE interest rates. 

Sure, HODLing crypto is more volatile than stashing one’s money away in a savings account. But when one accounts for inflation, the choice to move away from centralized banking becomes so much more attractive.

CryptoCurrency,Will there a bear market or no bear market?,"A crypto bear market is one in which the value of major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have fallen at least 20% from their recent highs, and are continuing to fall. By contrast, a crypto bull market is one in which the major cryptocurrencies are on the rise.
One of the most famous crypto crash occurred in December 2017, when Bitcoin fell from almost $20,000 per coin to just over $3,200 in a matter of days. After that, it rallied, reaching a price of nearly $65,000 per coin in April of 2021, before dropping again to below $32,000 in May.

One of the most famous maxims in all of investing is “buy low, sell high.” In four words, it’s how investors make money. And it’s why, for crypto investors, knowing when a bear market is coming, or when one is just about to end, can make all the difference.
This is where the relative youth of the crypto market makes things difficult. With the stock market, economists, analysts and traders have decades and even centuries of data to sift through to find the trends and triggers that occurred just before a bear market turned to a bull and vice versa. Bitcoin, on the other hand, was launched in 2009.
Some warning signs of a crypto bear market include:
•  Lower trading volume: This could indicate that people have begun holding their coins amid market uncertainty.
•  “Backwardation”: This occurs when the price of an asset in the futures market is lower than its current market price.
•  Death cross: This is a technical indicator in which an asset’s 50-day moving average crosses its 200-day moving average

Even though crypto’s history has essentially been a very lengthy bull market followed by a short, terrifying market free-fall, and another market bull run, some trends have popped up for investors to watch.
•  Liquidity. Crypto took a hit at the beginning of the lockdowns in spring of 2020, when investors needed cash. But so did everything else. Then it rose, as the crisis receded and the Fed pumped trillions into the economy, aiding in Bitcoin’s liquidity and other cryptos alike.
•  Adoption: If more companies and financial institutions adopt crypto, then it should move more in step with the economy, and be subject to less violent fluctuations. It’s a sign that the Wild West is being tamed. But adoption is a double-edged sword. If it’s your cab driver and barber who are talking about crypto, then it could mean that the market is over saturated

Like all assets, cryptocurrencies go through cycles in which their value rises and falls. For short-term investors, especially, knowing the signs of a bear market can help you create a portfolio strategy that makes sense for your risk appetite and financial goals.",cryptocurrency
dogecoin,I finally got my lost Doge from 2014!,"For the last 6 months or so, I have been trying to re-gain access to my Doge stored for 7 Years in MULTIDOGE, for which I had forgotten/lost the password. I now am the proud owner of 100k Doge. (Securely stored on Ledger).

I wanted to share my experience to give anyone that is going through what I have been through, to persevere, and never give up! 

Below is my journey that eventually led to gaining access to my lost Doges—first, the back story. 

In 2014, I was initially looking into Bitcoin and thought it sounded interesting. There was not a massive amount of information online, plus everything was a little bit sketchy. Strange websites selling this imaginary magical thing that ‘would be the future of currency’. During my research into Bitcoin, I come across Doge. I instantly loved the coin and what it stood for. I didn’t have masses of money to throw away at the time (IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN), but I knew that I wanted a large amount of something. That would be cool, right. 

I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be awesome if I bought 100,000 of this funny coin thing, and someday it was worth £100,000’. Something I can forget about and look back at in 10 years!

Off I went browsing the internet to buy my £32.00 of Doge from some mysterious website that no longer exists.

I set up my MULTIDOGE wallet on my Macbook and received the funds. COOL. I have 100K Doge! Now I need to lock it; I’m reading online about the risks and people getting hacked, thinking this password needs to be strong. So I created my password, wrote it on paper, filed it, and forgot all about it.

In the following years, I moved house twice, split up with partners, changed jobs etc. Not only that, I changed MacBook, using Time Machine to transfer all of my data over to the new device. Amazing how life changes, and you can forget you even did something. 

Fast-forward to 2021.

In the lead, up to the Doge ATH, an old friend said to me, hey, do you still have that Doge you told me about once? I said, oh heck yea I do… I think. He says you might want to check that. Look at the price of doge now it’s going to the moon. WOW.  

So, I got home, loaded up my Mac and looked for the MultiDoge app. Let the games begin. The first stumbling block, MultiDoge, won’t open. After looking online, I found that it was no longer in use, and I couldn’t find a download anywhere. 

Days passed until, brain wave. If I go into my time machine and go back to 2014, I may find the original files. So I looked through my downloads folder, and there it was, multidoge-0.1.2.dmg. IT ACTUALLY INSTALLED AND WORKED. 

It loaded up a wallet, with 0 balance, but one which I had named. I thought it was all over. 

Over the next few days, I looked through the time machine files for more clues. I had read online to look for the .key and wallet files. I couldn’t find them anywhere. I searched by created date, as I knew the date of the transaction. I then read in a Reddit post that there are auto backups generated, but they are stored in the Library folder in a hidden directory. 

THIS MUST BE THEM!!! I copied the various .wallet and .key files onto a USB ( At this point, I’m double-checking everything I do, making backups of literally everything ).  I opened the new .wallet file inside multi doge. After some time, there it was. I was so happy to see the 100k balance. Now I need to transfer it, right?! 

Nope. The wallet was protected by a password, and after reading online, I learned that the.KEY file was the private keys that I could use to access my doge, and they could even be imported to a new wallet. The keys were automatically encrypted with the same password that I set for my wallet. I also learned that I should have stored the un-encrypted keys on a USB stick or something. 

I tried entering thousands, no exaggeration, THOUSANDS of passwords in that thing. Manually typing them into MultiDoge, writing them down. I got the same error over and over again. 

“Could not decrypt bytes”

After weeks of racking my brain for more passwords that I may have used, I was becoming certain that it was random. That I would have used some online password generator. I was screwed. 

I looked through every piece of paper in every corner of my house, shed, loft and draws, no luck. I thought the doge was gone. Just give up. 

A week or so later, I changed my mind. I can’t give up on this yet, and I had a few more combinations of passwords in my head. So I started entering passwords again, then wait, what. That was weird. The error is different. 

When I entered a specific password, MultiDoge returned a different error. Upon testing, the error was indeed only coming up with that one password.

“Provided AES key is wrong”

Am I close?? Is it that password, but with different letters/symbols? That was enough to fuel me on. I might get this! 

For the next couple of days, I entered hundreds of more combinations of that password before thinking; there must be a program that could do this for me. Some script that can run combinations of this password. Surely that is a thing.  

After reading a Reddit post from 2016, I learned about a program on GitHub called BTC Recover. I’m no dev, but I know a thing or two about basic code and thought I could give it a good crack.

I downloaded the script, followed all of the steps with precision, researched what I was doing and learned as much as possible, so I was fairly confident in getting it right. 

All I can say is, BTC Recover is INSANE. This crazy script was able to produce passwords as I had never seen. Combinations of letters, symbols and words depending on the information you feed into the .txt documents. It can also test them against your .key file and lets you know when it is successful. 

However…3 Months pass 

I have learned this program like the back of my hand. Run my computer for months on end and tested every conceivable combination of the password that was returning the ‘ AES Key ‘ error. My computer is slowing down. It’s starting to freeze sometimes when running the script. I have even fired up my old gaming PC and installed BTC recover on that, too, for additional password cracking power. 

It’s time to give up now, surely?

My girlfriend is fed up. It’s all I have talked about for months. I was drained, and my brain hurt. I could visualise the day that I downloaded MultiDoge, the pen in my hand, and the piece of paper. The folder put it in. I had looked through photos of my old house, anything that might jog my memory.

But then It dawned on me. I have been trying the same password (with combinations) for the entire time. What if it wasn’t anything to do with the AES Key error, and that was just a bug in the program?

I started again with my .txt files, writing down every password that I have ever used and every symbol that I would consider using inside those passwords. 

I run the file.Twenty seconds later, the program stops running. I think, ahh heck. It's frozen again. 

Nope. There it was. The password is staring right at me. THAT'S IT, OF COURSE. I walked out of the room. I didn’t know where to put myself. 

The password was something that I use regularly but with COMPLETELY messed up symbols inside it. I would have never guessed it, not a chance. 

Finding the password was one of the best feelings I have ever had. I was elated that my persistence had finally paid off. 

I opened Multi Doge again, entered the password, boom, it unlocked. I was able to transfer it the next day using a paper wallet online to a ledger. (which I had just ordered on Amazon Prime). I had to do it this way as MultiDoge would not connect to anything. I believe it has to download the blockchain or something to operate. 

I had no intention of selling when I got the password, so I am not going to. I just wanted to know it is there when my “in 10 years it could be £1” moment comes.

Big love to everyone on this sub, the creator of BTC Recover, and the dozens of posts that helped me get the information I needed. 

I hope you enjoyed my story and that this post can help someone else retrieve their Doge :)

CryptoCurrency,"If global currencies will be backed by BTC you are going to be filthy rich with only 0,1-0,001 BTC","**Gold Standard**

The appeal of a gold standard is that it arrests control of the issuance of money out of the hands of imperfect human beings. With the physical quantity of gold acting as a limit to that issuance, a society can follow a simple rule to avoid the evils of inflation. The goal of monetary policy is not just to prevent inflation, but also deflation, and to help promote a stable monetary environment in which full employment can be achieved

So the advantages of the gold standard are that:

1. it limits the power of governments or banks to cause price inflation by excessive issue of paper currency
2. it creates certainty in international trade by providing a fixed pattern of exchange rates.

**Why did it failed then?**

With World War I, political alliances changed, international indebtedness increased and government finances deteriorated. While the gold standard was not suspended, it was in limbo during the war, demonstrating its inability to hold through both good and bad times. This created a **lack of confidence** in the gold standard that only exacerbated economic difficulties. It became increasingly apparent that the world needed something **more flexible** on which to base its global economy.

So if Bitcoin solves:

1. scarcity
2. flexibility 
3. transparency
4. reliability 

Then it’s only a matter of time before it becomes fundamental layer of global economy and new monetary policy. And when that happens you better of holding some. 

It’s just mind blowing for me personally that both you and I live in the time when some guy, or group of people, solved all of those gold related problems that we had for **5000 years**.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How do bond ETFs react to changes in interest rates?,"Here's something I've been thinking about. I'm sure there's some error in logic there, so I would really appreciate if someone told me where I'm making a wrong leap in logic.

What is the ""expected"" result of knowing that new bonds will be emitted at a higher yield in the near future (low risk ones, say government quality), due to something like rising interest rates? Price of already existing bonds should go down,  that makes sense, and because the ETF is formed from those bonds, the price of the ETF goes down too.

Here's a contradiction I don't get - a bond ETF continually buys newly emitted bonds. Once you buy it, you own a share of the fund, and you can assume new bonds will be bought. After interest rates rise, new bonds will likely have better coupon percentages, and this would seem to imply that the price of the ETF should also go up.

So what actually happens if the global average interest rises/bond yields go up? Which of the above is right/wrong? How exactly and with what money do the ETF managers buy new bonds?",finance

My work is completely remote so I am allowed to relocate to anywhere in the PST timezone. I'm considering moving to the Portland Metro Area (currently looking at Vancouver WA) and buying my first house. 

I have no credit card debt as of a few days ago. I own about 10,000 in federal student loans and 11,000 in private students loans (refinanced at 4.25% interest or payments of 250 a month over 5 years). I have a high credit score (close to 800). I have thousands of stock options currently valued at 70K but I expect my company to at least triple in value in the next few years. The stock options won't fully vest for another 3.5 years.

I have a little over 10k in my 401k.  I would have more in savings but I had some bad luck in the past few years (unemployment from ex-girlfriend calling my work with slander , had to relocate multiple times across the country without reimbursement for work,  unexpected medical bills,and a few other things).

I spend a lot of time and money on personal development and I expect to be making 150k+ when I am ready to change jobs. I have interviewed with companies offering 200K but I turned down the final interviews because I wasn't ready to change jobs yet. I don't have any doubt that in the next 5 years I could reach a 200K+ job that is completely or partly remote. 

The houses I am looking at are in between 250k to 350k range. I don't want to spend more than 1500k and I want to use the WA state downpayment assistance loan or if I buy in oregon I can take out a loan from my 401k. I am planning on to lease out one of the bedrooms for extra income.

I leaning toward Vancouver WA because of the lack of income tax but I am also wondering if I should be buying now. I am going to put 3% down with a loan and interest rates are probably going to rise in the future.

economy,Question about Build Back Better and Supply and Demand in Pre-K Education,"As title says, I have been trying to understand how 'free Pre-K Education' impacts supply and demand in the market.  I initially had this question about community college but that has been taken out of Build Back Better proposals.   

As far as I understand the proposal create federally subsidized demand but does not speak to supply.  Perhaps there are supply incentives that have not been publicized.  But I only see the implication for payments or credits to pay for pre-K for qualifying families.  

Now, I was thinking about the analogy of food stamps.  Food stamps do not distorts the grocery market.  But food stamps are small in size relative to the total grocery market and you are buying many small items so the impact on the price of any one items is negligible.

Pre-K education on the other hand is one large thing.  Obviously more supply will need to be created.  Is the potential for creation of pre-k schools so large that the increased demand can simply be easily absorbed?  How is price determined?     

I have not seen any discussion of this aspect in the press.  I only see worry about the cost to federal government.

EDIT: Update on this, I found information online.  it seems like this would not be direct payment to families but would be administered through state government who would provide grants to pre-k providers who admitted eligible families.  Further it sounds like states would set price based on average of existing price in the state.",finance

I cashed out $51k from my 401k in September to help secure an affordable mortgage on a new home after I moved job and state. I'm sure there will be many opinions about that in the comments but it's already done and I am happy with the decision. Moving on...

I know come tax time I'll owe that $5K from the 10% early withdrawal penalty. However I have been considering purchasing an electric car that qualifies for the $7500 federal tax incentive plan for about 3 years now, and with the new job and city I live in it would be a really good move. 

The biggest question here is would the $7500 tax break from buying the car help cancel out the 401k tax penalty? If the tax penalty is somehow unable to be avoided, then I would wait another few months to a year until I have the money for a more substantial down payment to make the monthly payment slightly more manageable. If the tax break does cancel the tax penalty, then I would push to purchase the car before the end of the year in order to take advantage of the situation. I hope that's clear.

Occasionally out of the blue over the 2 years she would have her moments were she would have diarrhoea lasting several weeks, constantly making the runs 5-10 times a day. We went to 3 vets over the course, check her blood for virus, did feces tests and nothing found that would cause this issue.

After leaving her at a cat boarding place while I was away from town they fed her hypoallergenic royal canine, on coming back to town and picking her up, noticed her feces were solid so I switched her to the hypo royal canine, it seem to work for a while until it happened again.

The TLDR is they added 6045(G)(3)(D) which defined was a digital asset is, and it's basically anything ""**any digital representation of value which is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology**"". And they changed 6045(g)(3)(B)(iv) to make digital assets into a security.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as far as the ding. Securities Act of 1933 is what we now have to worry about. This site puts it into normal speak instead of the legal speak [https://invest-faq.com/selling-unregistered-securities/](https://invest-faq.com/selling-unregistered-securities/)

Here is the legal speak [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77e](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77e)

In a nutshell, if you as a holder sell unregistered securities or if something else like an exchange does, then you get federally ding. Note I'm not a lawyer, and there is limits and what not. But with how complicated the law is, I think most would rather stay miles away from it.

The TLDR from above is unless if this is changed. This can be used as a way to ban crypto from the USA without actually banning it. Like the SEC can just not approve any crypto. And then there is a problem with things like NFT which I will get into below.

\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

Now people outside of the USA might be thinking, well at least everything on our end is fine. NO!!!!

So what happens is this includes NFT. NFT is basically a smart file and the definition doesn't state a difference between a private blockchain or not.

Example:

Company A contracts company B to build or do something. But the QA or other paperwork needs to go on the blockchain for security or other reasons.

Company B follows the contract so they can get paid. Note the

&gt;**any digital representation of value**

If the gov or others wanted to go after the company they can say the NFT that was made to comply with the contract has $ value (note it doesn't define value. Value could be $ value or other types of value).

Now note

&gt;**which is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology**

The NFT they made once created goes to the blockchain which comply with the contract. This clearly matches with the thing above.

And since company B was doing this for company A if you take a look into the broker changes in the bill.

&gt;(D) any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person

(from my understanding the word person legally can reference a company)

This means company B is now an unlicensed broker trading an unlicensed security. This means not only company B broke laws under the Securities Act, they most likely broke state laws (each state can have it's own security laws and broker laws), but also they broke the laws dealing with unlicensed brokers

&amp;#x200B;

# What should've company B have done?

Well this would require pretty much all companies like company B to be a licensed broker.

Also, this would require the SEC to approve of a NFT as a registered security before it was even made and many cases even thought of.

&amp;#x200B;

This will harm manufacturing industries, accounting, retail shopping, gaming industries, and many many many others that are looking at using the blockchain to help secure info and make sure people aren't modifying files or screwing with things.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Do you want to know the kicker?

**cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology**

An argument could be made cloud services and from there your hard drive is a similar technology. So this means ANY encrypted file that the gov can argue has value is a security.

&amp;#x200B;

Something you can do is share this with any political reps because this lays out how this 1 thing in the bill kills real world use, and possibly trillions of dollars. And it makes us far less secure.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Traditional IRA vs Roth IRA: financial implications only,"I have been struggling trying to figure out if the traditional IRA is better than a ROTH IRA strictly from a financial outlook. I understand there are many other benefits to a ROTH IRA, more flexibility to take out money before retirement, no required distributions at age 70.5, etc. What I am trying to pinpoint if the pure dollar amount of my investment accounts will be more with the traditional or ROTH. For the sake of argument, pretend I am already maxing out my 401k and HSA accounts. Here is my math:  


My tax bracket is 22% federal + 9.3% state. This means in order to fund $6,000 into a ROTH IRA I would have to earn $8,733. With a  traditional IRA I would have to earn $6,000.

In both cases the traditional IRA and the ROTH IRA will contain the same amount of money at retirement, since they both receive $6,000 per year in contributions.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to compare apples to apples, let's say I invest the difference between the earned income it takes to fund both accounts in a taxable account. $8,733 - $6,000 = $2,733. 

So then this $2,733 will get taxed at the stated tax rate, which will leave me with $1,877. [I looked around](https://calcxml.com/calculators/inv02?skn=#results) and it seems that an 8% return in an untaxed account is equivalent to 5.3% returns in a taxable account. So that means, after 30 years the taxable account should have roughly  **$96,041.18** .

Each of the IRA accounts (since they were funded with the same dollar amount per year) Should be worth roughly  **$457,419.72** 

With the Roth IRA strategy, I will have $457,000 in spending capital

With the Traditional IRA + taxable account strategy, I would have $457,000 + $96,000 = $553,000 in funds. However, this amount will be taxed.

It seems to me that it might make sense to go with the strategy that gives you the pure higher amount. My thinking is, the money will continue to grow, albeit at a much lower rate, in retirement. So, even though the distributions you take from the account will be taxed, the money might go further since a higher total amount invested will generally return higher total amounts .

&amp;#x200B;

This post is about how I see this bill changing mining, staking, and a few other things.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the parts we need to focus on.

 This is added to say what is a broker.

&gt;\`\`(D) any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.''

This is added to say what is a digital asset (in a nut shell anything with value on the blockchain)

&gt;\`\`(D) Digital asset.--Except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, the term \`digital asset' means any digital representation of value which is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology as specified by the Secretary.''.

And another part makes this into a security.

NOTE: I'm not a lawyer, I'm just an average dude trying to figure out this broken corrupt system and how it found a new way to screw me.

# Mining, Staking, Defi

From the looks of it is mining pools and so on could be considered as a broker. This means, if they don't have a broker licenses then they could be breaking those laws.

As far as the $10k thing. They might be able to get around that by doing something like $8k value of transfers. There is a ton of legal speak, but I think it's $10k per transfer has to be reported in 15 days or they break a federal law. But if that is right, then if they keep the transfers below $10k value then this is a loop hole. So say if you want to transfer $11k of assets from the mining pool. It could be broken up in several transfers. They could even make a TOS saying they will only transfer up to x amount per day.

Now as far as crypto being a security or not. If it is, mining, staking, and even DeFi shouldn't be ding as far as I can tell. You're not buying or selling the crypto with them. In fact, under them it's currently under income tax (hopefully no tax at some point) and not capital gains tax. (I'm not an advisor or CPA)

In fact as far as I can tell with DeFi the loans there is no rule saying they can't loan unregulated securities. But again, I'm not a lawyer and there is a metric ton of legal speak in the law.

# Reflections

Coins/tokens with reflections this is up in the air. For those of you who don't know, reflections are coins/tokens that takes part of the transfer fee and gives it to all holders based on the amount they hold. Think of it like a UBI where it's like a cash back that sends to all holders.

It could be argued many ways on this one on if they need a broker licensed, what happens with the $10k thing, and so on. 

# Exchanges

Centralized exchanges it's a 100% on this one as far as I can tell. Like it's pretty obvious this targets them in needing to be a broker. And it is obvious that if crypto does become a security then they can be ding for selling/buying an unregulated security.

But decentralized exchanges is tricky. In theory you can say no one runs the exchange. But in another look at it, they can say the groups that run the sites own it.

# YOU

It's also up in the air if you would ever be considered as a broker. To my guess not because it says ""...responsible for regularly providing..."" and you're not regularly providing anything.

So this brings up the question if you need to file the paperwork for the $10k thing because it appear it is just for brokers.

As far as the security laws, you need to look into it because even many states have their own laws on this. And this means you could be breaking both federal and/or state laws by simply selling your crypto.

# If you work for a company and get paid in crypto

It looks like the company would be a broker, and obviously would have to file the $10k thing. But chances are they would have the crypto sitting in some bank and the bank should take care of that.

CryptoCurrency,Review of the top crypto credit/debit cards available,"If you love crypto and plan on holding for a long time, why not get crypto back on every purchase? Here's my take on the top crypto credit/debit cards on the market.

## 1. Coinbase debit card
this one is my go to. Choose whether you'd like to receive 4% back in XLM or GRT, or 1% in BTC or ETH. As a debit card you have to load it before you use it, but 4% back in XLM is arguably the best deal on the market currently. Rewards are deposited into your crypto wallet as soon as the transaction clears. I recommend converting your XLM into ETH or BTC every so often for no fee, but if you want to convert it to a stable coin, there’s usually a 2$ fee

##2. Crypto.com debit card
Crypto.com requires you to stake a certain amount of crypto.com coin for 180 days to be eligible for one of their cards. They have 5 different card tiers and how much CRO you stake for 180 days determines which card you are eligible for.

|            Card               | CRO staked | CRO rewards |
|-------------------------------|------------|-------------|
|        Midnight Blue          | $0         |     1 %     |
|          Ruby Steel           | $400       |     2 %     |
|   Royal Indigo/Jade Green   | $4000      |     3 %     |
| Rose Gold/Icy White | $40,000    |     5 %     |
|           Obsidian            | $400,000   |     8 %     |

Other rewards include 100% back on prime, Spotify, Netflix, and 10-12% CRO staking rewards for the top 3 cards. Rewards are paid out only in crypto.com coin. I don't own this card yet, but I personally think this tier based system offers a great deal If you're willing to hodl CRO. CRO has risen more than 80% in value in the last month, and with Matt Damon's recent crypto.com commercial you better believe they're raking in new users. I've got my eye on the Jade card but haven't pulled the trigger yet. 


## 3. BlockFi credit card
I've been using this credit card for about a month since I got it, its a metal card that just looks and feels great. It offers 1.5% back in BTC on every purchase and your BTC rewards are deposited into your BlockFi account once a month. As a bonus, for the first 3 months you'll receive 3.5% back on every purchase. I like the card a lot but my biggest complaint is that you can't pay off your balance with crypto from your BlockFi account.


## 4. Gemini credit card
This credit card is still on a waitlist but plans to reward its users in their choice of BTC, ETH, or 40+ other cryptos. Compared to the flat 1.5% the BlockFi credit card will offer,  Gemini will give its card holders 3% back on dining, 2% back on groceries, and 1% back on all other purchases. I'm on the waitlist and am considering getting the card when its released, primarily for the bonus on groceries and dining.

## 5. Celsius credit card
Also on a waitlist, Celsius has recently announced it will be offering a crypto credit card. Celsius and BlockFi are both dominating the CeFi market and offer some of the best interest rates in crypto. Celsius typically has better rates than Blockfi but it's close. It's rumored to offer 2% back to compete with the BlockFi credit card. Just filled out a survey for Celsius regarding this card and am following closely for any news on when it'll be released.

personalfinance,"[HELP] Got new job, making 5-year plan, how to organize finances?","My wife and I are looking to set up a meeting with a financial planner, but I wanted to go into that potential meeting with some or most of my homework done.

We got married in March of 2020 and filed jointly for that year (I believe). We refinanced her (now our) house from a 30 year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage (where I'm now the primary name on the loan and she's the co-borrower, for whatever reason). We currently still have pretty separated financial setups:

- both use WF for savings and checking
- I have an additional savings and checking with USAA
- we both have our own Roth IRAs with separate institutions (that we both max)
- 401k accounts with employee matching (that we both max)
- I just recently made her an approved user for my Apple Card (but not a co-owner, though I may do that too)
- I have a Savings account with Navy Federal

Now that I've just gotten a new job we want to do what we realistically should have done a year ago, which is consolidate all our accounts and put our money in the proper places. My thoughts are:

1. open a HYSA and Checking with Ally to use as our primary accounts
2. keep our individual WF accounts but minimize how much is kept in them (enough to not incur fees and enough to be useful in a pinch - thinking about $1-2k between the accounts, so $4k total between the two of us)
3. I'll keep my USAA accounts because our auto and home insurance is done through them and they offer better rates if you autopay with a USAA account
4. I'll keep my Navy Federal account for the time being, but I'm not sure if there's any real advantage to having it

In addition to the above we want to save for a new house (5bd, 3+ ba). We live in central CA and houses like that in our area look to be going for ~$750k right now, and we figure that'll be closer to ~$1M when the time comes. Based on my new salary we should be able to live entirely off my take-home income alone, allowing us to save/invest my wife's entire salary. **What is the best way to do this?** If we just let it sit in our new HYSA we'd have ~$200k+ in 5 years, but I imagine there has to be a better way to safely grow that to put us in a better position to have more flexibility when the time comes.

Additionally we're thinking about potentially selling our current house which Zillow says is worth ~$415k, so my 5-year estimate is we could sell for $450-500k. We'd owe about ~100k, and would then give her parents 20% of the sale since they put in the initial downpayment. We'd be left with ~$250k, which we could use to buy the new home, leaving us with everything we'd saved for the past 5 years. This would allow us to do any home improvements we need/want, set up our safety net (~$50k), set up college funds for children (expecting 2 by this point, if all goes according to plan), and create a net new retirement account (addition to our IRAs and 401ks) with a decently sized initial principle amount that we could then continue to contribute most of my wife's salary to.

My new job's compensation: 160k base salary + 19% annual performance bonus
My wife's compensation: 93k base salary

We don't expect the numbers to line up the way we've thought about them, just rough (very rough) ideas. We know that the children will take up a decent amount when they come, but we're hoping we can maintain all the savings numbers and just limit our discretionary spending. We also know that realistically we won't be contributing my wife's entire salary to our retirement but we're hopeful that the vast majority of it can be.

Does this make sense? Are we over complicating it? How can we simplify things?

CryptoCurrency,Thought from a (former?) crypto skeptic,"Apologies in advance for the incoming wall of text, I'll do my best to make a good TL:DR.  
Over the past \~year I've begun having a change of heart about cryptocurrency in general. The weird part is, it wasn't really anything that happened in the crypto world that did this; it was actually because of the finance/banking industry. I'm not going to go on a diatribe about rampant inflation and shady practices on Wall Street as that horse is already very dead and requires no further beating. Instead, the point I'll bring up is the ability of payment processors and banks to gatekeep businesses from the internet. We saw it earlier this year with Onlyfans almost going the way of Tumblr with a porn ban based on pressure from their payment partners. Something similar happened to Pornhub last year with major credit card companies disallowing payments to Pornhub's owner, Mindgeek. And it's not only porn companies having issues, it's any ""risky"" industry like gambling, alcohol, marijuana, and lending/banking. Payment processors have the ability to control what businesses can accept payments on the internet, effectively gatekeeping what is allowed to thrive.

So, what does this have to do with crypto? A decentralized system can escape the oppressive control that payment processors have on the internet by making it possible for everyone to essentially control their own payment processing. Granted, wallets could possibly implement ways to try and become the new gatekeepers, but 1) I don't see that being a popular idea and 2) there are plenty of wallets to compete with that would love to take your risky gambling/porn/whatever money.

Now, why am I still skeptical? I want to be very clear: I hate the CURRENT state of crypto, but I am very interested in its possible futures. Right now, the biggest problems I see can be summed up as:

1. There are many, many more people getting in to cryptocurrency to get rich quick or for trading/investing/HODLing than there are actually using it for any purpose as a currency. Simply as a store of value, cryptocurrency does nothing to address the problems that I think it both can and should. Also, this attitude of buying crypto to get rich leads to the scam stories that we hear every day (looking at you, Squid Games) and pushes it ever further from widespread adoption.
2. The environmental impact of PoW right now is just absurd. Bitcoin maxis like to point out that the entire Bitcoin ecosystem uses less than half of the power of the traditional banking system while forgetting (or ignoring) that Bitcoin processes a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the transactions that banks do. Crypto needs a better way to go forward without consuming exponentially more and more electricity.
3. PoS sounds like a decent solution to the energy usage concern of PoW, but my biggest problem is that it just seems like another system where the rich get richer just by virtue of already having the money to stake. Granted, PoW has this same problem with the computational arms race is creates, but PoS does nothing to fix this. Growing inequality is one of the largest problems the developed world is facing today, and any cryptocurrency implementation is going to have to at least think about this. I wish I had a solution to this, but frankly it's a complex problem for people far smarter than me.
4. The cryptocurrency ecosystem feels like it is ignoring all the lessons learned in relation to banking/monetary policy/economics of the past few centuries. We have a mix of hyper-inflationary coins being held up by hype cycles, and coins with built-in deflation which is touted as a feature instead of being recognized as a massive liquidity problem. This is a big one for me, because it reminds me of problems I see all the time in my line of work. As a software engineer, a lot of us feel like any problem we encounter we need to solve with code. It appears to me this is exactly what is happening, where we have some unarguably brilliant programmers making decisions far outside of their wheelhouse without consulting people with the required expertise.

I think I have rambled enough here. I wanted to see if there was anyone else that had similar thoughts to me here. Alternatively, you can yell at me and tell me why I'm wrong. Either way, I'd love to hear your input. Specifically, I'd like to hear about what is currently being done/can be done to address the issues that I listed, or if I am way off-base in identifying the problems of the current crypto ecosystem.

TL:DR - Crypto has a few key problems that it needs to address sooner rather than later, but the current state of the banking system and payment processors has created a golden opportunity to address these issues and bring new people in to the ecosystem.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Staring down a new home purchase as part of a job move and having a miniature freak-out. Could use some perspective on whether or not this is a good idea.,"My partner and I are relocating for my new job and started the search for a new house (east coast US). The market is super challenging, and our first visit to the new location didn't yield ""the one"", and we have another visit scheduled to see one or two more properties. I need advice; we're both in our mid thirties and staring down a 500k purchase which is one heck of a psychological barrier. Our current home we bought for roughly 300k after 4 years in an apartment, it's 2100 sqft with a big unfinished basement, 3br/2.5ba. We just had a baby and downsizing really isn't an option. Here's our financials at a glance:

* Income: $150k Gross

* 401k Contribution: $21,500 (this crept up and I need to back it down to the federal max)

* Monthly Net Savings: ~$2,250

* Current Mortgage Payment: ~$1,450 (originally $1750 before refi, hurray new rate!)

*No debt, including CC/Student Loans/Car Notes

The proceeds from our home sale will net $100k after all is said and done, and this is a conservative estimate based on selling at the listed value. We're hoping for $10k-20k more. For the new house, we're anticipating staying in it longer than 6 years, so we're planning on paying 3-4 points to lower the rate even further. We're targeting about a 25% down payment, and all tolled the equivalent sized home where we're heading, and with today's market, will run approximately $2,000/mth based on a $500k purchase.

We'll take on ~$550/mth additional outflow. I'm the sole income for now but my partner is interested in going back to work in ~5 years which would greatly alleviate strain. I can also back down my 401k temporarily to the company match which would save approximately $750/mth, in the event of an unforeseen burden. This is obviously not ideal, but we are fortunate and the balance has reached the point where the growth outpaces my contribution.

Is this price point smart for us? Am I missing something? $500k is a big number, and we come from fairly humble beginnings. We are also weighing moving into an apartment temporarily until the market improves, which could never happen. I need some perspective. Thanks!",finance

The bank account and cc are actually pretty solid, with somewhat generous rewards on the cc and also the debit card, and a low interest rate.

The one concern I have is that the credit card has a $30k limit. I was surprised that they would allow me to have a card with this limit, since I have pretty much no credit history and this is my first credit card. I guess the limit was just part of the alumni deal, so that bypassed any sort of check that would have otherwise denied me.

I'm not sure whether I should call to have the limit lowered or just let it be. I'm generally fairly responsible with my money, and I don't forsee myself getting into trouble with it, but who knows.

Could having this amount of credit available benefit me in any way down the road? I'm saving up to buy a car, and I'll probably get a loan for about half of it.

Now imagine being able to own 5 USD of it instead of shelling out 100 or 500 or 1000 USD bare minimum. Compound that with the fact that inflation (for at least this year) outpaces the most traditionally safe investment federal ""high yield bonds"". We then shape a new narrative. Non-crypto people would say, ""People only buy bitcoin under the assumption they can sell it to someone else for a higher price.""                 

**I was NOT involved in crypto for the 2009-2013 run up.** However, one thing we can take strong notice of (because hindsight is 20/20) the broken theme of that run up is, ""There was only one centralized marketplace to buy bitcoin from."" I did get involved in 2017, and I noticed the theme of that time was ""Everyone making sure their exchange is easy to access and thus become an easy method to acquire bitcoin or whatever crypto users want to buy."" My own personal take is that the theme following the ""next cycle"" (Or at least after the next bitcoin halving, this is my own personal belief, no one else's) will be, ""Every exchange wants to make sure their customers are happy, so they will make sure that they can use lightning to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin."" and I highly believe this will happen before, during, and accelerate after, the 2024 halving.                 

Jack Mallers and Strike are already pioneering this idea, and that is why El Salvador was able to make bitcoin legal tender. You use your debit card to purchase $5.00 of bitcoin and you get 5 USD of bitcoin on the lightning network with no additional fees. I recommend you guys start preparing, because services like Strike will become ""The standard."" **If your nation's currency is going to continue to lose value over time, you'll need the cheapest method to buy bitcoin on lightning and this is exactly the reason why bitcoin will continue to rise.** Complimenting that last sentence, one of the most popular sayings in the bitcoin community is, ""Bitcoin has no top because FIAT has no bottom.""

personalfinance,Refi out of FHA into conventional - questions re condition of property and appraisal. Long Post,"Hi, we bought our house about 6 years ago. It is a very old house, over 100 years old, that is a long-term property for us. We knew we were were going to have to improve it over a number of years but it has good bones and is located in a good neighborhood. It is a two-family house, with an additional in-law suite. Our long-term goal is to stay in the house until retirement (about 15-20 years from now) and then retire elsewhere and either sell or more likely rent out the available units as an income stream. The house needed and still needs a great deal of work. We are in a very high valued property area, right outside New York City, and feel like this might be a good time to refi. However because of the work that needs to be done on the house I am concerned about the appraisal process. There is is work that needs to be done both inside and outside the house. For example we have a deck and a shed that need to be replaced. In addition there is work that needs to be done in our unit, primarily cosmetic,  because we have been focusing on doing improvements on the rental unit and exterior where we can get a tax break. If you look at Zillow and other appraisal sites, my house is valued very high. However I recognize that those have to be taken with a huge grain of salt. I think crunching the numbers it's worth it for us to move into a conventional loan with the interest rates being what they are and getting out from under the PMI. However I'm concerned about starting the process of refi and getting a low valuation on our property and it not being worth the costs of the refi and hard pulls on our credit. I am at a complete loss about whether to proceed, how to proceed, etc. Do I just throw caution to the wind and start the process? Then the issue is who do I go with? Do I just pick the lender with the lowest rate or try a couple of lenders? I don't want to tank our credit scores with too many pulls as we are both  in the mid 700s and too much score movement might adversely affect the interest rate. Any insight or advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Opening a savings account for my infant son (US/Australia),"Hello,

I hope this kind of post is allowed. I’m trying to become more financially literate, so I’m sorry if this post seems dumb.

I’m a US citizen living in Australia since 2016 with my Australian husband and child (has US and Aus citizenship). We’ll be travelling back to the US in Jan for the first time since he was born earlier this year, and I’d like to open a savings account for him when we go.

I still have a Charles Schwab account from when I lived in the US, which I’ve used to continue to pay off my student loans, etc. I’ve already received $600USD for my son from family members. They sent me checks by mail, which I deposited into my own account (for now) via the mobile banking app.

I’m wondering if anyone has any suggestions or tips on the best way to go about this? Bank recommendations? Any other criteria I’m missing? I’m looking for a bank with an app that allows mobile deposits, no fees, and a great interest rate. My parents live in Maine, that’s where we’ll be staying, so ideally a bank with branches in the northeast. 

My goal in opening this account is to deposit any future USD gifts from family, plus if he ever wants to move to the US when he’s older he’ll have those funds to help him. Would love any tips/advice.

Thank you!",finance

17. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

22. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It’s notable that Cardano’s Djed solves this.

24. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya.

25. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a “what if” scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised.

30. Sounds like we are getting close to the Cardano Summit NFT winners being announced. It’s still unclear how many actual winners there will be. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445672250435248131](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445672250435248131)

35. The New York Times is now talking about the difficult balancing act the Fed has before it with high inflation and less than promising jobs data creating conflicting priorities.

36. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle. [https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1445465912375590913](https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1445465912375590913) [https://emmer.house.gov/2021/7/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-provide-certainty-for-digital-assets-under-securities-law](https://emmer.house.gov/2021/7/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-provide-certainty-for-digital-assets-under-securities-law)
37. Caitlin Long revisits the articles she wrote years ago about fears of circulation credit in crypto markets. Spoiler: it came and crypto did it to itself. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1446874905241210880](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1446874905241210880)
38. COTI is a licensed payment institution in Singapore. This could get very interesting given their status as the issuer of Djed and the ongoing Monetary Authority of Singapore Blockchain Challenge in which Cardano is a finalist.

45. Coinbase is launching an NFT market. How will this impact the CNFT scene? Coinbase tells us: “...initial launch will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards with multi-chain support planned soon after.” [https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html)
46. Eric Rosengren (who recently left the Boston Fed) let’s us know that the Fed/MIT CBDC project is pretty far along and will release a working paper soon. This would obviously be impactful for all of crypto and for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/ivqFo9C2Jdo?t=409](https://youtu.be/ivqFo9C2Jdo?t=409)
47. The first project that actually looks like it may one day be a virtual world launches on Cardano and it already has a community built parcel explorer. [https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/](https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/)
48. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa. [https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830](https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830) [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08)

55. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan Müller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we’ll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)
56. Here’s video of the Fireside chat with Charles, Dynal Patel, and John O’Connor at the Cape Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative in South Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4&amp;t)

59. The Cardano Foundation is changing its delegation strategy. They will go from primarily delegating to promote decentralization to a new framework focused on delegating to promote ecosystem buildout.

61. In the Cap Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative Fireside Q&amp;A, Charles mentioned he is talking to Colossol Labs about the possibility of having the Mammoth DeExtinction Project take place on his bison ranch. There are probably some obvious NFT or tokenization use cases there.

CryptoCurrency,What will be the cause of the next financial crisis?,"Many say the crypto market is overleveredged and overvalued. I agree. The current crypto space echos the dot com bubble. Many projects valued at tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, with little to no revenue. Stablecoins having huge mkt caps with little to no cash reserved and backed by ""commercial paper"", and this is just the tip of the iceberg. 

The housing market in '08 crashed due to surprise mortgages and Wall Street going crazy on MBS, CDO's and false insurance ratings. 

The US currently has interest rates at near 0%, and has been at 0 for thevladt 10+ years. The US has printed 20-40% of all money ever printed in the last 12 months. Inflation is crazy high, despite what the FED says, and a forcasted slowing economy is coming.

CryptoCurrency,These books will change your life and show you earning opportunities in Crypto.,"I am posting this as many would benefit from these book projects that time has been spent on.


The First book is ""The Infinite Machine” by Camila Russo.

It explains the decentralized supercomputer Ethereum, that is growing faster than the internet. Many people have heard of Ethereum but don’t understand it for its complexity, buying Eth is one thing, but understanding Eth will change your trajectory in life.

You will learn :
-How Ethereum was created and the problem it solves.
-How smart contracts automate busineses and spotting investment opportunities.

This book takes you into the future of the technology,  and the minds behind how Ethereum started.



The 2nd book is “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous.

Most people FOMO into Bitcoin without understanding it, whereas Bitcoin changes the entire financial system.

Whether you buy Bitcoin after reading this book doesn’t matter. What matters is that this book will help you understand money and crypto.

If you've read them, share with the young people around you, the teens, your kids, your family, it can open portals of opportunities for them.

Bitcoin,Bitfinex has frozen $130.000 since February Support Ticket [#469901],"After bitfinex personally deleted all my posts on their page within 2 minutes I will try it here!
It's been more than half a year with headaches before I now decided to go public.
Bitfinex has frozen my account after a withdrawal request of about 2.1 BTC in February. By my standards that is a huge amount of money. Money I would have never dreamed of when starting with crypto to be honest. Back in the days (my account is multiple years old now) I used to trade crypto to crypto only. I have never encountered any problems concerning deposits and withdrawals at bitfinex back then. I probably wasn't anyone special to them because I was only juggling around a couple of thousand dollars a year (depending on the crypto prices).

Anyways, as we all know crypto prices rose immensely in the beginning of this year. That was when I decided to withdraw my coins. Upon request they claimed to have frozen the account because of an automated KYC procedure. As much as I understand it, you would only need to verify if you started trading fiat currencies. I did not do that. However, I thought it might just be some security feature to protect me as the account owner. After all, this wasn't ""peanuts"" anymore and because it was (and is) so much money for me I happily agreed to verify.

Since then I ran through an odysse of providing documents and declarations of all kinds. Some of them were super private.
They wanted me to proof my identity, which I did. The standard procedure with passport and proof of address.

After that they wanted a proof, where I got the very first coins from that I deposited many years ago. Those coins they never cared about for so many years while letting me do many deposits and withdrawals in the meantime.
Since I originally bought those bitcoins 6 years ago together with my old roommate that was quite a task. We found the transaction and sent them all necessary files and transaction data.

But not enough. I now had to proof that he was actually my roommate, which was quite difficult too because we don't live together anymore. Because of data protection regulations the landlord from back then needed a signed request from both of us in order to hand out the proof to me. (It's no joke, GDPR is taken serious in Germany.)
To clarify: I verified myself and my old room mate. I did not forge any documents and I did not lie anywhere throughout the process.

I finally send them the proof from the landlord.
Not enough again. I now had to proof that I went to school with that roommate. So both of us had to send them our school certificates also.
Not enough again. They suddenly started asking me about other withdrawals from 3 years ago. I proofed that I sold the crypto for cash and transferred the cash to my bank account a week later.

After that, they told me to wait again. That was almost 2 weeks ago. No reply.

I'm just so tired of this. Just angry, exhausted and worried. By now, they probably know more about me than most of my friends and family. Financially and in general. Plus they have copies of my entire identity from A to Z. At the beginning I thought it's really just a way to prevent my account from getting robbed but after all I'm just worried about their real intentions.

To bitfinex:
Please give me back my account and stop this shady practice.

To the community:
What else can I do?

UPDATE 1: Their support contacted me and is willing to unlock my Account if I upload yet another selfie in high quality. Instantly did it and they told my I will get full access within the next ours. I am hoping so much that all this really might be over soon. 
Thank you for your support peeps.

2 UPDATE: After all i got back the full authorization to withdraw my coins. You can't imagine the stress relief after 9 month. Immediately transferred all crypto to my ledger wallet. Thanks to bitfinex to finally solve the case. I think it's an remarkable coincidence, that I got my account back a few hours after i went public.
You really shouldn't do that to your customers. I will draw my consequences from it and never come back.
Massive thanks to the community, guess I owe it to you! That's the power of Internet! 😇🙏🏼

They also deleted the repost from their subreddit again. No bad blood but in my opinion those guys are legit criminals! Better stay away from Bitfinex.
I know many people who have the same unsolved struggles with them. My luck was that this got posted on the bitcoin subreddit so they had to to something.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Recently re-financed my mortgage &amp; now my county tax office has sent me a delinquent tax notice. Options for possibly removing escrow going forward? (VA loan in Georgia),"Back in September I re-financed my mortgage (VA loan in Georgia if that's relevant), took about 30k out for remodeling the master bath and got a lower interest rate. I must have done it at just the right time because this weekend I got a delinquent tax notice from my county tax office. Had a feeling this might happen because after closing the old servicer for my mortgage sent me an escrow refund for about the same as what my property taxes are. I called the new servicer at the time but they assured me that they were going to be paying the taxes. I'm assuming something got lost in the paperwork transfer and they probably assumed the old servicer had already paid the taxes, annoying but I'm not too upset about it. 

My main question before I call the servicer and tax office this morning is this; Can/Should I use this as a chance to remove at least part of my escrow going forward? I'm able to pay the taxes myself out of savings now, and I don't think I'd have any issue saving throughout the year going forward. I'm just not sure on the rules/standards as far as escrows and VA loans go, I'd ideally like to still pay my insurance through escrow and just pay the taxes myself but not sure if that's possible. Any tips on what to bring up to the servicer or how to word my request would be appreciated. I'm also hoping when I call the county tax office and explain the situation they'll take off the $100-ish late fee.",finance
investing,IMO the market is strongly underestimating the magnitude of rate hikes required to temper inflation,"Across the new sources I read, the consensus seems to be that the market is pricing in the first rate hike around Summer 22. The magnitude of the expected rate hike is tiny, maybe a quarter-percent. If you are of the belief that supply-chain shortages will last well into 2022, this is hilariously inadequate.

First, we've seen from 10 years of monetary experiments that the direct relationship between inflation and the state of the economy + monetary policy is tenuous at best. And this has benefitted the economy at large as we have pumped more and more money and cheap debt into the system with no apparent ill effects (except the ones that we choose to ignore, but I'm not here to beat that debt horse!). So it's already ridiculous to believe that the converse won't also be true. A 25 basis-point increase will do nothing to temper inflation.

Second, we have a new phenomenon that *does* seem to have a strong connection to inflation, both in theory and in practice. Inflation expectations among spenders and workers are higher than they've been in over a decade, wage increases at the bottom are faster than they've been in over a decade, and supply chains are more constricted than they've been in a decade.

Thus, if inflation persists, even at the not-hyper-inflation levels we're currently seeing, it's not a stretch to see that the Fed will have to make moves that shatter the confidence driving the second point. Once you accept the first point, that the Fed's tools have a weak causal relationship with inflation, it's clear that the only way they can stop inflation is to raise interest rates enough to tank assets, which will shake consumer confidence and bring demand in equilibrium with supply. If that isn't enough, they will be forced to go further and cause a recession, although this will take a lot of pushing, given their need to balance against the full employment mandate. Either way, I think we can all agree a quarter rate increase will do nothing.

I'm curious what other people's thoughts are. I'm not making any earth-shattering new statements, just connecting dots. To me, this outcome flows logically from the two points above, *if* you believe that higher inflation (but not hyper-inflation) will be persistent into next year.",finance

CryptoCurrency,this might be a great long term play,"So i've been looking around thinking of what should I take a new position in?

my conclusion was Monero, Let's face it Monero is something that will always have a use case and may be now considered a ""safe bet"" or a ""blue chip"" crypto. As we can see monero hasn't moved in price significantly in a long time however I'm looking to buy for the long term supply play.

For those of you who don't know Monero has a max supply of 18.4 million XMR, currently at 17.7 m XMR, the max supply is expected to be hit in May 2022. 

once the max supply is hit they will use “tail emissions,” with a small amount of XMR being fed into the system every 60 seconds as a reward for miners.

I believe once supply is hit and the 60 second reward starts up, it will be a great long term supply crush play.

the supply / demand will constantly tilt towards demands way.

will be looking to add onto my XMR position for the coming months and unless a big dip won't be buying too close towards the May 2022 date.

gaming,Does ESO get better?,"I've always been a great fan of skyrim. I have played it to completion multiple times, and I always immediately get super immersed in the game. So when ESO was released I really wanted to play it, except for the longest time I didn't have a PC that had 100gb of memory available. But finally I was able to buy the game, except I feel like it kinda sucks?

I figured maybe the problems would get less once I get through the first bit, so right now I've played through the first few islands in the daggerfall convenant, played through the afterlife bit with John Cleese and Dumbledore, and did the first few islands of the ebonheart pact, but none of it really seems to improve?

Here are some of the problems I have with the game:
Gameplay-wise, none of the combat encounters have so far been remotely challenging, most of them I just spam my spells and burn through them easily. For the few cases that I did end up dying, death was super inconsequential, I'd just run back to the same spot and went whacking my spells again. 

The story had some potential, but given that you seem to bounce around from place to place with no real attachment to any side, I've soon lost interest. The afterlife-part with Dumbledore looked cool, but now that I finished the first bit I've just been dumped in Morrowind with seemingly no way to continue that storyline.

The multiplayer aspect of the game does not really seem to add anything. Communication is weird, and it is really annoying when someone else decides to fight the same boss as you, cause then the already too easy fight is just finished in like two seconds.

The exploration part of the previous games is completely nerfed by the way the areas seem divided up into 'levels'. Exploration was my favorite part of the previous Elder Scrolls games, and I was super excited when I heard ESO was gonna cover all of Tamriel, but there is just very little freedom of movement it seems.

Do any parts of the game get better? Or should I just uninstall the game and accept that I've wasted €30",technology
personalfinance,Using US Treasury Series I bonds as a future emergency fund,"I, like a few others based on new topics popping up, just learned that the Series I bonds exist. My experience with bonds previously was extremely low interest rates which may be the series E one or something, so I am new to learning how good they can be. 

My question is: how long does it take to cash them out? Mostly I am curious about setting up a system where they are the majority of my emergency fund and savings accounts in the future (5+ years, plan on savings/checking having a few grand, the rest these). Also are there any limits to the amount of purchases you can make per year quantity wise? I know about the 10,000+5,000 limit, just curious if I could buy smaller amounts weekly. Then would the ""maturity"" be based solely on the day it was purchased, or based on that half of the year's interest date day?

EDIT: answered below, takes a few days to get cash into your bank account. Someone was confused down there too, I already have the 6 months of expenses saved up for my emergency fund, and I am not touching those for now. This would be new money coming in that I would be starting another ""emergency fund"" by buying these bonds weekly. 5 years from now when they start to mature I would start moving my 6 month emergency savings into other investments, and work down to a 1 to 2 month emergency fund in savings with these being available to cash out if necessary.",finance
investing,Is it a bad time to invest in bonds?,"My portfolio is about 15% bonds. That’s mostly TLT. I want to increase this percentage because of my age. I want to slowly increase it to around 30%. 

However, it really seems like interest rates and yields will be going up in the medium/long term. I’m concerned that that will cause TLT to drop. Is this something I should be worried about? Am I stuck? I have about 75% in equities and I think that’s too high.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Bitfinex has frozen $130.000 since February Support Ticket [#469901],"After bitfinex personally deleted all my posts on their page within 2 minutes I will try it here! It’s been more than half a year with headaches before I now decided to go public. Bitfinex has frozen my account after a withdrawal request of about 2.1 BTC in February. By my standards that is a huge amount of money. Money I would have never dreamed of when starting with crypto to be honest. Back in the days (my account is multiple years old now) I used to trade crypto to crypto only. I have never encountered any problems concerning deposits and withdrawals at bitfinex back then. I probably wasn’t anyone special to them because I was only juggling around a couple of thousand dollars a year (depending on the crypto prices).  Anyways, as we all know crypto prices rose immensely in the beginning of this year. That was when I decided to withdraw my coins. Upon request they claimed to have frozen the account because of an automated KYC procedure. As much as I understand it, you would only need to verify if you started trading fiat currencies. I did not do that. However, I thought it might just be some security feature to protect me as the account owner. After all, this wasn’t „peanuts“ anymore and because it was (and is) so much money for me I happily agreed to verify.  Since then I ran through an odysse of providing documents and declarations of all kinds. Some of them were super private. They wanted me to proof my identity, which I did. The standard procedure with passport and proof of address.  After that they wanted a proof, where I got the very first coins from that I deposited many years ago. Those coins they never cared about for so many years while letting me do many deposits and withdrawals in the meantime. Since I originally bought those bitcoins 6 years ago together with my old roommate that was quite a task. We found the transaction and sent them all necessary files and transaction data.  But not enough. I now had to proof that he was actually my roommate, which was quite difficult too because we don’t live together anymore. Because of data protection regulations the landlord from back then needed a signed request from both of us in order to hand out the proof to me. (It’s no joke, GDPR is taken serious in Germany.) To clarify: I verified myself and my old room mate. I did not forge any documents and I did not lie anywhere throughout the process.  I finally send them the proof from the landlord. Not enough again. I now had to proof that I went to school with that roommate. So both of us had to send them our school certificates also. Not enough again. They suddenly started asking me about other withdrawals from 3 years ago. I proofed that I sold the crypto for cash and transferred the cash to my bank account a week later.  After that, they told me to wait again. That was almost 2 weeks ago. No reply.  I’m just so tired of this. Just angry, exhausted and worried. By now, they probably know more about me than most of my friends and family. Financially and in general. Plus they have copies of my entire identity from A to Z.

personalfinance,Company overpaid me and now demanding me to pay them back the before-tax amount,"Quit my job about a few months ago and I recently got a letter in the mail about paying them back for 2 full days of work. I looked at the amount and thought there's no way I got paid this amount of money in two days. Then I did the math, and that's the money before taxes. I'm not too familiar with federal tax and all but in my head, I got paid, and had to pay taxes on the amount and now because of their ignorance, I have to pay them back the pre-tax amount but I don't have that exact amount because I have the after-tax amount so I have to take the difference out of my own money.

I'm not sure if I make sense on any of that. I'm just unsure on what to do. Do I fight it? Am I ignorant and should just give them the money?

Is tax return a fraction of what you paid in taxes or the full amount?

Edit: This is in the US.",finance
personalfinance,Moving Out (again): how soon is TOO soon?,"I'm 20M and the last 3 or so years have been a bit of a rollercoaster, to say the least. At 17 I got fed up with my parents and moved out on my own. I LOVED IT. Don't get me wrong, I *immediately* ran into problems, but all my issues were made easier purely because I lived alone. For the first time in my life I felt *in control,* but I could only make it last 2 years.

Earlier this year, I went through a big rough patch with my mental health and basically lost everything, including my job. Since July I've moved back in with my parents, and while things aren't *great,* I'm certainly building myself back up quickly.

I recently started my own graphic design/advertising business, and as a bare-bones startup it's going pretty well. As it stands, I'm pulling in around $1500/month from my few clients + financial assistance. It's not a perfect situation, but since I live with my parents and my bills have been greatly reduced, I can easily get by on that amount of money for now.

The problem is that it's not *enough* to reach my goal. Through all my mental health problems, moving back in with my folks, starting a business and everything else, my overall goal has always remained the same: **move out again, as soon as possible.** But at least in my city, $1500/month isn't nearly enough to support myself on my own.

I'm not *super* picky about my living situation, but I have some minimum standards. My first apartment was $800/month for a 10x10 shoebox they called a ""studio"". So as long as I can get something nicer than *that*, I'm happy. Unfortunately, as was evidenced with my second apartment, the next level up in terms of quality only exists in the $12-1500 range.

That price tag, coupled with my lack of financial discipline (which results in about $1500 of non-rent expenses per month) means I'd need to be consistently making about $3000/month in order to comfortably support myself. That doesn't sound too bad at face value (I mean, I did it before), but it conflicts with the ""as soon as possible"" part of my goal. I was aiming to move out by December 1st, but that's looking pretty unrealistic now. I could shift my target to January 1st, but even that's uncertain.

I know this is a lot of setup for what should be a purely financial post, so here's my question: how ""confident"" do I need to be before pulling the trigger on an apartment?

Call me impatient if you want, but my #1 priority right now is getting back out there ASAP. That said, I definitely don't want to jump the gun and wind up back here in a few months' time. So- I need help finding a healthy balance between ""I have no money but I'm gonna move out anyway"" and ""I probably have the money but I'm too paranoid to take action"".

Do you think I need the full 3k/month before making a move? Of course I intend to keep growing the business regardless of my living arrangements, so hopefully in 1-2 months I'll be there anyway. But, before then, is it at all advisable for me to start moving in on a few options? Like I said, December 1st is my goal, and if there's a path for me to get there, I wanna follow it.

Any thoughts are appreciated; I feel like I've overthought this to the point where no progress will be made without an outside opinion lol",finance

$**130k income**

\-25,900 standard ded

\-20,500 max his 401k

\-38,000 her solo 401k

\-7,200 max HSA

\-4,800 medical/dental premiums

**= $33,600 taxable income**

total tax = 3620 due

child tax credit  = -3,600

**taxes due = $20**

This would leave us with about $1,500 per month disposable income after food, mortgage, insurance, prop taxes, utilities are paid.  This would also be an annual savings of $66k or a 50% rate while living comfortably.

This seems to work for a zero tax liability right?

worldpolitics,"Scientists urge Biden to remove logging, fossil fuels, biomass from budget bills","More than 100 scientists have issued an open letter urging U.S. President Joe Biden and members of Congress to remove provisions promoting logging, forest biomass and fossil fuels from the multitrillion-dollar infrastructure and reconciliation (Build Back Better) bills.Both bills contain provisions for logging for lumber and for forest biomass energy, with the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Nov. 5.Although the infrastructure bill promises $570 billion in tax credits and investments to combat climate change, it also includes a mandate for 12 million hectares (30 million acres) of “additional logging on federal public lands over the next 15 years.”“The logging and fossil fuel subsidies and policies in the Reconciliation and Infrastructure Bills will only intensify the rate and intensity of our changing climate,” the letter states.More than 100 scientists with expertise in ecology, forest management, biodiversity, and climate change issued an open letter to U.S. President Joe Biden and members of Congress last week. The scientists urged the leaders to remove provisions promoting logging and fossil fuels from the multitrillion-dollar infrastructure and reconciliation bills.Late on Nov. 5, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the $1.2 trillion physical infrastructure bill, which deals with roads, bridges and other traditional infrastructure, and which Biden is expected to sign. The nearly $2 trillion social infrastructure Build Back Better Act, also called the reconciliation bill, has yet to be voted on. This second piece of legislation implements changes in the federal budget and pushes forward Biden’s agenda in the areas of immigration, child care, tax credits, health care, climate change, and more.Although the infrastructure bill includes $570 billion in tax credits and investments to combat climate change, in areas such as public transportation, electric vehicles and modernizing electrical grids, the 106 international scientists who drafted the letter say that provisions were also added for logging and fossil fuels that are antithetical to climate goals.“The Infrastructure Bill includes a legislative mandate for 30 million acres \[12 million hectares\] of additional logging on federal public lands over the next 15 years, in addition to misdirecting billions of dollars in new subsidies for the fossil fuel industry and an exemption from environmental analysis for new oil and gas pipelines across federal lands,” the letter states.Logging in U.S. forests emits comparable levels of CO2 to the emissions from coal-burning, or more than 723 million tons. Logging emissions account for more than 10 times the combined amount of CO2 generated by wildfires and tree death from insects.The scientists write that, even with provisions for logging and fossil fuels removed, the clean energy measures supported in the infrastructure and reconciliation bills are insufficient to reach the administration’s goal of a 50% reduction in annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030.Both pieces of legislation contain provisions for logging for lumber, forest biomass energy, and wood pellets. Burning biomass, especially wood pellets to make energy, is highly controversial. Because wood is technically a renewable resource, biomass carbon emissions are currently counted as producing “zero emissions” by the U.N. and by many nations, allowing the exploitation of what is referred to as the “biomass carbon accounting loophole.”However, biomass burning is not carbon neutral. Researchers, including those at Woods Hole Research Center, have established that burning wood pellets generates greater levels of emissions than coal per unit of energy produced because more biomass is required to generate the same amount of energy as coal. Also, cutting trees and converting them to wood pellets that are then burned releases that once stored carbon to the atmosphere. This forest carbon isn’t recovered and sequestered again until more trees are planted and grow, which can take many decades. However, drastic global emission cuts are most needed now and in the near term to prevent catastrophic climate change.“As the world’s nations meet to discuss solutions to climate disruption, we in the USA must get our house in order,” Stuart Pimm, the Doris Duke Chair of Conservation at Duke University and one of the lead signatories of the letter, told Mongabay in an email. “Logging — and especially the misguided harvesting of timber for wood chips, puts nearly three-quarters of a billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually. This is supported by perverse \[national\] financial subsidies and, sadly by some misguided and poorly-informed conservation NGOS.”“It’s all about the money,” fellow signatory Bill Moomaw, a top international researcher on biomass for energy and emeritus professor at Tufts University, said in a 2019 interview with Mongabay. “The wood pellet industry is a monster out of control.”The reconciliation bill, a fast-track spending bill expected to receive votes before the end of November, contains more than double the amount of existing subsidies for logging on federal public lands: $14 billion worth. It also proposes “nearly $1 billion in new subsidies for forest biomass energy, wood pellet facilities, and mass timber (cross-laminated timber) under the heading of ‘wood innovation,’” according to the letter.“This ignores the advice of hundreds of climate and forest scientists who have previously informed Congress that these industries substantially increase emissions and worsen the climate crisis,” the letter states.Last week in Glasgow, Scotland, at the COP26 climate conference, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson released the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use, with more than 100 countries committing to “halt and reverse forest loss” by 2030. Among those leaders was U.S. President Biden.“Today, I’m announcing a new plan to conserve global forests, which will bring together a full range of U.S. government tools — diplomatic, financial, and policy — to halt forest loss, restore our critical carbon sinks, and improve land management,” Biden said in a speech at COP26 on Nov. 2. “Through this plan, the United States will help the world deliver on our shared goal of halting natural forest loss and restoring at least an additional 200 million hectares \[494 million acres\] of forests and other ecosystems by the year 2030.”“The big announcement today at COP to halt deforestation is very misleading,” Moomaw told Mongabay in an email. “It is all about stopping deforestation in the Amazon, while the US and Canada continue to add vast amounts of carbon from their clear cutting and forest management practices. The UK continues to replace coal with wood pellets from the US and not count the emissions at all and claim great reductions in their own emissions.”The scientists writing in the open letter to Biden note that, according to the recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), emissions must be cut in half by 2030 “to avoid large increases of devastating heat domes, prolonged droughts, wildfires that can impact communities, intense precipitation events, and catastrophic storms.”“The logging and fossil fuel subsidies and policies in the Reconciliation and Infrastructure Bills will only intensify the rate and intensity of our changing climate,” said the letter.

CryptoCurrency,New and Surprising Crypto Regulation in the United States Is Far More Pervasive [Due Diligence],"Next to the infrastructure bill, a new bill was introduced in US Congress: the “Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.” It is not law yet, could still be amended, and if it ever comes into effect it will likely not be this year/cycle. Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/vdAK6jSCxII)

Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such.

Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security; guidance will be issued by CFTC/SEC. Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.

In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; (unauthorized) Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are to be prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for almost all crypto projects, possibly to facilitate more future regulations.

Finally, the Federal Reserve gets shocking new powers to create and distribute a central bank digital currency (CBDC), of which all transactions are recorded.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I Refinance?,"My mortgage company is offering me a refinance that, quite frankly, I am not sure if it's worth it.

My current mortgage is at a 30-year fixed rate. While I purchased my house in late 2015, I live in an extremely hot real estate and have well over $100,000 in equity already. I started out with an FHA loan, but because of the equity increase, refinanced into a traditional loan with a lower interest rate in early 2020. Goodbye, mortgage insurance.

Currently, my interest rate is 3.5%. I owe about $205,000 on the house. They are offering me a 3.125% interest rate, with all fees, the appraisal, everything wrapped up in the refinance. It would raise my balance to $213,000 and drop my monthly payments by about $40 or $50.

economy,Trying to understand CDOs,"First let me just tell you that the movie ""Big Short""
 doesn't do a good job in explaining the 2008 financial crisis, and it's annoying that people always recommend to watch. I think it's bullshit.

Now regardless all that, I'm trying to understand what is a CDO. 
So my basic understanding is, that it is a tool for banks to finance mortgages by allowing the public and home owners to meet. Let's say I want a mortgage of 200k with 5% interest, so the bank sells shares (or securities or whatever they are called) to the public, let's say 200k worth of shares with 3-4% interest, and the banks pockets the remaining 1--2% as profit. Right? 
Am I right till now? Ok.

I understand that there are different levels of quality of the home buyers, based on the risk of their ability to make payments. 

So people with good income and good credit history were rated as AAA, and people with poor income were rated as B or not rated at all.

Now we are getting to the part that I have difficulty to understand. So according to the movie, which doesn't really make it clear, the banks took good and bad home buyers, mixed them together, and passed as AAA... right? 

But I watched some other videos on YouTube, and they explained it differently. They explained it that every investors knew perfectly well what quality of CDOs he is buying, the lower the quality the higher the profit interest rate due to higher risk, and that rating agencies usually refuse to rate the subprime loaners.

So... what is going on here? Can someone explain this mess to me? Were bad and good cdos mixed and presented as good, or were they separated and investor perfectly knew what is the risk they are taking?",finance

cybersecurity,All I hear about is cloud security,"Hello all,

This is one of the topics which I am debating the most with my peers. 

Before I start a bit of background about myself. I have been in infosec for about 15 years as security analyst, pentester and the past 6 years mostly into GRC. I also have the following certs: CISSP, CISM, CISA, CEH, OSCP, Security+.  To be honest I am a bit fed up with GRC so for a while I was looking into some more hands-on specialties within the infosec. Don't want to go back to pentesting/red teaming as it has become like a magnet field, everyone trying to do those nowadays. I was thinking more like either cloud or defense. 

The past year, every time we have a presentation in my company, all we hear about is cloud cloud cloud.  When I talk to my peers they all say cloud is like the most complicated thing in security, I need to know so many things to be successful. Deep knowledge of cloud solutions + IAM + Networking + OS etc.  Instead they tell me to just go for defense (Blue team) or if I insist on cloud to consider CCSP which is more GRC around cloud. But I don't want to do yet another document-checking certificate. Don't get me wrong I think that CCSP is a must and most probably I will end up doing in the next months, but I prefer more of a role where I am brought in to build the security architecture of a cloud or help a company improve the security of their existing cloud solution. 

To those of you who are already working as cloud security architects: Would you recommend me to go down that road considering the above background? If yes, can you please describe a career path for me like: Recommended subjects to study, certificates, trainings, skills to buildup?

CryptoCurrency,Some great tips for buying million dollar waterfront properties,"Here are some things I learned when I first bought my waterfront mansion recently.

1. Look into loans early, if you aren't paying it all in cash or crypto.
Since many waterfront properties are more expensive than other properties, loans will often fall into the jumbo mortgage category. Jumbo loans are for loans above $**548,250** in most counties, as determined by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. These type of loans generally take a lot longer than regular loans, and could mean missing out on a great deal if not approved in time.

2.  Waterfront properties frequently have an increased risk of flood damage and some beachfront homes are also at risk of a hurricane or even earthquake damage. These properties have more risks than other properties, so most will require three different types of insurance: a wind policy, a flood policy and a general hazard policy. Consider these costs with the purchase price when looking at properties.

3. Consider investing in storm shutters for homes in hurricane-prone areas and stainless-steel locks to avoid corrosion from salt air if you are near the ocean. Whether you have water intruding into the basement from the high water table, corrosion on your exterior because of salt air, or mildew and mold issues from higher moisture levels in the air, an expert inspection can help you understand what you might be up against. Surveys, elevation certificates, water quality tests, and other land and water-based inspections that you might not have done on a regular house can be very important with waterfront property. 

4. If you want to make any changes to your waterfront property, such as adding a dock or a seawall, start this process early to ensure that these alterations will be possible. Government agencies can be very strict and you don’t want to commit to purchasing a million-dollar home without knowing that you can really do what you want to make it your own. Also find out what kind of activities are allowed on the body of water, as some areas have restrictions on jet skis, speedboats, yachts, mega-yachts and other large watercraft for the ultra-wealthy.

Please share any other tips you might have as I am sure a lot of us are soon to be looking for the absolute best properties available.",cryptocurrency

Nice guy, but really wanted me to sign a “non binding” agreement. I declined. Instead I am going to get two more quotes. One from tesla and one from another local solar company. 

My questions are: does anyone anticipate if the federal and/or state rebates will decline next year or in the future?

Second question is: is it true the tesla powerwalls are backordered 6 months? I wanted a battery backup in case of a power outage. I know the gas powered generators are cheaper and the likelihood of a very prolonged outage is low, but i just want to be safe in case the power grid goes down for whatever reason. I figured if the power grid went down the natural gas suppliers would as well and there would be some serious problems. 

Third question: the sales guy that came by today suggested to hold off on battery until two years from now when they will be more efficient and hold more power. Is it worth the wait?

I’m a long time crypto HODLER and this year I decided to give up 1/2 of my construction business to dedicate 100% of my time to crypto (best decision of my life).

Long story short, earlier this year, I tried to get a Mortgage for a property I fell in love with; funding was the one thing I never thought i’d have problems with, however one bank fucked up quite a lot and consequently, other banks have let me down n times.

I never take no for an answer, but it doesn’t make sense to keep trying with centralised finance.

I’m trying to understand if there is some sort of DeFi mortgage solution?

if not 

can someone help me with my idea/project?:

- creating a smart contract/token with a fixed total market cap (= purchase price of the property) which entitles the token holder to a fixed interest rate (payable monthly) for a period of 1 or 2 years?

If i manage to do that, I can then buy the property, refinance in 2 years, and pay back initial investment. 

My “mortgage” payments would be the interests paid out monthly to the token holders.

I personally don’t think it’s a bad idea, regardless of my case, maybe i’m mistaking though.

Can anyone point me to the right direction please?

personalfinance,I-Bond Questions Answered,"There have been several recent threads with variations on this topic with lots of good discussion.

I thought I would create a centralized thread with some of the most common questions I’ve seen, as well as a brief overview of the asset.

**What are I Series Bonds?**

Series I Bonds (or I-Bonds) are U.S. Treasury issued savings bonds, not so different from the ones you used to get from Grandma every year (which were EE series bonds).  I-Bonds were created in 1998 to give the average American a way to save that would be guaranteed to hold its buying power.  An I-Bond consists of a fixed rate (fixed for the life of the bond, which has a 30 year maturity), and a variable rate, which is based on the government CPI index, and resets every 6 months to the current inflation rate (May and November).  The current fixed rate is 0%, while the variable rate is 7.12%!

**Why should I own I-Bonds?**

Maintaining purchasing power of your hard earned assets should be your first priority as a saver/investor.  I-Bonds check a number of boxes that make them a very unique financial asset, namely:

1).  Safety - They are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury.  If the government defaults on you, we have bigger problems.

2).  Liquidity - After one year, they can be cashed in and deposited back to your checking account in 2-3 days (minus a small 3 month interest penalty, see below).

3).  Tax Deferred - I-bonds do not throw off interest.  You only owe tax on the internally compounding interest once the bonds are cashed in, which means *you* control when you pay tax.  Always a good thing!

4).  Inflation Protection - I-Bonds are guaranteed to grow with the general inflation rate, as measured by the CPI.

5).  Deflation Protection - I-Bonds will never lose value month over month, even when the CPI is negative (deflation).  That means in those cases, your money is guaranteed to *increase* in value in real terms.  

6).  Tax free (maybe) - All interest earned is local and state tax exempt.  If used for qualifying educational purposes and if you are under certain income limitations, interest earned is federally tax free.  

7).  Account Separation - Some people may consider this a negative, but I find having my cash and emergency funds separate from standard bank or brokerage accounts to be a positive in that you are much less tempted to do anything rash or draw on these funds for something that might not be a true need.  This is completely psychological, but for me, it works.  

Additionally, just like EE Savings Bonds, I-Bonds are a great educational tool for children.  They are simple enough to teach concepts like compound interest, but since they are also inflation linked, you can also teach them about what inflation is and the impact on buying power.  No more just having to tell them how you used to remember when a loaf of bread cost a nickel!


**What’s the Catch?**

I-Bonds purchased must be held for a minimum of one year.  In addition, bonds cashed in between years 1-5 will lose the last 3 months of interest paid.  Additionally, you are limited to $10,000 per year, per social security number (or EIN), plus another $5000 in paper I-bonds if you choose to get your tax refund back as I-bonds.  

**Why all the hoopla now?  Why didn’t I know about these before?**

Because of recent inflation data, I-Bonds are paying the highest variable rates ever for any I-Bonds purchased through April 2022 for 6 months.  That rate is an annualized 7.12%!  This has helped shine a light on an asset that has been flying under the radar for a number of years.

Also, because they are sold directly by the government, there are no expenses, commissions, or fees.  That means no one is paid to tell you about them.  

**How much can I expect to earn over the next (XX) years?**

No one knows in nominal terms.  In real terms, they are expected to return nothing.  Your $100 in I-Bonds bought today should be able to buy just as many groceries 30 years from now.  This is a good thing!  Inflation has averaged 2-3% overtime.  A government guaranteed return of your buying power is nothing to sneeze at, especially for something like an emergency fund.

*Note*:The current rate will likely NOT last, nor would you want it to.  They would mean inflation is way higher than long term trends, which would reek havoc in the economy and your personal finances. 

If you want to know what 2-3% interest looks like compounded semi annually, use this calculator.

https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator

**How is Interest accrued?**

Interest is earned monthly, and compounded semi annually.  Your account balance will reflect what you have earned minus the 3 month penalty (until year 5).  

Additionally, interest is earned for the entire month you own the bond, so bonds bought on the 29th will earn interest as if bought on the 1st!  Just make sure the purchase clears before the end of the month, so give it a few days.  

**Why are these rates so much higher than market bond rates or savings rates?**

To put it simply, they are government subsidized.  These are meant for the little guy to be able to save money safely.  Who doesn’t like a good government subsidy?  My rule of thumb is to max out on anything the government limits you on - it means it’s probably a great deal.  In this case you are limited to $10,000 per year (plus $5,000 in paper bonds from your tax return).  Any Wall Street finance person would be loading up on these, if they could.

**What part of a portfolio should these be for?**

Many people use them for emergency savings.  Others use it as part of their overall bond portfolio.  Others for college savings.  There’s no question they are one of, if not the best risk adjusted assets out there.  This should be the bedrock of your non-retirement savings/investing strategy.  One strategy is to “ladder in”, meaning you take parts of your emergency savings and add them every year so that you aren’t locking all of your liquidity in that one year lock up period.  

**How do I buy them?**

You can set up an account at www.treasurydirect.gov and buy them directly from the government by linking your checking account number and routing number.  You may also elect to receive up to $5,000 per tax return as your tax refund in addition to the $10,000 you buy at treasury direct.

**Who can buy them?**

According to the treasury website, anyone with a social security number meeting one of the following 3 conditions:

1).  Being a U.S. Citizen (living in the U.S. or abroad)

2).  Being a U.S Resident 

3).   Being a civilian employee of the United States, regardless of where you lived. 

Additionally, if you have an EIN for a trust/corporation, you may purchase up to $10,000 of bonds under those entities as well.  

**Is this a real government website?  It seems fishy.**

It’s real.  What can I tell you?  The government doesn’t know how to make a good website.  For the love of god, don’t hit the back button!  It has also been advised to make sure you don’t plan on changing your funding bank account information anytime soon, as some rather annoying paperwork is required.  

**Can I buy them for kids/grandkids?**

Yes.  You need to set up an account for them under your “master” account, and you can then gift them.  They would be a separate $10,000 limit.

**TIPS vs I-Bonds**

I am not going to get into too much detail here on TIPS - you can do your own research.  

Both are inflation linked treasury assets.

You may purchase as many TIPS through a brokerage as you’d like.  I-Bonds are subject to the $10,000 limit and 
must be purchased through treasury direct.

Because TIPS are marketable securities, they are subject to market forces.  While having the benefit of being able to sell TIPS whenever you like (no one year lock up), the drawback is they can (and have) decreased in value over periods of time.  They do not give the same deflation protection I-Bonds do.  They also throw off taxable interest payments.  

TIPS may have a place in an overall portfolio for some people.  For me, they are a bit too complicated.  I like to keep things simple.  I-Bonds are simple.

We are expecting a baby in Dec and plan to live in this condo for as long as we can continue to live in this expensive resort community.  Currently at 10 years and don't plan to leave unless the cost of living pushes us out.

We make roughly 110K collective plus a commission that averages 15K per year.  We have 265K cash for down payment, moving expenses, new born expenses, and emergency fund.  I am hoping to have a monthly payment of $2,500, excluding utilities.  Current rent expense is $2,300, on the low end for the area.

I am waiting to hear back form our lender regarding interest rates, they are running our credit now.  We are prepared to make a down payment of 20% with our savings and assistance from our parents.  We will not have to pay PMI regardless of down payment amount because of the loan to value.  I have been getting lots of advice on down payment amount 5%-20% and that I should ""RUN THE NUMBERS"" to see what we are comfortable with.  I have also received advice that if we are planning to live in the condo for longer than 5 years it is a good idea to purchase.

My questions is, what does RUNNING THE NUMBERS actually mean, how do I do that, and how does that relate to our down payment amount and/or the number of years we are planning to live in the home?   Thanks for any and all advice.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"I am a layperson, but I have almost quadrupled my holdings over three years.","This is just one more set of data points for those wondering about more run-of-the-mill investors (not whales, just people with a few hundred dollars here and there).

Over the course of the last 3 years, starting in late 2017 and early 2018, I put a few hundred dollars in here and there.  In hindsight, I wish I had bought way more of Ethereum and Bitcoin when they were crashing (every time they crashed). 

\-------------------------------------------------------

Below is a rough breakdown of my holdings.

ETH   50%

BTC   40%

XRP   3%

ADA   2%

LRC    1%

DASH 1%

XLM  1%

ZCASH .5%

OMG .5%

ATOM .5%

XTZ, ALGO, LTC  = .5%

\-------------------------------------------------------

The vast majority of holdings/earnings are, and have been, from the two big guys, not random shitcoins.  I think we are approaching another ATH and I have a few sell orders on some things to take some profits while I can, and I will probably buy the dip after the crash (whenever that eventually happens, as it has always happened for the entire history of crypto).

I don't think we are quite at the stage where there is enough widespread adoption for there to be no crash, especially when we think about the federal reserve tapering off the free money spigot, the coming December-January holidays selling of crypto (both Western and Eastern holidays).

I have found that a safe method is to set a stop-limit sell order for 20% above where a coin is, and immediately afterward put in a stop-limit buy order for 10% to 20% below where I sold it (depending on the volatility of the coin).

\-------------------------------------------------------

LTC used to be about 5% of my holdings, but I closed that position since it has been sideways for many years now, the creator seems meh, and other coins seem to promise the same thing better.  I may pick up one or two LTC when it crashes again.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Making Your Crypto Work For You!,"## What Can I Stake?

Thanks to the growing popularity of staking, there are tons of options for users who want to earn passive income with their idle crypto-assets. We’ll briefly cover some of the biggest cryptocurrencies offering staking rewards right now:

### Staking on Ethereum 2.0

One of the hottest staking options is Ethereum 2.0, since Ethereum is the second-most popular cryptocurrency platform to date. And if you are invested in ETH, you can essentially help the system flourish by becoming one of its early validators.

In order to [stake on ETH 2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/), you need to own a minimum of 32 ETH, as well the Eth1 mainnet client. Start by heading over to the [Eth2 Launch Pad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/).Of course, if you followed the DeFi industry’s explosion in 2020, you’ll know that much of their growth can be attributed to the staggering potential rewards that [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) protocols operating as ERC20 tokens offer to investors. We discuss this further down in more detail. 

### Staking on Tezos (XTZ)

[Tezos](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tezos/) was born in June 2018, causing a major storm as the [biggest initial coin offering (ICO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-an-ico) with over $230 million in investment. It implements a version of PoS called liquid proof-of-stake (LPoS).

Tezos’ native currency is called XTZ and calls the staking process, “baking.” Bakers are rewarded using the native coin. Furthermore, malicious bakers are penalized by having their stake confiscated.

To become a staker/baker on Tezos, a user needs to hold 8,000 XTZ coins and run a full node. Luckily, third party services have emerged, allowing small coin holders to delegate small XTZ quantities and share baking rewards. Annual percentage yield on XTZ staking ranges anywhere from five to six percent.

### Staking on Algorand (ALGO)

[Algorand (ALGO)’s](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/algorand/) main aim is to drive low-cost cross-border payments. Being a PoS protocol, the network needs stakers for security and transaction processing. Unlike Tezos, it uses the pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism. However, it still requires stakers to run full nodes.

Furthermore, there are third parties who support ALGO delegation. Staking rewards on these networks range between five and ten percent annually. Note that the rewards are influenced by the platform used. For example, those using Binance Staking enjoy an APY (annual percentage yield) of 8%.

### Staking on Icon (ICX)

The complex Korean blockchain project [Icon (ICX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/icon/) offers another platform that natively allows staking. However, Icon differs from Algorand and Tezos in that it uses the delegated-proof-of stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. With this model, a select number of users find new blocks and verify transactions while others delegate their coins to these entities.

Icon has a native token called ICX. Annual staking rewards on ICON range anywhere between six and 36 percent.

### Staking Stablecoins

Staking [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) is a great way to hold your funds in the current low interest rate environment and earn yields while avoiding market volatility. Here are some of the stablecoins yields across top exchanges:

* [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/): 3.49% in Binance, 0.15% in Coinbase, 3.23% in OKEx‍
* [BUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/): 3.59% in Binance‍
* [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/): 2% in Coinbase, 4.12% in OKEx‍
* [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/): 5.47% in Binance, up to 13.93% in OKEx

## Where Can I Stake?

### Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)

Exchanges have naturally jumped into the staking business, thanks to the extensive number of users on their platforms. 

By staking, traders can diversify their income stream and monetize their idle funds on exchanges. The leading cryptocurrency exchanges that support staking include, but are not limited to:

#### Binance Staking

Binance is the largest digital currency exchange by trading volume. Therefore, many investors find it at the top of their lists when they contemplate staking through trading platforms. In line with this, the Binance staking service for proof-of-stake coins like Ethereum 2.0 came to life in December 2020. In addition, the exchange supports DeFi staking, where it accommodates cryptos such as DAI, Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD), BTC and Binance Coin (BNB).

For more information on Binance staking, read more [here](https://www.binance.com/en/pos).

#### Coinbase Staking

Coinbase is a US-based exchange listed on the NASDAQ, and it is another leading cryptocurrency exchange where you can stake a selection of cryptocurrencies. Apart from ETH 2.0 staking, other coins accommodated on Coinbase staking include ALGO and XTZ.

For more information on Coinbase staking, read more [here](https://www.coinbase.com/staking).

#### Gemini Staking

There is currently no Gemini staking offered on the Gemini platform. Although there is Gemini Earn where users can earn up to 8.5% APY from their cryptocurrency, this is through the lending of their crypto assets, and not staking to secure a proof-of-stake network. However, Gemini has mentioned that they plan to offer Ethereum 2.0 staking services in the near future.

#### Cold/Private Wallets

This form of staking is also called cold staking. However, a staker has to keep staked coins in the same address, since moving them breaks the lock-up period, which consequently causes them to lose staking rewards.

**Leading offline/private cryptocurrency wallets supporting staking include:**

* **Ledger** – Ledger is the industry leader for cold wallets. The advantage of hardware wallets is that you still maintain full control of your coins during a staking session. On top of its security, Ledger allows its users to stake up to seven coins. Some of its supported coins for staking are Tron (TRX), ATOM and ALGO.
* **Trust Wallet** – The versatile [Trust Wallet](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trust-wallet-token/) is a private wallet supported by Binance. The wallet allows users to earn a passive income by staking XTZ, ATOM, VeChain (VET), TRX, IoTeX (IOTX), ALGO, TomoChain (TOMO) and Callisto (CLO).
* **CoolWallet S**\- The first Bluetooth mobile hardware wallet [CoolWallet ](http://coolwallet.io/)S offers stablecoin (USDT) staking in-app through its X-Savings feature
* **Trezor -** The world’s oldest hardware wallet also supports staking of some assets like Tezos through third-party apps like the [Exodus wallet](https://www.exodus.io/download)",cryptocurrency

How much money do you have to invest?

What are the interest rates?

stocks,"Instead of using margin, what if I take a loan out and put them in stock?","I asked a question about using margin earlier, and a lot of people were against it because of the potential threat of margin call.

This got me thinking, what if I get a loan from the bank, because the loan is separate from the broker, so I have no risk of getting margin call if the market goes down.

Hypothetically if I can get for 2-3% fix interest rate and put this money into VOO or VIT (for 30 yrs),

So long as the market still maintains 7% average annual return in the next 30 years, and that I can afford the payment every month, I will be net gain 4-5%.

personalfinance,"Help my Dad not lose his house... Bankruptcy, 2nd Mortgages... ughhhhhhhh","My dad called us (2 grown kids who don't live at home) and my Mom to have a little financial meeting today. Apparently, they're not doing too hot. Here is some pertinent information:

First Mortgage: ~2100 / Month @6.5% interest

Second Mortgage / Bankruptcy Payments: ~2100 / Month ~6% interest?




This was already not great, but during COVID he went into forbearance on the first mortgage. The company that the first mortgage is with, Shellpoint, is now making him pay those forbearance payments in addition to the other loans. This went on for approximately 10 months, and equates to roughly 21,000.



So, for the next 10 months, his payments would be:

First Mortgage: 2100 / Month

Bankruptcy (Chapter 13 + 2nd Mortgage) 2100 / month

Forbearance Payments: 2100 / month

Total before all the other expenses: ~6300/month.


This is too much for him to handle with his income at the moment. He's an independent contractor, and doesn't have any money coming in for the next couple of weeks and it doesn't look like he'll be able to make this payment. He has been talking to a lawyer/paralegal with some bankruptcy website, and they recommended that he take out an interest only loan. This will bring his monthly down to 2666/month for the next three years, but it's at 10% interest. They said that he could apply for a more conventional loan in about two years, but I don't really know how good his chances would be. His credit is terrible, and he's currently in bankruptcy. 

In total, he owes about 105,000 in bankruptcy, and owes (in total, both mortgages) approximately 270,000 on the house. The house is worth upwards of 700,000 so he has some equity, but he and my mom do not want to sell the house.

Apart from that, here is some other information:
Monthly Income: ~8,500/month

Monthly Expenses: 

First Mortgage: 2100

Second Mortgage/Bankruptcy: 2100

Storage Unit: 500

Car Insurance: 600

Phones: 400

Insurance: 450

Utilities: 400

HOA: 450

Gas: 600

Total: 7600 + food, repairs, other stuff.. it ends up being probably closer to 10,000. His income is not stable either... some months he will make a lot more and live completely above his means, other months... not so much work and he'll be in this situation he's in now. 

As far as assets and whatnot go, he has about 90,000 in a 401(a) through John Hancock. He says he cannot withdraw this until he retires. I don't know if that's true. 



Basically, what is the best way for him to proceed? This interest only loan seems predatory and like a complete last resort as a means to save the house, but I feel like this is like slapping a band-aid on a gushing head wound. Are there any relief programs? He is self-employed in a non-union company. He said his first loan wouldn't lower the interest rate. His credit is bad, and he doesn't have much money coming in until December. If you can figure out a way to consolidate this shit and save him some money.. I'll venmo you $1 for every $1000 you save him overall.... haha. Thank you!",finance

31. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle.

How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)

CryptoCurrency,Cryptotrivial contest 2021! Round 39! The multiple of the current price by which an asset needs to appreciate in order to reach its previous all-time high. | 09/11/2021,"First of all, sorry for not posting yesterday. I had a difficult day and when I got home I totally forget it.

Welcome to **Round 39 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 39: The multiple of the current price by which an asset needs to appreciate in order to reach its previous all-time high. 

The correct answer of **Round 38** is...

# Collateral!

**What is a Collateral:**

Simply put, the word collateral is something of value given as a guarantee to obtain something else. For instance, a borrower may offer their car as a collateral to a lender when taking out a loan. The vehicle acts as a safeguard or warranty in case the borrower fails to pay their debts. 

Usually, collateralized loans present much lower interest rates when compared to non-collateralized ones. Collateral can come in different forms. Some of the most common types include mortgage collaterals, invoice financing, and margin trading collaterals.

Mortgage or real estate collaterals are probably the most used by borrowers. They refer to loans that are backed by real state properties, such as an apartment, house, or farming land. In this case, the property is the asset that secures the loan. So if the borrower fails to make the payments as per the contract, the lender has the right to claim ownership of their real state property.

Invoice financing, on the other hand, is a short-term borrowing procedure employed by businesses. Such a strategy consists of companies using customers’ invoices (that are yet to be paid) as collateral. So this allows them to use funds in advance. For example, imagine that an online retailer sold $500,000 in products, but since most consumers paid by credit card, the company won’t be able to use the money anytime soon. The invoice financing strategy would be suitable in this case, allowing the company to improve cash flow, using the money beforehand for high-priority needs.

When it comes to margin trading, the term collateral refers to the assets that are kept in a margin trading account to cover potential losses traders may have when trading on leverage. In other words, when you borrow money to trade on margin, your account balance will act as collateral. The brokerage (or exchange) reserves the right to liquidate your assets in case the market moves against you.

personalfinance,behind on 3 months rent,"i messed up. big time. 

some context: i live in portland OR, and i had surgery august 31st, and i very stupidly quit my job because i was fed up with my boss. august 24th was the last day i worked, and i have absolutely no savings and barely bothered to get a job. (i have bipolar, and i’ve been in a really stupid state of mind that nothing can touch me and i’m invincible, until this week and i realized oh crap i might be getting evicted next week)

currently i owe Sept, Oct &amp; Nov’s rent, and i JUST started a new job this week. 

i applied for rental assistance for the month of september, which gave me eviction immunity until Nov 14th. i haven’t heard back if i’m approved for it or not, so betting on the fact i wont be approved, i will owe $3,750 on november 14th, not including my surgery bills. 

i just don’t know what to do. i’m not 100% that i’ll get an eviction notice that day but i also don’t want to fall back on the hope that i wont be. 

how the hell do i come up with $3750 in a week? i currently have $550 to my name, and i can’t get approved for a loan. i’ve been picking up here and there jobs but nowhere near enough 

please no judgement or hate, i realized how bad i messed up and i’m severely beating myself up over it. i’m just really at a loss and i don’t know what to do anymore.",finance
personalfinance,Is it a good idea to take out a personal loan to pay off this credit card debt?,"I have 3 credit cards that I’m drowning in. I racked up a lot of charges due to not making money during COVID, and all my promotional periods have ended and I can’t afford the interest and the cards are nearly maxxed out, which also affects my credit score. It’s actually the ONLY thing negatively impacting my credit score, as I have perfect payment history and 0 derogatory marks.

I have 9k on one card, $6,200 on another, $3900 on another. I can only afford the minimum payments lately and they never get paid down due to the interest accumulating and I feel like I’m drowning. I’m thinking about taking out a personal loan for about 18k, paying them all off, not using them (I haven’t used them since the pandemic ended and I am able to work again) and paying off the loan ASAP. If the monthly payments for the loan are lower than the total of the monthly payments of my credit cards, then it makes sense for me to do right? My credit score will increase and I will have an easier time paying off the loan, granted the interest rate on the loan is better than the ones on my cards?

Thank you, I don’t have anyone I can get financial help from.",finance

CryptoCurrency,An interesting conversation with a highly intelligent elderly man about Crypto.,"Yesterday I was asked by my mother to drive a dear friend of hers to the Hospital, he has had a cancer scare and was being sent for scans.

He is in his late 70's and has had a fascinating life and been very successful in his career and his investments in stocks. He bought shares in mobile phone companies 30 years ago, like Vodaphone and did very well from them.

He said that he was no longer investing and moaned about the terrible interest rates on savings.

I did my little rant about banks and their greedy ways. Then made mention of how their time is almost up thanks to DeFi and Lending platforms.

As he is old school, he had no idea what I was talking about, but seemed very interested to learn more. 

He clearly has a substantial pension along with considerable savings and absolutely no desire to grow his wealth, so I felt comfortable having a crypto conversation with him without the fear of opening a can of worms. (This has happened to me before)

The moment I mentioned the word 'crypto' I could see an instant scepticism wash over him, but I continued anyway. 

Dispite his age and rudimental understanding of technology (his PC mouse has an actual ball in it) he quickly grasped certain aspects like how stable coins are pegged to the US dollar and by holding them on a lending platform like Nexo or Celsius allows you to get interest up around 12% APY while cutting out the middlemen (Bankers)

He was astonished and in agreement that unless the Banks act swiftly they would certainly end up losing out to this 'new age' of finance.

What I took from this conversation is just how 'in the dark' most people are when it comes to their saving options. 

The deep mistrust towards crypto has been cultivated by banks and the media to protect their profits regardless of the damage to their customers.

While it does feel great to be on the inside and finally having my savings grow, I just wish there wasn't so many good people out there being hoodwinked.",cryptocurrency

&gt; “Infrastructure is one of those expenditures which is truly an investment — with an expected positive return on money spent — as opposed to a pure expense, with relatively little chance of getting the money back,” he added.
*****
&gt; Strong earnings results have also supported stocks in running to new highs. Through Monday morning 445 S&amp;P 500 components have reported quarterly results, with 81% beating earnings estimates. When it comes to revenue, 76% of companies have exceeded expectations.

&gt; The bulk of the index may have reported, but there are still some widely-watched reports on deck. D. R. Horton will report before Tuesday’s opening well, while Wynn Resorts and Coinbase will provide updates when the market closes.

&gt; “With Q3 earnings season winding down, economic data and the progress in economic re-openings will gain in importance in investors’ focus from here to the end of the year,” noted John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management.
*****
&gt; Also on Monday, Federal Reserve Governor Randal Quarles, who served a dual role as banking system supervisor, announced he would be stepping down around the end of 2021. Multiple Fed officials spoke Monday, with Vice Chairman Richard Clarida expressing concern about inflation, the current pace of which is “much more than a moderate overshoot” of the Fed’s 2% goal.
*****
&gt; In another central bank development, President Joe Biden last week interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard for the position of Fed chairman, Bloomberg News reported, a surprise development in that most of Wall Street expects Jerome Powell to be renominated to the position.

CryptoCurrency,"Hex is a scam, 12 reasons why","# Richard Heart AKA Richard J Schueler is a delusional guy

He believes he invented the best crypto in the world with hex.

I remember first hearing about hex when Richard Heart appeared on Ivan on techs Good morning crypto episode on YouTube in 2019.
Hearing him talk about high 3.69% interest, I thought this interest is not at all impressive. In crypto, interest rates around 10% or higher are very common. And before the financial crisis, interest rates on fiat deposits were 3-5%.
But more importantly, the interest of hex is payed by minting new coins. Why is this important? Because minting does not require any work, so it does not add any value. 

So I thought of hex as being a worthless project, but not a scam. That changed when I saw the hex website, when it was launched in 2019. It was so full of nonsense.

## Here is what he said on the website

1. Hex is faster and cheaper than bitcoin.

This is crap because hex runs on ethereum, so hex does not control the speed and the fees. Sure, at that time, ethereum transactions were faster and cheaper. But that was the case for any ERC20 token. So all ERC20 tokens are better than bitcoin then?
Currently, gas fees on ethereum are extremely high. So hex has a problem now, more than other cryptos, as interest calculations of hex are very expensive.

2. Bitcoin had two inflation bugs.

Alright, hex is a smart contract, so you cannot compare it to a blockchain. Besides, bitcoin has been running for 10 years and hex was not even launched yet. So bugs could still be discovered. But you can't even compare. It's like comparing Tic-Tac-Toe running on JavaScript to the unix operating system. Makes no sense comparing two things that are on completely different levels.

3. Bitcoin has not been audited, while hex has 3 audits.

Again, you can't compare a few lines of code of a smart contract to a whole blockchain. Like, now he is starting pulsechain, which also will not have any audits.

4. Bitcoin is bad for the environment.

Hex runs on ethereum, and users pay proof of work miners for every transaction, staking and end staking. This is bad for the environment as well.

5. Bitcoin has higher inflation in first 8 years.

Supply increases with every block reward, but demand is growing as well, a lot faster even. So I see nobody complaining about bitcoin inflation. Most crypto have higher inflation. Hex inflation was extremely high during first year. And hex supply keeps growing exponentially, while bitcoin supply is limited to 21 million forever.

6. Hex can easily 10,000x in two or three years. Hex is designed to go up in price.

Hex does not add any value. It failed miserably in the first months, dropping over 90% in value.
Richard then decided to take away most of the supply, such that the interest went up to 30-40%. This had a sales pitch that enough people would fall for.
In reality, the supply circulating between users, would also grow 30-35%, but many crypto users fail to understand this or don't realize it yet.
Price appreciation is due to the marketing and exposure. Even though the vast majority of crypto investors don't fall for these scams, enough people do to pump the price.

If you look at the hex website today, it still has a page dedicated to explaining how hex is not a scam. It's mostly filled with a lot of similar nonsense.

During hours long live streams, Richard Heart keeps feeding more nonsense to people.

## Here is what he's saying repeatedly in his live streams


7. Hex popularized Uniswap.

Uniswap was the fastest and well-known defi project, before hex was even launched. Most Uniswap users now, never even heard of hex.
Hex was kicked off of an exchange and denied on all other large exchanges. Hex had nowhere to go, but to liquidity pools of Uniswap and other defi exchanges and a few small exchanges most people never heard of.
Richard makes it sound like Uniswap needed hex to grow, but the truth is, hex needed Uniswap (and still does).

8. Stocks go up in price due to inflation rather than due to profits and dividends.

If people don't believe a company will be profitable in the future, they won't buy the stocks. Those companies will go bankrupt and no inflation will help the stock prices of these companies.

9. All people care about, is the price going up.

This only goes for worthless coins. Because when the price stops going up, without use case, you are just holding air.

10. Hex is designed to go up in price.

Price goes up due to demand. Demand comes from value or marketing. Hex does not have value, but enough people are falling for the marketing crap.

11. Bitcoin also does not have a use case.

Bitcoin is more than the coin. It's a whole network of blockchain nodes and miners, securing transactions for the users.

12. Consider selling all your crypto for hex. Buy hex for sacrifice, because with low liquidity, price is easily moved up a lot.

This is pure shilling his own garbage bags.

Right now, Richard Heart has people hyped up about pulsechain. He wants people to believe pulse can have similar returns as hex. But pulse does not have the 30-40% sales pitch, even though this 30-40% is out of thin air.
Most people don't know about Richard Hearts failed projects, like CFD token.
And even Richard has not figured out how to add game theory to pulse to draw in users. People invested in pulse are full of hopium.

And with ethereums upcoming merge with the proof of stake beacon chain, expected in Q1 of 2022, why do we even need pulsechain?

But hey, if people insist on throwing their money into a pit, that's up to them.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Educational - How Bitcoin Is Different From USD - BTC VS USD,"Hi guys!

I've made a new educational video where we compare bitcoin to US dollars:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mSzSs\_Drl4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mSzSs_Drl4)

We will look at the supply and the economics of both and compare them to each other.

We will take a look at the economics of the US dollar especially in the recent years since the financial crisis, and we will look also at the purchasing power of USD.

We will also speak about Bitcoin economics, learn how bitcoin is being created (Block Rewards), burned, what is bitcoin halving, and much more.

We will also speak about Fiat money, the Nixon shock, USD purchasing power, and Federal Reserve print orders

personalfinance,US EV Tax credit,"First, apologies if this is not the right sub.

I am planning to buy a new Tesla in 2022, and trying to figure out refundable vs non-refundable tax credits. I’ve read that “a non-refundable credit can reduce your bill to 0 but does not put money into your pocket”.

My yearly federal income taxes are more than the proposed credit. But I pay those taxes through the year from each paycheck and rarely owe anything more at the end.

Does that mean I cannot take advantage of the credit? That would seem odd … don’t most people end up about even at the end of the year?

Or, would I still be able to get the credit amount returned to me, as it’s not considered “money into my pocket” because I am, in total, paying money to the federal government for the year?

Must I reduce my paycheck contribution by $7500 for the year, in order to take advantage of the credit?

Many thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Why Banks don’t increase savings interest rates to compete with crypto?,"Curious why banks still generally only offer about .01% - .05% interest on savings accounts when they know many crypto assets reward well in excess of 5% just for holding or staking the assets, which is essentially the same as letting your money sit in a savings account, albeit perhaps slightly more risky. Banks are essentially loaning out your money held in savings and charging anywhere from 4% (mortgage) to upwards of 20% interest (credit cards) to others, but you only get .01% interest from the bank for giving them the liquidity to make those loans. Do banks not see the writing on the wall? Have they not yet felt the pressure to compete with crypto? Cathie Woods with ARK investments gave the opinion recently that she thinks banks are in fact feeling it already because profits come from the margins and crypto is shaving away those margins; yet, what have banks done to compete? Nothing, it seems.

personalfinance,Refinancing Mortgage,"I’m in the market to refinance the mortgage on my home and have been banking with the same bank for all my needs since I opened my first bank account at 16. 

Since starting the process, I’ve received a number of offers from other banks at a much lower APR than my “home” bank. When it comes to a mortgage, is a loan a loan? I’m looking for a lump sum of money at a low interest rate so why pick a big name over a low APR?

What should I be on the lookout for by these seemingly great offers?",finance
personalfinance,"Lender is doubling closing costs, is there anything I can do?","We're getting a mortgage and we were told our closing costs would be between $4,000-$5,000.  Today our lender sent an estimate at over $11,000, after I talked to the lender yesterday.  The reason given was ""

&gt;The reason that seems high is that when switching back to a Conventional loan, and because we use Fannie Mae as the regulatory bank, we charge LLPA points(Loan Level Price Adjustment points) based on credit score and loan to value of the home.These do not increase your interest rate, but they will add to your closing cost.The value of the home will not be an issue, but a less than perfect credit score, in this case a 647 does change the closing cost by $5,101.25

This was all known to them every time I've spoken to them.  Is this normal, or is there anything I can do about this?

EDIT: To be clear I didn't switch products. We were approved for both FHA and Conventional. He knew we planned to go Conventional when we spoke. He also knew our credit information. Nothing changed between the time we spoke yesterday and the email he sent today.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Ethereum 2.0: A Guide for Newcomers to the Crypto Space,"Fed up with Ethereum gas fees? To a point, we all are, but it’s important to consider context when investing in Ethereum (and really any project for that matter). Questions related to Ethereum gas fees on this sub are about as regular as that shit following your first cup of coffee or morning cigarette, so I'm here to spread the good word.

Before getting into the nitty gritty of Ethereum 2.0, the first important bit of context is that you’re investing a brand new technology, not just a store of value. If you’re worried about gas fees significantly affecting you’re bottom-line, you might not be in the right place. With that in mind, lets get to into the details.

The gas fees for Ethereum are a well-known issue that are driven by two major factors: user demand and scalability. When Ethereum launched in 2015, there was always concern for the latter, especially as the former grew. We're at or well past the point of scalability keeping up with demand, but Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum dev team have been working hard to address these issues. 

That's where [Ethereum 2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision/) comes in. Eth2 is an upgrade to the Ethereum block chain aimed at enhancing the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the Ethereum network so that it can process more transactions and ease bottlenecks. 
This issue is the chief reason for high gas fees. Eth2 is a redesigned Ethereum blockchain complete with a new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and the ability to process significantly more transactions per second (TPS). The Ethereum 2.0 updates intend to provide scalability that is orders of magnitude greater than what is currently available with Ethereum — a jump from roughly 10 TPS to potentially 100,000 TPS.
Ethereum aims at upgrading three key areas to the Ethereum network:

- **Scalability**: Simply put, Ethereum needs to be able to handle more transactions per second without increasing the size of the nodes in the network. While increasing the size of nodes on the network could increase the capacity for transactions per second, the hardware requirements would restrict who could do it, threatening decentralization. Without powerful and expensive computers to provide larger nodes, the alternative is simply more of them. The shard chains upgrade will spread the load of the network into 64 new chains. This will give Ethereum room to breathe by reducing congestion and improving speeds beyond the current 15-45 transactions per second limit. Despite an increase in network nodes, this will actually require less work from validators as they will only be required to run **THEIR** shard, as opposed to the entire Ethereum chain, thereby making each node more lightweight and enabling Ethereum to scale and remain decentralized.

- **Security**: More nodes means an increased need for security. The Eth2 upgrade improves Ethereum’s security against coordinated attacks that threaten the integrity of the network and prevent flatulence. The transition to proof-of-stake means that the Ethereum protocol has greater disincentives against attack. This is because in proof-of-stake, the validators who secure the network must stake significant amounts of ETH into the protocol. If they try and attack the network, the protocol can automatically destroy their ETH. This is an improvement on proof-of-work, which can do very little to prevent miners from exploiting vulnerabilities. With the introduction of shard chains, Eth2 will require the Beacon Chain to randomly assign validators to different shards, making it virtually impossible for validators to ever collude by attacking a specific shard. Staking also allows regular investors to become a validator, increasing the network’s decentralization and decreasing the attack surface area. To become a validator, all one need do is stake your ETH.

- **Sustainability**: Ethereum, among other block chains (Bitcoin included) are far from energy efficient in their current state, mostly due to the power requirements to mine. Ethereum intends to address this via Staking. In simple terms, validators don’t require energy-intensive computers to order or participate in a proof-of-stake system. the Ethereum we use today will run in parallel for a period of time, before it 'merges' with the Eth2 upgrades. One system secured by ETH, the other by computing power. This is because, at first, shard chains won't be able to handle things like our accounts or dapps. So we can't just forget about mining and Mainnet. With the Beacon Chain up and running, work has begun on merging Mainnet with the new system. This will turn Mainnet into a shard so that it’s secured by ETH and far less energy intensive.

Ethereum 2.0 is launching in several phases:

- **Phase 0 - Beacon Chain (Launched December 1, 2020)**: Delivered three primary technological implementations to the Ethereum ecosystem (the Beacon Chain, the PoS consensus mechanism, and validator nodes) that help ensure the shards across the network are kept in sync.

- **Phase 1 - Sharding Framework:** Anticipated 2022. The main objective of this phase is implementing shard chains and roll-ups. **Sharding** is a cutting edge scaling solution that breaks down the Ethereum network into smaller shards to increase both capacity and speed of transactions. **Roll-ups** initiate a process of off-chain transaction aggregation that bunches transactions together for execution before confirmation on the main chain. Implemented in concert, both techniques are expected to be a boon to Ethereum’s transactional capabilities.

- **Phase 1.5 - Ethereum transitions to Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain:** Anticipated 2022. The legacy Ehtereum chain becomes a shard on the new blockchain. The legacy Ethereum network likewise will transition to a proof-of-stake network and connect to the main Ethereum 2 chain. This effectively bridges Phase 0 and 1 while being the first official live launch of Ehtereum 2.0

- **Phase 2 - Fully Functioning Shards:** The shard chain will be fully functioning and able to communicate with each other and run smart contracts. The is more of an expected upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 than a feature at launch and will have a list of more detailed features published upon the completion of Phase 1.5

There's sever concepts I could only go into limited detail on, but below are some sources that explain some of these concepts in deeper detail:

CryptoCurrency,1 Year Alt-Coin DCA Experiment - Week 3 (second) update,"For anyone who hasn't seen my prior posts, I'm conducting a 1 year DCA experiment with 16 alt-coins. Why am I doing this? Partly because it's fun to talk about crypto and something like this will demonstrate how DCAing can pay off (or not, I guess we'll find out at the end) and partly because I was at a point where I wanted to expand my portfolio to include exposure to more projects because there are just so many good ones out there.

To make it interesting for the community I decided to take suggestions for the 16 coins I would include in my portfolio and I will donate at least 25% of the gains from the best performing coin to a charity chosen by the user who suggested it.

For those of you who have been following along, I'm just about done selecting the 16 coins, in fact I am done selecting them, but there is still one remaining unnamed by the community. For full update on the selection process click here for the first part of the week 2 update: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qpv0u8/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_3_partial/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3.

Please add your suggestions for what you think the final coin should be (or rather what the final coin is) and I will add the person who correctly suggests it to the table. Make sure to check against the list of coins already suggested as well as my exclusion list in the others posts. Also note, that it is one suggestion per person. As a final clue, I will add that the final coin is in the top 25 by market cap, so use that as a guide.

Some other housekeeping I want to note before I get into the financial update. First, I had planned on investing in RUNE (THORChain) as part of the experiment as well, in fact one astute user noticed that I had labeled it ""will invest next week"" in my previous post and changed it to ""no"" in the latest update. I wanted to explain why I did this. There were a few reasons, but ultimately it came down to either RUNE or OCEAN for the final spot as I had decided on all the others by that point. I went with OCEAN because it was one I had not heard anything about prior to the experiment but upon reading the whitepaper and looking into it, I really wanted to include it. In addition, I felt like if I did decide to invest in RUNE I would want to do so in a liquidity pool with another asset and I felt that this wouldn't fit the parameters of the experiment well. I may still invest in it on the side, but it won't be part of this experiment. As a consolation, I will donate $25 to a charity chosen by u/j0-hn-dea-ux who originally suggested RUNE. If you happen to see this post, please let me know what charity you would like the funds to go to. If I don't see a response in here I'll reach out through a DM.

Second, I decided to add some ""controls"" to the experiment. The point of this will be to use as benchmarks to see how these alt-coins fare against the big boys in the market and a stablecoin. For this reason, in next week's purchase I will also be adding BTC, ETH and USDT. I will buy and hold each of these on BlockFi and collect interest against them. I chose BTC and ETH for obvious reasons and USDT because I already have some USDC collecting interest on BlockFi and USDT pays a higher interest rate (currently 9.5% for &lt;$40k). These will be updated along with the other coins each week, but will not be in the running to win the prize.

Third, this was in my last post as well, but once the final coin is added, I will provide a link to the portfolio I set up on CoinGecko that will be tracking this portfolio so anyone can look at any time.

Finally, the financials.  This part of the post was held back originally because I was waiting on a fiat deposit to Crypto.com to go through. I got the notice this morning that the funds were availble, so I have now purchased the 4 coins for this week and will be updating. As I mentioned in the other post, going forward the list of suggested coins will no longer be included. The last thing to note is that I've reorganized it to read like a leaderboard, from the highest gainer to the lowest. For all of the ones I haven't actually invested in yet, I just listed those at the bottom for now.

EDIT: If someone could explain to me how the total cost, prepaid/reserve, earnest money, and down payment all fit into the house buying process, I would really appreciate it!

We're in the process of closing on a house (doing inspections at the moment). Closing is set for the week before Christmas.

Our down payment is a gift from my parents, so the 30k is not taken into consideration.

Our bank account currently has \~$23k in it.

# Other additional things to worry about:

\- We know the HVAC needs to be replaced (should last through the winter), father in law and his friend are helping us with installation and purchasing so we approximate the cost to be \~$6,000 (it's a guess amount)

\- The health insurance will be increasing to $400/month (unsure what the amount was before), because Hubby will be adding me and our son onto it.

\- My student loans will start needing to be paid around the beginning of the year, and it's \~$436.75/month (will look into refinancing when the time comes)

\- Every NCLEX attempt is $200. (Will do a maximum of 2 attempts)

\- Homeowners insurance will be bundled with the Progressive so it will be an addition of $89/month.

\- We will need to get a washer and dryer for our home.

\- Daycare eventually.- Christmas gifts (Hubby has budgeted 1k for the entire family, yes he has a big family.)

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, i think with 23k in the bank account, and all these additional big expenses that we'll need to do, i'm unsure if we will be able to handle it. We're already in the process of closing so it's not like we can back out, but I would like some other people to give me their thoughts on the situation. Feel free to ask any questions, I hope this is enough information to give you guys a clear picture.

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Should I do a charge back in this case?,"My dog used to use PetLab Anti Itch Chews until I noticed they didn't do anything for her so I stopped buying them. I never had a subscription for them. Last time I bought/received were in February of this year. I got an email in October saying that they were about to be sent out. I sent an email to them saying I never ordered, they said that I had a subscription and just pushed the date back 4 months. I logged in, saw I had one, cancelled it and tried to get them to cancel the upcoming order but since it was being sent out they couldn't do anything about it so they gave me a shipping label to send the products back.

The chews came on the 21st via FedEx. I taped the box extra, put the label on and dropped it off at the post office(the return label was for USPS). Luckily I took a picture of the return label and saw that on the 25th it said the box was delivered. I kind of forgot about the return until late last week and I emailed them asking about my money. They said that they never got the box and that I would get the refund when they found the products. 

Here is the first email 



""We totally understand you would like to know the status of your refund. In order for us to process it, we will have to confirm in our fulfillment center that the items you have returned have been successfully received by us.

We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience, however, we did run a check again for any returns using your name, order number, and tracking number but it is still not logged on our records.

personalfinance,Started saving for retirement later in life...,"Hello!

I'm 40 and for most of my adult life I was working jobs that paid just above minimum wage. I also made tons of bad financially irresponsible decisions. At age 35, I got my first salaried job. Not only did I start saving up for a 401k for the first time, but I also started my first emergency savings (I know, I know). 

Five years later, I am in a better place financially. I currently make 190k. My credit FICA has gone up to 745-751. I paid off all of my credit card debt and now credit cards responsibly. I brought down my college loans to $15k. I am married to someone who makes less than I do but has historically been much more responsible with money, their finances are not taken into account here.

I want to know what I can do to improve my retirement accounts

**401k**

I've had it for 5 years, but contributed about 6% of my salary a year to get the match. It's currently at $77k. All of it invested in a 2050 Target fund, expense ratio of .27%. I would be 69 in 2050. I'd love to retire at 60 or earlier, but since I started my 401k at 35, that might not be possible.
I tried to contribute at max, but with my 7% employer match I will hit $20k contributions by EOY. I will aim to contribute to max next year.

**ROTH IRA**

I opened one this year, rolled over from Traditional to ROTH. I maxed out 2020 &amp; 2021 contributions.  All of it is in FXAIX, I've had about 15.5% total gains. Is it risky being all in FXAIX? Should I look into target funds?

**Brokerage**

This year was my first time trading on the stock market. I have a lot to learn, but I think it's best if I stick with ETFs for now. I have about $4k in various stocks. I just transferred another $4k in my company's stock to that I got through ESPP to my Fidelity account. I will be transferring those to ETFs. I think I will transfer some of the other stock I have in ETFs. Any suggestions?

**Crypto**

Got into crypto this year, about $300.

**Emergency Savings**

$50k. Is this too much? I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so the cost of living is high

**Expenses**

- Monthly rent is $2800 
- Car is paid for
- Provide occasional financial assistance to two grandparents &amp; parents

**Debt**

- $15k in college loans. Highest interest rate is 4%. 
- $5k in medical debt that is financed, interest free
- $3k in financed home appliances, interest free

**Financial goals**

- Plan on buying a new car in the next 1-2 years, after the market demand subsides
- No plans on buying a home while living in the Bay Area
- Possible plans of having a child via adoption or surrogacy, but not in the Bay Area
- (no immediate plans of staying in the Bay Area, but we do have long-term plans of moving to the Pacific Northwest)
- We have overseas travel plans in 2022 and 2023",finance

personalfinance,Is it better to enroll in an FSA at work or to use my Amex BCP for 6% cash back at pharmacies?,"Trying to decide which would be better for me. I’m in a ladder career position with the federal government so my pay will increase each year from $47k currently to $85k in three years. As it stands I live in a HCOL area and am not bringing in a lot after taxes and premiums (around $1,100 biweekly). 

I do have to go to the doctor regularly for medication management and other specialists. My healthcare is good at about $30 copay visits. My pharmacy is Walmart Neighborhood market so with AmEx BCP I can get 6% cash back with my prescriptions there and same with Walgreens, CVS etc for OTC and other products. 

I’m wondering whether it would be better to lower my net pay even more with an FSA or save money this year by using my Amex card. Amex wouldn’t cover copays for visits and labs so it may be overruled by the FSA on that side. I’m just not sure how much to estimate for the FSA to deduct per pay period and I would hate to have it deducted, not need as much, and have a lower take home pay. 

How can I calculate which would be better for me this year (until August 2022)?",finance

personalfinance,"(USA, California) Opinions on Medicare Advantage or OG Medicare + Supplemental + Part D?","My mom and I recently helped my dad decide between his employer sponsored retirement Medicare Advantage health plan vs Original Medicare with supplemental and Part D included.  My mom works in healthcare and advised that Medicare Advantage lures people in with very low upfront costs so we decided on OG Medicare.  My dad likes Blue Shield so I advised him to take a Blue Shield Supplemental Health Plan G ($90 a month) along with a Blue Shield of California Prescription Drug Plan Plus ($60 a month).  Things seemed swell when we had this setup two months ago.  

However, the drug costs under the prescription drug plan are pretty insane.  I believe my dad is taking some tier 4 medications and these cost around $272.00 for a thirty day supply.  My dad is flabbergasted that this medication that used to be $25.00 is now almost 11x the cost.  He was also not fond of the deductible and the incoming ""Donut Hole"" where he will be responsible for more of the costs.  Seeing these prices, my dad doesn't have a fond opinion of what we've signed him up for now and is contemplating going back to Medicare Advantage.  I also realize now realize the PDP I signed up for is the basic tier insurance and I probably should've signed him up for the ""Enhanced"" PDP ($160.00/month) which covers more and doesn't have a deductible.  Yet at the same time, he probably would've scoffed at paying 2.5x for this higher level of insurance 

I feel like we made an educated choice but it's difficult to reason with someone whose paying way more for the same medications they've been taking for the last few years.  Is there anything I can tell my dad to make him more understandable about the current insurance?  Otherwise, maybe I should've shopped around for a better PDP.  I only set him up with Blue Shield since he has been using them for the last decade or two.",finance
personalfinance,Higher loan balance with lower interest rate? Or lower loan balance with higher interest rate?,"7k loan interest rate of 8.49
10k loan interest rate of 4.98

Upon digging a little deeper I noticed that if you want to take out a loan of 10 K or a higher, the interest rate is actually 4.98% .. almost half! so if I were to take out an additional $3000 which I could probably pay off right away and not receive an early payment penalty, I would be receiving a much lower interest-rate.... just for borrowing an extra 3k?

I applied to refinance with SoFi (through my work) and the offer is a fixed interest rate for my two loans at \~5% (over 15yr) which I think is a great deal, especially since it lowers my monthly payments by around $200. However, there is a hefty Finance Charge of $32k!

One section of the loan offer says ""Prepayments: If you pay the loan off early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge.""

Another section says ""NOTICES TO CUSTOMER (d) YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO PAY IN ADVANCE THE UNPAID BALANCE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND YOU MAY BE ENTITLED TO A PARTIAL REFUND OF THE FINANCE CHARGE.""

So obviously sounds contradictory but I called SoFi and their answer was that, while I won't get a refund for any finance charge, the total finance charge will be lower if I prepay. Also there is no prepay penalty. 

That answer makes sense to me. BUT, I'm very nervous with this sort of stuff and I really just wanted to hear if anyone else has refinanced with SoFi, and how their Finance Charge has changed if they prepaid?

(For reference, my current loans are private, split in two with one interest rate being \~5% and one being \~8.5%. Each loan is around 37K.)",finance
CryptoCurrency,The 2021 bullrun exit strategy,"**\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***

I posted an update on Saturday Jan 8th

Hang in there everyone, no dip lasts forever.

**Disclaimer:** This exit strategy relies on a bunch of assumptions. The point of this post is not to debate those. If you think this bullrun will last well into 2022 or perhaps even longer, that's cool, you do you. What I'm about to describe is my own exit strategy. I'm not trying to convince you that it's better than your plan, my only hope is that there might be handful of people to whom this makes sense who can take something valuable from this post. As for the rest of you, best of luck, and I sincerely mean that.

**Thesis Statement:** I believe we are at the tail end of the bullrun that started after the March Covid crash of 2020. We have seen mindblowing gains on alts like Solana, Luna, Ada, Avax, Harmony, and many others. I believe that there's not much juice left in that lemon. The main reasons for this belief are:

\- **This isn't the ""cycle of mass adoption"".** This is actually a good thing, because literally none of the L1s in the top 100 are ready for mass adoption: Solana had to shut down for 17 hours because it buckled under the weight of transactions. Eth's answer to increasing traffic is to charge you $250 in gas for a uniswap transaction. Matic can barely handle the traffic it gets currently and transactions frequently remain 'pending' for hours or days. Cardano still doesn't have working smart contracts and Hoskinson himself essentially admitted that it can't scale without L2s. I could go on here, but you get the point.

\- **Governments all around the world have been printing money like it's a sport, and that didn't begin in 2020 with the onset of the pandemic, it began more than 10 years ago after the financial crisis.** A by-product of this has been record-low interest rates. This has fueled investment all over the planet, as is easily evidenced by a completely out of control housing market in most major markets and a stock market that has been basically 'up only' for ten years straight. Governments are now admitting that the current 4%-5% inflation rate is not sustainable. In order to get this back in line, the federal banks will have to raise interest rates. That means less money for all of us, because things like mortgages, car payments, credit card debt, etc. will all go up. And obviously, it will no longer make sense to take a loan to invest (and yes, people have definitely been taking loans to invest, simply because it made sense: you can take a loan from the bank for less 5% and put that money into index funds and you'll come out on top....at least for now).

\- **This whole space is dramatically overvalued.** Yes I know, market caps do not reflect the actual value of a company, but they do reflect the current level of speculation: we are in the kind of market where Tesla is worth more than the entire German automotive industry. Cardano is worth $77 billion dollars and it currently doesn't even function as an L1 smart contract chain. Dot is worth $50 billion dollars and barely has a working product. The point is that the current valuations reflect what these projects may become in the next 5 years. In other words, their valuations are based on speculation, not current capabilities.

**""Ok dude, get to the point already""** I believe that this December will see the crypto market go absolutely ballistic, fueled by holiday spending, euphoria, and an over confidence in a market that has already seen 10X gains in the last 3 months. It will crash in early 2022, most likely kicked off by a stock market crash as governments all over the word raise interest rates and announce efforts to contain their out of control spending that's resulted in debt levels our grand children will still be paying off.

**""Cool story bro, so what are you gonna do about it?""** At some point in late December (obviously depending on market dynamics at the time), I'm going to sell most of my crypto assets for stable coins and earn yield on stable coins. The US dollar is extremely unlikely to collapse. And if it does, the whole planet goes into a massive economic recession and crypto will not be spared. USD will be the safest asset to be in, save for perhaps gold. Here's what I will do step by step:

\- Deposit stable coin as collateral on a protocol such as anchor, earning interest

\- take stable coin loan against collateral, again earning to borrow (and even if you're no longer getting paid to borrow, the interest earned from lending will most likely outweigh the interest owed from borrowing, meaning on a net level, you're still making money)

\- Provide stable coin liquidity, e.g. USDC &lt;&gt; DAI pair, earning yield and compounding that yield into liquidity.

The rates currently available for doing this vary from platform to platform, but at the moment, you can easily get 20% APR doing this. If you're willing to risk doing this with smaller, less established platforms like Tranquil and Openswap on Harmony, you can get almost 100% APR). There are variations of the above, but that's the general gist.

**""And then what?""** I wait as my USD reserves grow. I use the time to research in an effort to identify alts that have a good chance of becoming winners in the next bull market. My focus will be on L1s that can actually scale to global demand without having to rely on imperfect L2 solutions. Once it becomes relatively clear that the market has reached the bottom (where it will probably stay for quite some time like it has in every other true bear market), I start to DCA, positioning myself for the next bull market, whether that comes in late 2022 or in 2024, I plan on being a part of it.

Thanks to those who read this entire wall of text, and to those who didn't, well, you're not reading this anyway ;)

**EDIT:** A few responses are misinterpreting the above as trying to 'time the market'. I wouldn't really call it that. If I was trying to time the market, I'd be trying to sell more or less the exact top. I know I won't be able to do that, and I'm not at all ruling out that after I sell, the market keeps pumping throughout January and maybe even longer. But I'm absolutely willing to forego gains at the very tail end of the market if it means not having to see my portfolio bleed like a slasher movie over the course of a few short days like it did in 2018.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Nov 9, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 9, 2021**

The stock market took a breather, putting a pause on this record-breaking rally, with all three major indexes closing the day lower. In recent weeks, market participants have rode an extended wave of optimism amid better than expected earnings season, new, better than expected economic data, the passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress, and a new antiviral coronavirus pill from Pfizer (PFE). 

With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. 

[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\_110521.pdf](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf)

Marci McGregor, Bank of America Merryl Lynch Senior Investment Strategist said, “I still think it’s all about corporate profits.  I know a lot of my peers are concerned that peak earnings growth is behind us. But I think peak earnings isn’t even a 2022 story. We’re seeing solid consumer demand, a strong U.S. economy, and I think we’re going to have a capex cycle in 2022. And I think that’s all positive for corporate profits, and that underpins this market, in my view.”

However, despite positive earnings, a host of companies have cited constraints around raw materials, labor shortages, and general supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. According to Bank of America, mentions of supply chains on quarterly earnings calls have surged by 360% compared to last year, underscoring the widespread nature of these pressures. These supply-related issues have also contributed to still-elevated inflationary trends. Tuesday's Producer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that producer prices rose by 8.6% over last year, matching October's rate for the fastest on record in data going back to Nov. 2010. 

Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco, said “I would expect inflation to peak by mid-year 2022. It should remain elevated but it should move lower in the back half of 2022. So while this is certainly an issue, it is part of what we should expect coming out of the pandemic. We have gotten out of a burning building, but we should expect that there is a little smoke and water damage as a result. That’s really what we’re experiencing with elevated inflation and supply chain disruptions”. I agree with this position and think the analogy is very apt.

personalfinance,Mortgage - Approach to downpayment,"Hi All,
We are looking for a new home for a growing family and I am currently trying to figure out the most efficient way to come up with a down payment.

Some basic facts: 
* We own a home
* In our market it is not possible to list your current home as a contingency
* We are having a new child in March and will likely be trying to move in the late spring although it is possible it could be sooner if the right house comes along. Long story short, there is a reasonable likelihood we will be paying double mortgage for a few months. We are ok with this but it means we won't be able to use equity to finance the down payment (see bullet 2)
* We are trying as hard as possible not to sell stock for tax purposes 
* We will probably have about 200k liquid by the time we purchase. 20% down on the properties we are looking at is 600kish so we have a 300-500k gap to cover most likely 
* Have about 800k in equity in current home

Options:
* I found a bridge mortgage product that would allow us to use our home equity to cover 2.698m on the new property at 5% down and 3.25% interest. Upon sale of our current property the loan would be re-capitalized with the remaining 15% down and would remain 5 year ARM at 3.25%. Any home above 2.698 we would have to foot the bill on the difference.
* I could take out a margin loan against our brokerage account for the down payment and pay that loan off upon selling our home. Interest rate would be high (like 5%) but it would just be a short bridge. Account balance makes a margin call pretty unlikely.
* I could bite the bullet and just take the LTCG hit.

personalfinance,Converting Series EE Bonds to Series I Bonds,"Hi all,

I've been reading a lot about Series I Bonds since new interest rate for the next 6 months was announced as \~7.0%. Is there any reason to NOT sell low yield (&lt;1%) Series EE bonds and use that value to purchase Series I bonds? 

Example:

I have about $3K in Series EE Bonds with rates below 1%. Any tax liability I'd incur from selling these would be offset by Series I gains at 7% interest in the long term, right? Series I rates also have not been below 2% for a few years, correct, so even if inflation / rates return to normal I should net out positively? I have no plans to sell the Series I bonds within the 1st year, and potentially within 5 yrs. 

Am I oversimplifying this, or can anyone poke holes in this thought process?  Thanks.",finance

**TLDR**:

With some of the above analysis, centralised exchanges have the ability to use complex calculations without worrying about costs to create many complex derivatives. However, with decentralised exchanges, they are limited in this ability, so they focus on a single niche and improve their products slowly.

FTX is one of the leading derivatives exchanges when it comes to creating unique (but also ""dangerous"") products. Meanwhile, Mirror and Synthetix are more specialised in a particular market. Technological capabilities do not meet current needs.

In terms of synthetic products, all three exchanges are competing with each other. FTX simply collateralises real-life assets and tokenises them. Synthetix mortgages $SNX again for $Synths. Mirror is more diversified in collaterals to generate $mAssets.

# General Conclusion

Today we will discuss platforms that offer a variety of derivative products. Our approach will go from off-chain to on-chain and outline the benefits and drawbacks of each platform.

In addition, we also analyse aspects related to token design. We will have a closer look at each of the tokens that make up the platform.

In this article, we focus on three main platforms: TFX ($FTT), Synthetix ($SNX) and Mirror ($MIR). All three protocols deal with derivatives. How are they different? How are they the same? How are they successful?

 

# What are Derivatives?

&gt;Contract based on underlying asset

A derivative is a financial transaction **contract** between two or more parties **based on** a change in the future value of an **underlying asset**. That underlying asset can be a tangible asset, an index, or an interest rate. Derivatives themselves have no intrinsic value.

&gt;Assets: Gold, silver, precious metals, coffee, rice. Index: Stocks, bonds, interest rates.

That is, users transact based on a change in the value of another entity rather than directly owning that entity. Profit is generated based on the spread and price movement of the underlying asset.

Derivatives trades have been around since medieval times, between merchants. The first base assets used were olives and food.

In derivatives trading, there are four basic types of contracts:

* **Forwards** Contract: An agreement to trade between two parties at a specified time in the future. The price is determined and agreed upon by both parties in the present.
* **Futures** Contract: This is a standardised form of forwarding contract and listed for trading on official exchanges.  
For example: In the US, there is the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).
* **Option**: A contract in which one party has the right to require the other party to perform the obligation to buy or sell an amount of the underlying asset at a specified price on or before a certain date.
* **Swap**: An agreement between two parties A and B in which they exchange the cash flow of party A's financial instrument with the cash flow of party B's financial instrument for a certain period of time.

# What are Crypto Derivatives?

&gt;Short Answer: Crypto-based derivatives are dependent on change in value of crypto tokens

Simply put, you will trade with each other based on the price of tokens. You will not be directly owning and trading those crypto coins.

The biggest difference between traditional derivatives and crypto derivatives is that crypto's underlying assets are not bonds, stocks or interest, but crypto tokens.

For example, you see that the BTC/USDT is aligned with your risk profile and you can find a way to make money there.

There are two methods for you to participate in profitable trading:

* Method 1: Buy $BTC directly and trade it.
* Method 2: Trade derivatives of $BTC. This comes in the form of a financial contract. At this time, you do not need to buy and own $BTC.

If you choose **Method 2** to trade, you are trading **derivatives**.

CryptoCurrency,1 Year Alt-Coin DCA Experiment - Week 3 (second) update (repost),"EDIT: We finally have the last coin in the project: AVAX!

Please check out the link to the project on CoinGecko here: https://www.coingecko.com/en/portfolios/public/pokoire-1-year-dca-experiment

As I've been posting about this project I think I'm starting to learn that when I post something to the forum greatly affects the level of interaction my posts get. At least I think that's why my updates this week got much less interaction - perhaps I'm just getting duller as I go. At any rate, this is a shameless repost of my week 3 update because I am still missing the final suggestion for my 16 coins. If you are interested in being a part of the experiment, there is still one coin that I plan on including which no one has suggested. It's a top 25 coin that I don't yet own and isn't part of the list below. One suggestion per person and the one who gets it right will be on record for the contest. If that coin ends up having the highest profit over the course of the project, that person will get to choose a charity where I will donate at least 25% of the profits.

The rest of the post is simply a repost from earlier (except the financials, I did at least update those).

For anyone who hasn't seen my prior posts, I'm conducting a 1 year DCA experiment with 16 alt-coins. Why am I doing this? Partly because it's fun to talk about crypto and something like this will demonstrate how DCAing can pay off (or not, I guess we'll find out at the end) and partly because I was at a point where I wanted to expand my portfolio to include exposure to more projects because there are just so many good ones out there.

To make it interesting for the community I decided to take suggestions for the 16 coins I would include in my portfolio and I will donate at least 25% of the gains from the best performing coin to a charity chosen by the user who suggested it.

For those of you who have been following along, I'm just about done selecting the 16 coins, in fact I am done selecting them, but there is still one remaining unnamed by the community. For full update on the selection process click here for the first part of the week 2 update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qpv0u8/1\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment\_week\_3\_partial/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qpv0u8/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_3_partial/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

Please add your suggestions for what you think the final coin should be (or rather what the final coin is) and I will add the person who correctly suggests it to the table. Make sure to check against the list of coins already suggested as well as my exclusion list in the others posts. Also note, that it is one suggestion per person. As a final clue, I will add that the final coin is in the top 25 by market cap, so use that as a guide.

Some other housekeeping I want to note before I get into the financial update. First, I had planned on investing in RUNE (THORChain) as part of the experiment as well, in fact one astute user noticed that I had labeled it ""will invest next week"" in my previous post and changed it to ""no"" in the latest update. I wanted to explain why I did this. There were a few reasons, but ultimately it came down to either RUNE or OCEAN for the final spot as I had decided on all the others by that point. I went with OCEAN because it was one I had not heard anything about prior to the experiment but upon reading the whitepaper and looking into it, I really wanted to include it. In addition, I felt like if I did decide to invest in RUNE I would want to do so in a liquidity pool with another asset and I felt that this wouldn't fit the parameters of the experiment well. I may still invest in it on the side, but it won't be part of this experiment. As a consolation, I will donate $25 to a charity chosen by u/j0-hn-dea-ux who originally suggested RUNE. If you happen to see this post, please let me know what charity you would like the funds to go to. If I don't see a response in here I'll reach out through a DM.

Second, I decided to add some ""controls"" to the experiment. The point of this will be to use as benchmarks to see how these alt-coins fare against the big boys in the market and a stablecoin. For this reason, in next week's purchase I will also be adding BTC, ETH and USDT. I will buy and hold each of these on BlockFi and collect interest against them. I chose BTC and ETH for obvious reasons and USDT because I already have some USDC collecting interest on BlockFi and USDT pays a higher interest rate (currently 9.5% for &lt;$40k). These will be updated along with the other coins each week, but will not be in the running to win the prize.

Third, this was in my last post as well, but once the final coin is added, I will provide a link to the portfolio I set up on CoinGecko that will be tracking this portfolio so anyone can look at any time.

Finally, the financials.  This part of the post was held back originally because I was waiting on a fiat deposit to [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) to go through. I got the notice this morning that the funds were availble, so I have now purchased the 4 coins for this week and will be updating. As I mentioned in the other post, going forward the list of suggested coins will no longer be included. The last thing to note is that I've reorganized it to read like a leaderboard, from the highest gainer to the lowest. For all of the ones I haven't actually invested in yet, I just listed those at the bottom for now.

personalfinance,PenFed Power Cash Rewards Woes,"Hey all! Long time lurker, first time poster.

I got the Penfed Power Cash Rewards for the 2% cash back. For previous cards, I set up autopay to pay the statement balance in full as soon as it's due, and I'm all set.

For this card, there's a double whammy of issues:

* Apparently, I can't choose the date for autopay. It's tied to statement date, which for me is the 2nd, but my due date is the 27th- so my first autopayment as well as future ones will be late but within grace period.

* I can't pay the due amount- only choices are minimum amount, static amount, or last statement balance. My understanding of this is that if my statement is $3k on the second, if I pay off this $3k, then accrue another $2.5k throughout the month, the autopay date will pay off the lesser of the last statement ($3k) or the current amount owed ($2.5k), meaning it will pay $2.5k well before the due date.

This feels terrible to me! I don't like having to worry about whether daily interest will apply within that grace period, and while the interest on the early payments is peanuts, I just want to use it like a chase card- pay the amount due on the due date (or slightly before).

Has anybody already thought through this and/or have suggestions?",finance

34 y/o single male living in Northeastern city. Salary recently jumped from $110K to $140K in September. I work in consulting. I have $2,900 in monthly expenses. Approximately $1,344 of that is student loan payments (of which $550 of the student loan payments goes toward my mom's parent loan - total balance $110K). Personally, I have $73,425 in federal student loans. The loan was previously $108K pre-pandemic but I've been making headway since then. I have $34K in savings. About $4500 of that is in a stock brokerage account. I also have $80K in a Roth 401K. Question - as the federal moratorium on student loan payments comes to an end, should I drop a significant portion of my savings toward the student loans? I want to make a payment toward my mom's but am worried it's a bit of a lost cause - she's 72 y/o and near retirement. Typically, I split her monthly payment with her. Not sure how much longer that will last though. Would I be better of just focusing on my own loans? If so, how much of my savings should I spend?

I'm trying to minimize our tax liability for 2021. My spouse and I have maxed out our 401(k) contributions for the year. Since the standard deduction for 2021 is $25,100, where does a 529 contribution come into the calculation? Like, can I make an after-tax contribution at the end of the year on 31 Dec, then deduct it like an itemized deduction on our 2021 taxes?

If our property taxes total $7,000 for the year and we have no other (significant) deductions, would it make sense to put money into a 529, or would the standard deduction still be greater than what we can deduct by item?

personalfinance,"Took a credit hit to finish a major renovation, considering next moves and when to refi/consolidate","Hi all - will start by saying I appreciate all the thoughtful advice y'all share in the community. I think this situation is unique enough to start it's own post, but point me elsewhere for related advice exists. In short, I have to determine if I want to refi now, or wait until my credit score is back up in 12-18 months and do it then. 

We recently completed a major renovation of our home. Full demo of one floor and complete rebuild of half the square footage. We bought it 6-7 years ago knowing it was the location we wanted long-term, but would need to renovate to fit our family, and to permanently address some foundational/drainage issues. The timing wasnt great from a financial standpoint, but had to get it done to fit our growing family (now finished growing). 

Enough backstory, on to the numbers ... 
The project left us with about 120K in new debt. 50K is in a HELOC at 5.5%, I maxed out all the 0% credit I could, which was about 40K. The other 30K was in-store financing or personal loans through my existing credit lines that are in the 6-8% range. I've already paid 10K of that off in the first few months.

Pre-reno, we never carried any unstructured debt from month-to-month. Our credit score was 740ish for many years, 0 missed payments, plenty of open credit, etc. We are down to 640 because of credit usage and inquiries. Main mortgage balance is at 278K @ 4.25% fixed. Pre-reno in 2019, it appraised for 355K. Don't want to do a full appraisal now if possible, but if I needed to it would probably be 430-450K in this market according to my realtor. 

Right now base minimum payments on those loans listed above (not counting main mortgage) is about $2500 a month. That leaves roughly $1000 after all other bills/regular expenses are paid, which I've been applying each month to the highest APR loan. Starting in May, I'll be down to one daycare payment per month moving forward (wahoo!), which will free up an additional $1200-1300 per month. In a little less than three years, I'll be down to no daycare payments, so will be able to aggressively pay all debts within two-three years. 

Ultimately, I'm determining if I want to do a refinance now and consolidate some of this debt, but take on a slightly worse interest rate because of my current credit situation. Or, do I hope rates stay low, and wait 18-24 months when my credit is in better shape. I know it's a bit of a guessing game with rates on that long of a timeline, but thought I'd see what advice others have. 

For what it's worth, we both work in very stable fields with great insurance and are on solid footing professionally. I'm likely to be advancing into a new position within the next year or two with a solid pay bump, but am not going to factor that in until its final. We are all young(ish) and healthy, done having kids, and don't expect any major additional financial changes on the horizon. We are in relatively solid shape from an investment standpoint, will get pensions eventually in addition to our other investments, and I havent touched any of that. Lastly, while I don't have a large cash emergency fund, I do have other non-retirement investments I could liquidate quickly with minimal tax burden, but I won't get into details because it's out of scope here, other than noting I have cash if i need to access it in an emergency.

So, thats a lot, but it's everything I'm considering here. TIA for any thoughts!",finance

I just wanna know how I can dispute all these accounts properly with all three credit bureaus. People say to go online but I'm not sure that's the best way to go. So how I do I correctly dispute all these accounts with all three credit bureaus so I can go ahead and get these removed. Is snail mail a good option? Let me know what to do with a detailed answer. Thanks!

BONUS QUESTION: Do collectors try to sell your charged offed credit cards, repos or collections to another collector to restart the 7 years or am I just being paranoid?",finance
defi,Why do CeFi dominate stablecoin rates compared to DeFi?,"Hoping to understand a bit better why CeFi platforms like Nexo, Celsius, Blockfi are able to offer 8-12% interest rates while DeFi OGs like Aave and Compound tend to be in the 2-4% range (with an occasional spike into 20, 30, 40%).

I assume CeFi must be able to lend it out at higher rates, which doesn't necessarily make sense since CeFi seems to have stricter LTV collateral terms...",cryptocurrency

15. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

20. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It’s notable that Cardano’s Djed solves this.

22. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya.

23. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a “what if” scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised.

[https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/)
25. Remember! There is no mobile Daedalus wallet. There is no browser extension version of Daedalus. These are fakes! They will steal your ADA. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853)

31. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle.

33. COTI is a licensed payment institution in Singapore. This could get very interesting given their status as the issuer of Djed and the ongoing Monetary Authority of Singapore Blockchain Challenge in which Cardano is a finalist.

40. Coinbase is launching an NFT market. How will this impact the CNFT scene? Coinbase tells us: “...initial launch will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards with multi-chain support planned soon after.” [https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html)
41. Eric Rosengren (who recently left the Boston Fed) let’s us know that the Fed/MIT CBDC project is pretty far along and will release a working paper soon. This would obviously be impactful for all of crypto and for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/ivqFo9C2Jdo?t=409](https://youtu.be/ivqFo9C2Jdo?t=409)
42. The first project that actually looks like it may one day be a virtual world launches on Cardano and it already has a community built parcel explorer. [https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/](https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/)
43. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa. [https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830](https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830) [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08)

50. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan Müller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we’ll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)

54. The Cardano Foundation is changing its delegation strategy. They will go from primarily delegating to promote decentralization to a new framework focused on delegating to promote ecosystem buildout.

56. In the Cap Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative Fireside Q&amp;A, Charles mentioned he is talking to Colossol Labs about the possibility of having the Mammoth DeExtinction Project take place on his bison ranch.

stocks,Why we care about Michael Burry.,"\[*Inspired by this thread:* [*Michael Burry calling out Elon Musk, comparing today's market to tulip mania*](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qq85ed/the_big_short_investor_michael_burry_says_elon/)

*Someone asked ""semi-serious question, but why have we ever cared about what Michael Burry thinks?""  This was my answer, and I think it's important enough to warrant its own discussion.\]*

&amp;#x200B;

People care because the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was such a devastating and world-shattering event. It's basically unprecedented in our times. The only thing that comes close to it is the Great Depression, but you could argue that 2008 was even more shocking given the fact that an advanced, modern, technology-based financial system came to the brink of complete and utter failure.

That in and of itself leads to a compelling story. But what truly makes the whole thing amazing is the fact that people went on about their business like everything was fine, everything was great, and that we had entered into a new era of prosperity where nothing would or could go wrong. People like Burry were scorned, marginalized and laughed at.

It's truly amazing that the mob had no idea they were on the verge of one of the greatest societal disasters of our lifetimes. They were walking towards a precipice, blissfully unaware, and when the whole thing came crashing down, there was suddenly real fear that nothing was ever going to be the same again.

I think most people around here don't understand just how scary the 2008 crisis was, and just how close we came to total financial meltdown. In retrospect it's hard to appreciate how blissfully unaware just about anyone who's anyone was about the possibility of this occurring. Those who were around and paying attention at the time seem to have forgotten, but that's in part because of the emergency measures taken by central banks around the world which helped pump asset prices but still haven't restored the real economy to normality. 13 years later and monetary policy still hasn't been normalized. The scars are still being felt around the world. Inequality is on the rise in the US, directly resulting in the populism we saw from 2016-2020, and Spain, the country where I live, has become a shadow of what it what it was pre-housing boom. This is a big deal.

Of course, you wouldn't think it was a big deal if you're just a middle or upper class stock market investor. You're doing OK. The crowd marches onward, blissfully ignorant of the fact that the economy and markets are complex adaptive systems that have the potential for failure at any moment. Unprecedented liquidity and monetary policy do not help this situation, and even Bernanke spoke about weighing the ""costs and risks"" of these policies when they were first implemented 13 years ago.

Honestly, I don't know what's going to happen, but the mystique around Burry is that he was seemingly the only one who was sensible at a time when the rest of the world was marching blindly off a cliff. I think for a lot of people he's seen as the voice of reason against human greed, ignorance, and stupidity. Burry was always an outcast, and it took an outcast to say ""hey, what the mob is doing isn't right"". It took courage, and it took vision.

What's going to happen going forward, I don't know. But to those of us who feel the world is a little more complicated than most people want to let on, and that markets (and life) aren't always smooth sailing, Michael Burry represents an alternative voice.  It's a voice that's willing to call things as they are, even if it's not always comfortable to look at them that way.

As far as I'm concerned, it's not about raining on a parade, or preaching gloom and doom.  It's about seeking prosperity in a way that is sustainable and just, and moving forward in a way which takes into account the risks and does an adequate job of preparing for them.  True prosperity cannot be founded on lies and wishful thinking, and 2008 was the perfect illustration of that.",finance
personalfinance,"Student Loans are switching servicers, should I pay them off before the switch?","So my Student Loans are serviced through Fedloan, which has been a really good servicer to work with. They're easy to get a hold of, they apply excess payments to principle without me having to do anything else, just really no issues. However, I got a notification from them that my loans will be switched to a different servicer soon, no update on when. Two of the providers were listed as Nelnet and Naviant, both of which I heard were absolutely horrible. Not applying excess payments to principle  and no way to get a hold of them, ""losing"" payments, several lawsuits against them. 

I have the ability to pay off the rest of my loans completely but thanks to the 0% interest it's  been a gravy train to leave them alone and dump the excess in my index ETFs. However I'm worried that my loans will get switched to a crappy provider so I'm thinking just taking a some cash out of savings and killing them now before the switch so I don't have to deal with it.

stocks,(11/10) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, November 10th, 2021-

*****

# [Stock futures are lower ahead of key inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. equity futures nudged lower early Wednesday as investors await key data that will indicate how much rising price pressures are accelerating.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed about 60 points. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Investors are holding their breath for the latest consumer price index reading, which the Labor Department will report Wednesday before the bell. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.6% increase, or a year-over-year gain of 5.9%, which would be the most in 30 years. They expect core CPI, which excludes food and energy, to have risen 0.4%, or 4.3% year-over-year.
*****
&gt; With Thursday a government holiday due to the Veterans Day observance, the department also will release its weekly jobless claims count a day earlier than usual. The Dow Jones estimate is for 265,000 first-time filings for unemployment insurance, which would mark a fresh pandemic-era low.
*****
&gt; In regular trading Tuesday, the Dow lost about 0.3% to close at 36,319.98. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4%, snapping an eight-day win streak, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The sell-off in Tesla continued as the electric vehicle stock fell more than 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, a day after ending nearly 12% lower and more than 16% down on the week.
*****
&gt; “The weakness in Tesla (which is largely technical, not fundamental) is also weighing on the consumer discretionary sector within the S&amp;P 500 today, and the October PPI may also be doing so as business input prices continue to rise,” Goldman Sachs’ Jeff Currie said in a note Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “The prospect of Covid transforming from pandemic to endemic, and the potential for supply chain congestion to moderate are all likely to continue to drive growth, albeit more slowly,” Currie added.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday morning, the Labor Department reported a 0.6% increase in the October producer price index, which iwas in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate. Wholesale prices jumped 8.6% in October from a year ago, however, the hottest annual pace on record in almost 11 years.
*****
&gt; “Investor worries came to the fore again today,” Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, told CNBC. “The inflation narrative is still out there and needs to be resolved. We think investors will see inflation abate in the coming months as the Fed remains accommodative, people come back into the workforce and consumers shift from buying goods to services… and we expect that will pull the market higher as we move toward the end of the year.”
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues to be strong, with most of the S&amp;P 500 companies who have already reported earnings beating estimates, according to FactSet. Disney, Affirm, Bumble and The Honest Company are all scheduled to report Wednesday after the bell.

personalfinance,My bonus check did not have federal tax withheld.,"I have a part-time job in addition to my full-time job and I noticed this morning an unexpected deposit. 

Checking the payroll app it turns out to be a bonus check. However only social security and Medicare taxes were taken out. $41.42 out of $541.42. That appears to be the correct 7.65% taken out. 

My suspicion is that the company wants to make it seem like they are giving out a generous $500 bonuses to everyone so they chose to not have the federal tax withheld.

Bitcoin,Will there be one last opportunity to stack sats before the final run to the top? Why one last dip would be beneficial to the market.,"# Will there be one last opportunity to stack sats before the final run to the top?

Some of the most prolific influencers have been talking about a possible correction around mid-to-late November, just before the final run to the top.

**Guy, from Coin Bureau, stated in his latest videos / newsletters:**

&gt;I think we’re on the cusp of another correction, and not just because we’ve hit another market cap milestone.

He then expands about the macro factors that could drive this potential drop, like

the Federal Reserve recent confirmation that they will reduce their government bond purchases and how this could increase interest rates in response. As a result, this could mean less demand by consumers and less investment by companies.

Also, if the FED’s tapering manages to reduce inflation, the demand for Bitcoin among institutional investors could potentially drop. 

One final red flag mentioned by Guy is the FATF’s crypto “recommendations” and a potential global crackdown on cryptocurrency in the name of money laundering.

**Bob Loukas, who at this point enjoys a prestigious trader status for all the accurate predictions he’s made in the past**, shared this chart in his last youtube video published on the 15th of October (notice the dip around mid-November):

&amp;#x200B;

**TechDev\_52, a must-follow on Twitter (who also seems to always hit the hammer on the nail with his charts and analysis)**, published this interesting comparison chart:

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: TechDev\_52 Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/g372x05masy71.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdccdc778e8866d4a25c682de6b4befb88191f33)

He is comparing the 2017 bull run - which had a significant pullback around mid-November - to the current market situation, and also projects a dip around the same time frame.

# Why one last dip would be beneficial to the market

**From where I’m standing, this event would serve two purposes:**

1. The obvious opportunity to stack more sats, both for seasoned investors and newcomers. By now, the veterans are most likely comfortable with their holdings and may or may not capitalize in the event of a dip.   
For newcomers though, it’s a completely different story, as they love to ask their crypto savvy friends “is this a good time to buy?”. This retrace would provide the affirmative answer and one last opportunity to increase the inflow of new investors at a crucial phase, accelerating adoption and boosting the final market capitalization for this cycle.
2. This could also further extend the cycle well into the first quarter of 2022. Extending the cycle could also allow for more hype and proliferation, and thus achieve a higher top.

# TLDR

Everyone and their dog is super bullish on BTC. There are clear skies ahead for it to reach 100k+, but some experts believe we are due for a correction before we resume the run to the top of this cycle. 

**What are your thoughts on this?**

I’m expecting the retrace to happen at any moment now and personally keeping dry powder to **BUY THE DIP!**",cryptocurrency

investing,Inflation surges to its highest since 1990,"https://www.npr.org/2021/11/10/1054019175/inflation-surges-to-its-highest-since-1990

&gt;	The Labor Department reported Wednesday that consumer prices were 6.2% higher in October than a year ago. That's the sharpest increase since November of 1990.

&gt;	Price increases were widespread, with energy, shelter, food and vehicles all costing more. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices were up 4.6%

&gt;	Much of the upward pressure on prices is the result of a mismatch between booming demand and limited supply, as businesses struggle to find both parts and workers.

&gt;	Many employers have increased pay in order to attract more workers. But growing paychecks have quickly been eroded by the rising cost of gas and groceries.

&gt;	""For families, they're feeling it right now,"" says Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. ""If you got to a grocery store, you buy food that you usually buy, you then fill your gas tank on the way home so you can go to work or take your kids to school, you're feeling this.""

&gt;	""When you then look at the winter coming and you realize your fuel bill for heating your home is going to rise as the winter comes, you're nervous,"" she added.

Well, 2 years into her employment we find out she is pregnant and when she asks about maternity leave HR tells her they don’t offer any. 

I know….she should have read her employee/benefits manual and had a clear understanding of it earlier and assumed nothing. 

We have looked into FLMA and it looks like that will require her employer to hold her job during the times her doctor says she cannot work. She can use all her sick/vacation days to get paid, but won’t receive any other compensation from her employer.

stocks,NYSE Quirk Means New Year’s Will Not Be a Trading Holiday,"Bloomberg) -- It’s the Grinch That Stole New Year’s. 

Thanks to whoever created an obscure piece of New York Stock Exchange red tape -- officially known as Rule 7.2 -- U.S. equity markets won’t commemorate the start of 2022 with a holiday. 

The rule stipulates that when a holiday falls on a Saturday, the market will close on the preceding Friday -- unless, that is, “unusual business conditions exist, such as the ending of a monthly or yearly accounting period.” Since Dec. 31 marks the end of the month, quarter and year, that means a full session on New Year’s Eve and no day off on the following Monday. 

While the exchange published its holiday schedule a long time ago, complete with a “—*” footnote under the New Year’s Day 2022 column, some market participants are only now realizing they’re getting stiffed on the holiday. Adding salt to the wounds, bond traders get to start their New Year’s Eve parties a little earlier: Sifma is calling for a 2 p.m. market close that day. 

“People are going to lose their minds, honestly,” Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, said by phone. “I’m looking at that Monday and saying, what the what? Are you kidding me?”

There could be more at stake than just sour grapes. Scott Bauer, chief executive officer of Prosper Trading Academy, has a family ski vacation planned for the end of the year and said he will adjust his holdings ahead of time just in case. 

“What I will certainly do is position myself accordingly so that going into that long weekend, any positions that don’t expire December 31st, anything that I may have subsequent to that, I’ll make sure I don’t have any expiring options or futures positions that first week of January,” he said. “I’ll be attuned to the market, but I absolutely will not be putting on new positions.” 

It’s not the first time Wall Street has been deprived of a day off for the holiday. Rule 7.2 also reared its ugly head 11 years ago when New Year’s Day fell on a Saturday in 2011. And there’s actually good news on the holiday calendar this year: A new day off for Juneteenth National Independence Day has been added on Monday, June 20. 

Not to mention, many traders these days can get away with avoiding the office since the pandemic forced them to establish robust work-from-home setups. Volumes remained elevated in the days ahead of Thanksgiving last year as more traders, stuck at home due to the pandemic, remained logged on for clients. Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management, plans to fly from Chicago to Florida at year-end and bring his “office,” meaning his laptop, along. “I still plan on partying,” he said. “I’ll just have to start a little later.”

Still, it goes without saying that not everyone is thrilled about a missed day off, especially since it’s a federal holiday. An NYSE representative declined to comment. 

“A bunch of Grinches,” Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager and head of multi-asset solutions at Federated Hermes, said while looking at the calendar. Holiday or not, he added, many fund managers try not to be too active at the end of the year.

“You generally see liquidity tail off that last week of the year, really from Christmas on,” he said. 

It’s not just market liquidity that will be reduced this year. 

“Maybe I wait a little bit later in the day to start sipping champagne,” Chiavarone said. “I don’t really need to be drinking before 4 p.m.”

personalfinance,Is it true that you're not allowed to pay off an auto loan in less than 90 days?,"I bought a car in mid-September.

I was planning to pay off the loan in less than a month so I wouldn't be charged interest, but the financial person at the dealer told me I had to keep the loan open for at least 90 days, but I could pay it off on the 91st day. Otherwise, it wouldn't show up on my credit report, and I wouldn't get any benefit. 

There's no prepayment penalty. I asked about 5 times on that. I don't think it's precomputed interest because the amount of interest over the life of the loan is like 5.5k, and she said I wouldn't pay that amount if I paid it off early.

CryptoCurrency,People think Evergrande news are driving current correction yet they ignore inflation report.,"I am actually surprised that people blame CHina for current situation while BTC briefly flash crashed at the market open this morning upon news about record high inflation. Yes, market rebounded but it can not be ignored that FED now will have to react to it one way or another, otherwise inflation will rise even more. After pandemic started, society and economies changed profoundly and nothing is going back to ""old normal"", there is new paradigm. 

Gold is going rapidly up, it happened even before Evergrande published the document, some investors are hedging heavily. If FED keeps printing and increasing repo liquidity inflation will destroy dollar not in a deceade but years. 

My point is people take comfort in ""China FUD"" whereas there is much more at play. I am not saying Evergrande default is not main contibutor, but it may act as a trigger instead of main issue. Be safe and remember to take profits. Markets will rebound as always even if situation is dire but BTC rose from 30k to 69k without proper correction, people will sell for profits if markets sense JPOW is slowing down the printer.

EDIT: People here are saying that inflation should be a good news for BTC. Yes, in normal markets slightly increased inflation is great for Crypto as for stocks, for last 2 years it was proven that liquidity rapidly was flowing into those markets. Problem now is that FED has to react and they either have to remove some of the liquidity or increase rates which will cause markets to dunk. If FED keeps printing siregarding inflation rates then yes, it's great for BTC, but if they do they destroy dollar quickly, and it's not in their interest at all.",cryptocurrency

* The CAPE Schiller P/E 10 ratio for the S&amp;P is nearing all time highs (CAPE=39.29).  It hasn't been as great at predicting recessions as some other analysis methods, but, two key points that stand out on the historical chart did precede crashes.  We exceeded one of those levels and are approaching the other. The last time the Schiller ratio was near 40 was right before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000.  Prior to that, the last time it spiked to these levels it preceded the great depression (CAPE = 32) in 1929. The economist who developed this ratio was given the Nobel prize for using this ratio to predict the dot com bubble, so this measurement does carry some weight.

* Rumors are surfacing that Evergrande has defaulted on one of it's payments.  This is hearsay at this point, but it seems very suspicious that some banks and bond holders are not commenting on if they are receiving payment from Evergrande.  It also stands to reason, the company is fighting to keep their heads above water to make these payments but they are over $300b in debt.  In reality they are just kicking the can down the road.  It's a house of cards at this point and the bottom is being pulled out, it's only a matter of time.

* Treasury yield curves are flattening.  This is a potentially huge indicator of the uncertainty within the market.  It has reliably predicted the last 7 recessions up to and within 18 months of an inverted yield curve.  The curve is not currently inverted but is starting to flatten.

**TLDR**:

DeFi is still in its early stages and it is still risky. There are scams here and there. But we should not use a few black sheep to define the space as a ponzi scam. DeFi will develop further in the future with better testing. And it is clear that its potential will develop very quickly later.

DeFi is innovating fast. We should analyse and exploit the strengths. Scam projects will still emerge. Our continuous education and knowledge will help reduce that.

**Get smart:** DeFi is not exactly a Ponzi Scam, it is still evolving and will have limitations in it.

**Get smarter:** The growth potential of DeFi is huge, we see the traditional financial system, the governance system is very ineffective. Thing resources are under-utilised and expensive. DeFi is trying this problem and if it succeeds it will be revolutionary.

# General Conclusion

Some people claim that DeFi is a scam ponzi because there are a lot of pumps and dumps. Everything on Twitter is shilling all kinds of different projects. Now there are a lot of risks involved, and the projects are not fully audited. So a lot of people are wondering this is a ponzi scam of part of the innovation cycle.

In this article, we will tell why DeFi is more than just a ponzi scam.

We cover 3 things today:

1. Why DeFi feels like Ponzi
2. Why DeFi is not Ponzi
3. Future of DeFi.

When talking about DeFi here, we are referring to the general ecosystem and not a single project, because the ecosystem is doing quite well in general.

Sure, there are some systems around the world with plenty of scams. This includes traditional financial market. But you cannot discredit the entire system because of a few black sheep.

DeFi is a new system and industry. There will be a few scams coming out but you cannot define this for the entire ecosystem, which is doing a lot of good and interesting things.

# DeFi and Ponzi

If you google the keyword ""DeFi and Ponzi"", you can see a lot of articles saying that DeFi is like Ponzi, just another name called, DeFi is basically ICO 2.0 where people are pumping and dumping, whale manipulation, etc.

**What it feels like:** Everything is just memes and a joke. Is this even serious? Why do I have to join? How is this legal and how can people make money? Projects with 100% APY; where does the money come from and why is it valuable? People just swapping or trading tokens together, but it was in a circle, a pyramid scheme.

**What it actually is:** Liquidity Mining (Synthetix) and Yield Farming (Compound) are ways to bootstrap growth and to reward a decentralised community to take ownership of the protocol. High rewards for risk takers in the early days is rationally sound. And when payout for the risk takers happen all at once, it feels like the APY is insanely high.

# Why DeFi is not Ponzi

**1.   Grow the Pie**

Answer the above question briefly: this is not necessarily true. If you look at the distribution of the entire economic value as a pie, a ponzi scam is where you are extracting value every time someone is coming in. This means that the pie doesn't change much, you give your money to someone else to receive new tokens.

DeFi is like the pie, that keeps growing. There are many projects/protocols under construction, such as lending protocol, Dex protocol, portfolio asset management protocol, etc. They're in beta testing in this early stage and they do not try to capitalise on the entire financial market which is a big field.

Each DeFI tries to do well with a specific purpose, they are like small lego blocks, combined together to create various different products. This is composability, the protocols can interact with each other and make the pie grows. Just like in order to make a delicious pie, we have to add more kinds of fillings. This is why it is so interesting and exciting.

On the protocol side, the protocols with all these little ecosystems and applications whose own community can grow by interacting together.

With the platform which is pretty neutral because they are technology, the added value from connecting buyers and sellers. If we look at economics, this is supply and demand, and they only make sense when there is equilibrium and interacting together.

The protocols/applications are trying to build to the playing field, from which suppliers and buyers can come to interact with each other. The more interactions, the more economic value added is created and the pie keeps growing.

**2.   Experimenting with New Business Models**

According to the economics perspective, if you observe the previous business models, it is usually one-sided. Going back to the above example, if I make a cake, you go to a bakery and buy it, there is nothing more I can do like asking a few people to try a new or similar flavour. Supply and demand are still very dependent.

However, when we look back about 10 years ago, a new business model emerged called the platform. We have Amazon, AirBnb, Uber, etc. which provide the technology to connect the two sides of the ecosystem together to transact. This creates a lot of economic value.

Suppose I am an economist, the question is: how to quantify the economic value created? We can then calculate metrics like GDP, because it represents the growth of a platform.

With these values, you can calculate the value-added with all of these transaction fees. But there is a lot of intangible value being created in the ecosystem, which is connecting two sides of the platforms together for easier interaction. By reducing transaction costs, it increases economic value. This is what an economist observes and we are working on it. Specialities focus on the digital economy and how to compute them.

I realised that what we are doing with native tokens is considering how valuable they are to the ecosystem. Tokens can have a lot of utility and represent value. More specifically, these tokens are representing the value of some ecosystem.

That way, we are assigning a monetary policy value to the economies that the system is creating. And we can calculate metrics, like GDP. All of the above gets interesting.

**3.   New P2P Incentive Models**

We are developing new p2p incentive models. One thing about decentralised finance as a whole is the complete elimination of middlemen. Instead of centralised power in one person/place, they are distributed equally to everyone. Now, we have more money to be distributed, instead of sending them to intermediaries. In traditional finance, for example, a public initially listed on a stock exchange must go through banks and pay them an expensive fee, but these are eliminated in decentralised finance, where those companies can list their tokens on dexes, provide liquidity, and lots of other incentives.

This is very interesting. We are phasing out intermediaries that are stealing a lot of money. But the bad thing is we have a lot of money not distributed: how do we allocate them? How do we reward the right types of people?

I would say that these will keep moving forward because we realise that capitalism does not work so much anymore and is not going to be sustainable in the long-term. That makes us look forward to new paradigms of capitalism, like social capitalism kind of thing.

We need to have lots of new p2p incentive models and the best place to test is DeFi which has liquidity farming, yield farming, etc. For these interesting mining and incentive mechanisms, we are trying to try many different incentive mechanisms and create many interesting future mechanisms.

# Future of DeFi

There are two things that we see in DeFi's future:

1. **On-chain Financial Experiments and Mechanisms to be used in TradFi**  
The first thing we are seeing in DeFI right now is that you don't have many transactions in the real world. That goes back to my point of the whole GDP accountability because we are trading nominal value, not much real value transactions since you exit the crypto space and transfer the money to the bank.  
Right now, everything is still within the on-chain sphere. DeFi's future is to allow these experiments and experiences to interact within the off-chain world. Because the off-chain world is very ineffective (like the financial system, the governance system, etc.).  
What we are trying to do now is to run all these little experiments/tests. If it works in on-chain well, we can extend to the off-chain world, creating a bridge to connect the 2 worlds. This is really interesting.
2. **Economic Valuation from Ecosystems**  
Second, we can now more easily calculate the economic values generated from specific individual ecosystems, while also moving them off-chain world and account for them in a much more equitable way. It leads to governance which has better resources/data points to be accounting for all these different changes in the world.

# Conclude

Here is a quick summary of the Ponzi Scam and DeFi and I would say that not all DeFi platforms are Ponzi Scam. One of them could be a scam and you need to check it out carefully. For non-scam projects, they are fun experiences. We need to learn to understand how it works and explore what kind of experiments capital allocation and governance system that could be.

Honestly, I am going to tell you that there is so much economics literature out there, talking about the technical and the academic aspects of all these experiments, but we never really had a chance to explore them. There are a lot of interesting monetary policy mechanisms in academic papers, but we don't really use them. We have a lot of dynamic variables in DeFi space and we can test these experiences.

In fact, in the economics space, a lot of people are experimenting with many different theories on DeFi and if it works which will lead to a huge change and bring DeFi even more powerful. Their users also become part of DeFi's future development. An example of a testnet is the experiments of crypto and crypto itself is the experiments of the off-chain world.

Now there are a lot of risks involved, and the projects are not fully audited. So a lot of people are wondering this is a ponzi scam of part of the innovation cycle.

In this article, we will tell why DeFi is more than just a ponzi scam.

We cover 3 things today:

1. Why DeFi feels like Ponzi
2. Why DeFi is not Ponzi
3. Future of DeFi.

When talking about DeFi here, we are referring to the general ecosystem and not a single project, because the ecosystem is doing quite well in general.

Sure, there are some systems around the world with plenty of scams. This includes traditional financial market. But you cannot discredit the entire system because of a few black sheep.

DeFi is a new system and industry. There will be a few scams coming out but you cannot define this for the entire ecosystem, which is doing a lot of good and interesting things.

# DeFi and Ponzi

If you google the keyword ""DeFi and Ponzi"", you can see a lot of articles saying that DeFi is like Ponzi, just another name called, DeFi is basically ICO 2.0 where people are pumping and dumping, whale manipulation, etc.

**What it feels like:** Everything is just memes and a joke. Is this even serious? Why do I have to join? How is this legal and how can people make money? Projects with 100% APY; where does the money come from and why is it valuable? People just swapping or trading tokens together, but it was in a circle, a pyramid scheme.

**What it actually is:** Liquidity Mining (Synthetix) and Yield Farming (Compound) are ways to bootstrap growth and to reward a decentralised community to take ownership of the protocol. High rewards for risk takers in the early days is rationally sound. And when payout for the risk takers happen all at once, it feels like the APY is insanely high.

# Why DeFi is not Ponzi

**1.   Grow the Pie**

Answer the above question briefly: this is not necessarily true. If you look at the distribution of the entire economic value as a pie, a ponzi scam is where you are extracting value every time someone is coming in. This means that the pie doesn't change much, you give your money to someone else to receive new tokens.

DeFi is like the pie, that keeps growing. There are many projects/protocols under construction, such as lending protocol, Dex protocol, portfolio asset management protocol, etc. They're in beta testing in this early stage and they do not try to capitalise on the entire financial market which is a big field.

Each DeFI tries to do well with a specific purpose, they are like small lego blocks, combined together to create various different products. This is composability, the protocols can interact with each other and make the pie grows. Just like in order to make a delicious pie, we have to add more kinds of fillings. This is why it is so interesting and exciting.

On the protocol side, the protocols with all these little ecosystems and applications whose own community can grow by interacting together.

With the platform which is pretty neutral because they are technology, the added value from connecting buyers and sellers. If we look at economics, this is supply and demand, and they only make sense when there is equilibrium and interacting together.

The protocols/applications are trying to build to the playing field, from which suppliers and buyers can come to interact with each other. The more interactions, the more economic value added is created and the pie keeps growing.

**2.   Experimenting with New Business Models**

According to the economics perspective, if you observe the previous business models, it is usually one-sided. Going back to the above example, if I make a cake, you go to a bakery and buy it, there is nothing more I can do like asking a few people to try a new or similar flavour. Supply and demand are still very dependent.

However, when we look back about 10 years ago, a new business model emerged called the platform. We have Amazon, AirBnb, Uber, etc. which provide the technology to connect the two sides of the ecosystem together to transact. This creates a lot of economic value.

Suppose I am an economist, the question is: how to quantify the economic value created? We can then calculate metrics like GDP, because it represents the growth of a platform.

With these values, you can calculate the value-added with all of these transaction fees. But there is a lot of intangible value being created in the ecosystem, which is connecting two sides of the platforms together for easier interaction. By reducing transaction costs, it increases economic value. This is what an economist observes and we are working on it. Specialities focus on the digital economy and how to compute them.

I realised that what we are doing with native tokens is considering how valuable they are to the ecosystem. Tokens can have a lot of utility and represent value. More specifically, these tokens are representing the value of some ecosystem.

That way, we are assigning a monetary policy value to the economies that the system is creating. And we can calculate metrics, like GDP. All of the above gets interesting.

**3.   New P2P Incentive Models**

We are developing new p2p incentive models. One thing about decentralised finance as a whole is the complete elimination of middlemen. Instead of centralised power in one person/place, they are distributed equally to everyone. Now, we have more money to be distributed, instead of sending them to intermediaries. In traditional finance, for example, a public initially listed on a stock exchange must go through banks and pay them an expensive fee, but these are eliminated in decentralised finance, where those companies can list their tokens on dexes, provide liquidity, and lots of other incentives.

This is very interesting. We are phasing out intermediaries that are stealing a lot of money. But the bad thing is we have a lot of money not distributed: how do we allocate them? How do we reward the right types of people?

I would say that these will keep moving forward because we realise that capitalism does not work so much anymore and is not going to be sustainable in the long-term. That makes us look forward to new paradigms of capitalism, like social capitalism kind of thing.

We need to have lots of new p2p incentive models and the best place to test is DeFi which has liquidity farming, yield farming, etc. For these interesting mining and incentive mechanisms, we are trying to try many different incentive mechanisms and create many interesting future mechanisms.

# Future of DeFi

There are two things that we see in DeFi's future:

1. **On-chain Financial Experiments and Mechanisms to be used in TradFi**  
The first thing we are seeing in DeFI right now is that you don't have many transactions in the real world. That goes back to my point of the whole GDP accountability because we are trading nominal value, not much real value transactions since you exit the crypto space and transfer the money to the bank.  
Right now, everything is still within the on-chain sphere. DeFi's future is to allow these experiments and experiences to interact within the off-chain world. Because the off-chain world is very ineffective (like the financial system, the governance system, etc.).  
What we are trying to do now is to run all these little experiments/tests. If it works in on-chain well, we can extend to the off-chain world, creating a bridge to connect the 2 worlds. This is really interesting.
2. **Economic Valuation from Ecosystems**  
Second, we can now more easily calculate the economic values generated from specific individual ecosystems, while also moving them off-chain world and account for them in a much more equitable way. It leads to governance which has better resources/data points to be accounting for all these different changes in the world.

# Conclude

Here is a quick summary of the Ponzi Scam and DeFi and I would say that not all DeFi platforms are Ponzi Scam. One of them could be a scam and you need to check it out carefully. For non-scam projects, they are fun experiences. We need to learn to understand how it works and explore what kind of experiments capital allocation and governance system that could be.

Honestly, I am going to tell you that there is so much economics literature out there, talking about the technical and the academic aspects of all these experiments, but we never really had a chance to explore them. There are a lot of interesting monetary policy mechanisms in academic papers, but we don't really use them. We have a lot of dynamic variables in DeFi space and we can test these experiences.

In fact, in the economics space, a lot of people are experimenting with many different theories on DeFi and if it works which will lead to a huge change and bring DeFi even more powerful. Their users also become part of DeFi's future development. An example of a testnet is the experiments of crypto and crypto itself is the experiments of the off-chain world. This is super fascinating and now one of the best times to be.",cryptocurrency

A family member recently called and told me they had about 40k in a savings account that they’d like to grow. The bank is closing and I’m hoping to figure out a way to help them invest/deposit their money in a way that will make it grow more. 

Their interest rate was around 1% if that, incredibly low.

I’m a beginner investor and haven’t handled that much capital before, but my investments have given me ~20% in returns.

Now let us compare that to the USD: it has unlimited supply and can be printed more, whenever the FED wants to. This is the best anti-whale measure there is.

Bitcoin,Panic in the market sent people to take refuge in Bitcoin.,"Todays panic in the market and leap in BTC provides a glimpse at the psychology of where bitcoin is at in society. 

Inflation numbers were much higher than what was to be expected and the market began to sell off rapidly. At the same time bitcoin saw its price jump to all time highs, Signaling that people view Bitcoin as a source of refuge.  

The price jumping  was kind of a opposite reaction to what I think should have happened. Bitcoin is more a hedge against monetary devaluation than just inflation. Yes inflation will cheapen the dollar in due time, but it will probably cause the FED to tighten which will strengthen the dollar for a bit.  Still if we are in it for the Long term, the dollar is on shaky grounds and whatever policy the FED chooses to curve inflation will not be substantial enough to stop it. 

I think this is partially why bitcoin came back to earth towards the evening. That and futures contracts being liquidated on both sides. 

All of that said, the escape to bitcoin is a great signal that the population is  seeing bitcoin as a safe haven to the monetary policies of the current fiat systems, and will only legitimize the asset going into the future.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Evergrande meets interest payment deadline, avoids default","https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/business/evergrande-bond-deadline.html

China Evergrande, the troubled property giant, made interest payments on at least two of its bonds on Wednesday, a company bondholder said, a sign that it yet again managed to head off default.

Evergrande owed investors interest payments totaling nearly $150 million on three bonds, with the grace periods for those payments set to expire on Wednesday. Missing them would have triggered a default that could ripple through the Chinese economy: With some $300 billion in debt outstanding, the company’s inability to pay its debt would potentially hurt banks, property developers, and even home buyers in the country.

Instead, the company has managed to leap from one deadline to the next, meeting its obligations at the last minute — but often without explaining how or even publicly disclosing that it had done so. The company has tried to sell off parts of its empire to raise enough cash.

In October, when Evergrande said it had scrapped its effort to sell a $2.6 billion stake in its property services company to another developer, the company warned in a Hong Kong securities filing that there was “no guarantee” it would be able to meet its financial obligations or negotiate an extension with its creditors.

On Wednesday, the company met its interest payment deadline for bonds that mature in 2022 and 2023, the company bondholder said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.

The person did not specify if a payment on the third bond had also been made, but Bloomberg News reported that obligations for all three bonds were met, citing a spokesman for a clearing house.

The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Although Evergrande has managed to avoid default so far, its troubles have already begun to weigh on other Chinese developers, with the government tightening controls on borrowing and investors retreating from the sector.

At least six Chinese property developers have defaulted on foreign bonds in recent weeks, rattling domestic financial markets and raising the cost of borrowing for all Chinese companies. Property prices are slowing and fewer people are buying apartments, worsening the outlook for real estate.

Evergrande’s challenges could spread outside of China as well, as they ripple through global financial markets. On Monday, the Federal Reserve said troubles in China’s property sector could threaten the United States.

“Given the size of China’s economy and financial system as well as its extensive trade linkages with the rest of the world, financial stresses in China could strain global financial markets through a deterioration of risk sentiment, pose risks to global economic growth, and affect the United States,” the Fed said in its twice-yearly update on the American financial system.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednseday, Nov 10, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 10, 2021**

The dizzying rally in the stock market came to a screeching halt following the release of a key inflation report that showed a greater than expected jump in consumer prices despite new jobless claims coming in at a pandemic-era low. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.8% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.47% in its third consecutive red day while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.61% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed 1.58% lower.

This morning, the Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. 

The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. 

Though the Fed has commenced a tapering in the pace of quantitative easing, members of the Fed have so far maintained that supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances caused by the pandemic have prevented producers from keeping up with demand, particularly as we head into the busiest time of the year, the holiday season. I broadly agree with this narrative, even the Fed has conceded that inflation could last longer “than they currently assume”. The latest Fed meeting minutes said, “Most participants saw inflation risks as weighted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed.” We’ll have to see what happens in the coming months, if inflation doesn’t begin moderating in the next 5-6 months, the Fed will likely be forced to step in and raise interest rates in my opinion.

With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds.

personalfinance,Sell mutual funds versus get a Home Eq. Loan to pay for landscaping?,"Will be having about $75k of landscaping done approx. 6 months from now. Pondering the best way to pay for it. Separate from 401k and IRA retirement funds, we have about $130k worth of investments, mostly mutual funds.

The basic question is: do I sell enough of these investment holdings to pay the $75k plus the capital gains taxes (I've estimated this would be around $8k), or take out a $75k home equity loan? I guess a third option would be a combination of both, but this makes less sense if there is a clear favorite between the first two options.

Arguments in favor of taking the loan would be (i) interest rates are low, (ii) interest would be deductible, (iii) it leaves the investment money untouched to keep growing, and the historical annual ROI of our funds has been about 10%, which obviously exceeds current interest rates.

Still, I'm leaning toward using the investment money because:

* I don't like the idea of taking on more debt. Especially in the near-term, my partner's income is reduced because she cares for our toddler a few days a week, so our existing mortgage payment is currently a big chunk of our monthly income (close to half). 
* As my partner transitions back to working more over the next few years and we can afford to pay more per month, I like the idea of writing that check to myself in the form of recurring investments rather than writing that check to the bank every month, with interest. In other words, we fully intend to keep investing, and will eventually build back up these funds.
* Retirement goals are on track, max out contributions, etc. My point being, what is the purpose of non-retirement saving/investing if not to use the funds for exactly this type of project?
* We'll still have adequate emergency reserve funds even if we pay for the whole thing this way.

&amp;#x200B;

Other tidbits to consider:

* This is our forever home, period. I'm planning on dying here :)  So increases to the home's value don't really factor into the equation the way they would if we knew we'd sell someday.
* Our equity has shot way up in the past few years. Estimated home value is \~$1m, and our loan balance is about $400k.
* We refinanced in Sept. 2020 @ 2.5%. Probably should have considered a cash-out refi at the time, but didn't (shame on me).
* The landscaping is essential and cannot wait. Our backyard is wild to the point of safety hazards, and we need somewhere that our toddler can safely play.",finance

cardano,This is what makes Cardano different from others.,"Backstory: My Uncle is a farmer in India and his borrowing interest rate is somewhere between 16% to 24% because most villages do not have banks and private companies lend out money at stupidly high-interest rates.

Identity solution (Atala Prism), government deals (Ethiopia), Cheap Internet (World Mobile), borrowing and lending (MELD, Liqwid ...), Insurance, Hydra (high TPS), Mithril (better light wallets): These are the important things needed to onboard the masses from 3rd world countries.

This is what makes Cardano different from others. Ethereum and most other smart contract blockchain's approach to this is that: We are building an open system, and whoever wants to use or build on it can do so freely. This is not a bad idea because you get to focus on making better tech, but since this is a relativity new technology, the ones who are progressive about working with governments will have a better chance of succeeding. This is where the decentralization of the blockchain will matter because no country will want to run their system on a blockchain where a few people own the majority of tokens. 

The farmer is not thinking about the PAB release this month, so he can trade some shitcoins on sundae swap. He wants a reliable infrastructure so that he doesn't get grinded by debt from high interest.

The only other blockchain (that I know of) trying to build this infrastructure is Algorand in El Salvador.

investing,"The evidence is in on negative interest rate policies, and it has largely worked according to an IMF paper","https://blogs.imf.org/2021/03/03/the-evidence-is-in-on-negative-interest-rate-policies/

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115

Interest rates are low, and “lower for longer” has become something of a mantra among policy makers, regulators, and other market watchers. But negative interest rates raise an entirely new set of questions.

After eight years of experience with negative interest rate policies, the initial skepticism (paying interest to borrowers rather than savers was certainly unprecedented) has proven largely misplaced. The evidence so far suggests that negative interest policies have worked.

The evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns.

Since 2012, a number of central banks introduced negative interest rate policies. Central banks in Denmark, euro area, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland turned to such policies in response to persistently below-target inflation rates (most central banks set rates as part of their broader mandate to keep prices stable, thereby supporting jobs and economic growth). These banks were also responding to a very low “neutral real interest rate”—that is, the real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary. The move reflected the central banks’ struggle to boost inflation even when they had already pushed interest rates to zero.

The effects of the COVID-19 crisis, in an environment where many central banks are constrained, have brought back negative interest rate policies to the forefront.

Overall, these policies have eased financial conditions, and, in the process, likely supported growth and inflation. However, negative rate policies remain politically controversial, partly because they are often misunderstood.

Unfamiliar territory

At the time of introduction, many questioned whether negative interest rate policies would work as intended.

There were concerns about risks, given the untested, and in many ways counterintuitive, nature of the move. Would banks, households, and firms shift massively to cash in response to the new policies, thereby weakening the link between central bank rates and other interest rates? Would banks resist cutting lending rates, or even reduce lending to prevent profits from falling? Would negative interest rate policies provide a meaningful monetary stimulus?

Concerns about potential side effects of these novel policies also arose. Chief among the concerns were financial stability risks stemming from lowered bank profitability, and fear of disruptions in the functioning of financial markets and money market funds.

Based on the evidence to date, these fears have largely failed to materialize. Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies. For example, some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy. They also led to lower money-market rates, long-term yields, and bank rates.

Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits—because it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash. Bank lending volumes have generally increased. And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash, interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens.

So far, so good

Any adverse effects on bank profits and financial stability have so far been limited.

Overall, bank profits have not deteriorated, although banks that rely more on deposit funding—as well as smaller and more specialized banks—have suffered more. Larger banks have increased lending, introduced fees on deposit accounts, and benefited from capital gains. Of course, it is possible that the absence of a significant impact on bank profitability mostly reflects shorter-term effects, which could potentially be reversed over time. And side effects may still arise if policy rates go even more negative.

Money market funds in countries that have adopted negative interest rate policies have not collapsed. And, even if the existing “low-for-long” environment does create significant financial stability concerns (as it induces a search for yield or excessive risk taking by financial institutions), negative interest rate policies per se do not appear to have compounded the problem. For example, the increase in bank risk-taking does not appear to have been excessive.

Given this evidence, why haven’t more central banks jumped on board? The reasons are likely related to institutional and other country characteristics. Institutional and legal constraints may play a role, and some financial systems—because of their structure or interconnection with global financial markets—may be more prone to suffer adverse side effects from negative interest rate policies. For example, countries with many small banks that rely more on household deposits as a main source of funding may be more reluctant to adopt negative interest rates.

Even the adopting central banks have moved tentatively, typically with small interest rate cuts because of the risk that negative side effects become more apparent if the negative rate policy lasts for very long, or if rates go very negative.

In sum, the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns. Thus, central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further. And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit—even if they may be unlikely to use it.

Ultimately, given the low level of the neutral real interest rate, many central banks may be forced to consider negative interest rate policies sooner or later.",finance
datascience,Is it normal in this field to work a lot of overtime?,"Hello! Sorry for the silly question and formatting. I am on mobile. I received my first job as a research analyst at a community college from leaving a PhD program focusing on behavioral neuroscience with a focus on substance abuse. So my past work experience has been various weird jobs to keep afloat but I don't necessarily have a ton of professional experience.
 My current job creates federal mandated reporting and uses relational databases to do it but we are now focusing on creating more data science models. We also address several ad hoc reports. I have never had a regular 8 to 5 pm experience here and wanted to know if it's normal in the field. I apologize if this isn't allowed and would appreciate some insight.

personalfinance,Taxes not adding up on bonus?,"Hi Everyone, recently got a bonus at my company and $1000 of it was taken out for deductions which seems extremely unreasonable? Perhaps I’m missing something. I’m in AZ, 3.6% state tax. Filing single. 

Bonus amount pre deduction: $2,742.51

State tax: $95.77


F.I.C.A.: $170.04


F.M.H.I.: $39.77


Federal withholding: $585.25

and, for some reason a 401k deduction (not complaining): $82.28

This leaves me with $1,769.40 coming to my bank. Am I just now discovering how bad taxes screw me over, or is there something I’m missing?

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Largest Gap Between Interest Rates and Inflation Rate in Modern Era,"Given the 6.2% YoY CPI reading that came out today I looked at the relationship between the Fed Funds Rate and CPI. This is the largest gap between interest rates and the inflation rate in the modern era. Basically saying, savings accounts will lose you more purchasing power than ever given the low interest rates and high inflation. I think this is why people are feeling unsettled, there has never been a time where it has been harder to safely protect your capital. I think investing in index funds is the right approach, but still noteworthy!

CryptoCurrency,Until crypto becomes easier to use it'll never reach mass adoption,"I think of myself as fairly knowledgeable about tech but after getting into crypto February of this year I've realized just how hard using crypto can be. While I like the idea of decentralization I don't believe that it will ever be mass adopted in it's current form as it's just way to unfriendly to use. 

Sure some of it's really simple. I can create a coinbase pro account and buy crypto off of it and I can even send it to my Ledger with ease. What though happens when something goes wrong? 

I currently can't vote on Algo governance because even though the offical Algo wallet connects via bluetooth to my Ledger wallet it says it's not connected when I try to sign transactions. I've reached out to Ledger and they are requiring video of me going through their online troubleshooting guide before they'll even talk to me and I just never heard back from the Algo wallet support. I also had issues with the Polygon network where I tried to move some Matic token from the ETH mainnet to the MATIC mainnet. Thought it was simple, logged in using the Polygon Bridge and paid the gas I needed to process the transaction and I figured I was done. Unfortunately for me nothing actually happened and my MATIC token are still sitting on the ETH mainnet. Reached out to Polygon support and they never even looked at my emails based on the replies I got. Spent a few weeks going back and forth with them only to give up. The best part was that the quickest reply I ever got from them was when they closed my ticket when I told them I was just giving up!

Now maybe I'm just an idiot and what I need/needed to do is obvious to someone reading this. When I think about mass adoption though I realize out of my group of friends if I'm having these issues most of them would have more and they'll never adopt crypto if they can't even get support to talk to them without first taking a video of them sitting at a computer running through the troubleshooting guide. 

Sorry for the rant but after spending a few hours tonight trying to vote in Algo governance I just realized how fed up I was with feeling like and idiot because things that I think should be simple just aren't.",cryptocurrency

After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

CryptoCurrency,Brazilian federal deputy proposes a bill to start paying workers with crypto,"This are aswesome news! Federal Deputy Luizão Goulart, a Brazilian congressman, proposed a bill to legalize crypto payments as a mode of payment for public and private sector workers.

Goulart’s proposal seeks a new law that allows all Brazilian workers to have an option to request employers for remuneration in cryptocurrencies. However, the bill warrants crypto payments to be made only after selling a mutual agreement between the workers and the employer. According to the translated version of the bill:

“The limits of the percentage of payment (remuneration) in cryptocurrencies will be of the worker’s free choice. Any imposition by the employer will be prohibited.”

The bill highlights the evolution of finance — from a barter system and fiat currencies to Bitcoin — focusing on the decentralization aspect which removes the reliance on “a single person or a central entity.”",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Landry's restaurant chain to reward members with bitcoin,"So I read this article from CNBC that Landry's owner, that also owns an NBA team that accepts Bitcoin as payment on their online store, is a big believer in crypto.

Now Landry's is a huge chain containing casinos, resorts and restaurants like rainforest cafe and bubba gumps shrimp company.

The article says that ""in order to introduce people to Bitcoin we will reward them with loyalty point using Bitcoin"". They said that too few people are used to the price fluctuations of crypto and giving them their point in Bitcoin will be a great way to expose people to cryptocurrency volatility.

Now to me this sounds a bit forced. What if people don't care about Bitcoin?? The thing is . I worked in a Bubba Gumps Shrimp Company and the customers were not the most investment savy people I ever saw.

To be honest very few people had membership cards, and the ones that had, looked better, financially speaking.
But what if they don't care about Bitcoin, which is my guess in most cases?? People that came to that restaurant just wanted their 10% Cashback in points and that's it 

Now don't get me wrong maybe it's just gonna be another option to let people choose on their website but still doing this in a pandemic while most companies are short staffed is gonna be hard specially because they want to do it before Thanksgiving.

Don't get me wrong I love reading about this, because things like this really bring Bitcoin to the mainstream since eating out is something the public really loves doing.",cryptocurrency
stocks,Why does higher interest rates reduce inflation?,"I just read that as interest rates are raised people tend to save more.  What dies that mean?

Do people put money into savings accounts making a whopping .05%? Or do they buy treasuries or something?

So this is supposed to make people have less money to spend and consequently inflation cools?

It said that due to people saving more (with an increase in interest rates) that people would then spend less driving down inflation ultimately.",finance

NFT,Upcoming NFT Coalition Crew twitter: @CCrewNFT,"This is the NFT for Game Changers. The Coalition Crew is an exclusive collection of 7100 unique Cheetah NFTs living on the Ethereum blockchain.

It’s estimated that as of 2021, there are only 7100 cheetahs left in the wild.

Cheetahs are currently listed as vulnerable and we want to help change that. That’s why for every NFT that is purchased, we will “adopt” a cheetah in your honor. This includes a photo, an adoption certificate, a stuffed animal, species card + more! (Will be sent to you after holding token for a minimum of 3 months!)

So why is this the NFT for Game Changers? Well because not only are you literally helping a species from becoming endangered you are also going to be helping yourself. That’s where the Game Changers Academy comes in. We have been featured and promoted in Forbes, Entrepreneur, Success Magazine and more! The GCA was designed to help entrepreneurs —at different stages of business— get access to an exclusive network and various tools to level-up as fast as possible. Learn more about it at [gamechangersmovement.com](http://gamechangersmovement.com/)

On top of getting access to the GCA, your token also doubles as your ticket to any live, in- person event. The costs for these usually run anywhere from 1-24k. (If you happen to hold a rare cheetah, this will get you VIP access)

This is just the beginning. You see we want to over-deliver for our token holders. We also have airdrops, merch + more in the works. We take feedback very seriously so we will constantly be making adjustments to make this a top notch experience for you.

stocks,"I’m a importer, in my point of view, the true cost of inflation isn’t there’s too much money, it’s because—","It’s because the logistic is a nightmare right now. 

I import things from China. There are thousands of companies like mine. We are the one that sells shit to ur the distributors, the distributors sells to stores. We are also the one directly sells on Amazon and other e-commerce website. 

Pre COVID, a 40ft high cube costs me only $4000 from China to Long Beach. Currently it costs me god damn $20000, and that doesn’t include land transport. If I want to sent a container of goods to Ohio, the total cost on shipping alone is like $40000, excluding import duties. Back in the day shipping make up abt 30% of my cost, it makes up 60-70% now. Pre COVID a container of nice double layer fleece lining hoodies cost me 60k includes shipping. It costs me 100k this year. 

There are 110 some container ships stuck outside of Long Beach. You probably have no idea how many that is..ima use the nice fleece lining hoodies as example again. Each 40ft high cube carry’s 6000 this hoodie (so 20ft carry abt 3000). Each ship carry 20000 TEU (20ft equivalent units). there are also some 2 million TEU still in the port waiting to be hauled.. 

Let’s do the math

3000*20000=60 million hoodies 
110*20000=2.2million containers on ship stuck outside still. 
2.2million+2million=4.2 millions on containers total. 
4200000*60000000=252000000000000

US population is 333000000 
That’s 756 thousand hoodies for each person just stuck there waiting to be distributed! 

Let’s say my number is off by 50%, it’s still 378 thousands hoodies just stuck there! 

We can’t unload at Houston or New York cuz it will cost us even more… 

The problem Is not the demand, it’s supply. 

It’s not that there are too many monies were printed, who cares if we print more money, we can print unlimited useless pieces of paper and buy real goods from China ( export our Inflation)!

So, if u see on the news that the supply chain has been fixed, or the port of Long Beach has been cleared, or you know inflation is about to stapled.. until that , whatever the fed say is bs.

Side note Biden should declare national emergency and have nat guard come in and help haul these stucked goods.


Edit-----
Guys, sorry I did this math before I went to sleep on my phone.

My math is wrong.

It should be

3000*(110*20000+2000000)

=3000*4200000

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin price rise to continue into 2022 as inflation fears grow?,"The Bitcoin price is likely to continue its skywards trajectory until at least the second quarter of 2022 amid continuing global inflation fears, predicts the boss of Nuggets.

The prediction from Nuggy comes as the world’s dominant cryptocurrency hit another all-time high at $69,000 on Wednesday.

It followed data revealing that inflation has surged to a 31-year high in the U.S., raising the prospect the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sooner rather than later.

Mr C Nug says: “Prices paid by U.S. consumers jumped the most since 1990 last month, climbing a staggering 6.2% from a year earlier. 

“This latest data out of the U.S. will only compound global fears about inflation as price pressures run hot around the world.

“Inflation in the UK could rise above 5% by early next year, Euro area annual inflation is 4.1% in October 2021, up from 3.4 % the month before, and the cost of goods leaving Chinese factories surged by another record rate last month – 13.5% - and there are increasing signals that consumers are now feeling the pain.”

He continues: “It’s a global issue as businesses have been raising prices as supply chain bottlenecks and a shortage of qualified workers push up costs.  

“And it’s one that is likely to last until at least the beginning of the second quarter of 2022, when pressures should start to ease.

“Against this backdrop, and amid some peaks and troughs along the way as markets never move in a straight line with traders taking profit, we can expect to see the price of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies continue their skywards trajectory.

“Bitcoin is widely regarded as a shield against inflation mainly because of its limited supply, which is not influenced by its price.”

This ‘inflation shield’, says Chicky, will bring to the crypto market growing investment from major institutional investors, bringing with them capital, expertise and reputational pull – and further driving up prices.

Earlier this week, as he accurately predicted that Bitcoin would hit fresh all-time highs, Mr Chicky said that other cryptos can also be expected to move to the upside.

“Bitcoin’s gravitational pull on other digital assets will show itself again this week, pulling up other major cryptocurrencies as it maintains its own strength.

“We can expect those cryptos involved with fintech development, such as Ether, Solana and Cardano, to do particularly well.”

He concludes: “In this inflationary period, Bitcoin has outperformed gold, which has been almost universally hailed as the ultimate inflation hedge - until now.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Calculating exponential growth,"In the light of the recent inflation rate news from the US, I'd like to share a bit of a trick that should be more common knowledge but in my experience isn't:

&amp;#x200B;

Given a certain percentage increase, divide it into the number 70 to get the number of periods required to double.  this is called the rule of 70.

&amp;#x200B;

E.g. given an annual inflation rate of 6.5%:  70 divided by 6.5 = 10.7 years.  This is the time it will take the goods and services you buy to double in price.    10.7 years until your savings will buy half what they buy now (assuming the inflation rate is accurate and constant).

&amp;#x200B;

and you can of course go the other way - my avocado toast has doubled in cost in the last 5 years!  That's (70/5=14) 14% inflation year on year!   

&amp;#x200B;

it's a neat mental trick.   just remember the number 70.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what people in my experience don't understand because they cannot translate an inflation rate or interest rate into a time period in their head.   This method makes it easy.  If inflation is 6% and I'm getting 1% from the bank on my savings account, then 70/5=14years.   14 years until my money is worth half.   

&amp;#x200B;

On certain exchanges, current staking rewards for DOT for example are 11%ish - so you will double your coins in a bit over 6 years.   USDT is at 9% for example - so 8 years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some more detail:  So Why 70?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

starting with bank interest:  

If I have $1 and I get 100% annual interest, paid out at the end of the year, I will have $1+($1x100%) = $2

If the interest is calculated and paid out twice per year at 50%, then each calculation includes the interest already paid:  

&amp;#x200B;

at 6 months with the pro-rata interest calculation being 50% the calculation is:  $1 + (1x50%) = 1.5, then at 12 months, the calculation is: $1.5 + (1.5x0.5)= $2.25

&amp;#x200B;

if you do this 4 times per year, the pro-rata interest calculation is 25%, and the results are, $1, $1.25, $1.56, $1.95, $2.44

&amp;#x200B;

The more times per period that the interest is calculated and paid out, the larger the number at the end gets.   

&amp;#x200B;

so:  compound the interest once per year, you get $2, compound twice per year, you get $2.25, 4 times, you get 2.44.   These are increasing, but with diminishing returns.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually this number coalesces to approximately 2.71.   This is the mathematical constant e.  sometimes called Euler's number, or the exponential number.

&amp;#x200B;

a Logarithm with a base of e is called a natural logarithm and written as ""ln""

&amp;#x200B;

70, is just the natural log of 2:   ln(2) = 69.31    you can round this up to 70.   if you want to calculate the time to triple, use ln(3) = 100(ish).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this post can provide some value to some people.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Home REFI vs No Debt,"I'm 49 Y/O and have less than 5 years to pay on my house, less than 95k remaining.  We bought the house in 2001 and did a 30 year mortgage, then refi (no cash out) in 2009, and house is worth about 650 now.  With interest rates at all time lows, and markets on a bull run, what's the thought on taking the 550k out of the house and putting it in the market.  If I had done it a year ago, I would've paid for the 15yr mortgage in the first year (had a 40% return over the trailing 12months).   My financial advisor says that it's a smart move, since i'm not even able to deduct the interest anymore, it's not enough to meet the minimum to itemize deductions.

But on the flip side there's dave ramsay and the no debt crew yammering about debt, but can't debt be an asset rather than only being a liability.  Every company that ever existed had debt to get started.. debt can help you grow.  For ref i have about 1.4MM invested, 401k, ira, personal accounts, etc.. so if i could cash out the house equity, i could be at almost 2MM  -

For ref.. the wife is completely against this - she doesn't want to have a house note, but if I'm making even 8% on AVG over 15 years on that money, we would be far ahead of the curve? right?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Facebook's idea of the perfect Metaverse is the newest way to Centralize everything,"I'm seriously confused how no one has brought this up. I obviously haven't seen everything posted here but what I have seen is people shilling Facebook's idea for the Metaverse without really thinking about what it would mean.

&amp;#x200B;

Their perfect idea, or the perfect example of a user would be someone who works, earns, gets educated, does their social activity and games all on the Metaverse. AKA you'd only ever leave to sleep, toilet and eat (which you'd have the food delivered to your door). This would all be run and governed by Facebook.

&amp;#x200B;

This literally could not be more centralized if they tried, and from what I've seen everyone couldn't be more excited?? 

&amp;#x200B;

Facebook would run everything (centralized). If you earned in the Metaverse, you'd have to be paid in a Crypto they choose to accept, and through a Meta Bank they setup/choose. Which puts you back under Government rule of your money. They could ban you for life because reasons then you're stuffed end of.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just the new way to govern and control people.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures inched higher in early morning trading on Thursday following a tech-driven sell-off on Wall Street.

&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose about 40 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Disney shares fell more than 5% in premarket trading after the media giant missed on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results. Disney+ subscribers also came in short of estimates.
*****
&gt; The major averages dipped on Wednesday after a hot inflation report pushed up bond yields. The rise in yields especially pressured growth pockets of the market.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 240 points. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.7% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
&gt; The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 dropped 1.6% on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Fresh economic data released Wednesday showed persistent inflation. The consumer price index, which tracks a basket of products ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents, rose 6.2% in October from a year ago, hitting its highest level in three decades. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.9% against the 0.6% estimate.
*****
&gt; “Inflation remains stubbornly high, to the surprise of many that expected prices to come back to earth sooner,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “The truth is you can’t shut down a $20 trillion economy and not feel some bumps as it restarts, but we are hopeful the supply chain issues will resolve over the coming quarters and inflation should calm down as well.”
*****
&gt; Following the CPI data, traders moved up their expectations for when the first Fed rate hike would occur. The Fed funds futures market now sees greater odds of the central bank’s first full rate hike coming in July 2022.

I have about $600 that was recently sent to me over Zelle. The problem is, I signed up for Zelle several years ago, never ended up using it, and eventually deleted it off my phone. Yesterday, upon learning I was sent money over Zelle (and not venmo/payal which I normally use) I download Zelle, attempt to log in with my mobile number and get a ""C201"" error message. I call customer support and here is where the nightmare begins.

Zelle customer support tells me the only way to gain access to my account is if I provide them with the last 4 digits and/or CV code off the card I used when initially signing up for Zelle. Since it was several years ago and i've changed banks several times, I have no idea what bank I signed up with Zelle with. I tried asking if it was one of the various 5+ different banks i've used in the last few years and they said ""no"" each time. They claim this is the only way to gain access to my account. They said there is no other way to retrieve account information or access to my account.

When I initially signed up for Zelle a few years ago, I used the stand-alone app (not mobile banking through my banks), I also don't believe I ever even sent or received money so there is no transaction history. Bank of America checked back 7 years and said I have not had an account beyond my recent unemployment account. USAA has no history beyond yesterday (when I started this process) of being linked with Zelle. My regular bank Tower Federal Credit Union is not partnered with Zelle, so I don't even think that is an option for what I could have signed up with. I'm completely lost and Zelle is being less than helpful.

How do you gain access to a Zelle account that was linked to a bank account/card that is closed and you don't even know what bank you signed up with Zelle with?

I'm just going in circles, Zelle is telling me to call my banks, banks are telling me they don't have history of being linked with Zelle and to call Zelle.",finance

stocks,Battery Materials Pick Alert - $TSLA in talks with Quebec government for Li-ion battery facility,"Quebec Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon confirmed in an email Monday that he met with Tesla Inc. executives in October to discuss harnessing the province’s capacity to support the vehicle maker’s battery needs. 

Quebec is known for being rich in resources, including lithium and nickel – key components in electric vehicle batteries. Another attraction for companies is its abundance of cheap electricity. 

Fitzgibbon declined to provide further details about his meeting with Tesla, which was earlier reported by Electrek.

It’s not the first time Quebec has looked to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. 

The province announced in March that it would split a $100-million investment with the federal government for The Lion Electric Co. to build a highly automated battery-pack assembly plant just north of Montreal.

[Here is a Pick by Ahead of the Herd - Lomiko Metals TSXV: $LMR OTC: $LMRMF](https://aheadoftheherd.com/global-energy-crisis-highlights-a-growing-need-for-ev-battery-minerals-like-lithium-graphite/)

&amp;#x200B;

While there’s no shortage of miners in North America aiming to serve the EV battery market, a company like Lomiko Metals that offers investors exposure to both lithium and graphite is hard to find.

The La Loutre property looks especially promising so far, with a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on the project showing potential to become the next large-scale graphite mine in Canada.

According to the study, the open-pit project will produce 1.4 million tonnes of graphite spanning 15 years, for average annual production of 97,400 tonnes. For the first 5-6 years, the target is to reach 105,000 tonnes per year, focusing mainly on the North American and European markets.

La Loutre’s net present value (NPV) was estimated to be C$186 million with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 21.5% — using an 8% discount rate and $916/tonne Cg (graphitic carbon) sale price.

But it is the low-cost nature of the project, at attractive cash costs of $386/tonne Cg and all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $406/tonne Cg, that makes it extra appealing. Both of these cost figures are already at the lower end of the industry spectrum, and combined with a capex of C$236.1 million, La Loutre is setting up to be a ***highly profitable graphite mine within one of the most prolific producing regions in Canada.***

This notion was seconded in a recent report by Far East Capital Ltd., which specializes in the junior end of the resource market. ***In its weekly commentary, the Australian investment bank said it believes Lomiko is “very cheap” at current prices, citing the company’s C$22.5 million market cap compared with a direct comparable like Nouveau Monde Graphite (C$386 million).***

It also noted that many graphite projects in other parts of the world (Mozambique, Tanzania) have yet to deliver due to various issues, so upcoming mine projects like La Loutre stand to benefit from a surge in demand from EVs and alternative energy storage.

Not to mention, graphite projects in Canada tend to boast greater production and better economics, which is a considerable advantage over those in Africa.

The next step for Lomiko is to follow up the positive PEA results with a Prefeasibility Study (PFS) and then the final Feasibility Study (FS), by which time we’ll have a better picture of the graphite market and how La Loutre would fit into the equation.

The company will also look to continue its exploration efforts on the Bourier lithium project. The new discoveries from targets generated by GoldSpot are an indication that Lomiko may have brought another exciting EV battery play into the fold.",finance
personalfinance,Any way to get tax benefit/savings for health costs? Not eligible for HSA or FSA,"Hello!

I'm trying to figure out if there is a way for me to get a pre tax benefit for health costs.

My facts:

\-*Self-employed* sole proprietor on a NYS marketplace plan (health + dental), HMO. This plan is a *low deductible/low OOP* one so I believe I am not eligible for a HSA. I cannot move to a higher deductible plan. I have ongoing health issues and use my insurance a lot. Moving to a worse plan could bankrupt me.

\-And since I'm self employed, I cannot get a FSA from an employer.

\-I file a Schedule C and take a standard deduction on my taxes as the itemization is never more than the standard. I *do* deduct my premiums.

\-Location NYC, NY.

\-Single, no dependents.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to get braces which are not covered under my dental insurance. This will cost anywhere between $3k-$8k. I'd love to have a way to put this money somewhere and get a tax benefit.

I've thought about an I-bond since this is something that can wait the required year and I can gain interest on the money (I know the interest is taxable).

I currently have a HYS with Amex but the interest rate is lower (1.5-2% or something).

I have an IRA but it's my understanding that I can't draw from that w/out penalty nor do I want to.

Is there something else I should consider? What is the best bang for my buck? Bonus if there is an option where I can save for health care costs I can draw from anytime so I can also use it for other care that is not this specific braces scenario.

Thank you!",finance
stocks,Margin Interest Rate Very High on stock,"I have a 170 share position in AARQ, but my question is about Margin Interest Rates, in particular very high rates. I have been noticing the Margin Interest Rate has been climbing steadily higher, daily, for more than a month. It is very volatile it seems also. The interest rate I started paying attention was 18% not that long ago, but it kept jumping what appeared to be daily, and is at 150% for the past couple of days. I don't know a lot, but this would make it harder to buy and short using margin, right? My question is, what effects could this have on a stock? I have never seen such a high number, and hope to learn something in general from the comments.

Edit: I should clarify that I use Fidelity, and I came up with the idea to check Margin Interest Rates before buying a stock. I just had a thought though. In order to check this rate, I click on Short Stock, then just hover over the shares available to borrow, to see how many are left. It usually says Hard to Borrow, Call Fidelity. I also just realized that this information is available in a simple quote, without my extra steps. 😅 So I guess what I have been looking at is short borrowing interest margin rate, and not the buy side margin interest rate. Maybe Fidelity want's to make it very hard to short, right?",finance
stocks,"A ‘Made in America’ tax credit — what car buyers considering a Tesla, Rivian or other EVs need to know about Build Back Better","Car buyers in the market for an electric or hybrid vehicle have a special reason to follow the last-minute wrangling over the Build Back Better bill: it could expand electric-vehicle tax credits to up to $12,500 and make it easier for more people to qualify for those credits. Already, a handful of EV-supportive programs were cleared in the recently passed $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. They aim to add more charging stations to a road system that needs many more hookups if the nation is to convert to a greater share of green vehicles and hit net-zero emissions by 2050. Both political parties have said greatly expanding the network and speeding up charge times will be key to more EV buying, and that will require private and public investment.

For individuals mulling their first EV or trading up in this growing market, it’s the still-pending budget reconciliation bill, which Democrats have called Build Back Better, that packs the most incentives.

**How much savings is on the line for electric-vehicle owners?**

The Build Back Better proposal calls for expanding tax credits per electric vehicle or gas/electric hybrid of up to $12,500, if certain conditions are met. The base amount of the newly proposed tax credit for qualified filers remains $4,000, as it is today, with another $3,500 available if the EV’s battery pack includes at least 40 kilowatt-hours of capacity. In the case of plug-in hybrids, the gas tank cannot exceed 2.5 gallons. The bill also calls for resetting the clock for makers Tesla TSLA, 0.11% and GM’s Chevrolet GM, 2.77%, which had tapped out the incentives allowed under earlier legislation, Nadel said. Current law for the credits phases them out after a particular automaker sells over 200,000 qualifying vehicles. Other observers said non-U.S. production for some or all of the parts that go into EVs will rule out some of the major makers extending the full credit to their customers, considering they can’t quickly return production to the U.S.

As proposed, EVs qualify for another $4,500 in the tax credit if an automaker makes the vehicle in the U.S. with a union workforce. Another $500 comes into play for automakers using a U.S.-made battery, for a maximum of $12,500 available to qualifying filers. Today, the only vehicles that would qualify for anywhere near the full proposed credit is GM’s Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV, auto site Road Show said.

The Tesla 3, earlier this year, was voted most “American-made” by [Cars.com](https://Cars.com), using a list of qualifications. Rivian RIVN, 19.13%  is based in Irvine, Calif., with its manufacturing plant in Normal, Ill. The Ford Mustang Mach-E, for instance, is assembled in Mexico. Critics said these restrictions on imports limit the EVs that consumers can buy and still enjoy the break. “It discriminates against American workers, undermines global climate change goals and threatens our relationships with our trading partners. Tax incentives should be fair and equal for all EVs,” said Jennifer Safavian, president and CEO of trade group Autos Drive America. 

In other changes made in later iterations of the proposed bill, Democrats increased the price cap for qualifying EVs. The new language allows for vans, trucks and SUVs with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of up to $80,000 to qualify for the $12,500 credit. Previously, the initial framework set a limit of $64,000 for vans, $69,000 for SUVs and $74,000 for pickup trucks. 

The Democrats also reduced income eligibility to claim full credit. Single filers with adjusted gross annual incomes of $250,000 or more, or joint filers with AGIs of $500,000, will not be eligible for the full credit. That’s down from $400,000 for single filers and $800,000 for joint filers under existing law.

**Making EV tax credits ‘refundable’**

Currently, the EV tax credit is a nonrefundable credit when you file your taxes, meaning it simply lowers your federal tax bill — you have to make a certain amount for it to really have an impact. However, the latest version of the Build Back Better bill turns the EV tax credit into a refundable amount. With this change, it wouldn’t matter if an EV buyer owes the IRS or not — anyone who buys an EV will be potentially eligible for at least $4,000 in their pocket. The change would move the tax credit much closer to a point-of-sale incentive, although not quite. 

**What about used and leased EVs?**

Right now, and in the pending bill, there is no tax credit if you decide to lease a new electric vehicle. Instead, the tax credit actually goes back to the automaker or lender financing the leased vehicle. Like leasing an EV, buying a used electric car also does not allow you to claim the traditional EV tax credit. But that could change. Language calls for a $2,000 credit for used EVs at least 2 years old that cost under $25,000. There’s an extra $2,000 available if the EV includes at least a 40 kilowatt-hour battery for a total of $4,000 available for qualifying previously owned EVs.

**Ask about state help and other programs**

Many states and even local governments are looking to speed up EV adoption rates and so offer their own incentives on top of any federal help. California is a leader in incentivizing EV purchases with a direct consumer rebate up to $4,500 through the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project. There is a waitlist. Colorado, Washington and select New England states also offer state incentives and more may be looking to leverage federal efforts. Even your local utility company may subsidize an EV purchase, so it may be worth an inquiry.

CryptoCurrency,"Be skeptical when people say “ crypto is an inflation hedge” , biggest increases were during the time of low inflation and monetary stimulus","I hear this said a lot like a gospel and I think a lot of people never actually looked at data or read anything besides posts that support their views .

During low inflation / weak economy Fed lower Fed Fund Rate ( FFR) and inject stimulus into financial market , during good time Fed pulls stimulus from the market and raises rates 

You can take a look at cycles here 

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS

Last rate cycle started in 2016 and really got up to speed in 2017-2019 , you can check yourself crypto performance and it wasn’t till Covid stimulus things woke up ( that’s where a lot of people misuse term inflation  vs asset appreciation ) 

So now we again in the phase where Fed is starting to withdraw stimulus and will be raising rates to combat inflation in goods and services 

Yesterday we saw a stock and crypto sell offs due to inflation data that can force Feds hand to move faster And increase rates which decreases asset prices 

Another side effect of higher rates is that margin loans will be more expensive and less people will be willing to go long on borrowed money and more people will liquidate their leveraged position Because of risk / reward 

Historically stocks and RE are best inflation hedges Because companies can increase prices and RE can increase rents , crypto ? It’s 12 year old new asset class and I am not sold yet it’s a hedge Bevause the data is not showing it , I am ok changing my opinion if data changes

investing,Understanding and Profiting from our Current Inflationary Environment,"Inflation is a persistent issue coming out of the COVID lockdown economy and continues to create a great amount of confusion for the retail investor space. Many retail traders don't know what it means or how to respond. More specifically, many are having trouble with tailoring their portfolios to either avoid risk or take advantage of inflationary circumstances. I aim to somewhat remedy this. I hope the pointers below will help you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. This is not the end all or be all and I welcome your observations and comments on what I could have missed. Enjoy this and lets make some money taking advantage of these once in a lifetime economic circumstances.

* **Inflations is Measured by a Change in Rate:** Inflation doesn't usually go down. The RATE of inflation goes up or down, but inflation itself is persistent. This is by design. Could you imagine what would happen to the economy if you knew that your dollar would be worth more tomorrow than it is today? Spending on goods other than necessities would come to a very dramatic reduction (*Note: You might be rethinking crypto right now huh?*). So it is important to understand that what we are looking at is the CHANGE IN RATE of inflation. There is no deflation!! Deflation is 1000x worse for the economy than inflation. So do not expect deflation. The Fed simply will not allow it. Nor should they!
* **Current Inflation is Largely a Result of too Much Demand:** During the COVID lock downs many businesses were forced to grind their operations to a halt. Remember food, toilet paper, &amp; other essentials flying off the shelves? Indeed many grocery stores were limiting the amount of water you could buy. It only stands to reason that when you force businesses to close down you create a situation where the goods that people demand are not being replaced by a steady supply. So what happens as the economy opens back up? Suddenly those same businesses have reduced inventories, they need to hire back workers, they need to order new supplies, &amp; they need to meet an increased demand as a result of some competitors closing their doors for good. Now the quantity of goods demanded well exceeds the quantity of goods supplied ... on all fronts. Reopening firms are competing against other reopening firms for the same raw materials, supplies, resources, shipping, etc. They are also competing for the same labor pool. Remember that goods &amp; services in times of extreme scarcity go to the highest bidder.
* **Secondary &amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand (Or too Little Supply):** Below you will find the inflationary issues we find ourselves in as a result of increased demand and limited supply. Below each topic you will also find some examples of how to profit from each. You will also receive some examples of secondary and tertiary effects of each.
* **Supply Chain Bottlenecks:** First and foremost in the news are the supply chain bottlenecks. We've all seen the ships floating off the Port of Los Angeles, or the very long line of trucks waiting to pick up freight from the ports. The United States &amp; Europe have but a limited number of ports and they're taking on all the supplies that firms ordered as the economy opened back up. Making things worse ... its holiday shopping season. So cost of shipping dry bulk overseas is not just rising as a result of increased demand, but as a result of the fact that it costs money to have all these carriers waiting weeks to offload their goods. Making matters worse many of the imported goods are perishables which can spoil and reduce the supply of foodstuffs amid an already high demand. As a result many firms are opting for alternative methods of shipping like the much more expensive option of air freight.

**(*****Note: Moderately bullish on sea freight carriers, rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight*****)**

* **Supply Chain Shortages:** As if the bottlenecks weren't bad enough, there are but a limited number of domestic shipping firms. Firms that not only transport materials to businesses, or, finished goods to retailers, but also delivering orders to retail shoppers. Here we are once again talking about rail, trucking, mail delivery, air freight, logistics firms, logistics outsourcing, etc. So yet again we have an increased demand for shipping and logistics with but a limited supply. And while this demand will keep up for some time, many firms know it will eventually come back down to normal, and therefore, are very hesitant to expand too fast too quickly for fear that they will one day have too much fleet for future business.

**(*****Note: Moderately bullish on rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight*****)**

* **Semiconductor Shortages:** Everything these days has a semiconductor. Whether its semiconductors, passive semiconductors, diodes, you name it, chances are if it was an electronic made in the last 5 years, it needs a semiconductor to properly operate. Indeed before the supply chain shortages hit critical mass, we were dealing with semiconductor shortages. Now we will not likely fix the semiconductor issue until we fix the supply chain issue. Once again as the economy opened back up &amp; demand skyrocketed, semiconductors too experienced a complementary spike in demand. Semiconductors alone are preventing the automakers from producing at full capacity. There are not enough semiconductors to make vehicles. And with the holidays on the horizon semiconductors are in higher demand than ever. Even Sony had to reduce the number of PlayStations they could manufacture and ship due to component shortages and logistics issues. So expect the price of any new electronic device that has a semiconductor to increase in price.

**(*****Note: Bullish on electronics &amp; semiconductors*****)**

* **Vehicle Shortages:** As noted with the semiconductors, vehicles are in short supply. As a result the quantity of vehicles demanded exceed the quantity of vehicles supplied. Therefore we not only have a shortage of vehicles but the price o vehicles have skyrocketed. Have you seen the empty lots at your local dealership? There's nothing to sell! People are ordering direct from factory. As a result people turned toward used vehicles which now are also in short supply. As a result people who could not afford the increased price of used vehicles resulted to maintaining their current vehicles. And as a result of people maintaining their current vehicles, the demand for auto parts &amp; auto mechanics have skyrocketed. And I don't know many large firms that do not need a frequent supply of vehicles to maintain operations.

**(Note:** ***Moderately bullish to bullish on used car firms, auto parts, and car repair***\*\*)\*\*

* **Raw Material Shortages:** Raw materials were the first to explode out of COVID. Wood, steel, ore, oil, &amp; minerals ... you name it, its all going up. The quantity of supply demanded exceed the current supply ... and for many reasons.

**(Note:** ***Moderately bullish on miners, steel, mining equipment suppliers, and oil/gas producers ... see energy shortage below for more detail on oil/gas***\*\*)\*\*

* **Increased Demand for Housing:** Largely as a result of low interest rates incentivizing lending, we experienced a housing and construction boom in the middle of a Pandemic. Houses and industrial builds in many areas have skyrocketed in value. But this was not only as a result of low interest rates. When the federal government instituted a ban on evictions from rental properties, many took advantage by simply not paying their rent. The forgone payments to the landlord forced the renter to pass on the costs on to new tenants, which increased the cost of rental properties beyond that just owning a home in many areas. So people bought homes instead. Moreover many people moved out of urban areas to escape burdensome COVID restrictions which furthermore increased the demand of housing. Furthermore lifetime renting millennials saw the low interest rates as a great time to buy their first home. Finally, mortgage forbearance reduced a lot of foreclosures during COVID. Less foreclosures means less supply, less supply amid high demand results in higher prices.

**(Note:** ***Not very bullish on housing &amp; real estate at this time but still moderately bullish on construction, furniture, paint, fixtures, and infrastructure***\*\*).\*\*

* **Energy Shortages:** As we began to put the COVID economy behind us, more people are travelling to work, to school, and going on vacation. More recently international travel is opening back up.  Moreover firms are expanding rapidly to meet demand and shippers are using more energy than ever. This all of course increases the price of oil, natural gas, jet fuel, and the fuel you pay at the pump. Making matters worse, no matter what your politics are, the current administration in the White House is the most ardently unfriendly domestic coal and fossil fuel administrations we've had in 5 years. OPEC, perhaps realizing that such demand will be but temporary for the next 1-2 years, refuses to entertain the Biden administrations request to ramp up oil supply. Oddly enough big oil hasn't been in this good of a position for the last 4 years where the increase of supply made it seriously hard for oil firms to profit. Energy is used for producing everything. When energy goes up the cost of everything goes up. When energy goes up, people spend more on energy and less on other things. So the increase in energy costs are a result of both increased post COVID demand and politics. Of all the issues we are experiencing with inflated prices, energy is among the easiest to fix.

**(Note: B*****ullish on oil, natural gas, oil and natural gas equipment maintainers and suppliers, and perhaps oil exploration if the Biden administration would quit putting up road blocks***\*\*)\*\*

* **Worker Shortages:** ""Worker Shortages"" is misleading. When people think of a ""worker shortage"" they generally think that we don't have enough workers to meet demand. They would be correct. But we should phrase it as ""firms do not have enough workers to meet CURRENT demand."" Lets face it we are rear view looking creatures. Simply because a firm doesn't have enough workers does not indicate that they cant beat previous profit/revenue, but rather they can not only beat previous revenue projections, but also be in a position where they cannot meet CURRENT demand. And just like anything else, when the quantity of labor demanded exceeds the quantity of labor supplied, we run into increased labor costs ... namely wages. And wages are overwhelmingly the highest cost for most firms. 

**(Note:** ***Bullish on staffing and outsourcing firms***\*\*)\*\*

* **Secondary &amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand ... Conclusion:** Lets keep this simple. You want to buy a car. That car is made from raw materials such as aluminum &amp; steel. The car requires electronics. Those electronics require semiconductors. You need a labor force to put that car together. You need energy to manufacture that car. You need truckers &amp; freighters to ship those cars or bring manufacturers the materials to make cars. You need equipment to make cars. In short 100% of the price of all components of that car, or the components used to make that car, have gone up. Still, you have a high demand market where people and businesses require vehicles, but the manufacturer cant meet that demand due to the lack of supplies available. Nevertheless the vehicle manufacturer still needs to pay for overhead costs to keep the doors open. And as so many people are demanding such a short supply of cars, the manufacturers simply increase the price of that car to meet the demand of the highest paying bidders. And this phenomenon is happening in each step of the chain to make that car from the folks who supply the materials, to the folks who produce the energy, to the folks who ship the finished product. When the quantity of goods demanded exceed the quantity of goods supplied, prices necessarily must go up.
* **Monetary Drivers of Inflation:**  As a result of the dramatic initial downward shift in demand amid COVID lockdowns, the Federal Reserve made money cheap, essentially lowering interests rates to both incentivize borrowing and make borrowing more affordable. The result? Massive influxes of borrowing and lending which in turn flooded the economy with cash. At first this excess cash was used to make it through the pandemic. Later this cash was used by firms to expand rapidly to meet demand. People also used cheap money via extremely low interest rates to purchase homes, which increased the demand for housing. Eventually the Fed is going to need to raise interest rates to disincentive lending and cool off a hot economy. If allowed to persist for too long the influx of cash will lead to investments by firms looking to to stave off losing the value of money via inflation and thereby creating a massive bubble. There are already indicators of this happening by virtue of equity valuations in the market. (*Note: the Fed has also been incentivizing investment in the stock market by buying treasury bonds on the secondary market which resulted in keeping the yields artificially low. As a result people were less inclined to buy treasury bonds and more incentivized to invest in other equity*).
* **Government Drivers of Inflation:** The rapid inflation we are experiencing has not deterred President Biden for advocating for trillions in spending measures. The U.S. Government is a customer just like anyone else, and the government competes for the same goods and services you and I do. Increased spending will to some extent result in crowding out the private sector that competes for the same goods and services. Remember that an increase in demand with limited supply generally results increased prices. If the government spends too much, it can seriously hurt consumers in the form of increased prices. Moreover the Biden administration isn't the most friendly administration when it comes to mining for coal, oil, minerals, etc.. This inevitably leads to increased costs of energy and raw materials. (*Note: This comment used a political figure as an example of a negative economic consequence. Do me a favor, take the example for what its worth to you, and realize I am not going to entertain heated political discussion. There is a cost and benefit to everything, and I don't have the time to entertain the talking points you pulled from a political webpage or favorable news site and tell you why you're wrong, when no matter how much the evidence is stacked against you, you're not going to change your mind anyway. Ergo a massive waste of time that benefits no one*).
* **Inflation is Excellent for Debt!:** I will keep this one quick. Lets say you took out a 30 year fixed mortgage in 1990. You paid $90,000 for your home and have a mortgage of $400 per month. In the year 2019 your home is now worth $200,000 in market value but you're still paying $400 per month at a fixed rate. Through inflation your wages have eventually increased while your fixed rate mortgage remained stagnant. In short, you may have been scrimping for pennies when you took out the mortgage, but years later you can make your payment while working at a fast food restaurant. Neat huh? Inflation is excellent for debt ridden companies. As their profit margins increase over time through inflation they will find it much easier to pay off their long term debt. (*Note: Perhaps this put some of the companies you were looking at into better perspective, and if debt was a major factor for not investing, then you may or may not want to revisit your decision.*)
* **Bullish Sectors You Can Profit From that I did not Mention Above:** Industrial Chemicals, Industrial Equipment, Fertilizers, Farm Equipment/Construction, and Pesticides. As firms ramp up production they will increase the demand for industrial chemicals. Moreover, as food prices continue to increase the more land farmers will be incentivized to clear for additional farming which requires more farming construction, farming equipment, chemicals/pesticides, and fertilizers.
* **The Canary in the Inflation Coal Mine:** If the change in prices rise beyond the change in incomes to the point where people need to start economizing their necessities and forgoing their wants, we could be looking at a very serious correction.

**Conclusion:** I hope the pointers above have helped you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. Please understand that I will be reading this over and over again to identify typos &amp; unclear sentences. I may even edit it as people bring ideas to my attention.

stocks,Long on PSFE - analyzing their debt and growth,"I've been interested in this company for a while. I didn't mess with it until earnings clarified the revenue, due to this note I saw in their last IR presentation at the time saying they exited 'discrete set of clients' without disclosing the actual impact: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q28r4k/paysafe\_psfe\_revenue\_blackbox/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q28r4k/paysafe_psfe_revenue_blackbox/). Also Covid benefited iGaming so this was going to be a tough comp vs. Q2.

The main thing with PSFE was understanding that leveraged M&amp;A was their strategy from the beginning and they were extremely upfront and transparent on this even from their December 2020 presentation, it was in their first or second main slide. This was important as I understood it would shift from a high growth stock valuation to a lower, more mature growth one. As we saw with DraftKings, another M&amp;A driven landscape, I think the mindgame aspect is the investors' perceptions of the warchest - they start off from IPO/despaccing with around 2B+ cash positive and it's easy to underestimate how aggressive management is going to be. As it turns out, PSFE has taken on debt of 2.1B at an effective interest rate of 11%.

The questions here as a speculator/potential investor is:

1. Do you believe the CAGR projection?
2. Do you believe they can handle the debt load and interest expense?
3. Do you believe their acquisitions are accretive due to synergy?
4. Do you think the regulation outlook is the same?

I have no issue with the 11% CAGR projection that the company gives. Unlike a lot of these other IPOs, I think PSFE backed this up with their 2018 and 2019 numbers.

Let's take their TTM topline revenue of 1.48B x 1.11 + 0.06B (I'm just taking Cowen Equity research's estimate of 60M annual revenue added by SafetyPay and PagoEfectivo) = 1.70B e2022 revenue.

Apply operating margin of 11.5% (it's been very close to cracking 12% with a couple quarters of 11.8%, but I disregarded the Q1 numbers due to the merger costs as one-time. All the acquisitions and Paysafe are all electronic so I think 11.5% is reasonable, even slightly conservative). This gets us at around 190M operating income annually for 2022 estimated.

They will almost be able to cover the interest expense on operations alone. They still have as of the end of September 262M cash and equivalents. People see the debt is a big number but they are more than able to carry it unless revenue growth is permanently stalled. 

They were able to retire 2B in debt already, and extend the maturity to 2028 and 2029, they should be smooth sailing well before. I've said this before for other companies in the Q2 earnings where this is a sign of good management - they're anticipating rates rising so want to clean up their balance sheets now so I noted all the earnings reports in Q2 that did this.

For this reason, I think the fact all their acquisitions were all-cash, and the fact they chose to leverage, suggests dilution is unnecessary. Also from a management standpoint, it's very strange to not dilute early or earlier on from a position of strength when they were cash-rich, with at least a part-equity offer (like Draftkings was prepared to for the Entain bid). These are huge capital structure and financing decisions that the board of directors and the CEO have to decide on from the very start, and it's consistent with the idea they don't want to dilute if they can help it.

The curveballs and bear sides are:

1. What if management decides to go off the rails and this is actually just the beginning of the M&amp;A spree? In this case, dilution does become unavoidable. But from a corp finance standpoint, and what they've bought at what time for what price, this looks normal so far.
2. What if the regulation outlook reverses?
3. What if iGaming growth projection is wrong?

I do think the stalled revenue in Q3 was due to Covid demand pull-forward in Q2 like a ton of companies relating to gaming in general, I don't really have more to say there. The most bearish thing is Digital Wallets had a big decline. This is a very competitive space, but their strategy is to build this up via cross-selling through their acquisitions - it's more likely it's a one-off than a permanent reversal. That's why you see the M&amp;A urgency. 

I don't know if regulation outlook will change but in the US it seems to be going fine. I'm taking a starter at 4.25, will scale in more if it hits 4 and 3s.",finance

personalfinance,Best Game Plan- 90K Student Loan w/Navient (Aidvantage),"FYI- I also posted this in the Student Loan Sub. But figured I could find more advice here. Thank you all. 

$90,000 balance. Payments have obviously been stopped because of COVID. Payments will start again Feb 1. I never made payments to begin with. See below.

Background: A bit insane. These loans are from over a decade ago. I've never made a single payment on them. Original loan was around 60K, and I've been using forbearance and anything else possible to avoid making payments for the last 10 years. That interested accrued to what is now $90,000. That backstory is a novel, and I'll save it for another day.

Current: My entire life and financial situation has changed drastically over the past few years. So I'm done playing the deferment/forbearance game and ready to tackle these, mainly for my first home purchase.

I now make around $300K and I've set aside 50K in cash specifically to make a lump sum payment in February to knock this balance down, then start repaying monthly. Most likely make a final lump sum payment at the end of 2022 to clear the balance entirely.

I guess my question is how do I make these monthly payments (from Feb-December) low as possible? Do I pay down 50K, then refi, then make monthly payment until I pay off balance at end of year? Do I refi, then pay down the 50K, and then make payments till end of year when I make final lump sum payment?

Interest rate is 6.8%. My credit is very good these days as opposed to when I took the loan. So maybe an improvement could be made with the rate for those 11 months. I just have no idea how this works.

I really appreciate any suggestions or guidance here. Thank you.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Nov 11, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 11, 2021**

The market finished mixed on Thursday, as market participants continue to grapple with the implication of the latest inflation report and third-quarter earnings, which are showing signs of slowing down as it winds down. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) rose after two consecutive down days, as tech stocks made a comeback, closing 0.04% and 0.28% higher, led by a rebound in technology stocks, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.44% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 0.8% higher. 

With a slow news days due to it being Veteran’s Day holiday in the US, market participants continue to digest the Consumer Price Index released tomorrow, which showed prices of consumer good surging 6.2%.  in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. 

The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. 

Matthew Luzzetti, Chief US Economist at Deutsche Bank, said “This \[the CPI report\] is certainly telling us, I think, that price pressures are more persistent. They are broader. They are not just narrowly focused on those categories, whether it's autos and the supply-constrained items. And it's going to last longer than expected. We do think that the Fed is going to have to raise rates next year. They've signaled that they're going to taper through the middle of the year, and that's our baseline at this point. But if you continue to see price pressures like this over the coming months and more persistent, it may cause them to have to act earlier than expected.""

With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds.

CryptoCurrency,Earning 11% passive income. Who offers the juicy 20-40% returns I keep hearing about?,"[edit] Overwhelming amount of responses. Thank you all so much.

I'm a huge fan of earning passive income on my stable coin holdings. I currently hold a mix of USDC &amp; USDT. I could be more risky and play with liquidity pools but my preference for passive earning is to keep my stable coins as liquid as possible while avoiding fees / chance of losses.

Until last night I was holding majority of my Stable holdings (USDC &amp; USDT) in my Nexo Finance wallet. Nexo pays a base 8% interest on stable coins. The interest is paid out nightly (usdc). You can opt to accept the interest payment in the form of Nexo tokens which brings the interest rate to 10% (2% bonus). Nexo also offers tiered bonuses based on the amount of Nexo tokens you hold in your account. My current rate is 11%. Again, holding zero Nexo tokens and choosing to be paid out in USDC nightly gives a base rate of 8%. That's solid.

It looks like BlockFi, Celcius and some other platforms all follow the same model as Nexo for the most part. Some of these platforms are advertising returns of 18-19%. However, digging into these offers, most are promo only, dependent on locking up your funds for 30-90 days, etc. Again, I want to keep my money liquid in case the market has that 25-50% correction. I want to buy the dip.

This leads me into the reason for my post. Last night I come across a post about KuCoin. Their P2P lending platform provides the security I want that my funds will be paid back but also has interest rates sitting around 19-20% at the moment for stable coins. USDT paying the highest. The minimum lending length is 7 days but reading lots of feedback about the program, most people report loans are paid back on average quicker than 7 days. Essentially doubling my interest earnings from 11% (my current Nexo stable coin interest rate) to ~20% seems fantastic. I've heard the interest rate tanks during the bear market which makes sense. This money will get put to use during those times anyways.

Does anyone use Kucoin? Thoughts? Any other experience with other platforms? Am I missing something you think I should consider before trying to lend on KuCoin?

Thanks for reading. Get that passive income coming in guys and girls. It's huge. Remember to ALWAYS DYOR and always be skeptical. Lots of scammers out there promising insane returns.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,LCX: A nest generation CEX and why you should own it,"f there's one thing that holds true in crypto its that by the time you are seeing a token posted on the front page of Reddit, or being pumped by an influencer on YouTube, its too late, not to make any gains at all, but making those fat, juicy gains that separate those in the know from the herd is an opportunity loooong gone. More often than not 'apeing' into such projects means you are going to become exit liquidty for those who got in first.

So how do you get in first? How do you find good projects early? Where's all that alpha at? You can spend hours trawling through Twitter and Discord, hoping to trip over it. You can spend even longer looking at the crypto markets, trying to isolate the trends that are going to form the next hype cycle. Or you can do what I have been doing, which is plenty of all of that, but also looking at the broader macro landscape as well. In doing so I am forming a thesis around the next big wave of, not only adoption, but liquidity, a veritable tsunami of money. While everybody is looking at gaming and metaverse plays and waxing lyrical about the wave of adoption that is surely coming (and they're right, its just that things move so fast the pumps have already happened for this bull market) I have found it always pays better to look where the crowd aint looking. Where might that be? Believe it or not, at the boomers, or, more specifically, the funds that manage their money.

And amid all the hype around the metaverse and gaming the markets have been quietly changing. Institutions have caught a whiff of the insane ROI possible in crypto and want in. Thus far they have only able to get indirect exposure via Greyscale's fund, a suite of JP Morgan instrument that are total rip offs and doesn't even hold bitcoin or nay other crypto, by buying MicroStrategy stocks and most recently a Bitcoin futures ETF. That ETF did a record amount of volume on its first two days, which to the alert should give you some idea of the incredible amount of demand for crypto among those too old or bogged down in regulations to jump on metamask, hit Uniswap and jump onto the latest, greatest project.

***My Macro Thesis:***

Why do I think the Boomers will provide the next big wave of adoption, in addition to younger segments in the markets currently forming the major narratives around the future of crypto?  Simply put traditional investments (such as bonds and other fixed income products) cannot keep pace with inflation under a low interest rate monetary policy regime. The Boomers aren't earning enough passive income to preserve their wealth.  The hunger for yield this creates will force this normally conservative cohort of investors out onto the risk curve, and the race to create instruments that provide exposure to crypto among financial institutions all over the world bears witness to this.  And while many predict the Fed will raise interest rates these raises will be small, and slow, regardless of inflation.  The Fed have painted themselves into a corner whereby any major hike in interest rates would totally collapse the global economy and, moreover, render the US government insolvent.  The whole globe has become so indebted both before an during the pandemic that any major shift in these historically loose policy settings and its GG.  Keeping interest rates low during a period of inflation is known as financial repression, and occurred, for example, post WWII.  These bleak epochs of financial history are generally slow and last decades as Governments monetise, and slowly pay down their debts.  ***Real, that is, inflation adjusted interest rates are at historical lows, and in my opinion will continue to remain so for far longer than most economists and analysts expect.***  This will drive the Boomers to increasingly seek higher returns on their capital, and is what is driving them as clients to start asking their money managers why they cant get exposure to crypto..

Total Supply: 950 Million

The following is a quick paraphrased summary of information gleaned from their website

and Coin Gecko about the exchange (my comments added!):

**LCX** is a next generation crypto exchange based in Liechtenstein (a very small, very rich and very crypto friendly jurisdiction). They have offices in their hometown as well as Switzerland (hello banks), New Dehli and Chicago. They are a member of the World Economic Forum's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (who estimates that more than 8 trillion USD of value will be stored on blockchains by 2027). Their advisory board is a who's who of thought leaders in the space: Jimmy Wales (Wikipedia), Yat Siu (Chairman at Animoca Brands) etc. *LCX has obtained eight registrations from the FMA in Liechtenstein and has introduced a comprehensive crypto compliance suite* (hello institutional investors). In addition to this LCX offers enterprise grade custodial solutions, an advanced Crypto Trading Desk that enables users to trade on all major exchanges from a single terminal, a defi dashboard ""Fire Salamander"" that enables limit order functionality on Uniswap DEX and a launchpad for *compliant* Token Offerings.

**Why I am Holding LCX:**

***Solid tokenomics***: LCX is essentially a utility token, giving users a 50% discount on fees. 100% of all tokens used to pay fees within LCX's ecosystem **will be burnt.** This means that eventually the token will become deflationary, meaning number go up.

***Huge upside***: LCX is flying under the radar, but not for long. A recent listing on Coinbase gives us a cursory sense of the potential of this project. And by complying with regulators from the outset the big end of town are suddenly free to ***directly*** invest in crypto projects. We can have ideological debates about whether regulations are good or bad for crypto till Twitter crashes, but the simple fact is that **they are coming, worldwide.**

***Legal Clarity***: While exchanges like Binance who love to exist in that legal grey area crypto has, up until now, flourished in, will be focused on fighting the SEC and others, LCX are positioning themselves to be a legally compliant exchange, which means the boomers and their fundies can flood into the markets, bringing with them their money. While many exchanges are inevitably going to feel the wrath of regulators, and some may even be shut down during the coming purges, LCX are looking forward and positioning themselves well to take advantage of continued and accelerating adoption in the space.

***Cringe NFTs/Boomer-Fi***: yeah, you read that right, cringe. While we all want to be cool I reckon making money is cooler. LCX are launching a NFT based project called Tiamonds, to basically school boomers about tokenising real world assets on the blockchain. Each NFT represents a diamond and entitles the holder to ownership of the asset and to also earn TIA tokens (branded as a deflationary cryptocurrency). LCX basically want to onboard/introduce boomers to the idea of NFTs, which again, is cringe, but smart. Unlike SOL and other platforms (XRP, STX etc) who are trying to replicate the NFT boom that occured on ETH's mainnet (SOL punks anyone?), LCX are strategically targeting their demographic (much the same way Hedera are). Everything about the project, from its clean and simple UI to the fact that it offers custodial solutions is well aimed at the tech-phobic, but yield hungry, Boomer cohort, I am calling this trend Boomer-Fi. This, combined with the above, indicates sound strategic management of the project, which can't be a bad thing.

""***It's Early""***: I know this catch cry borders on becoming a meme, so often is it applied to projects that have already pumped, but in this case applies. At sub 50 cents (which it hit only recently) this is a bargain, and given the scope and ambition of this project, it really is early. Combine that with the tokenomics, and the clearly well informed and tactically savvy management team and its a solid buy IMO, with a great risk/reward profile.

In conclusion, I am holding LCX because not only it is a project that already has a product/market fit that differentiates itself from the crowd, but it is a project well positioned to survive any downturn, and lets face it, many projects currently enjoying this hype cycle will not. In my opinion this is a long term hold. Anyway, that's all I got for now guys, please feel free to add any feedback below. If you liked this or got any value out of it a bump for visibility is always appreciated.  (And yes, guys, I have already tried to correct the title and cannot!)",cryptocurrency

I just spoke with Schwab and they informed me that I could go ahead and move my Inherited IRA over to TD Ameritrade as eventually all of that is getting sucked into the Schwab ecosystem (maybe in the next year).

I'm looking for some guidance here. Maybe reassurance that my plan makes sense going forward. 

Here's a quick screenshot of my CURRENT budget until my Emergency Fund is built back up (should be done by Dec 31st) - [https://imgur.com/a/QJEIRLO](https://imgur.com/a/QJEIRLO)

Currently, after all my bills are paid and I've funded my lifestyle, I have roughly $2000/mo leftover that I am trying to decide what to do with. 

I am putting that away into savings currently to rebuild my emergency fund after an impromptu job change and relocation, which should be neatly wrapped up by end-of-year. I am shooting for 3 months of expenses saved. 

Once I hit that goal, this is where I have options that I'd like help deciding. Ideally, I would like 6 months to a year of emergency funds saved, but 3 months is a good cushion for now. 

I currently have \~$37k in Federal student loans, half are subsidized (interest-free) and half are unsubsidized (carry an interest rate). 

I have \~$4000 split between credit card debt and the remainder of a motorcycle note. 

I am **not** currently contributing to an IRA, though I have roughly $2000 I would like to rollover to Schwab or another firm (currently with Northwestern Mutual, trying to get out of there fast). However, I am a government employee with a nice pension system setup. I am not vested yet, and am only 24 years old. 

I would also like to begin saving for a home. I'm sick of dealing with landlords and crappy neighbors. My girlfriend and I have been talking it over and are willing to commit - we are also aware of the marriage advice, no need to dive into that for home ownership on this post. :)

All that being said, I would like to outline my plan for your consideration - please tell me what you think should be changed, or if you agree with the idea. Like I said, looking for either guidance or reassurance here. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Once my 3-month savings goal is hit, I would like to aggressively pay down my credit-card and motorcycle debt. This would free up another \~$250/mo to use elsewhere. With student loan payments coming due at the end of January 2022, I would be making just the minimum payments during this time. This would likely only take about 2 months to complete. 
2. Once my CC and motorcycle loan are paid off, I would have roughly $2250/mo to allocate. I would put the large majority of this into my student loans - make the minimum on my subsidized loans, and as much as possible on the unsubsidized loans to pay them off as quickly as possible. No IRA investing at this point. 
3. Once subsidized loans are wiped out (roughly $16k, so by the end of next year if putting $2k/mo into it) I would then divide my available funds between paying down my subsidized (interest-free) loans, maxing out an IRA, and saving for a home. 

Some other considerations like continuing to add a small amount into savings to slowly build it up to a 6-month cushion, potentially bumping up my ""lifestyle"" funding, are here too, but this would be roughly $300-400/mo. 

Thank you for your time and consideration - I hope my rambling here has made sense and would love to hear anyone's feedback on this plan going forward.",finance
Bitcoin,Talk #Sats,"We should talk about sats which are the foundation stones of the great bitcoin platform.
As USD are the foundation stones of the federal reserve platform.
#sats are day to day unit of account.
I got 1m sats, for example.
Average Joe will get it more easily.

personalfinance,Home buying questions! Please help. Is it worth buying a home in this market?,Alright so I’m currently looking at purchasing a 400000 dollar home. I recently just bought a business this year as well. I have about 100000 in stocks right now that I don’t want to pull out quite yet. I will be a first time home buyer so I only have to put up 3 percent which is 12000 plus closing costs with a 2.5 percent interest rate. My questions are is it worth buying in this market or do people think it will come down? (I do think it’s a bubble). I don’t wanna buy a house and have 2008 happen all over again. Or would it be a smart decision to buy now before interest rates start going up next year like they are talking about! Please help alll pros and cons welcome and will be considered thanks!!!,finance
investing,China's Everygrande problem may affect global real estate?,"The Fed in its semi-annual report on financial stability on Monday wanted to warn investors about the recent financial problems regarding the Chinese real estate sector. According to the Fed, the current problems affecting the Chinese real estate market could **spread around the world and cause global economic damage**. The reason for this is to be identified in the **close relations that China has with countries around the world and with the vastness of its economic-financial system**. Furthermore, any increase in interest rates could lead to a reduction in the demand for housing, and this would lead to a reduction in house prices, putting the sector even more in crisis.

The American central bank, through its semi-annual report, therefore stated in no uncertain terms its concern on the entire Chinese real estate sector, referring in particular to China Evergrande Group.

**Do you think it really can influence global real estate?**

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown November 12, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. World Mobile dropped a nice youtube AMA for us. Very interesting details came up about Microsoft Airband, Google Project X, and Project Taara. [https://twitter.com/WorldMobileTeam/status/1458718340931858435](https://twitter.com/WorldMobileTeam/status/1458718340931858435)
2. Weiss highlights that Cardano addresses participating in staking have grown by 100k in two months. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1458845224671887362](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1458845224671887362)
3. The Cardano Summit 2021 Terra Virtua NFTs have arrived. Check your inventory if you did all the tasks in the Summit’s virtual worlds. [https://terravirtua.io/inventory](https://terravirtua.io/inventory)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano. [https://twitter.com/seal\_kiman/status/1443593563846193155](https://twitter.com/seal_kiman/status/1443593563846193155)
2. Adam Dean gives us a great post-mortem on the network load created yesterday by the NFT drop(s). [https://twitter.com/adamKDean/status/1443599818845081600](https://twitter.com/adamKDean/status/1443599818845081600)
3. Wow! It’s looking like Meld has landed a partnership with a mobile provider in Nigeria with nine million customers. Not many details out at this point (Sept 30). But, that certainly sounds like it could be gigantic. [https://twitter.com/MELD\_labs/status/1443548879966949382](https://twitter.com/MELD_labs/status/1443548879966949382)
4. Two factor authentication via SMS once again turns out to be a bad bet. [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hackers-rob-thousands-coinbase-customers-sms-mfa-flaw](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hackers-rob-thousands-coinbase-customers-sms-mfa-flaw)
5. Grayscale releases a report on Cardano which shocks many due to its (actually) fair reporting. [https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1443625454146097152](https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1443625454146097152) [https://twitter.com/cardano\_whale/status/1443786596721967104](https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1443786596721967104)
6. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It’s notable that Cardano’s Djed solves this. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-seeks-to-regulate-stablecoin-issuers-as-banks-11633103156](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-seeks-to-regulate-stablecoin-issuers-as-banks-11633103156)

8. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM. [https://twitter.com/thr33strikes/status/1444898320070086659](https://twitter.com/thr33strikes/status/1444898320070086659)
9. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a “what if” scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised. [https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1445059673401528328](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1445059673401528328)
10. The so-called “Pandora Papers” reveal globally widespread cases of wealth concealment by public officials and bring up the question of whether blockchains like Cardano should take this into account when dealing with nation-state regimes as partners. [https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/)
11. Remember! There is no mobile Daedalus wallet. There is no browser extension version of Daedalus. These are fakes! They will steal your ADA. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853)

13. dcSpark releases some mockups from the experimental version of its upcoming Flint Wallet. The mockups seem to indicate that the wallet will allow for dApp interaction from hardware wallets. [https://twitter.com/FlintWallet/status/1444902727956508674](https://twitter.com/FlintWallet/status/1444902727956508674)
14. Charles is interviewed in the Harvard International Review. [https://hir.harvard.edu/charles-hoskinson-1/](https://hir.harvard.edu/charles-hoskinson-1/)
15. The Biden Administration has revealed that it is considering an executive order to establish a government wide approach to crypto regulation. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/white-house-weighs-wide-ranging-push-for-crypto-oversight](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/white-house-weighs-wide-ranging-push-for-crypto-oversight)
16. The New York Times is now talking about the difficult balancing act the Fed has before it with high inflation and less than promising jobs data creating conflicting priorities. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/business/economy/fed-jobs-full-employment-inflation.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/business/economy/fed-jobs-full-employment-inflation.html)
17. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle. [https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1445465912375590913](https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1445465912375590913) [https://emmer.house.gov/2021/7/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-provide-certainty-for-digital-assets-under-securities-law](https://emmer.house.gov/2021/7/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-provide-certainty-for-digital-assets-under-securities-law)
18. Caitlin Long revisits the articles she wrote years ago about fears of circulation credit in crypto markets. Spoiler: it came and crypto did it to itself. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1446874905241210880](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1446874905241210880)
19. COTI is a licensed payment institution in Singapore. This could get very interesting given their status as the issuer of Djed and the ongoing Monetary Authority of Singapore Blockchain Challenge in which Cardano is a finalist. [https://cotinetwork.medium.com/coti-lists-as-a-payment-institution-in-singapore-666c6fcaaab4](https://cotinetwork.medium.com/coti-lists-as-a-payment-institution-in-singapore-666c6fcaaab4)
20. Goldman says Evergrande is nothing compared to the potential $8.2 Trillion problem with local government financing vehicles in China.

21. Cardano isn’t wrong about Africa. It’s just first. Google is investing $1 Billion in African internet access over the next five years. [https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/) [https://twitter.com/ghostchainer/status/1445964578257395714](https://twitter.com/ghostchainer/status/1445964578257395714)
22. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) delivers an opinion piece that investors should be allowed to make their own decisions without SEC paternalism.

26. Coinbase is launching an NFT market. How will this impact the CNFT scene? Coinbase tells us: “...initial launch will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards with multi-chain support planned soon after.” [https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html)
27. Eric Rosengren (who recently left the Boston Fed) let’s us know that the Fed/MIT CBDC project is pretty far along and will release a working paper soon. This would obviously be impactful for all of crypto and for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/ivqFo9C2Jdo?t=409](https://youtu.be/ivqFo9C2Jdo?t=409)
28. The first project that actually looks like it may one day be a virtual world launches on Cardano and it already has a community built parcel explorer. [https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/](https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/)
29. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa. [https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830](https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830) [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08)

32. Apparently, Putin kind of accepts that crypto might choose to exist. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/putin-defends-cryptocurrencies-amid-global-regulation-push](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/putin-defends-cryptocurrencies-amid-global-regulation-push)

36. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan Müller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we’ll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)
37. Here’s video of the Fireside chat with Charles, Dynal Patel, and John O’Connor at the Cape Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative in South Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4&amp;t)

40. The Cardano Foundation is changing its delegation strategy. They will go from primarily delegating to promote decentralization to a new framework focused on delegating to promote ecosystem buildout.

42. In the Cap Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative Fireside Q&amp;A, Charles mentioned he is talking to Colossol Labs about the possibility of having the Mammoth DeExtinction Project take place on his bison ranch. There are probably some obvious NFT or tokenization use cases there. [https://colossal.com/mammoth/](https://colossal.com/mammoth/) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4)

personalfinance,"Mortgaging a property after marriage, as a foreigner","Hi. I recently got married and am trying to make smart financial decisions.

I am an international PhD student and own the house we live in. I applied for a mortgage when I bought it, but everyone kept denying me because they simply don't make loans to international students. In the end, my parents ended up gifting me money that I used to buy the house in cash (\~300k).

Now I'm married to a medical school student in fourth year who has \~150k in med school loans.

I would like to mortgage the house so we can pay those loans immediately and have a low-interest rate mortgage debt instead of the school loans, but I'm doubtful I'll get approved for one (if I wasn't approved back when I bought it, why would I be approved now?). Now that I'm married, I'm wondering if my chances of approval are higher since my wife is a US citizen, but have the following concerns.

1. Can we apply for the mortgage together instead of me alone, who doesn't have residency here yet?
2. If so, does she need to be added to the title of the house beforehand?
3. The paperwork for a green card will likely take years to finish, so I don't think I'll be able to apply for the mortgage as a resident until then.

I would appreciate any recommendations or advice on the matter. Thank you!",finance

Satoshi launched bitcoin partly in response to inflating economies and started I believe in 2008. Right around the time of the last fininacial crisis.

To my knowledge crypto hasn't been in a recession market and so the variables are unknown. There has already been a massive leap in total market cap of at least $1 trillion this year alone, meaning crypto has probably inflated more than the economy and stocks themselves.

6.2% cpi inflation in the USA has upset many, UK forecast 5% by end of q1. China and most of Europe have faced heavy inflation and the cost of living has sky rocketed. A heavy correction of inflation is long overdue, with the FED stating ""inflation is transitory"". I dont believe them at all and expect the worst is yet to come

How easy would it be to access this data with let’s say a BI tool to analyze things like did the volume change, how many parcel centers have been crossed, and so on.

personalfinance,Help with proper allocation,"As a heads up, I also posted this in the portfolio management reddit but that community is much smaller.

Hi everyone, first time poster. Sorry if this post kind of wanders a bit - I'm trying to work all this out and am very nervous about making a tough life decision.

So I'm a 33 year old and have been investing since I was 8 years old lol. I've done really well in the market primarily because I have traded increase returns (researching and buying individual small caps) for higher volatility and downside risk in the longest bull market in history. My finance knowledge is almost completely self taught. I'm not a YOLO reddit investor, but I am definitely aggressive, and I know I touch my portfolio way too much -- and this lack of discipline means I end up being tax inefficient.

Anyways, to my point. I now have two million in my main portfolio. I am burnt out and unhappy with my job (I work for the government as a civil servant) and am seriously considering quitting to becoming a full time investor - like many, I am passionate about the research and have a taste for the chase.

I have been hesitant to make the jump, primarily because I'm not sure if I'm actually good at investing, or if I have just gotten extremely lucky. My job provides that security cushion if I blow up -- like most, I took a hard beating in 2008-9. However, I figure at 2 million I might have enough security to take the risk. I figure if I am going to try it, I should do it before I have kids and need to be much more careful.

So to my portfolio. My current thought process is reallocating to put a million in some type of high dividend or all weather ETF as a more conservative base - trading gains for downside protection. I live in Washington DC, and while I live rather frugally (considering my wealth), I still have expenses of \~50k-60k a year. As a result, I am aware that I'm going to have to touch my principle one way or another. However, it gives me a solid base to prevent me from living on the streets in a drastic downturn, at least if its not another great depression.

The other million is what I will be much more aggressive with and do my normal investing in.

I realize that this is more risky than coasting with my government job at 85k a year. I'm also worried about increased expenses of healthcare, losing government benefits, and what happens if I have kids in a few years. I know there is no real ""right or wrong"" answer here.

Just to add, another strategy for the conservative million I have thought is putting it in SPY and buying puts to trade returns for protection? I thought about bonds, but considering how low interest rates are, it just seems kind of pointless? I also know very little about the bond market or treasuries and considering the possibility of inflation sticking around...

I have no debt, but also am currently renting. The prices on houses in my area are unreal and my rent hasn't gone up in 3 years so I've chased higher returns in the markets at the expense of pissing away money on rent rather than mortgage.

I guess I'm just looking for some advice as I don't really have anyone I can talk to about this and this subreddit seams to have more sane people in it then many other stock ones.",finance

personalfinance,Is it an okay idea to pay off a small credit card in full but use it to get by minimally till next (Friday) payday?,"I'm debt snowballing and this is my second credit card on the list to pay off, I paid a $300 card off last month and haven't used it since. This one though has a $510 balance and I'm wondering if I should pay it off in full today and use it to get by till next Friday when I get paid again.

I'm 32, single, unmarried, no kids. I want to start off by sending thank you to the folks in this sub-Reddit. Thanks to many Redditor's advice over the years, I was able to change my financial lifestyle and situation. At one point, I had $13,000 in credit card debt, was a college dropout and worked a minimum wage job. Now, I work in education, finished my BA, will finish a graduate certificate in eLearning Design this December, and have payed off all of my credit card debt. 

Right now, I am at a new juncture in life. 

I need to start saving. I know this much, but I am trying to figure out for what. As someone who spent their money in the now, lived through the stress of paying off debt, I am trying to develop future-oriented thinking. It's been a process. 

I'm trying to answer my why. I'm in a fortune position that I don't have to pay rent (or utilities) and I want to use it to my advantage. My expenses are low. Car is payed for. Etc. 

For me, it makes sense to break up goals into 3-month increments. Create phases. It will prevent me from overwhelming myself and chunk my goals. 

Where do I begin? Emergency fund? Save up cash like a rapper preparing for the economic apocalypse? I have read stories about people who pay off their student loans in two years. I currently have $43,000 in student loans. I make $42,000 a year. Pay off student loans and become another success story? Would it be wise to just throw money at my student loan debt? What about interest rates? Get a higher paying job? Saving up for a house? All of it at the same time? If so, how do I manage all the spinning plates. I just need some direction, and help with a plan that leads to **sustainable financial habits that will enrich my quality of life and my future family's**  

My Dad always told me to spend money from strength, I didn't used to listen to him, I am beginning to now. 

Thank you for your help.",finance
Bitcoin,"Ray Dalio's ""How the Economic Machine Works"" and Bitcoin","Video reference - [How the Economic Machine Works](https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0)

Hello fellow bitcoiners!

I first discovered this video a number of months ago, and I've watched it twice more since then. I think Ray Dalio is correct with his analysis, and I think you'd be hard pressed trying to convince anyone who understands economics otherwise. 

Now here's my real question to you all here; assuming Dalio is correct about how this works in a fiat world, how does bitcoin fit into it/change it? 

You may immediately think that there wouldn't be cycles anymore with bitcoin, but I don't believe that is true. There will still be cycles because people will still borrow money, with the main difference being that interest rates will be generally higher all the time. So, at the very least, there will be short term cycles. 

What I'm struggling with is the long term cycle. Is it possible that bitcoin eliminates the long term cycle? If it doesn't eliminate it, how do we recover from it if our currency is deflationary?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Question about Financing for a roof repair,"I recently purchased a new home (3 months ago)  

Long story short, we were told the roof was brand new.  Mostly this is true, but it was a DIY job, not done by a professional roofer, and there is a section of the roof that was not done, so it is over 30 years old.  This is now leaking and needs to be replaced ASAP.  

Because the house was purchased so recently, I do not have alot of equity built up in the home, maybe around 5k or so, thats it.  

I do not know what the best course will be to get a loan to do the repair job.  I am looking at options less than 10k to repair it, but don't want to be stuck with large monthly payments, or an insane interest rate.  

Does anyone have some advise for different options I can look into?

Not looking into Legal advise for now, as that is already being handled, but the roof needs to be fixed before it starts snowing here.",finance
Forex,EURUSD Concern Came TRUE,"A prediction concerning the $EURUSD came true and 1.14 is getting closer. Now there is a northbound reaction to the Michigan consumer sentiment but that in itself was so lousy a figure that it even could support the $USDOLLAR once it calms down a bit. I made another $NSDQ100 sell on the latest move to the north the day of the inflation figures was released and missed the tp at 15900 by a mere 10 points but it is once again getting closer. For the $GER40 I can only say that it has been a long wait and it would be highest time to soon see some sells to reach their targets. but it has refused to leave the 16xxx level to any side whilst we have been through a lot of disappointing figures and a FED tapering. But with the consumer figures today there should be no other way than south for the DAX alongside the rest of the important US equities. They can keep pretending that everything is doing fine and we are looking at a major recovery which is beating expectations, but the figures do speak a clear language. With the consumer sentiment at a 10 year low, inflation should not be the biggest problem here as that is only the beginning.",finance
stocks,"Sky high inflation isn't due to ""supply chain bottlenecks"", it's due to printing too much money","I see a lot of articles and posts these days talking about supply chain issues: whether it's about how expensive it is to buy a shipping container, or that there isn't enough space at shipping ports, or that there aren't enough truckers, etc. etc.

However, these are all micro-level symptoms of a macro-level problem. Don't miss the forest for the trees. Journalists need to write something new every day (or every hour it seems), even if there isn't anything new to say. Which leads to a lot of noise that clouds your mind from making sense of what is really happening in the world.

In my view, the problem is clear: governments overdid it with stimulus. Unlike the 2008 Global Financial Crisis where policymakers did too little and acted too slow, this time around governments decided to err on the side of doing too much too quickly. If you look at consumer spending on FRED, it didn't just fully recovery from the 2020 shock, it's arguably on a stronger trajectory than it otherwise would be without the pandemic! At the same time, unemployment is still high and labor force participation is dreadfully low! The Fed created such a tremendous wealth effect, people are earning multiple years worth of stock market returns in the span of months. I'm not surprised many people are taking career breaks or retiring early. So why do we have red hot inflation? Because we're printing more money and making less things, it's that simple.

The inflation problem highlights how difficult it is to be a policymaker. On one hand, you don't want to under spend and risk seeing long-term economic scarring, but if you stimulate too much, you risk fueling inflation as well as asset price bubbles. The other factor at play is the politicization of economic policy. You're everyone's favorite politician when you're fueling spending, but it's hard to get reelected when you advocate for cutbacks. Prudent policymaking requires spending when times are bad, and building reserves when times are good - politicians have forgot about the latter half of that equation.

Edit: replying to a set of very common critiques in the comments:

1) “But shipping containers are $8k!” - I’m not denying supply chain problems, rather I think they are a symptom, not the root cause. When you have too much money chasing few things, you get supply chain bottlenecks.

2) “But velocity of money! QTM! You don’t understand Econ 101!!” - QTM is the foundation of Friedman’s famous view that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. For the Econ nerds who feel inclined to use textbook frameworks, here’s a pop quiz: what happens to prices when the velocity of money is flat and the monetary base is growing faster than real output? Prices go up!

algorand,Bitcoin Maximalist Defection/Betrayal - Leveraging My Assets for ALGO,"recently tried to post this to r/CC and mods deleted it. i already typed the whole thing though so hopefully it is OK here :)

&amp;#x200B;

Officially defecting from bitcoin maximalism and will now take a large fixed-rate loan to buy ALGO at $2 USD and below.

Fundamental Considerations: Max Keiser famously said “altcoins only exist to steal your bitcoin” and I believed this for a long time. I viewed altcoins as competing with bitcoin for attention and market cap – which I now find ridiculous. The MARKET chooses what has value, not you or me or Max Keiser. I am reminded of goldbugs – everyone knows they are technically right, but practically ridiculous. Bitcoin maximalists likewise can be ridiculous in our expectations and are particularly susceptible to *outgroup homogeneity bias* (thinking all members of groups outside one’s own are identical) which is a psychological defense to justify not having time to research 10,000 coins. I no longer hold a fundamental assertion that others *should* use/care about bitcoin, and find in letting go, relief washes over me like an awesome wave.

The Gamble: Most people immediately think taking a loan to buy ANY investment asset is risky – to those people I say “to each his own, and have fun staying poor.” I have been doing margin loans on btc proxies for years, at 6-8% interest rates. Moving this to a lower rate fixed-term is a no-brainer. What does Michael Saylor say about this? What do ALL the smart people in finance say? ALL rich people leverage assets to increase exposure to more assets – that’s the whole game and WHY the rich are pro-inflation. I choose to play rather than take the “safe route” which is designed to keep you out of the game.

Why not bitcoin?: The obvious move is take the maximum loan/mortgage and buy bitcoin. But my view of the future and web3 recently changed. Just as the internet didn’t wait for banks when bitcoin was launched, DeFi isn’t waiting for bitcoin. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means no one controls the direction it takes, we ALL have to go with the flow or drown. It doesn’t *always* matter if a project is the most secure, sometimes that tradeoff is worth it. Gold operated as the settlement layer store of value for human civilizations for 5000 years, yet most wealthy people today own little or no gold directly. The same principle applies that while btc is THE settlement asset for the internet’s base layer store of value, it is not obligated to be the only store of value. The other answer is volatility – I believe I can outperform bitcoin with ALGO using a similar strategy I use for bitcoin against higher volatility. (One of my trading assumptions is that ALGO is also 100% guaranteed to hit new ATH).

Why ALGO?: For me it’s clear Algorand is set to explode because it has a unique combination of: fast, final, cheap, easy, and network.

Fast – transactions are very fast, like a few seconds and it’s done, permanently

Final – transactions are not reversible, no forks ever so no disagreements on what happened whether you run a node or not

Cheap – 0.001 ALGO for a standard tx. I don’t even pay attention to fees and that’s how life should be

Easy – I’ve used other DeFi apps, certainly not ALL of them. Others I have used seem to have lots of errors, they are not intuitive, and just not a good user experience. ALGO official wallet is beautiful, apps like yieldly and tinyman are easy enough for a clown like me to figure out without instructions, and I don’t ever worry about losing tons of coin in the process. I can just do things and it works and makes sense. For a non-engineer who wants to feel comfortable, ALGO really hits the sweet spot. It is just so simple and intuitive to me that I simply can’t imagine other people not loving this experience. Staking is even automatic and continuous.

Network – I don’t mean the traditional node infrastructure (although you CAN and I WILL run a participation node). I mean the ALGO network/community itself is a powerful force just starting to wake up, which I expect to have economic consequences over the next 1-2 years. ALGO in general gets a good reputation for all the reasons above, but it also carries a lackluster connotation as a “stablecoin” or “bad tokenomics” or “inflationary” which I feel is to the ALGO investor’s advantage. Upon closer examination, the ALGO participation rewards, accelerated vesting schedule, and governance rewards made a surprising amount of sense to me (really, I was shocked to be convinced of the practicality of all three in conjunction). Taking a neutral stance on tokenomics and reviewing technicals and roadmap, ALGO stands out to me like a shining diamond in a lump of coal. I believe ALGO hodlers have an amazingly low time preference and eye for fundamentals compared to altcoiners in general, because the ALGO tokenomics and lack of pre-marketing act as a qualifier to investors – ALGO is organic chemistry for crypto: it separates those who truly do research and understand fundamentals from those who are good at bullshitting to get a passing grade.

THE STRATEGY: I will employ a self-made strategy I call “stacking limits against a core position.” To start this requires initial acquisition of a core position at some target price. It also requires the unwavering commitment to making profits (no stop losses, no emotional decisions. Do or do not, there is no try here). I may adjust based on market price when funds are received, but the goal will be immediately buy \~25% of the funds into ALGO at any price at $2 or below. From there, some % of the funds will be set at limit buy some % below the current price and step-wise down below that. E.g. start with $10k, buy $2500 into ALGO at $2, $1000 at $1.90, $1000 at $1.85, $1000 at $1.80, and so on, until I am all-in with 100% by $1.50. Then I will stack sells in the reverse order beginning at a 15% profit on each tax lot e.g. sell some at $2.30, then the lot bought at $1.90 gets paired with a sell at $2.25, the $1.85 buy get paired at $2.20, etc. for the same amount (less profit kept as ALGO). If ALGO immediately moves up and I can’t buy in, I start selling, readjust my core position target price, and start over.  I plan to continue this process until I double my ALGO stake or the price of ALGO never drops below $2 again. Either way I’m in good shape. If I double up I will add to my governance stack, add liquidity to tinyman, or take this same strategy over there to use on other ALGO assets and liquidity pools.

Possible Mistakes: I recognize at least two risks/shortfalls I am accepting:

1. ALGO is not truly decentralized. I came to terms with this and accept it on the premise of “use cases exist outside of my preferred use case.” Algorand addresses centralization well and have positioned themselves well as an “institutional grade” asset, even going so far to apparently get a pass as the only crypto muslims are allowed to trade(?).
2. Lack of research into other options. Admittedly I don’t know a lot about certain other projects that could seem just as amazing as ALGO were I to do more homework.

What do you think?

**TL;DR – I am taking a loan to daytrade ALGO and am targeting to double my ALGO stack in 2021-2022 using a passive market-making strategy.**

CHEERS!

CryptoCurrency,The dollar is losing close to 1% of it's value EVERY MONTH. Mass crypto adoption can't come soon enough!,"I just read that the U.S. dollar is losing almost 1 percent of its value every 30 days, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data that was released on Wednesday.

Surprise, surprise. Dollar inflation is at its highest point in years. A measure of the average monthly change in the price for goods and services paid by urban consumers increased 0.9 percent last month, more than doubling September’s 0.4 percent increase.

All together, prices rose 6.2 percent from a year ago,  the biggest year to year increase in over 30 years as inflation grips all markets. 

Food prices increased by 5.3 percent during October, with chain supply issues being felt nation wide. Increases in the cost of housing, energy, consumables, pre-owned and new vehicles, plus fuel prices increased 6.1 percent from 1.2 percent in September.

This substantial, unanimous markup has been caused in part by efforts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to decrease their oil production. The United States has limited oil production substantially alongside President Joe Biden’s wishes to move away from fossil fuels.

Prices on used vehicles have risen 2.5 percent in October from 0.7 percent in September, while new vehicle value changed to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent in September.

An Axios report cites Robert Frick, an economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, “We expected inflation would get worse before it got better, but not this much worse. Particularly painful is the increase in food prices as we approach the holidays, and the rise in energy prices as we plan to travel more to family get-togethers,” 

“However, both those increases are likely to be temporary, and the forecasts that inflation overall will drop next year still seem credible,” he said.

Reporters on Wednesday depicted Biden saying that he’s directed the National Economic Council to focus on lowering energy costs for the U.S based on internal reports. 

Biden was quoted saying “Today’s report shows an increase over last month. Inflation hurts Americans pocketbooks, and reversing this trend is a top priority for me. The largest share of the increase in prices in this report is due to rising energy costs.”

The president claims he directed his top economic aides to “further reduce these costs,” of energy prices, and asked the Federal Trade Commission to handle the “market manipulation or price gouging in this sector.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy threw a jab at the current administration and corporate america earlier this week on the heels of reports that corporations are now showing support for Republicans after the defeat they gave Democrats in the 2021 off-year elections, and likely will be giving campaign money to party lawmakers for favorable legislation

McCarthy tweeted “If Corporate America thinks jumping on the bandwagon after Tuesday’s election and before the impending red wave will make conservatives forget the role they played in subjecting the U.S. to open borders and runaway inflation, they are sorely mistaken.""

The Federal Reserve and White House hold the sentiment that inflation will slow down as the supply chain issues are addressed in the future..

Bitcoin,S&amp;P 500 vs Bitcoin as hedge against inflation,"Let me first off say that I am a bitcoin maximalist and have all my savings in it and have nothing in the S&amp;P 500.

That being said, with the new number for inflation that we received for October adjusted using the pre-1980 method, inflation is at 14%.

The S&amp;P 500 is up 32% and Bitcoin is up 275% from last year.

When debating people who are still speculative about bitcoin, I am not sure what to say when they bring up investing in the S&amp;P 500 because it has been +18% yield against inflation and it is considered a safe investment for them vs Bitcoin.

Now I was listening to a Saylor video and he was saying how the reason the S&amp;P 500 has gone up so much is because of all money that has been printed in the last couple years and it gets funnelled into these top 500 companies or something of that nature. 

If you have a better explanation why the S&amp;P 500 had gone up so much please let me know.

Now when debating someone on which is the better investment, how do I explain to them them Bitcoin is a better investment?

I know it has something to do with inflation and all the money printing the fed is doing, but I’m not educated enough to articulate it.

CryptoCurrency,Utility token vs Security token,"So as more tokens come out I have to ask if we’re all remembering the SEC consideration of security. I see a lot of tokens giving voting rights to holders and also a holding presales without adhering to utility token rules and I’m worried a lot of people are going to get fucked come tax season and when the SEC starts taking a look at some of these new tokens. Are people getting exemptions or just not giving a shit and hoping it works out?

In case you’re curious what I’m talking about....

From: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pPo1dslGCI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pPo1dslGCI)

What is a Utility Token?

Utility tokens are simply app coins or user tokens. They enable future access to the products or services offered by a company. Therefore, utility tokens are not created to be an investment. Just like an electronics dealer might accept orders for a video game that will be released several months later, a startup can create utility tokens and sell digital coupons for the services or products it is developing. A good example is Filecoin, which raised $257 million through the sale of tokens. These tokens will allow users access to its decentralized cloud storage platform.

What is a Security Token?

A security token is a digital asset that derives its value from an external asset that can be traded. Therefore, these tokens are subject to federal laws that govern securities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in severe consequences including penalties and potential derailment of the development of a project.

On the other hand, security tokens can offer a vast array of applications if the startup abides by all the regulatory requirements. The most promising of these features is the ability to offer tokens as a digital representation of shares of a company’s stock.",cryptocurrency

devops,Simplifying AD/SAML/LDAP logins (Authentication Spaghetti),"I'm really not sure where else to post this, so forgive me if it's a bit out of the main scope for this sub. 

Long story short (as best I can) due to companies buying companies, and all of the political issues that ensue, I'm left in a mess, trying to maintain a global platform with no one central piece of authentication. 

* We have a legacy AD domain left over by one company, but the corporate direction is to move away from it. Several key systems still rely on this though. 
* We have Azure AD tenant which works for like 80% of things, but it doesn't help the unix/windows hosts that use the legacy AD for authentication. 
* We have a lot of things tied into Okta (which is federated against our Azure AD) but there's no ability to take user groups into consideration there (unlike LDAP for example). 

This is complicated further by my complete lack of knowledge in this area, the fact that anyone who knew anything has long since quit, no one who remains knows how to set anything up, and we don't have enough resources to properly implement something like Azure AD DS and LDAP-S. 

So, I am in desperate need of some solution that allows me to try and pull it all together, a sort of middle man.

personalfinance,Metro Bank refusing to clear funds (UK),"Apologies if this is the wrong sub don't know where to post. My cousin was working for a delivery company for 6 months and did not get paid this whole time (20k). I've written a very condensed timeliness of events below. Please can someone advise.

Company did not pay wages for 6months (20k) - he raised complaint with ACAS
A few months later they paid full sum into his account at metro
When he tries to access the money its not in there, account frozen and money in ""holding"" 
Metro won't tell him why for like a year
Finally tell him he was being investigated for fraud as it was such a large lump sum and money will be accessible on Monday (this was Dec last year)
Money is not there on Monday
Every week since they've been promising the money will be released but it isn't
He's also had his wages from a new job paid in to a barclays which was also frozen. Upon being cleared of fraud he   closed barclays account and moved everything to metro
Metro will not let him access any money at all despite being cleared of fraud
During this time he has raised multiple complaints with the ombudsman so the total amount owed now is missing wages + new wages + compensation to a total of 60k
Then he tells us that the boss who owed him wages has been convicted of using  bank account to launder money to a foreign country. Cousin also said he was supposed to be a witness at the trial but didn't go (didn't say why)
He's not been able to access his new wages (paid after unfreeze of account) from his job because he opened a new account, transferred the wages over, but then his card never arrived because the FedEx  driver was ill and metro would send a new one - this was like 3 months ago
Now bank is saying they cleared the 60k last week but it didn't go through because it was such a large sum. They are now going to clear 30k Monday and 30k the Monday after that
Cousin has said once it's cleared he will withdraw in cash the entire 60k

personalfinance,Is it feasible to hire a realtor and start viewing houses before my down payment/closing costs are saved?,"**Edit:** Based on the comments I've received so far, it would appear my timeframe for hiring a realtor is not realistic for today's markets. It is/was definitely not my intent to say I was going to hire a realtor just to look at houses months before placing an offer.  


Apologies if this is too far removed from a personal finance question for the sub, couldn't find a much better place to post it.

Next summer, ideally mid June to mid August, I'll be moving out of state (about four hours driving distance). For a lot of personal and financial reasons, I am looking to get out of renting and purchase a home when I move. This will be a stretch financially, but mainly only because of the down payment and not having a lot of cash up front (I'll detail this below).

Overall, I'm aiming to have at least $20,000 in cash available at closing. The big problem is, I only have about $2,500 now, and by time I want to start looking seriously at houses and working with a realtor (2-4 months from now), I'll probably only have about $7,500 available. So, my big question is:

**Will I realistically be able to start this process in a few months, or am I going to get laughed out of offices because the money isn't saved yet?**

Some more specific financial details, in case they're relevant. I currently make $95,000. I Just recently finished paying off a lot of CC debt (completely free and clear of CC debt now) and my salary has grown significantly over the last two years (normal for my occupation), hence why my savings are so low. Free cashflow after bills, food, entertainment, etc. is over $1,700 a month. Current credit score according to Credit Karma is 775. It was up over 800 earlier this year, however I financed a new car which seems to have pulled it down.

Current savings: $2,500Planned savings at time of purchase: $20,000, all from saving free cashflow.Expected house cost: Between $200,000 and $300,000

I also have additional ""backup"" funds not included in the $20,000 down payment above, just as a safety margin, which could be available earlier if necessary:ESPP funds (available mid-march): $2,000Expected tax refund/credit: $3,500 (could be higher, very conservative estimate)Bonus (end of March): $9,000 (before taxes)401k loan (only if necessary): $10,000

I'm aware my down payment will be pretty low and I'll have to pay out PMI, have a higher interest rate, etc. I've worked out all those figures. Only thing I'm not sure about is the timing of having the money and getting approved by lenders, working with a realtor, etc.",finance
stocks,Yields on stocks aren’t keeping up with inflation,"The total earnings return on equities (calculated as the inverse of the P/E ratio plus dividends) are currently negative for the first time in history.

The factors that have produced the current negative return environment: negative real interest rates and stock markets driven to valuation peaks by unjustified investor expectations are major reasons why we view the current risk/reward prospects offered by markets are less than compelling.

The resolution of this problem must involve either a sharp decline by stock markets or an increase in interest rates. The most likely result will be some combination of both. Any scenario will likely eventually produce a significant market decline.

Both macro and micro considerations suggest that we can anticipate a return to a higher volatility investing environment, following the unusually low volatility exhibited by markets over the past decade. Higher volatility will present considerable risks for the unwary, but also great opportunities for the prepared investor.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, November 12, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 12, 2021**

Stocks advanced firmly on Friday, with market participants continuing to balance better-than-expected corporate earnings amid rising inflation. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.75% higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.05%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) broke a three day losing streak to finish 0.51% higher. 

As of Friday’s close, the SPY closed the week 0.4% lower following volatility after the release of the October Consumer Price Index. However, after five consecutive weeks of gains, the market remains marginally below previous all-time highs. The QQQ closed the week 0.91% lower, while the DIA closed the week 0.97% lower.

the Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. 

The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. 

While a rise in inflation was expected, the pace of the increase surprised to the upside. If the pace of increase is not moderated soon, it carries meaningful implications for corporations, consumers, and the Federal Reserve. As input costs rise, companies will pass the increase in cost to consumers to preserve their bottom line, who will be forced to pay the higher prices. The Fed would then be forced to step in and rise interest rates, which will makes the cost to borrow money more expensive, which means people and companies will likely spend less, leading to a fall in demand for goods and services. A rise in interest rates would particularly hurt high P/E tech stocks that have been flying in the last two years, as these companies rely on borrowing to fund their aggressive expansion.

Still, the Federal Reserve and many economists have reaffirmed that the inflationary pressures are transitory, caused by pandemic-era disruptions in global trade and will eventually ease, albeit while likely settling at a higher level than had been present before the pandemic. 

Gabriela Santos, Global Market Strategist at JP Morgan, said “Inflation should moderate. We’re talking about settling at 2%, 2.5% over the course of the next 12 months. So we're still talking about real wage gains, and that's extremely supportive, certainly of people's livelihoods, but also of consumption and hence the economy overall. We do expect a big re-acceleration in growth starting this quarter and throughout next year, \[and\] 5% average growth just over the next three quarters. So we would characterize this not as stagflation, but as reflation. And that difference is, reflation is actually quite good for earnings growth and quite good for the stock market, especially cyclical sectors."" So far, expectations are that the Fed will step in sometime mid-2022 to raise interest rates.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Rivian (RIVN), which is backed by Ford and Amazon,  continue to be on absolute fire. The company, which is expected to lose $1.28 billion on no more than $1 million in revenue this quarter, now has a market cap of more than $100 billion. For perspective, they are now the fourth largest automaker in the world by market cap. I’m not a stickler for valuation, but this is absolute insanity and unsustainable. The company has not started production and is already priced to perfection, which they are bound to hit a snag with. I don’t think this price is sustainable. 
* The University of Michigan’s closely monitored Consumer Sentiment survey showed the consumer sentiment index decreased to 66.8 from 71.7 in October, missing estimates of 72.5. Waning confidence reflects “ an escalating inflation rate and the growing belief among consumers that no effective policies have yet been developed to reduce the damage from surging inflation,” Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement.
* A Snap (SNAP) investor sued the social media company alleging it downplayed how Apple’s (AAPL) change in privacy would affect revenue. Remember, the stock plummeted 25% after an earnings miss, citing Apple’s changes as hampering ad revenue. 
* After more than a decade of explosive growth, China's Singles' Day, the world's biggest online shopping fest, is losing its gloss and bracing for more modest growth in coming years, hurt by a slower economy and tighter regulatory scrutiny. Alibaba (BABA) said on Friday its sales - or gross merchandise value (GMV) - during the 11 day event grew 8.5%, the slowest rate ever and the first time it came under double-digits growth. 
* The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it rejected an exchange-traded fund from VanEck that would have tracked Bitc… spot prices directly. This would have stood in contrast to the ProShares ETF (BITO), which was approved and which only tracks futures rather than prices directly.

investing,Amazon Worker Group in New York Withdraws Petition for Union Election,"A group of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN 1.52% warehouse employees in the New York City borough of Staten Island have withdrawn their petition with the National Labor Relations Board to hold a union election at four company warehouses, a labor board spokeswoman said Friday. 

 The fledgling union, which calls itself the Amazon Labor Union, said it had to withdraw because the labor board, a federal agency that oversees collective bargaining, had communicated that it no longer had adequate support to move forward with an election.

  To meet the requirement, unions typically have to collect signatures from 30% of workers showing support. The change came after many workers who had shown support for a union left the company, according to Chris Smalls, a former Amazon employee who leads the group. He said the union planned to collect more signature cards and refile for an election.  “As soon as we can get enough cards, we’ll resubmit,” he said. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company’s focus “remains on listening directly to our employees and continuously improving on their behalf.”

 The union push in New York is the biggest challenge to Amazon of organized labor since a failed unionization effort earlier this year in Alabama.  It also represents another battle for Amazon at its New York hub. In 2018, Amazon had selected the city as part of its so-called “HQ2’’ development around the same time union leaders had been rallying support for workers to unionize on Staten Island. The union effort fizzled out, though Amazon also abandoned its HQ2 plans in New York.

personalfinance,Ho to do balance transfer to a line of credit?,"Thanks for the very much appreciated platform. 

I would appreciate if anyone could answer or clarify the following question. How can I do balance transfer from a credit card to a line of credit to benefit from 0% interest rate. The potential offer states it's for another credit card. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a credit card with good score and always manage to pay it fully off. It has high credit limit. Also, I have a credit line with the same bank. It's balance approximately 15-16K. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if I get a balance transfer offer with 0% for a few months, can I transfer it to my main credit card that I use. So I will have extra credit in my main credit card. Therefore, the balance would be - few thousands (negative balance). Then once the balance transferred is settled in the main credit card, I will pay my line of credit via the main credit card. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking of this option as the balance transfer offer states it's applicable to other credit card (not to line of credit). Also, I am afraid that it will be considered as cash advances (if they consider the option to transfer it to a line of credit).

The business is located in Chicago, but I work 100% remote in a state with no income tax, and always will. I'm not supposed to be taxed any IL state tax.

My annual pay is $135k, and my first paycheck was supposed to cover my first three weeks of work. It was roughly $8,200. I was taxed (combined with federal, social security, and medicare) about $2,300. 

Trying to break this all down by a daily rate, it appears I worked over four full days over a three week period for basically no money.

CryptoCurrency,Will crypto winter begin after Xmas again?,"The 4 year BTC cycle is looking to revert back to a deep winter once again. 

Traditionally, I'd look to sell down most of my holding ahead of the holiday season. Then start buying again when things are cheap again. 

But what changed significantly is the covid-fuelled recession we had. 

First the deep red share market in March 2020. Some of us bought shares for cheap and made good profits. Some of us even kept buying crypto throughout the end of 2020 when BTC and ETH were creeping back up.

Only for January - February 2021 to be an insane time in the crypto market. NFTs were dominating the headlines with artists making bank with their crypto gains. 

The GameStop fiasco also got more people interested in share and crypto trading. I believe a certain loop.coin is pumping not only because it's a legitimate project but because the GME apes see strong potential in it. 

So what's changed since Covid?

House prices went nuts in most developed countries. Commodity prices boomed. Materials boomed. Chip shortages are being carried on. Hence why the second car market is still insane. Graphic cards and RAM chips have shot up in prices.

Inflation is legitimate and real and according to most investment banks, it'll be the greatest challenge next year. Groceries have increased in costs, timber prices have gone up, car parts have increased, everything is now more expensive. 

On the jobs side, lots of boomers retired. The high costs of air tickets have meant that travel is not at pre-covid levels and border restrictions are still a serious issue. There's a genuine talent shortage all around the world. 

Low interest rates from last year meant businesses and individuals borrowed a fuck ton of cheap money. Stimulus meant a lot of people got money doing nothing really but used it to spend to stimulate the economy. 

So if we zoom out, the share market is overheated. The housing markets are very overheated and now the crypto markets are in full mania phase. 

Shit doesn't look good according to old school boomer economists. Because our global society is living off cheap interest rates, borrowed money, time and over printing of money. 

What will cause shit to give in? Evergrande or the number of illiquid developers in China unable to repay their debts?

You tell me.

personalfinance,"What's most financially sound: stationary tiny house, THOW, or.....???","I own a piece of land that I inherited and want to live on. It's zoned ag, outside of any city limits and has had someone living in a trailer on it indefinitely with no problem. There's electric service, a water hookup, and a composting toilet setup. I currently live in an apartment in town. I bring home \~2k/mo after taxes and health insurance, and my monthly housing and utilities are around 850/mo. If I stay in the apartment I will get a roommate for a while to cut costs. I have 7k saved, no debt, credit score 800+ but not much history.

I'm trying to figure out next steps that will get me in a better financial situation, be prudent for the future of the property, and get me living on the land as soon as I can.

My ideal house would be very small, both for affordability and because I prefer small spaces (and living alone). For the mid-to-long-term, I'm considering either building a permanent house (&lt;400 sq ft) or buying a used tiny house on wheels. I will be in this area for at least 5-10 years but may want to move later. Here's what I'm thinking about…

Permanent house:

* Would plan to DIY as much as possible, but this would still cost considerably more overall and would require knowledge and time. Not even sure what a reasonable budget would be but probably, like, at least 50k and probably closer to 100k, if not more?
* If I did this option, it would take a while to get it built, during which time I would need to keep renting
* Would a regular construction loan work? Could I get one with my income?
* Would this give me equity/be a good long term investment in the same way as a more typically-sized and non-DIY house?
* Would I need to follow building codes to make it a good investment?
* Would it also need to follow codes to get insurance?

Tiny house on wheels:

* Could get one secondhand that someone else has built for \~24k and basically brand new
* If I did this option, I could move onto the land fairly immediately after buying. Would need to take out a loan for most of the cost. (Would try to live with a roommate for a while beforehand and save more down before taking this route.)
* Is it reasonable to think I could get a loan of, say, 17k over 72 mo with my financial situation? Depending on the interest rate (I'm looking at LightStream RV loan at 5.5-10.4%) their website says this would come out to \~280-320 per month. Even with utilities and insurance this seems fairly doable. Ideally would try to save money while living in it and would live there for closer to 10 years.
* Would a credit union be likely to have a better rate than the above?
* I'm aware that they depreciate. However, also seems reasonable to think I could likely have a cost of living at least comparable to renting. If I'm sick of it after 6 years, even if it depreciates and I can only sell it for a few thousand, that's still a few thousand more than I would've had renting…?? Tell me if this is way off base. (But don't try to tell me there won't be broke millennials who want to buy it in a few years lol, we're all getting poorer and housing is only getting more expensive!)
* I know insuring a tiny house can be tricky….if you have had a THOW, what did it cost to insure it and who did you use? (If insuring wasn't possible I don't think I would go this route at all.)
* It could also be nice to have the option of moving it if I move elsewhere, but for the most part the      mobility would just be helpful for the ability to get it set up and move in quicker.

I'm definitely more psyched about the idea of being able to live on the land sooner and not having the hassle of building something myself, but I also know THOWs come with a lot of logistical challenges... 

What would your plan be if you wanted to live cheaply and live on your own land and hopefully have more equity if/when you sold? Which of these would you do, or would you do something else entirely? Anything else I'm not thinking of, and any other options I should consider? Thanks in advance!!!",finance

stocks,Reverse repo clarification,"So in 2021 banks are holding a record sum of 14T dollars on feds reverse repo accounts. Someone point out there is no better use for these money and banks are just waiting for a good buying opportunity. The others state that these money can't be used ordinarily to buy equities because of the restrictions.

If it's the latter then what exactly are those trillions of cash for? In the end all this mass will come to the market meaning a greatest bull run or its a new normal to see these numbers on overnight repo as infinitely increasing US debt?",finance
CryptoCurrency,What cryptocurrencies have the best compounding interest?,"I'm curious to learn what I haven't learned about yet in the world of cryptocurrency. I'm interested in the interest rates and the rate at which said cryptocurrency compounds. I've seen some with outlandish interest rates.. 500%+ are these scams? I would also like to know how you get ahold of these cryptos I.e., certain brokers, wallets, certain blockchains? The more info the better. I love learning about this. 

Simply put this is the future and eventually those who haven't will wake up to the fact that they have to adapt to crypto. I really believe in 2021/2022 we are all still here early.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Don't be bullied by someone else's bull run,"Just because someone has invested in something and seems to be having a bull run doesn't mean that you are definitely going to have the same success or that you should invest, always go with your gut and your research.  I currently know a guy who claims to be making over $500 a week on NFTs and has made ""over 11,000k"" by investing in a particular coin and I am actually fed up of hearing about it because he's using it as a stick to beat me with like to say ""oooooh see what you could have had if you had invested too.""  He sounds exactly like those people who are involved in pyramid schemes and I just don't feel comfortable.

Now before you think that I'm just bitter, it's not that.  I've made some healthy returns by investing in coins I have interest in and established coins such as BTC, ETH and the reason this guy has made so much is that he's invested like 5k plus.  He talks about the money he's made but actually none of it is fiat, it's all value because he trades in some kind of gems but I remember how people couldn't cash out of squid and yet you had people boasting how they were millionaires in the coin but now it's crashed what are they?

I have no interest in NFTs, no interest in the coin he's investing in because having DMOR I don't feel enthused by the numbers and don't think it'll reach a penny let alone a dollar but even if it does I don't mind because I am happy with my investments and I feel confident in them.

I will not be bullied into investing where I don't want to because someone else is trying to pressure me into it.  Just wanted to encourage others who may be feeling pressured in the same way -remember an investment that's good for Warren Buffet isn't necessarily good for you. DYOR is paramount and if your research disagrees with others and you go with that don't let anyone make you feel like an idiot, remember when Harry Markopolos called out Bernie Madoff in the 90s, people made him feel the same way.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Emergency Fund - Staking (UK Residents),"The recent rise in inflation vs the pitiful interest rates provided by fiat banks has got me thinking about my emergency fund, and how I'm losing hundreds of £s a year simply by having my emegency fund stashed away in a traditional bank.

An option would be to move that fiat into a crypto wallet and stake it in a stablecoin for inflation beating returns. However, as far as I'm aware, there isn't a stablecoin pegged to the GBP...

Staking USDC, for example, is therefore the only option but would leave me open to fluctuations in GBP/USD values, and there's obviously the risk of staked crypto not being insured / covered if the exchange or wallet goes byebye. 

Does anyone have any advice / experience of this? Particularly looking at non-US perspective.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Tell me what I'm missing about stablecoins and Gemini Dollar (GUSD) in particular,"Looking for sober/realstic replies, not hype.

So GUSD is offering 8%+ interest on Gemini. This is a ridiculous return on ""cash"", given that cash interest rates aren't topping 1% anywhere. If your goal is steady growth and not speculation, this is an absolute no brainer. But risk premiums are real and there is no free lunch, so I'm very skeptical that I'm missing something big.

Let me break it down how I see it:


* **the Asset:** It is stablecoin so it's tied to the dollar. Not only that but the dollar reserves underlying it are audited by reputable accounting firms frequently.


* **the counterparty:** I probably trust Gemini more than any other exchange as far as fly by night risk. These guys have reputations and name brand recognition, voluntarily took the hard route in registering their exchange through all the appropriate regulatory bodies, and holding themselves to a higher standard.


* **The credit risk:** Currently Gemini uses Genesis as the platform it takes your stablecoin and lends it out on. Genesis lends GUSD on margin to institutional clients (ie I think it's a minimum 4-5mm loan size). They are extremely conservative about margin requirements and margin calls. In the past they have shut down margin lending during turbulent market movements when others have continued lending. And margin loans are generally safe for the lender since they are fully collateralized.


Ok, so when I look at the above, I see very low risk. Yes there is the chance that the market completely implodes somehow and Gemini goes under or Genesis somehow cannot collect collateral on their GUSD loans. But I struggle to imagine the scenario being that realistic. Certainly not as realistic as a junk bond defaulting, which is basically what you'd need to invest in for this level of fixed income return.


So what am I missing? Like I said I don't believe in free lunches.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.

# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.
*****
&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he’s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve’s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.
*****
&gt; “That’s going to be key, outside of that it’s retail sales,” Boockvar said. “I think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s good that they would be on a talking basis,” Boockvar said. “I don’t think anything would come out of it unless there’s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.”
*****
&gt; # Chain store earnings
&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “Walmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,” National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.
*****
&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan’ consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.
*****
&gt; “It’s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,” Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.
*****
&gt; “The trend that we’re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,” Hogan said. “That’s the important thing to focus on.”
*****
&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.
*****
&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.
*****
&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.
*****
&gt; “I think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,” he said. “The good news is demand hasn’t been destroyed. It’s been delayed.” Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.
*****
&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. “What would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things — hubris and debt,” he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of “management gone awry” and many companies restructured their debt.
*****
&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.
*****
&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. “I think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,” he said.

&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th

&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.

&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).

&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).

&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately

&gt; Next week is not only November’s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.

&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful

&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let’s look at some reasons to be thankful.

&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there’s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Although the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.”

&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.

&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we’ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.

&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.

&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour

&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**

&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index—Plans to Make Capital Outlays—moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**

&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**

&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**

&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.

personalfinance,Student Loan Payoff &amp; Credit Score,"Hi everyone,

I’ve saved a lot and have been fortunate enough to be in a position to pay off my federal student loan debt before the pause on interest stops at the end of January and I am so grateful for this. I’m just worried this will negatively impact my credit score, which wouldn’t be a big deal but I’m also planning on finding a new apartment in the Spring. Fyi: My student loans are my oldest accounts. I believe any potential new landlord will want to check my credit score before considering me as a renter and I worry the dip in credit score could affect my chances of getting an apartment. Would the person running my credit see that my credit score went down because I paid off debt?Can anyone that has paid off their student loans please share how much (general range), if any, your credit score went down when you paid off student loans?

Any insight is greatly appreciated. 😊

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing car loan but paying my original monthly?,"Since auto loan interest rates are low, I'm thinking about refinancing to have lower interest rates and lower monthly payments. This is temporary as I am just wanting to build my saving up more quickly, and I'd resume paying my original monthly after I've reached my goal. Is this something that makes sense to do,, so I don't end up making more in interest down the line?

My current interest rate is 2.99, refinance interest rate is 2.29(estimated) but I have excellent credit and would expect for it to be lower 

I have a 5 year loan, 2 years in.

What do you all think?",finance
personalfinance,"Buy new vehicle and reduce insane monthly costs? Buy used? Lease? Not sure the best plan, please advise.","I owe 16500 on my truck. It's a very basic truck, a 2017 Frontier with 90 000kms on the odometer. I bought it new 4.5 years ago. It's basic but a good reliable vehicle, and I love the utility of it. It will be paid off on May 2024. 

However my payments are pretty brutal at 570 a month, and it is insanely hard on gas. It's using a 5 speed transmission designed in 2000s, and best case scenario I get 15L per 100km on the highway. In town I'm getting way worse like 18 - 19L per 100km. 

Turns out the used truck market is wild right now and a Subaru dealership is offering me 26 000 to take it off my hands. So I'm looking at a profit of 10500 (the switch would take place in 2 months when I owe 1000 less on the truck, they will honor their offer even if the market drops off a bit). They had a great smaller SUV that I'm very interested in, it's got a great AWD system (I live in the snowy north) and uses about 7.5 L per 100km. Brand new so totally under warranty, with winter tires thrown in. Interest rate of 1.99 because it's a 2021 and not a 2022. It holds its value extremely well and is considered one of the safest vehicles (my already low insurance will drop 15 bucks a month). 

I'm tempted to roll in my positive equity and  go for it because my monthly payments will drop to 410 dollars over 5 years. I will also half my fuel costs, and it still has some of the utility that's important to me (good for camping, and in the snow). I would be lying if some of the new features like remote start didn't catch my eye too. However I realize that I am overall going to be financing more money, and my car debt will jump to 24 600 if I make the switch. It's more vehicle debt than I have right now, but for the next 2.5 years by driving it instead of the truck I'll be saving between 250 and 300ish a month by reducing payments and literally halving my gas consumption (so approx 8000+ in savings). So in 2.5 years I would owe 12 300 dollars on the SUV and will have saved 8000 in operating costs for the truck. 

I also thought about cashing out and buying used. I'm not opposed to it, but I've been burned pretty bad in the past but buying what should have been a great car (low km Civic) and had some major components crap out on me. Also utility is very valuable to me, I would like to drive in the winter with solid peace of mind and I love camping with my GF (rougher roads, harder to reach places). 

I'm 26 and make 70 000. I do have debt from schooling, and not much help getting started on life etc. It's roughly 13 000. I've been paying into a government pension as well. It's untouchable, but it's valued between 80 000 and 90 000. I'm paying down my debt, but having an extra 250 a month to throw at it would be nice. 

I could also lease and take a check for 10500, and just throw that right at my debt. I didn't check the numbers on doing that but I believe my payment would be between 400 and 500 monthly. In that scenario I'm almost eliminating my debt, and could re-evaluate if I want to buy out the car in 3 years, but I wouldn't own it. 

I'm at a loss. Thankfully it's 2 months before the car arrives, and they've reserved it for me (without downpayment) so I can say I don't want it at any point up until early Jan. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Most friends and family are actively encouraging it, saying it's a great deal and take advantage of the market. Some are pointing out that I'm financing more debt, and questioning if it's actually a good move. I don't know what the right answer is.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Questions about Celsius,"Yesterday I went to transfer some USDC to Celsius for those juicy 10.02% apy gains and it said do to local legislation I was unable to receive coins. Today I checked again and it was just fine working as usual. Does anyone have any information? Was this just a bug? Should I wait and see or move my assets off the platform? I live in North Carolina, USA and as far as I know nothing has changed about the state or federal law including crypto here. Maybe it has to do with that infrastructure bill? Any info would be greatly appreciated. By the way every time I've posted questions or concerns so many of you have been so helpful! I want to thank you in advance because I'm sure I'll get more of the same. Excited for the future in crypto and for this taproot upgrade to finish soon. Hold on for the ride boys and girls. Good luck out there! 

P.S. I also noticed Celsius increased their rates on many coins what's up with that? I love passive income but am weary of the too good to be true scenarios and it's starting to feel that way.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Purpose of 'Intent to Proceed' with lender, when closing is 12+ months away?","I just signed a purchase agreement with a builder. I had to get pre-approved through their preferred lender in order to sign. While they are offering $3,500 off closing costs as the builder's preferred lender, I'm not 100% sure I want to go with them since their interest rate was a fair amount higher than other quotes I have gotten.  Ideally, I would check to see who would offer me the best deal around October 2022, then go with that lender and lock in a rate.

However, I just got notified that I need to sign an 'intent to proceed' document within 10 days, in order to keep their terms.  Since I'm kind of worried about where interest rates will be 12 months from now, I'm hesitant to commit to this one.  Why are they asking me 12 months in advance to commit, when they won't even lock in my rate until next October?  What could be the pros/cons of ignoring this?",finance

stocks,Buybacks and Dividends at Records Amid Confidence,"Company stock buybacks are on pace to **set a new high** in the third quarter, while dividend payments are already at records and could set more in the fourth quarter, a sign that U.S. company management is confident about where the economy is heading, analysts said.

* Buybacks by **S&amp;P 500** companies are around **$204 billion**, on pace to beat the quarterly record set in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.
* Dividend payouts could **surpass $500 billion** in 2021 for the first time, S&amp;P Dow Jones said. The possibility of a 1% federal tax on stock buybacks could encourage companies to shift to dividend payouts to avoid the tax.
* Below-average dividend payout ratios, which measure the percentage of earnings that gets paid in dividends, could also **point to higher dividends** in the future. The current 30% payout ratio lags behind the average of 50% going back to 1900, according to BofA Securities.

investing,Are the declines and corrections sharper during this earnings season? Does that say something about the state of the market?,"Will clarify first that I'm not saying the market is a bubble or that I think we're correcting/crashing. I'm fully allocated, using margin, and have multiple put options sold. So I'm bullish AF if anything.

I'm just wondering if the recent decline this earnings season are steeper than normal. And if so, is it because the market is more frothy?

From my view, a good number of stocks that didn't meet earnings expectations this Q3 seem like they were absolutely eviscerated this earnings season. Fedex, BMBL, TWTR/SNAP, Zillow, Casinos, Draftkings, Lockheed, Uber, pinterest, and more. And I'm wondering if the reason why is because market has been heated and valuations on the hot side. I suspect this is a sign of the froth in the market. Doesn't mean there will be a large correction/crash, but I think there will be stock/sector/industry isolated corrections (technically we have had them since February this year from SPACs &amp; crypto to stay a home plays). 

Wonder if anyone else on r/investing noticed this as well? Or maybe have the stats to prove/disprove my suspicions?",finance
personalfinance,This sub helped me get out of a terrible car lease and now seller becomes buyer. Is it better to buy new or to buy a super cheap used car? I want to avoid being upside down in a loan.,"Used cars are more expensive than ever, so much so that brand new cars end up being just $2k - $3k more.

I want to be able to sell within 1-2 years. I want to have a reliable car. And I need a car sooner rather than later, otherwise I’d just wait it out.

I qualify for a great interest rate (~2%) and would love to pay $15k (or $17.5k max incl. title &amp; fees, ideally). I can afford more, but just want to be frugal if at all possible.

1.) Do I bite the bullet, pay more for new and hope the value holds once the market corrects?

2.) Or do I find the most reliable car possible for under $15k and hope to not be upside down when it comes time to sell?

3.) Something else I’ve not considered?

personalfinance,Buying new home before selling old one,"Hi there,

I'm moving across the country, but don't really have any firm deadlines around when the move occurs (I work remotely, my family just desires to move elsewhere). My understanding is that typically when you move houses, you try to sell your old one to fund the down payment on your new one and put a contingency clause in the contract on the new purchase that your sale goes through (or you move into a short-term rental while looking for a new home).

That sounds like a lot to coordinate with given I'm moving several timezones away, it today occurred to me that I have enough cash (were I to liquidate some stock) to afford the down payment on the new house, and my cash reserves are high enough that I can afford both mortgages for a while. I think it would be much less stressful to purchase, then move, then sell the house once I have settled into the new one.

The downsides I see are that I have to liquidate some stock and pay any capital gains tax on that, and also it is likely that I will have to pay a higher interest rate for the second mortgage. Once I sell the old house, I could of course refinance if the rate would be significantly lower. I'd also be paying two mortgages temporarily.

Am I missing anything that would make this a boneheaded move financially? What I mention above seems worth the reduced stress to me and my family.

Also, would it be difficult to find a lender for the second mortgage for a non-rental property? My credit score fluctuates between 750-800, but my income would just barely cover both mortgages and I'm guessing that pinky swearing to unload the other mortgage probably isn't one of the boxes I can check when applying.

CryptoCurrency,A guide for beginners on how to earn interest on your crypto,"Here's a short guide on how to earn interest on your crypto. Sharing here both to help beginners and also to get feedback on missing gaps:

//

You can earn interest on your crypto often at much higher rates than from a bank (e.g., 2-10% APY vs. 0.5% APY). Stablecoins such as USDC typically offer the highest interest rates and are pegged 1 to 1 to the US dollar, minimizing the risk from crypto price fluctuations.

Popular crypto interest accounts include:

1. [**BlockFi**](https://blockfi.com/): Top US platform with 10+ cryptocurrencies. Pays interest monthly ([rates](https://blockfi.com/rates/)).
2. [**Nexo**](https://nexo.io/earn-crypto): Offers up to 12% APY for 17 cryptocurrencies. Pays interest daily ([rates](https://nexo.io/earn-crypto)).
3. [**Celsius**](https://celsius.network/): Offers up to 17% APY for 14 cryptocurrencies. Pays interest weekly ([rates](https://celsius.network/earn-rewards-on-your-crypto)).
4. [**Gemini**](https://www.gemini.com/earn): Offers up to 8% APY for 20+ cryptocurrencies. Pays interest daily ([rates](https://www.gemini.com/earn))

**Are these accounts safe?**

The platforms above make money by lending out your crypto at even higher rates than what they pay you. They all have millions of users and billions of assets under management.

However, you are taking on more risk with a crypto interest account vs. traditional bank savings:

1. **Crypto interest accounts are not FDIC insured.** These platforms try to manage risk by only lending out your crypto to trusted borrowers.
2. **Regulatory discussions are ongoing.** For example, several US states have [issued cease and desist orders](https://blockfi.com/regulatory-developments/) for BlockFi’s interest accounts.
3. **It could take a few weeks to withdraw your crypto** from your crypto interest account.

In some ways, a traditional bank savings account is risky too because you are losing money over time with the &lt;0.5% APY vs. 6% US inflation. A crypto savings account lets you earn 8-10% APY on stablecoins but there’s no doubt that the risk to your principal is higher.

Another way to earn money on your crypto is through staking (e.g., using your crypto to help confirm other blockchain transactions).

CryptoCurrency,Using theter margin to your advantage,"Everybody knows the problems with tether. Even if you don't hold any tether if tether blows up it will have a huge impact on the whole market and every single crypto will tank. Tether isn't backed 1:1, no official audits and they just printed 4billion worth of USDT which is equivalent to USD in the past 10 days... It isn't certain tether will collapse, nobody knows when or even if BUT the risk can not be ignored and you can actually profit quite nicely from it.

Therefore I propose an idea in which way you can hedge your exposure as well as realise a big profit when tether blows up which is relatively risk free.

First you take out a loan on USDT. You can do this on most exchanges as an example I will use KuCoin.

The daily interest rate is around 0.06%. Now you can buy other crypto with this BUT when USDT blows up this will have an effect on the whole market so you will not make the most amount with this strategy but in the case of it happening USDT will become worthelss anyways so anything borrowed can be repaid for almost nothing and in turn you made a profit anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't want to speculate on realising a higher return before Tether/if Tether blows up you can buy another stablecoin OR asset backed cryptos such as PAXG where you buy Gold. This gives you rights to a certain ounces of Gold depending on your investment and there is a trading pair with USDT and BTC. If market crashes the price of PXG will equalize and you keep your total initial investment. Of course this exposuses you now to Gold prices but with high inflation it generally looks bullish for Gold/Silver. When USDT crashes to 0, everything will tank apart from your Gold investment and when you take out a loan of for example 100k USDT you will keep your 100k worth of gold while your loan will be almost non existant.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Calculating Monthly HELOC payment,"Hi everyone, thanks in advance for your time.

Recently established a HELOC, giving us access to 75K. Not 100% sure I understand how to calculate the monthly payment. Draw period = 10 years, Repayment Period = an additional 20 years (Loan ends in 2051)

Interest Rate: Prime (Currently = 3.25) + Margin (Margin on balances under 50k = -0.256)

Looks like our minimum payment will be the &gt; amount of a) $100 or b) an adjustable payment that will amortize and fully repay the advances outstanding after each billing cycle.

So if, for example, we borrowed $25,000 right now, what would be the math to determine how much we will owe next month? I just calculated $108 a month, at the current rate, if that amount gets amortized over 30 years. Is that how this works? I know the rate is variable, so this number can move.

personalfinance,Buying investment property without spouse?,"Hello, throwaway account for privacy.

My spouse and I recently signed a contract for an investment property, and the close date has been pushed back several times over the last few months (new construction). This may negatively impact our interest rate if our lender decides not to honor our lock-in agreement, which was set to expire after the most recent estimated close date. My spouse is increasingly frustrated with this process (understandable), and has expressed that they may not be interested in moving forward with the purchase if the new rate is higher than our current locked-in rate. I have someone who is interested in becoming a partner on this property and can immediately pay my spouse their half of the non-refundable deposit that was provided at signing. 

My question is, is this a realistic option? Would I be able to protect this investment in the case of a separation/divorce? I have heard of quit claim deeds, but my understanding is that one must be signed both at purchase and at sale. Is the second quit claim signing only necessary if I were to sell while still married? If we divorce while I still own the property, does the initial quit claim cover me or will I need my spouse to agree that they really have no claim? We live in a community property state, but the property is in an equitable distribution state, if that changes anything. 

For what it’s worth, my spouse has agreed that this may be the best option if they aren’t happy with the lender’s response to this. Our incomes are fairly equitable, we are both employed full-time, and we currently share our finances but agreed we would open separate accounts and keep our finances separate if this is the direction things go.

Bitcoin,I just realised why cash isn't worth having,"It hit me the other day that money (fiat) isn't worth having. For now you need it to spend on most things still but holding it is a liability. It's designed to lose its worth, so you have to spend it or buy assets. It's good for the masses to keep it in circulation.

Anyway - the point that dawned on me was this: **It isn't that assets appreciate, it's more that they just don't lose value like cash**. Take a range of asset classes like property, gold, etc. It looks like their value increases, but on average what you're seeing is just what the money you purchased them with *would* be worth if it weren't designed to deflate.

It's not assets increasing in worth - it's the dollars they cost falling in value. They're really just a hedge against inflation. Some better and worse than others.

Monetary policy erodes savings.

The average person can't get an interest rate to beat inflation, and when they do they are taxed on it - even where the real value of their money is *less*.

One of the wonderful things about **bitcoin** is that eventually everyone will be able to have **savings that don't lose value.** People won't have to hand money to a bank or investment fund where the financial industry take their cut.

Imagine millions of people whose savings can be relied upon, where if you do nothing after 2, 5 or 10 years no government or financial institution has robbed them of their value.

CryptoCurrency,How to survive inflation (some advice from a Venezuelan),"Hi guys, as you know I'm Venezuelan living here. 

We had more than 2,000,000% inflation anually in 2019 and I (we) survived.  

Now it has dropped to 1,258% anually and that is a nice number for me (October was only 8%, lowest value in more than 5 years!). Mind you, more than 1,000 % inflation anually seems very good!

So, some (of many) things I recommend:

* You have to get rid as soon as possible of the FIAT that is affected by inflation (I mention this, because here, the Venezuelan Bolivar was the one affected, the other currencies like USD or EURO weren't affected or at least not at that extend)! That means spend if as soon as possible, buying things that you need, will need or things you can store for years or trade later. And yes, spending it could mean purchasing things like gold, silver, ""hard"" currencies (like USD or Euro, in your case we are talking about a collapse of a ""hard"" currency like USD, so this won't be an option) and OF COURSE, cryptocurrencies!
* Bartering is common and you need something to offer, that is why is good to use the soon to be worthless money to stock with nonpershable and useful goods!
* Usually things like cars, lands, houses, warehouse lose value too but not at the same extend or speed than the currency.
* Check the loans and credit card interest rates, these could be a easy way of getting ""free"" money, here being an inflationary country for years, the interest rate for a credit card was 36% and annual inflation was WAY over that value, you could max out your credit cards and pay it months later with some pennies, of course banks didn't liked that so they nerfed the credit. Stil, here we have black VISA and MC credit card with less than 10 USD limit. Of course, here knowing the kind of goverment we have, they didn't let the banks ""adjust"" the old debt to a new interest rate.

There are other tips, but these are the ones I remember now!

Bitcoin,Who is the SEC protecting..?,"The other day the U.S. The Securities Commission (SEC) turned down a proposal for a spot ETF. I know like many of you I am skeptical and when things don’t seem to smell right I ask myself “Who benefits?” and in this case it’s clearly not the consumer. The SEC is charged with protecting retail investors which would make the most plausible kind of ETF to be approved a spot ETF however, the futures ETF was the one that was approved and there are now multiple. The thing about futures ETFs is they don’t end up affecting the underlying assets price much and don’t track the price of bitcoin very closely which causes a disconnect. One can’t help, but realize that by doing this the powers that be are trying to keep the status quo by attempting to put the genie back in the bottle and disrupt bitcoins price discovery. 

WHY THIS MATTERS

Bitcoin is arguably the gateway drug to crypto. I for one got into crypto in 2017 because I heard about bitcoin hitting 10k, but went into altcoins. The bottom line is bitcoin is the poster child for the crypto space and the better it does (at least for now) the more people and institutions come into the space, which is something that is good for all of us for many reasons. I won’t pretend to really understand what's going on at the technical level with spot and futures ETFs. I’m just some millennial PE teacher who in my free time hops around discord servers, lurks on various subreddits and listens to a lot of crypto podcasts. Both Mark Yusko and Plan B who obviously are legends have hinted themselves that there could be foul play here with the SECs decision to embrace futures ETFs. I was inspired by /r WallStreetBets a year ago and it feels like this moment could be the spiritual successor of last year's ape fest. Let's break the glass ceiling, the lid they tried to put on bitcoin. Bitcoin is and represents money for the people, the ability to redistribute wealth, and create a more equitable and censorship resistant future. I am lucky to live in the U.S, a country with its own problems as every other country has theirs. However, one thing I think we can all agree on is that the world isn’t perfect, infact far from it, but there is a step we can take to make it much better for us all. If we all banded together and bought up BTC we could move the price by magnitudes, trigger institutional FOMO (who need to reach certain market caps to invest), blow past silver’s MC perhaps or even get within striking distance of gold’s and tell some powerful people you’ve lost now GTFO. 

Not expecting much out of this, but I at least wanted to try since I’m just getting so fucking fed (pun not intened) up with corruption and want to see something change the world for the better when it so clearly can.",cryptocurrency

My plan is to pay off the $9200 in student loans above 4.68% before January 31st when interest begins to accrue again for federal loans, then minimum payments for the rest. I also want to plan to buy a car in 2022 as my current car is a 2005 and it’s getting older and takes a lot of gas. 

I typically work about 65 hour weeks right now.

Typical 9-5 at a state job. In 2022 I’ll have five years in with the state, at eight years I’m vested and at 60 I would be able to collect a small pension. - I make about $34,000 a year. Moving up is slow. I need to stay with them until  July 2022 or I would owe them $2300 in tuition reimbursement. I also work a weekend job that I really enjoy. My lease will be up at the end of July 2022. 

I buy and sell items on the side which has made me about an extra $6,000 this year. 

In 2022 I’d like to move closer to my parents (same state) and possibly live with them as well since we have a close relationship. Since they live in a resort town, I could work 6 months out of the year and clear about $30,000 and then spend the other 6 months pursuing hobbies such as travel. Although I could try and get another state job and finish out the 3 years to get vested, I could also come back later on down the road and my service year would still count.

personalfinance,Best card for disabled relative?,"TL:DR —What prepaid or debit card would be best and cheapest with virtually no exposure?  

Background: I have a middle-aged family member who, due to brain trauma, has significant dementia and is unable to live independently. She lives in a nursing home and her financial thoughts are very child-like; she falls for scams without a second thought and has little concept of the value of money. (E.g., this week “FedEx” texted or emailed her offering a new iPhone for $1 so she clicked the link to claim it and now wants us to send the dollar so she can have a new phone. She believes it can’t be a scam because FedEx is a large, reputable company)
Unfortunately, she remembers her life as a successful businesswoman and doesn’t understand why she can’t have a debit card, but 100% of her money goes into a trust and is all paid back to the center for her care, with the legal maximum carve-out of $60 for personal items going into an account for her (which is used to pay for her cell phone, sodas, snacks and cigarettes.)   
She also remembers earlier in her disability when her benefits were paid to a debit card and she can’t retain the difference between her situation then and now (she has severe short-term memory impairment as well.)   
I’d like to gift her a small value card to relieve her fixation on the debit card, and ideally be able to reload it occasionally. I’ve looked at banking cards like Chime or Bluebird, but I’m thinking a gift card off the shelf might just be a better option despite the fees and inability to add funds. Whatever it is, needs to be financially isolated from anything else with no opportunity for overdrafts.   
Is there another option? With her current situation she wouldn’t qualify for a bank account and with her financial irresponsibility I definitely won’t tie anything to our accounts. Thanks for any suggestions!!",finance

* This concentrates power into the Federal Reserve to better control the Economy.

**What does this mean in economic terms?**  
The Federal Reserve will be responsible now for all forms of lending within the economy, and control risks associated with the fractional reserve lending system as well as in all forms of investment banks usually make, such as commodities, foreign exchange, derivatives, stocks, private equity, etc. They may however cut some of these off as this is not explicitly clear to me yet.

In times of inflation, she would like the Fed to directly remove money from everyone's accounts at once. So if they wish to reduce money supply by 2%, you would lose 2% of your money, as the prices climb in the supermarket. Is this feasible? Well I'm not so sure, as this only further reduces the purchasing power of the average person when things are getting tough, until inflation comes under control. I'm sure most people would be against this idea anyway. 

**What does this mean for the cryptocurrencies that exist right now?**   
This is the part that remains unclear as her official policy on Bitcoin and Alts remain unclear. What we do know however, is that if an American holds Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency that is not the Fed coin for that matter, the Fed will not be able to take money away from them. They will still be able to effectively reduce the money supply, as the Fed coin that was exchanged for Bitcoin would be reduced, wherever it is, but I'm not sure this is a comfortable idea for the Fed. If one person can do it, what's stopping the American people from all just buying Bitcoin, and having it become widely accepted as a means of payment, taking away the power the Fed just gave itself? The answer you probably already know.

**My opinion: What do I think?**  
Well as you can probably guess, I, as well as many senators, am uncomfortable with the idea, not because it essentially kills all banks, but actually because previously, I would not have felt the decrease of a nation's money supply, as this would normally be done via the purchase and sales of foreign assets, as well as quantitative easing, the issuance and calling of government bonds. Now, under this system, though I am European, I fear for the  American people when they cannot buy a loaf of bread, and all of a sudden have even less money. What would I do? Hope that this is not the direction of the world, possibly lobby against it, and keep stacking what I think is the backbone of the future of finance, Bitcoin. Monetary policy is the only thing cryptocurrencies can't do right now in the economic sense. However, do we need a shield from inflation and deflation in the form of monetary policy? Or can a work around such as a economic disaster relief fund be a decent workaround?   
Either way, it's good to see blockchain finally get some exposure to the modern world. Must be a no-coiner's nightmare.

stocks,Why I believe $MAPS WM Holdings is undervalued,"WM Holdings is in my opinion is misunderstood and undervalued. I have been following the company since February 2021 a few months before it went public via special purpose vehicle financing on 06/10/21. Until recently the stock had a solid level of resistance around $12 and fell to roughly $9. Why is the stock being beaten down? Is this indicative of the company’s performance or overly pessimistic sentiment?  I will dive into my take on this, and why the recent price movement and price trends are not concerning from my perspective.

 
I see the current price as a tremendous opportunity to buy and hold and take advantage of the cannabis industry without any direct exposure to regulations that companies handling the product face, and risk of product oversaturation in markets that growers will face post-legalization or decriminalization on the Federal level. I will speak to federal legalization, but what I mean is any material movement on the federal level, be it decriminalization or delisting as a sch. 1 substance.


Please note, this is not a get rich overnight stock, however, this is a solid stock to get in early on and hold through any movement on the federal side. Hear me out on this, because at the very least you should be watching this company.
 

It is not my intent to discuss the company’s generic background. I am not discussing their history of profitability and YOY growth since 2008. I find given their business resets in the US and Canada, historical sales and earnings are irrelevant outside of the fact that they are an early-market leader and have experience via early establishment in the industry. I am also not diving into the newer management and their autobiographies, as this is all basic qualitative information that is nice to know, but I find it mostly irrelevant, and you can easily find this in the analyst presentations linked at the bottom.

 
Personal Disclosure:

This isn’t financial advice or persuasion. All data provided is presented for discussion and educational purposes only, and most of all is my limited and subjective opinion. This is my personal take on what I believe to be an undervalued company. I believe the company is undervalued due to the companies’ strengths, the lack of understanding on how the company generates sales, and the unreasonable hesitation of investors due to being scared of weed stocks. MAPS is different than most weed stocks, and I’ll explain why.

 
I have watched this stock daily since February 2021, and have kept up with news and analysts presentations. I am not an expert by any means. I personally do not use MAPS  App or website regularly, although I have years ago. I have friends/acquaintances that use the app in the Los Angeles area for personal consumption reasons. My post is in no way sponsored by WM or WM Holdings or of any outside interests. I come from a background in commercial banking and credit underwriting, which is not the same as securities analysis or investment banking, thus this is my unqualified opinion. 


I simply see value in SAAS side of the business, and the stickiness of their products in addition to the competitive advantages offered to the company due to its high liquidity in going public, it’s early entrance into the industry, and it’s placement as an industry leader spearheading legalization efforts. The fact this company had over a decade of consecutive profitability initially caught my attention due to no one else in the cannabis industry having any similar performance or experience.

 
There has been a lot of pessimism around this stock due to the current price movements. I feel like this is just short term, and I am not at all concerned. I have ridden from $29 down to $11.91 with about 4,900 shares in my IRA, and have about 1,200 shares at $13.30 in my brokerage. This is all based on my perceptions alone based on readily available information. Invest at your own risk.

 
1-year Price Targets:

I will link at the end of this post the actual documents/presentations that I have access to.

 
• Piper Sandler - $16.00 (82.85% upside from 11/21/21 low of $8.75)

• JNP - $21.00 (140% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

• Truist - $18.00 (105% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

• Canaccord - $21.00 (140% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

• Average – $18.75 (114% upside from 11/12/21 low of $8.75)

 
 
Let’s start by discussing the obvious cons and get into the pros later. The stock has seen declines in price, and they’re not pretty. I believe this is driven by overly pessimistic market sentiment which is in turn creating opportunities to be taken advantage of. I believe there is an overreaction on future guidance numbers vs the company’s actual strengths and understanding the business cycle. Why panic over a single quarter that hasn’t been realized? Nothings changed in my mind.

 
Why did the Stock Price decline after Q2 earnings release in August 2021?
Q2 was the companies first quarter under it’s belt as a publicly traded company. Q2 Revenues increased 21% to $47mln (55% adjusted YOY growth). Additionally, Adjusted EBITA of $8.5mln was down YOY, and Wall Street was not excited. 2021 Guidance was reaffirmed.
 

• At face value, Q2 information didn’t seem all that exciting for a growth company. However, there are important adjustments to be made to understand the company’s normalized performance. Earnings were down YOY, but this was driven by one-time costs associated with the 06/10/21 merger in addition to prior year inflated earnings discussed below.

• YOY revenue growth of 21% was driven by inflated prior year sales from non-licensed dispensaries. The company conducted a “reset” in its Canadian markets and eliminated ties with all non-licensed dispensaries via delisting from the MAPS marketplace. The company similarly had a reset in US business around 2019. When adjusting YOY growth to account for eliminating prior year illicit sales, the company saw a 55% increase in legitimate growth centered in US markets. This is material since the US market upon any Federal level movement will be much bigger than the Canadian market.

• It is important to note that the biggest difference between Adjusted EBITA and EBITA is that Adjusted EBITA subtracts the Change in fair value of warrant liabilities which was $38mln at 06/30/21. There are other offsetting line items however, this is biggest differentiator between EBITA and Adjusted EBITDA. The company doesn’t pay warrant liabilities until exercised. Until then the liability is based on outstanding warrants and stock price at the time of reporting. Adjusted EBIDTA in my opinion is for discussion purposes to demonstrate what earnings would be if the company paid warrants at that time.

 
Q2 Quick Highlights:

• Revenue: $47mln (21% YOY increase; 55% adjusted)

• Gross Profit Margin: 95.93% (95.21% in prior year)

• Operating Income (loss): ($15mln)

• Net Income: $16.8mln (78.72% YOY increase)

• EBIDTA: $17mln (67.90% YOY increase)

• Adjusted EBITA: $8.5mln (18.27% YOY decline)

• Q2 Monthly Active Users “MAUs”: 12.3mln (75% YOY increase)

• Q2 Average Monthly revenue per paying client: $3,706 (24% YOY increase; 21% adjusted)

• Q2 Average Monthly paying clients: 4,221 (2% YOY decrease; 28% adjusted)

 
Q2 Earnings Release: (https://ir.weedmaps.com/news-releases/news-release-details/wm-technology-inc-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results)
 

Why did the Stock Price decline after Q3 earnings release in November 2021?

Q3 was the companies second quarter as a publicly traded company. Q3 Revenues met guidance and increased 9% YOY to $50.9mln (46% YOY adjusted growth). Additionally, Q3 adjusted EBITA of $10.4mln was down YOY, but exceeded Q3 guidance expectations. The stock fell primarily due to Q4 Guidance which was adjusted downward to $50mln-$52mln revenue expectation ($16mln down from annual FYE 21 guidance of $205mln), and $3mln-$5mln adjusted EBITDA expectations ($17mln down from annual FYE 21 guidance of $50mln).
 

• Stock price fell due to Q4 Guidance adjustments largely based on the decline of Adjusted EBIDTA.

• Legitimate Q3 Revenue grew 46% YOY when excluding sales associated with Canada-based operators who failed to provide a valid license. Gross Profit margin increased to 96%.

• The company’s net income of $49.2mln reflected a 217% YOY increase up from $15.5mln in the prior year. This was primarily driven by $46mln which came from the change in FMV of warrant liabilities. It is important to note that the FMV of warrant liabilities is represented as both income/expense on the companies profit and loss statement, and as a liability and equity item on the balance sheet.

• While guidance on sales and earnings was adjusted downwards, anticipations are still that cash flow will be positive. Additionally, the guidance was for Adjusted EBITDA which is materially impacted by FMV of warrant liabilities which may be dramatically different at 12/31/2021 depending on the factors at that time.

• The company is still highly liquid post acquisition of Sprout, and the parent companies of Cannveya and CannCurrent. This is due to June 2021 special purpose vehicle financing, which is really the only funding they could reasonably obtain, given the listing as a Sch. 1 substance. The intention was to prepare for Federal movement early to obtain an advantage and head start via Mergers, Acquisitions, marketing campaigns, and growth to generate returns.

• The company’s largest liability is centered in Warrant Liabilities which is determined as of the date of the information provided and is impacted by warrants outstanding and stock price at the timing that information is reported. The warrants have a strike of $11.50 and expire after 5-years or if the stock trades at/above $18 for 20/30 trading days.
 

Q3 Quick Highlights:

• Revenue: $50.8mln (9% YOY increase; 46% adjusted)

• Gross Profit Margin: 96% (95.47% in prior year)

• Operating Income (loss): $4mln

• Net Income: $49.2mln (216.84% YOY increase)

• EBIDTA: $50.5mln (206.14% YOY increase)

• Adjusted EBITA: $10.4mln (36.96% YOY decline)

• Q3 Monthly Active Users “MAUs”: 13.9mln (37% YOY increase)

• Q3 Average Monthly revenue per paying client: $3,817 (7% YOY increase; 18% adjusted)

• Q3 Average Monthly paying clients: 4,444 (2% YOY decrease; 24% adjusted)

Alright, now that we have discussed the last two quarters, why the price has fallen, adjustments that should be considered, it’s time I substantiate my opinion.
 

Services &amp; Revenue Generation:

 
1. WM Holdings source of revenue and product offerings:

The market has been overly pessimistic about MAPS since the start. Initially when the company announced it’s intention to go public via Silver Spike, I recall reading articles that spoke to it simply being an overvalued listing service. I feel this is a gross misrepresentation of the company’s potential and a lack of understanding on how the company generates revenues. There are two sides to the company’s revenue generation. WM Holdings generates approximately 77% of sales from various advertising products (Maps Market place, app &amp; website), and the remainder comes from selling subscriptions to SAAS solutions for businesses. It offers both B2B (Business to business) and B2C (Business to client) solutions.

 
• Q1 2021 revenue = 55% featured listings, 23% SAAS subscriptions, 22% nearby listings, promoted deals.

 
• Advertising Breakdown:

1. Futured Listings allows for clients to drive additional traffic to their site through prominent placement on the WM marketplace. Keywords are priced at $0.49 per click which is attractive relative to industry comparisons. This currently accounts for 55% of total MAPS revenue in Q1 of 2021.

2. Nearby listings allow retailers to increase presence in adjacent regions/markets.

3. Promoted deals allows for retailers to showcase discounts and promotions through the MAPS deals page

4. Display advertising allows banners throughout the WM website

 
• SAAS Business Breakdown:

1. WM Marketplace is the product most are familiar with, which consists of the company’s website and Android/IOS apps.

2. WM Pages is a listing page with product menu where clients can also provide license information, hours of operation, contact info, discount policies, and other information.

3. WM Orders provides reservation of products for pickup or delivery which allows retailers to confirm availability of products, complete orders, and process payments. (The latter two occurring outside of WM listings marketplace)

4. WM Dispatch is logistics and fulfillment software that allow for real-time routing for legally compliant delivery and tracking of product.

5. WM Retail is a retail point-of-sale system providing inventory management and compliance reporting functionality. The POS system is integrated with WM Pages and WM Orders.

6. WM Dashboard provides data analytics. More specifically, it provides insight on user data and traffic trends on a client’s listing page.

7. WM Store is an orders and menu embed that allows retailers to import their listing menu or WM orders to their own white-labeled WM store website or external third party site. This allows retail businesses to manage their online presence, inventory, and compliance workflows on the WM website and separately branded sites. This does not include product availability confirmation, final order entry, order fulfillment, or payment processing solutions.

8. WM Exchange provides access to the online wholesale exchange allowing retailers to explore brand catalogs and identify wholesalers in order to obtain inventory and manage customer relationships and wholesale operations.  Additionally, this solution offers compliance features such as invoice and transportation manifest generation and recordkeeping. WM Exchange is presently available in California, Oklahoma, Michigan, Maryland, Missouri, and Maine with future plans for expansion as allowed.

 
2. Competition:

Competition such as Leafly, Dutchie, and others only target specific products that WM Holdings offers. While Leafly enjoys the same amount of Monthly Active Users, MAPS appears to be monetizing at a higher rate with a targeted audience more weighted on the west coast.

 
Competition does not provide all of the same business solutions, but most importantly, do not offer a marketplace which differentiates WM. The company’s competitive advantage is quite simple in that it provides a wholistic and comprehensive approach for the cost, compared to any technology solution provider in the industry, which provides more value. Additionally, they provide retailers compliance tools which is a key competitive advantage.

 
The company’s time in the industry has positioned it well for post-legalization/decriminalization. They have been spearheading lobbying and legalization efforts which will benefit them.

There has been concern about Google or Facebook entering the game, however this is doubtful as proposed legislations in both sides of the aisle thus far have retained current restrictions on cannabis advertising.  If anything it would be most likely that MAPS will be bought by a competitor as M&amp;A follows decriminalization or legalization.

 
JNP provided the following information from 5 customer relationships

• 100% of WM customers indicated low odds of switching vendors

• 100% of WM customers picked WM over the competition due to performance

• 100% of WM customers also evaluated Leafly

• 80% of WM customers indicated spending with WM would increase in the next 12 months

 
3. Legalization Trends:

People always talk about how this industry is highly regulated, which is pretty obvious, but also doesn’t mean much at the same time for a company that isn’t touching product directly. As a SAAS company, WM Holdings doesn’t directly touch product, thus they are not regulated in the same sense as a grower/retailer. (Does Square fall under food handling regulations and risks? Does Grubhub? No! They simply service the industry) 


Additionally, CEO Chris Beals has indicated the company will never ger involved with direct handling the product due to the headache of risk and compliance on city, county, and state, and federal levels. This insulates the company from the industry as a service company. It’s also the hurdles Amazon has to overcome if they want to ship the product.

 
It is important to note that the DOJ withdrew its prior subpoena and does not intend to pursue further investigation into the matter. In September 2019, WM Holdings received a grand-jury subpoena from the DOJ which was related to the company’s prior listing of unlicensed dispensaries. The company had conducted a business “reset” to delist illicit or non-licensed retailers, similar to what it has done in Canada.

 
• Present trends are favorable for the legal environment with the most recent development being a GOP sponsored bill for a way forward on the federal level. This is huge since this is the first time the GOP has been willing to discuss a path forward. For the last decade, the same bills have been proposed only to die in the senate. This has changed, and both sides are at least open to discussion.

• Prior top justice officials from the DOJ (highest ranking law officials in the nation) have discussed the great potential of legalization, and their expectations of this occurring. This information is available online via news articles.

• The supreme court, while it did not directly rule on legalization, Justice Thomas in his dissent in June 2021 questioned the listing as a sch. 1 substance while every attorney general over the last decade or so saying they would not enforce. He stated that this was inherently contradictory, and Justice Thomas questioned the point of even listing it as an illicit substance when enforcement was not followed through on.

• Recent studies have shown that the majority of US adults now favor legalization for both medical and recreational use. Record breaking tax revenue and product usage was reported in 2020, with trends indicating increase in these areas. This has led states sitting on the sidelines to now become interested in their own way towards legalization.

• While there is concern about Amazon or Google competing upon federal movement forward, this seems doubtful based on current proposed legislation, and management’s prior comments. The company isn’t getting into logistics due to the headache of compliance. Additionally, so far proposed legislations on both sides restrict advertising, which is in WM’s favor, and will prevent Google or Facebook from competing. Amazon has made political contributions for lobbying efforts, however given the size of Amazon and their historical donations, this doesn’t seem as serious as it could be.


 
4. Valuation Assumptions:

Many of the price target estimates are based on unrealistic conditions that penalize the stock.  This also includes the companies initial guidance projections which did not include recently legalized states. Many do not include 2020 election results or subsequent legalization that has taken place. Many also ignore any future legalization whatsoever for base case discussion and apply arbitrary industry discounts as high as 20%, because they claim that investors are too worried to invest in MAPS due to cannabis risk, thus investment supply is short. 


I find this laughable, considering I do not see any cannabis related risks to this company. They do not handle the product directly, the DOJ dropped its subpoena, and if there was any period to be concerned it was the company’s first 8-year from 2008-2016 when California had yet to even legalize with Prop 64.  For MAPS to be in trouble, their dispensary or retail clients would have to go under. 
 

• Piper Sandler Base Case scenario of a $50bln US market assumes no regulatory changes, and no further legalization is achieved through 2030.

• Key Assumptions for some of the analysists assume no new states legalizing in 2021-2022, new states tricking in 2023 and onwards, and no federal legalization through 2030.

• Arbitrary industry discounts such as 20% due to industry risks. Many of the analysts utilize 15%-16% discounts.

 
 
Conclusion:
 

I see this company as the leading SAAS for the cannabis industry. It has us consistent performance and has gained a lot of experience over the years, but it’s gross profit margins are insane. I have yet to see a cannabis related company achieve their same metrics (MAPS is quasi-cannabis in my mind since it is a service company). 


Acquisition of Sprout for its client relationship management functionality is a positive sign in my opinion. They’re positioning to take advantage of states that are legalizing ahead of the curve.


MAPS has no risk in terms of regulation. The DOJ dropped its subpoena, and there is no more risk on that front. They do not handle cannabis directly they simply provide software solutions and advertising solutions to the industry.


Cannabis product differentiation doesn’t really exist. It’s similar to produce, you don’t buy fruits and vegetables because of loyalty to the farm that grew them (unless you know some farmers personally), because there is no differentiation between end user products. As such, growers are price takers. This makes them reliant upon MAPS as consumers have no brand loyalty to cannabis products. Traffic to dispensaries tends to be by foot, and convenience. MAPS benefits here since consumers use their listing services to find what the hell is nearby. MAPS has dominated the fractured California market because of the lack of brand recognition, and I anticipate them doing the same elsewhere due to their favorable client ratings. Clients even admit even though they aren’t the cheapest they provide the most value, especially with their assistance with legal compliance.


Additionally, no one else can really compare to what MAPS is offering. No one is providing vertically integrated solutions on the same scale, and in a manner that communicates across products. MAPS products work with one another and provide a lot of data points to wholesale and retail operations. This will put maps ahead of the competition who compete on a smaller scale against specific products. With MAPS dominance, it’s hard for businesses to leave. Their products are sticky and the more a retailer has, the harder it is to leave. They aren’t even monitoring their database yet.


The company’s unique strengths combined with their profitability and growth are material to me. Their monthly average users, and average clients are increasing quarter over quarter. Sales continue to increase as well. 


Everyone recently panicked over expectations of a single quarter yet to be realized. FYE 22 is projected to still be profitable, and I think it’s ridiculous to freak out over a single quarter for a company with so much potential. This hasn’t made the company insolvent or illiquid, they are very much liquid and capable of further growth and M&amp;A. As far as I’m concerned their prospects are unchanged. 


It is important however, from a stock price perspective to keep in mind warrant dilution. Once the stock is $18 for 20/30 days that could impact shares. I don’t know what the impact will be. I have heard rumors about the shares being in short supply based on the initial offering, and how many insiders own them. Although I cannot substantiate it, what I heard was that if there was a huge run in this stock the low float would drive up the price. I can’t speak to this, the YouTube video is no longer posted from what I can see. 


However, I do recall hearing about notable short interest on this stock. I’ve seen a lot of large volume after hours purchases, especially around the $12-$14 range. This stock typically runs on low volume. It has done so with the exception of 11/12/21. 4K shares driving the price up/down a lot. $12 was the floor of resistance for a long time and anytime it fell below it would shoot back up. Seemed to bounce between $12-$15 range for a long time. No idea if this helps, just my personal observations. I believe any price under $15 is solid, anything under $12 is killer. Considering the current price is hovering above $9, and warrant strike price is $11.50, I’d say it’s a hell of a deal right now, just in time for Black Friday.

Being able to talk and recruit demons, regardless of purpose, is fun and interesting, and the demon fusion is also really in depth and fun. Moon system is taking a bit to learn, but making demons harder or easier to talk to depending on the moon is a nice touch, as well as using demons in your party as tools to avoid a confrontation with the same enemy. I also like that talking can net you either a new demon or avoid a fight entirely, which can get them to join you and/or back off entirely if you bribe them enough. Demons can even talk to you at the start of a fight as well, typically just bribing you. It's a really fun system and unlike anything i've seen in an RPG. The level of interactivity makes Undertale just seem...... not at all revolutionary or unique. (Sorry.)

There are also Abscess battles which let you fight beefed up demons in return for Apotheosis bonuses you can get with Glory, which you get from finding once off deposits and certain Miman creatures in the overworld.

It's really just a blast of the past, and honestly feels just like the old JRPGs i'd used to play when i was 12. Even at 24, i can still enjoy these, thankfully, and i'm not really that into slow paced strategy games. I dropped many of the Final Fantasies pretty quick, i didn't even get far in Persona 3 due to all the fluff dialogue and the Tired mechanic which gated my progression. (On hard mode, this fucking sucked for me cuz i couldn't progress a whole lot early on. Then again, i did try to stick with Orpheus, so...... yeah. Even 19 year old me was an idiot.) And while i liked Chrono Trigger and got a decent way into it, i just can't seem to enjoy it anymore when i try to go back.

It has the right blend of entertaining RPG and Pokemon/Digimon style monster building, and as well the difficulty of it all keeps me from getting too lax, but it's not bad enough that i feel like i can't get anywhere. The Press Turn mechanic gives some nice rewards for using mechanics in your favor, and enemies can use this system against you as well, so battles play out far more deliberately by stacking the mechanics in a way that benefit you and detriment the enemy.

In all, it's really damn fun. My only problem currently is the fusion menu. Like, if Dyad fusion and Reverse Fusion give me the same demon, why do Reverse Fusion? Why is Special Fusion showing me only one demon i can't see or even get to make so early in the game? What the fuck does the Compendium do for me? Also the animation for the fusion is just nothing short of glorious.

Aside from the pop in, aliasing and shadows, this game looks absolutely beautiful on the Switch. And that game over animation? Absolutely eye opening.

I love this game, and i'm really itching to go back and play the others now.",technology
solar,Why am I hesitant?,"I’m convinced it is time to go solar but I can’t seem to commit. I had signed up for several consults and only one company followed through with a meeting.

solar,"Solar loans are a rip off, take it from a solar sales consultant. (U.S.)","Throwaway bc of confidentiality agreement.

I am currently looking for new jobs because after taking a deeper look at the pricing breakdown for solar loans through lenders such as Sunlight Financial, GoodLeap, and Mosaic I have realized that the homeowners who finance their systems through these lenders are getting absolutely screwed.

Let me give you an example. A homeowner I recently closed had a total financed amount of $38k. The terms on his loan were 20 years at .5% apr through Sunlight Financial. If he had paid for the system in cash, his total system cost would have only been $27k. 

Thats right folks. Sunlight Financial charged this man a “dealer fee”/origination fee of 29%! That comes in right at $11,000! Just for processing the loan! I checked out the other financing options we offer such as GoodLeap and Mosaic, and all of these lenders charged a dealer fee anywhere from 25-31%! 

Obviously this homeowner, as well as thousands of others have no idea that a huge chunk of this total financed amount was actually a dealer fee, because the price they are pitched does not show the breakdown of what the money is going towards.

These lenders lure in customers with incredibly low interest rates, but little do they know that the real profit is coming from these almost criminal origination fees. Essentially what they are doing is taking advantage of the 26% federal income tax credit in order to capitalize off of the tax savings that homeowners get to claim. In the end, homeowners wind up paying right around MSRP or even more because all of the tax savings are negated by the lender.

My word of advice is under no circumstance should you finance your system through the lender that your solar installer recommends. Nearly all solar installers in US use these lenders and I suspect they are receiving kickbacks in a similar fashion to car dealerships offering their preferred financing plans. 

Instead consider either paying in cash, or using your own financing through a home improvement loan, or home equity loan. While the interest rates on these loans are a little higher, the origination/dealer fee will only be around 5-10%.

1) Partial Claim: Interest free junior lien that isn't due until the mortgage matures, is paid off, or the house is sold. Total missed amount:  $19,134.87 - this would be the amount of the partial claim.

2) Recovery Modification: brings the account current by modifying the terms of the loan and reducing the monthly payment. My loan servicer doesn't make it clear what the terms of the modification would be - I imagine it would be 360 months (30 years), and possibly a lower interest rate?

3) Recovery Non-Occupant Modification: brings the account current by modifying the terms of the loan. Any amounts owed are added to the loan balance. Loan term will be extended and rate will be reduced. \*\*I'm not sure how this option is any different from the normal modification...\*\*

Note: I am looking to begin working in December or January, and currently have $3,500 in savings that should hold me until the new year. I am not currently residing in the house - I have been in addiction treatment this year and am currently living in a recovery house about 1 hour away. I am looking to rent this property out while I continue living in a sober house after the forbearance is over.

Can someone help to explain these three options a little bit? I'm not sure what I should do. I think I'd like for the normal mortgage payments to resume, and the $19,134.87 be added onto the loan. What would the difference in having that amount in a junior lien (partial claim) VS. modifying the loan? And is there anything to gain/lose by going the Non-Occupant modification route?

Forex,Fundamental based trade #7,"Hey friends,

Every now and then I post some quality content in this subreddit to get a few people away from ""technicals"".

My last trade went down the drain because the RBNZ actually didn't raise the interest rate because of a few Covid cases. Then in the next Monetary Policy Meeting they did rise. You can find everything else in the comments of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

My next trade for next week is the NZDCHF.

NZD because the RBNZ is the only central bank from the G8 that has already gone into the rate hike cycle. It is also the third fastest growing country in the G8.

&amp;#x200B;

[New Zealand has the highstes 2y bond yields among the G8 and is also increasing indicating that their interest rate is high and will also increase in the future.](https://preview.redd.it/9oko9ijfdj181.png?width=405&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97c96befe6f20d77c41ea6b65f115175d001f6dd)

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's talk about why NZDCHF has fallen so much since October 20 even though New Zealand is growing economically and RBNZ is very hawkish.

You may have heard that there are cyclical currencies just as there are safe haven currencies. AUD and NZD are among the cyclical currencies. When the world economy is growing, Australia and New Zealand benefit the most. When it weakens, they are also the most vulnerable. They are high beta (very volatile) because they are commodity driven. Similarly, but not as strongly, this is also true for Canada.

So if we look at how the Corona infections are developing around the world, then we can make trading decisions that can be very profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

[Copper \(seen as a barometer for the global economy\) had its high on October 20 and fell thereafter \(purple\). After that, the 10-year government bond yields of 5 of the G8 countries fell \(blue\). Last, the SPX came down a bit \(candle sticks\). NZDCHF is in red.](https://preview.redd.it/r095r9zhdj181.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eba0f9ca29570a990d058206bcf7fbb31fc166a)

&amp;#x200B;

There is a very high correlation between the AUDJPY and the corona infections in the world ([see my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/p9jh6n/fundamental_based_trade_6/)).

&amp;#x200B;

[Since October 20, safe havens performed the best and cyclicals \(with the pound together because of poor economy\) fell the most.](https://preview.redd.it/g9ym7tikdj181.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=395abe64066254c8e47ca724f40dcb85e799e200)

&amp;#x200B;

[Exactly on October 20, the infections started to increase. Market participants saw this as a risk to the global economy and priced it into all markets \(commodities, bonds, stocks and currencies\).](https://preview.redd.it/esfgllnmdj181.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abfe0f596fc8a7caf9b77338fc0eee8ab04fcfcb)

As mentioned before NZD is one of the cyclical currencies and it is so interesting (than e.g. AUD) because the RBNZ is very hawkish. CHF on the other hand is the weakest currency of the safe havens. Why actually, when Switzerland is doing better economically than Japan? Quite simply, from the SNB we know from their last meeting that they do not plan to change anything on interest rates in the next 3 years (and probably beyond). The same is true for Japan. The only difference is that there is higher inflation in Switzerland than in Japan. Inflation means that the currency depreciates in purchasing power. Inflation in New Zealand is 4.9% and very high compared to Japan at 0.2% and Switzerland at 1.2%. However, the New Zealand dollar is appreciating because we know from the RBNZ that a strong economy and high inflation leads to an increase in the interest rate. Interest rates are always the price of money. If you want to borrow money, it is currently more expensive to borrow New Zealand dollars than Swiss francs. Therefore, it does not matter if the New Zealand dollar depreciates in purchasing power (unless inflation is so high that a high interest rate does not compensate).

My bet is the following, I assume a recovery of the downtrend (albeit short term). Infections will probably rise to a new wave, but as long as I don't see it in the economic data, it might turn out less bad. Market participants of course see rising infections and want to predict something. They could also be wrong. After all, we have a lot of vaccinated people.

&amp;#x200B;

[We also see that some markets are stabilizing again. Copper has made an upward breakout \(purple\). The NZ yields are rising again \(green\) and SPX also pretty much makes up for the losses \(yellow\). The candle sticks represent the NZDCHF.](https://preview.redd.it/9fybpbyodj181.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=458bbd619f7026de4b217066d4e5ad7bbd210550)

**As long as I don't see a risk-off that pulls the cyclicals back down, I'm long.**

&amp;#x200B;

[This could be a potential long. TP and SL are according to the volume profile.](https://preview.redd.it/1oo7kklrdj181.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a90ea68421ec06395048b726f6f6c40ea5d7f8c2)

A person familiar with the situation stated on Thursday that certain bondholders of China Evergrande Group have received coupon payments from the embattled property developer, easing concerns about a possibly destabilising default.

Earlier this week, Chinese news site Callanish reported that many bondholders had received interest payments from three bond tranches that owed **a total of more than $148 million in interest payments due last month but had a grace period that ended on Wednesday.**

Because they were not authorized to speak to the media, the source declined to be identified. A request for comment from Evergrande was not returned.

Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, has been missing deadlines in recent weeks as it deals with **more than $300 billion in liabilities, $19 billion of which are international market bonds.**

Failure to pay would have resulted in the company's formal default and triggered cross-default provisions for other Evergrande dollar debts, aggravating the world's second-largest economy's debt problem.

Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed shares had risen more than 9% by mid-morning on the news that the latest deadline had been reached. A financial crisis has weighed on the sector, threatening hundreds of projects, and the corporation, which also has **coupon payments totaling more than $255 million due on December 28**, has come under strain.

The market is also keeping an eye on rival **Kaisa Group**, which has $59 million in coupon payments due on Thursday and Friday. After Evergrande, Kaisa has the biggest offshore debt of any Chinese developer. Kaisa, which has missed a payment on a wealth management product, was **downgraded by S&amp;P to “CCC-” from “CCC+” with a negative outlook on Thursday**, following a similar action by Moody’s.

The rating agency said Kaisa’s liquidity appears to be depleted, and it expects a default scenario is inevitable within the next six months. China’s property woes have rattled global markets since September despite Beijing’s efforts to reassure markets the crisis would not be allowed to spiral out of control. Regulators and government think-tanks have held meetings with developers in the past few weeks, and the market is expecting some easing in credit and housing policies to prevent a hard landing of the sector.

**Besides, the Federal Reserve warned on Monday that stress in China's real estate sector ""poses considerable risk to the US financial system."" See details on** [**westmoney**](https://www.westmoney10.com/share/stocknewsdetail?lang=zh&amp;id=909766865776152576&amp;color=1&amp;wm=reddit)

I'm just wondering if it would be better to lease or buy. I'm leaning towards leasing since she doesn't like driving but I also want to make the best decision for us financially. We bought our last car a little over a year ago with a 2.5% interest rate and I have a credit score in the high 700s shes in the 800s. Any advice on which would be best would be lovely. Thank you!

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano. [https://twitter.com/seal\_kiman/status/1443593563846193155](https://twitter.com/seal_kiman/status/1443593563846193155)

3. Wow! It’s looking like Meld has landed a partnership with a mobile provider in Nigeria with nine million customers. Not many details out at this point (Sept 30). But, that certainly sounds like it could be gigantic. [https://twitter.com/MELD\_labs/status/1443548879966949382](https://twitter.com/MELD_labs/status/1443548879966949382)

5. Grayscale releases a report on Cardano which shocks many due to its (actually) fair reporting. [https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1443625454146097152](https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1443625454146097152) [https://twitter.com/cardano\_whale/status/1443786596721967104](https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1443786596721967104)
6. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It’s notable that Cardano’s Djed solves this. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-seeks-to-regulate-stablecoin-issuers-as-banks-11633103156](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-seeks-to-regulate-stablecoin-issuers-as-banks-11633103156)

8. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM. [https://twitter.com/thr33strikes/status/1444898320070086659](https://twitter.com/thr33strikes/status/1444898320070086659)
9. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a “what if” scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised. [https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1445059673401528328](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1445059673401528328)
10. The so-called “Pandora Papers” reveal globally widespread cases of wealth concealment by public officials and bring up the question of whether blockchains like Cardano should take this into account when dealing with nation-state regimes as partners. [https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/)
11. Remember! There is no mobile Daedalus wallet. There is no browser extension version of Daedalus. These are fakes! They will steal your ADA. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853)

16. The New York Times is now talking about the difficult balancing act the Fed has before it with high inflation and less than promising jobs data creating conflicting priorities.

17. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle. [https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1445465912375590913](https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1445465912375590913) [https://emmer.house.gov/2021/7/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-provide-certainty-for-digital-assets-under-securities-law](https://emmer.house.gov/2021/7/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-provide-certainty-for-digital-assets-under-securities-law)
18. Caitlin Long revisits the articles she wrote years ago about fears of circulation credit in crypto markets. Spoiler: it came and crypto did it to itself. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1446874905241210880](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1446874905241210880)
19. COTI is a licensed payment institution in Singapore. This could get very interesting given their status as the issuer of Djed and the ongoing Monetary Authority of Singapore Blockchain Challenge in which Cardano is a finalist. [https://cotinetwork.medium.com/coti-lists-as-a-payment-institution-in-singapore-666c6fcaaab4](https://cotinetwork.medium.com/coti-lists-as-a-payment-institution-in-singapore-666c6fcaaab4)

21. Cardano isn’t wrong about Africa. It’s just first. Google is investing $1 Billion in African internet access over the next five years. [https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/) [https://twitter.com/ghostchainer/status/1445964578257395714](https://twitter.com/ghostchainer/status/1445964578257395714)

26. Coinbase is launching an NFT market. How will this impact the CNFT scene? Coinbase tells us: “...initial launch will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards with multi-chain support planned soon after.” [https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html)
27. Eric Rosengren (who recently left the Boston Fed) let’s us know that the Fed/MIT CBDC project is pretty far along and will release a working paper soon. This would obviously be impactful for all of crypto and for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/ivqFo9C2Jdo?t=409](https://youtu.be/ivqFo9C2Jdo?t=409)
28. The first project that actually looks like it may one day be a virtual world launches on Cardano and it already has a community built parcel explorer. [https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/](https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/)
29. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa. [https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830](https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830) [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08)

36. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan Müller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we’ll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)
37. Here’s video of the Fireside chat with Charles, Dynal Patel, and John O’Connor at the Cape Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative in South Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmuJFc5Qrr4&amp;t)

42. In the Cap Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative Fireside Q&amp;A, Charles mentioned he is talking to Colossol Labs about the possibility of having the Mammoth DeExtinction Project take place on his bison ranch.

stocks,Are stocks a viable alternative to savings accounts in 2021?,"So it's 2021 and the interest rates of UK savings accounts are absolutely rubbish. 

I had taken out a loan for home improvements and have about £8k sitting spare with about 3% interest on it.

The sensible answer is giving it back to the bank, however looking at the stable growth of companies like Google/Microsoft/Nvidia I think if there's a real argument for putting this money into stocks and seeing comfortable returns on the investment higher than the rate of interest I'm paying.

The stock market is always talked about as 'risky' but these behemoth companies have had zero set back by the pandemic and if anything have boomed in the last year.

Of course compared to savings accounts there is a risk of a market crash and losing money and so the relative risk is much higher, but the actual risk I would posit to be actually quite low, yes past performance is not a predictor of future growth but come on, Microsoft/Google are not going anywhere anytime soon short of world war three breaking out.

CryptoCurrency,Do you borrow money to HODL crypto? What interest rate on a loan is still profitable?,"I was always skeptical about borrowing money for investments. So far I have all my debts paid, but seeing the double digits % returns on staking cryptocurrencies or 6-9% on USDT locked savings it makes me wonder if it can be profitable.

If I can borrow at 4% and get relatively safely 9% (on USDT), that is not only 5% profit, but 5% on money that I don't even own...

Also buying BTC/ETH and staking it and paying interest on my loan from staking distributions could work.

Or am I missing something?

Share your strategy if you have one.

EDIT:

Appreciate all the comments here. I have other investments, mainly in stocks, which I can quickly liquidate if anything goes wrong and I need to pay this debt.

But the image that I can have 5% profit basically for free is appealing.

It seems to me that ""never borrow to invest"" is more like a rhetorical quote than actual advice.

How different is this from ""normal"" crypto investing? In the case of your money/borrowed money, it is just the 4% difference which is lost when in worst case scenario occurs ( 100% of my investment is lost - which is not likely when speaking about USDT, BTC, ETH)",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"Congratulations you kind people! Scottish Animal Rescue Receives $118,000 Cryptocurrency Donation via Pawthereum","Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home is celebrating the biggest known cryptocurrency donation in Scottish history.

The Home has been gifted 26 Ethereum, (approximately $118,000USD or £87,000GBP) by Pawthereum, a community-run charity cryptocurrency project focussed on supporting animal welfare organisations and being a digital advocate for animals in need. The donation has been given to fund the Home’s Pet Foodbank service, Paws Pantry, for the whole of 2022.

Paws Pantry initiative aims to tackle pet poverty in Scotland, one of the leading causes of pet surrender. Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home works with 52 foodbanks and community groups and provides essential pet food, collars, jackets, bedding and other care items to pet owners in need. Over 1,300 animals per month are now being cared for through this service

Nicola Gunn, Director of Development and External Affairs at Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home, said:

“Our team’s day-to-day work to ensure vulnerable animals get the care they need is absolutely relentless, and just to know that this has been recognised by Pawthereum is incredibly overwhelming. There really aren’t enough words to thank them for this donation, which will ensure another year of Scottish pets being warm, fed and most importantly, remaining in loving homes.”

Pawthereum has also committed to donating a further $2,000 per month to the rescue to ensure the ongoing growth of the service, as it continues to expand across East and Central Scotland. Last month, as part of their ‘Pack in Pet Poverty’ campaign, the Home reported a 77% rise in the use of Paws Pantry between 2020 and 2021.

Matt C-Roy, Charity Coordinator at Pawthereum, said:

**“Pawthereum was born out of the idea that cryptocurrencies can be a tremendous force for good in the world. We couldn’t be happier to do our first major donation with a partner as thoughtful and caring as Edinburgh Home. Their community outreach programs help pets stay with their owners during tough times. We’re proud to support that mission and to partner with Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home long term to save more animals.”**

The Home first started taking cryptocurrency donations in response to the financial struggles of the pandemic, when other income streams such as events and community fundraising began to dry up. In September 2021 the charity launched a presence on The Giving Block (TGB) and found that they were suddenly able to reach global supporters. 

Alex Wilson, Co-Founder, The Giving Block said: 

**“It’s been incredible to see the growth of crypto and NFT philanthropy globally. We’re excited to help our clients set records for the largest crypto donations in their regions. We’ve been lucky enough to help facilitate the largest crypto donations around the world from the US, UK, Australia and now in Scotland.”**

stocks,(11/15) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 15th, 2021-

*****

# [Dow futures up 100 points after market breaks a 5-week winning streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were slightly higher in early morning trading on Monday as investors prepared to start the week after the S&amp;P 500 broke a five-week winning streak.
*****
&gt; Dow futures gained 137 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were each up about 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares fell 2% premarket Monday following a weekend Twitter exchange between founder Elon Musk and Sen. Bernie Sanders.
*****
&gt; “We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period,” the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats wrote.
*****
&gt; “I keep forgetting that you’re still alive,” Musk responded. In a follow-up tweet, he said, “Want me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word …”
*****
&gt; Dow component ExxonMobil saw its shares under pressure, falling nearly 1% premarket as West Texas Intermediate oil futures slipped more than 1% to fall just under $80 a barrel.
*****
&gt; Also on the bluechip index, Boeing rose nearly 3% following news that Saudi Arabian Airlines is in talks with Airbus and Boeing for a wide-body jet order. At the same time, Emirates announced an order for two Boeing 777 Freighters at the 2021 Dubai Airshow.
*****
&gt; Dollar Tree shares gained 7% premarket following a report Friday that activist investor Mantle Ridge has taken a stake worth at least $1.8 billion in the discount store chain and will push it to do more to add to shareholder value.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a losing week after last month’s consumer price index made its largest annual increase in more than three decades. The major averages snapped a five-week winning streak.
*****
&gt; Markets digested a range of economic news last week showing that inflation was rising even more than expected and workers continued to quit their jobs in search of better opportunities.
*****
&gt; That data “added to concerns that inflation at a 30-year high could indeed remain a stickier problem and challenge for businesses, consumers and monetary policy makers to contend with over the next four to six months or even longer” John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said in a note Monday. He said he expects inflation to dampen, however.
*****
&gt; “Positive offsets to the current waves of inflation hitting the U.S. economy at this time are likely to emerge as the effects of what may have been overstimulation of the economy at the height of the pandemic fade,” he said.
*****
&gt; Investors this week will get a look at how much consumers are spending when retail sales data drops Tuesday, while housing numbers come Wednesday with new construction starts and building permits. This also will be a busy week for the Federal Reserve, with multiple officials scheduled to speak through the week.
*****
&gt; Also, the Labor Department reported that a record 4.4 million workers left their jobs in September, generally that they can get something better. Consumer confidence, though, dipped to a 10-year low in November, as consumers apparently flush with cash are growing more worried about inflation.
*****
&gt; October’s CPI jumped 6.2% from a year ago, well above the 5.9% estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones. The index, which tracks a basket of consumer products, increased 0.9% on a month-over-month basis, also hotter than expected.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.6% and the S&amp;P 500 eased 0.3% last week. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was the main underperformer, dropping 0.7% as rising bond yields dented growth pockets of the market.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected to combat inflation.
*****
&gt; Also denting sentiment was a report that workers left their jobs in record numbers in September, with 4.43 million people quitting, the Labor Department reported Friday. The exodus occurred as the U.S. had 10.44 million employment openings that month, according to the report.
*****
&gt; Still, the major averages are not far from their record highs. The Dow is 1.3% off its all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq sit 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, away from their records.
*****
&gt; Investors will be focused on Tuesday’s retail sales report and several major retailers’ earnings this week. Walmart and Home Depot release results on Tuesday, and Target and Lowe’s report on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; On Monday, President Joe Biden will host a bipartisan bill signing ceremony for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

CryptoCurrency,[Fiction] Crypto-Apocalypto: “Little Brown Specks”,"Imagine if you will this hypothetical scenario following the 2024 halving:

&amp;#x200B;

2024: Elizabeth Warren is appointed “Chief of Economic Fairness” under incumbent re-elect Harris. Warren is tasked with creating regulations to make cryptocurrency ownership and use more fair, as well as hunting crypto hoarders and exposing them for causing devaluation of the US dollar and depriving American society of basic living standards. 

2025: Global politics becomes increasingly divided, with essentially the same two parties developing in every jurisdiction: the “Human Labor Party” (AKA “New Conservatives”) vs. the Technocrats, commonly referred to as “Universal Minimalists Anonymous.” It is increasingly clear all discussions boil down to a singularity: do we make human decisions to temporarily ease the suffering of those who appear to need it most now, or do we act rationally for the greatest net social benefit in the long run? It is painful to watch the K-shaped future as the HLP are tired, desperate, publicly pleading, rioting, and fanatically destroying machines and network infrastructure, while the UMA are conspicuously silent, they have no stories to tell. Crying seems to fall on deaf ears, as the Technocrats are increasingly frustrated with the HLP’s ignorance, selfish attitude, and refusal to accept reality. Anonymous suggestions to deport the poor to the Boise ghettos are becoming more common. HLP members regularly call for wars but cannot seem to collectively decide on an enemy, they turn inward.

2026: The Great Decentralization begins – physical attacks on public and private infrastructure are declared National Emergencies in the US, Russia, and most nations, China assures the public no such attacks have been successful there. US domestic Energy production is halved as simultaneous attacks on railways, pipelines, and ports crush oil &amp; gas supplies. Meanwhile, companies like AGROstax, remoteMINE, and NukeJuke benefit immensely from this fragmentation and claim significant market share in both energy and cryptocurrency production. Many cite corporate terrorism, others blame radical conservatives, spending on defenses increases, attacks on large, centralized enterprises continue with roughly the same effectiveness.

2026 November: The National Order to Create Regulations Yielding Positive Technological Organization (NO CRYPTO Act) is passed. All private use of natural resources to produce energy to mine cryptocurrency is banned in the United States, except for those organizations who possess one of the six licenses awarded annually, to be hand-picked picked by Elizabeth Warren. 

2027 January: The New Conservative Union organizes a sit-down strike at BNSF to protest wage stagnation and job automation. Corporate police in multiple locations clash with protestors, violence ensues. As word spreads, the “peaceful” strikes turn to retaliation resulting in near-complete inoperability of BNSF railways. Warren Buffett is blamed by everyone, he is deemed a fascist by the HLP, and a terrorist by the UMA. BNSF files for bankruptcy as they are now flagged across the entire insurance industry a “Universal Force Majeure Liability.” The US Federal government grudgingly accepts ownership of BNSF, Emperor Harris signs the $6.7trillion “Railways Advancement Modernification Infrastructure Technology” (RAM IT) bill.

2027 August: 14% of the New Conservatives unexpectedly die. It is later revealed that a Russian Facebook A.I. thought it was funny to post thousands of articles recommending Krokodilia as a cure for the common cold.

2027 September 06: Coinbase is awarded the largest-ever US Department of Defense contract of $141.9 trillion to secure American dominance of bitcoin. This award was not put to competitive bid, and the sole-source justification documentation just says “BA wuz h3r”.

2027 September 06, 23:99 PDT: Coinbase’s website is replaced with a repeating video of John McAffee dancing in his underwear with Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” playing over it. Gemini and Kraken are 404.

2027 September 07: All centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets hosted in the USA, and by Amazon Web Services, are officially shut down under Executive Order “Just Call it Something” by Supersonic Galactic Technicolor Harris. Only self-custody bitcoin exists now. Most people on this sub go back to working at Wendy’s, because they never secured their keys.

**TL;DR - I see posts all the time about how less than 21 million people can own one bitcoin, but really less than 21 million people own ANY bitcoin, and it appears to be staying that way. There are less than 21 million bitcoin addresses with any balance. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Run a bitcoin node, secure your keys, BE the revolution.**",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Why Inflated Home Prices Will Lead to More Money Pouring Into Crypto from Millenials and Gen Z'ers,"No doubt you've heard about skyrocketing home prices, in some markets home prices are going up 25% or more per year, year over year. In some especially hot markets homes are rising that amount in a single quarter or half a year. This is keeping both Millenials and Gen Z'ers out of the housing market, especially Millenials who are entering that stage in live when they are moving out of hip areas and cities looking for more space or getting married, having kids, and starting families and are looking for more room and better schools.

Traditionally this is where people would be putting a hefty chunk of their money. But with Millenials and Gen Z'ers not buying homes, those tens of thousands of Dollars traditionally used as a downpayment, and those monthly mortgage payments have to go somewhere. Well where can they go?

Well interest rates aren't shit so they aren't going to be sitting in bank accounts and money market accounts, and nobody is going to be locking up money in a CD for 0.0015%. The stock market is a popular place but many people are worried an imminent crash is among us, also I'm hearing from many of my peers that they don't trust the stock market. While I think we've all always known the market is somewhat rigged to an extent, the whole fiasco with Robinhood really highlighted how big players behind the scenes and Government are working together to make sure the little guy can't get ahead, and beyond that, while previous generations enjoyed their 8% to 10% returns, for Millenials and Gen Z'ers, those returns don't get our dicks hard.

So that leaves crypto. I not only do these generations have a good understanding of crypto, in many instances a better understanding than the stock market as many people's initial introduction to saving and investing was crypto and not stocks, but it's also something that in a sense doesn't need to be ""trusted"" as in many ways the blockchain runs itself ie smart contracts and it outside the control of any central company or Government.

That leaves me thinking Millenials and Gen Zers will continue to pour their money into cryptocurrency and asssuming home prices don't come down, I only see this continuing as both of these generations continue to grow into their prime earning years. To me this is very bullish for crypto.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Student Loans... Amounts Redistributed?,"Hello all! I have a question relating my federal student loans and I'm wondering if anyone may be able to shed some light.

As most people know, in the US, federal student loans have been in forbearance for quite some time. I've taken the opportunity to pay off a significant portion of my student loans interest free. For some reason, my student loan provider decided to only show the interest rates for all my loans during forbearance to be 0.00% interest, and didn't offer the information on what the usual rates for each of the loans were. So back in September of 2020, I did the math and determined which loans were which interest rates (I had a good idea but I couldn't remember the exact order). I have a screenshot with the totals of all my loans and the interest rates beside them for my own reference.

Yesterday, I popped onto the online portal to update my personal records for what I still owe on my loans (I paid a bit more off after the September screenshot and then stopped hoping for some student loan forgiveness) and I noticed that all of my unsubsidized loans had *increased* except for one which for some reason \*decreased (\*more than I have paid toward it).

Now the total amount I still owe for my loans has stayed the same, and this... redistribution is actually in my favor (my highest interest rate loan was decreased and my lowest interest rate loan increased the most) but I cannot for the life of me figure out why this happened? I had been aggressively paying off the highest interest rate loans at the beginning of forbearance, but I haven't touched anything since November of 2020....

Should I contact my loan provider? Is this something I should keep an eye on? Or since it benefits me in the long run, should I just keep quiet? I know it's not interest, or it shouldn't be interest considering 1. forbearance and 2. the total amount has stayed the same. And my aggressive payments were targeted towards specific loans, not split between all of them, so I don't see why the targeted loans would suddenly become less than what I've officially paid off. Unfortunately since I haven't paid in 12 months (I've been saving the amount I'd normally pay down) I can't see the specifics on what I paid anymore, so I can't see if they did something funky, but I definitely remember the amounts being correct last time the payments hit. I'm just very confused.  


Additional question for student loan repayment: Should I hit the loans hard just before forbearance is lifted or continue paying slowly (I'm extremely far ahead at the moment)? I have the money to hopefully pay them off by the end of next year if I'm aggressive enough.",finance
stocks,WonderFi (WNDR:NE) DD - Decentralized Finance for the Masses: here’s all you need to know,"WonderFi (previously DeFi Ventures) is a leading platform enabling investors to access the exciting world of decentralized finance (DeFi). It recently listed on the NEO exchange, and is available on both $CAD and $USD markets. WonderFi has amassed a star-studded backing, including Kevin O’Leary (Shark Tank), Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX) and other top-tier blockchain-focused VC firms. ***Here’s all you need to know about WonderFi.***

**Summary**

* WonderFi is developing a platform for users with no crypto experience to access DeFi *(intro to DeFi provided below)*
* WonderFi will holds DeFi assets on its balance sheet, enabling investors to benefit from the significantly higher yields (e.g. &gt;4% on savings accounts vs near-0% in the market today), among other attractive offerings
* Listed on NEO (Canadian exchange) in August 2021 and has traded up \~51% since to CAD $2.50 (\~$186mn market cap)
* Investment Thesis:
   * Provides a simple, easy-to-access, attractive offering in the rapidly growing (but esoteric) DeFi market 
   * Strong management team with best-in-class strategic investors and advisors
   * Significant catalysts provide upside to stock price (progress on platform, strategic partnerships, acquisitions)
* Key Risks:
   * High execution risk - ambitious product offering still in development 
   * Existing and new competitors (e.g. Alice) developing a more attractive, more widely adopted product offering
   * Increased regulation in the decentralized finance space (recent passing of 6050I) poses significant threat to DeFi in the USA
   * Risks inherent in DeFi space (rug pulls, impermanent loss) may result in significant losses (mitigated by use of reputable protocols)
* **Initiate at a Buy on catalysts to valuation upside (see valuation section)**
* *Note - all figures in CAD*

5. Recent Developments / Strategy
6. Valuation / Key Risks

**1. Business Model**

*What does WonderFi do?*

WonderFi is a tech company that is developing a platform (mobile and desktop) to facilitate investments in the emerging industry of decentralized finance. Its users (investors) will be able to use the platform to access decentralized protocols (think of these as tools for different investment strategies) on multiple networks (including Etherium and Solana). Their primary offering, a high-interest savings account, enables users to earn attractive yields on low-risk products (&gt;4% vs. the near-0% interest rate on traditional bank high interest savings accounts).

While these decentralized protocols are available to all investors without the use of WonderFi, it is a highly complex ecosystem that is difficult to learn and navigate, with scams (often called “rug pulls”) being prevalent in the space. *We are actively engaged in the DeFi space, and have fell victim to scams; the risk of losing your capital with unproven protocols is often seen by investors as just a part of the space.*  

WonderFi aims to simplify and de-risk this process with its easy-to-use app and curated access to safe protocols, achieving an attractive offering with low-risk that offers **significantly** higher returns than what an investor would earn in a bank savings account.

Details on DeFi are included in Section 2, but it is important for those not in the DeFi space to understand that the space is incredibly complex and difficult to navigate, creating very significant barriers to entry to the average investor, or even a well-versed traditional finance investor. WonderFi aims to bridge this gap, through an all-in-one, highly curated platform, appealing to the average investor. 

*What is its product offering?*

WonderFi’s product offering, its app, will provide four offerings:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Product**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|
|WonderFi High Interest Savings Account|Allows investors to earn significantly higher interest through WonderFi’s investments in low-risk products in the DeFi space |
|WonderFi Baskets |Allows investors to invest in various curated indexes |
|Swap|Exchange to swap cryptocurrencies |
|Earn|Allows investors to lend their assets to earn interest|

**Our take:** we expect the high-interest savings account and baskets to be the cornerstone offerings of the app. As explained above, the high-interest savings account provides an attractive risk-reward profile, while the basket enables investors to access curated baskets in the DeFi space (our view is that researching attractive DeFi opportunities is a highly technical, time-consuming exercise that the majority of DeFi investors neither have the time nor capability to do). 

Given the highly developed existing space for exchanges, the exchange offering will likely not be cost effective in comparison to the leading centralized and decentralized exchanges. In addition, lending generally yields lower interests in the crypto space than other DeFi strategies including staking (detailed below), so we don’t see the Earn product being competitive with the savings account.

**2. Introduction to Decentralized Finance**

*What is Decentralized Finance?*

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a system by which financial products and transactions are made through a blockchain network. In short, rather than trading through a centralized entity (bank, broker, etc.), you don’t transact with an entity and rather through a “smart contract” (code between the transacting parties). As is the nature with blockchain, these transactions are traceable, transparent, and irreversible. 

Investors in DeFi can earn rewards through the value of their currency appreciating, in addition to other DeFi strategies such as lending, staking, yield farming, and liquidity mining. Each of these strategies have different inherent risks and rewards, and WonderFi aims to simplify this process by providing a very low-risk product with a &gt;4% interest. The benefit to investors is significant; they earn an attractive interest rate while circumventing the complex steps and diligence required to properly execute these DeFi strategies. 

Within DeFi, there are many protocols, which are networks where investors can enter into smart contracts, and within these protocols, there are thousands of different projects and currencies, with new projects launching everyday. Given our own experience in DeFi, we know well the significant technical knowledge (coding, tokenomics) and research (team, community, roadmap, backing) required to properly diligence protocols and projects, making entering the space difficult for the average investor (and making WonderFi’s product a very attractive alternative for investors).

*Current Sizing*

Currently, DeFi has **&gt;$267 billion** in total value locked (Source: DefiLlama), representing the sum of all assets deposited in different DeFi protocols (leading to rewards, interest, new coins/tokens, etc.). The space has grown significantly in a short amount of time, from \~$16 billion less than a year ago. We expect this space to continue to develop as retail and institutional money flows into DeFi to capitalize on the attractive risk-return.

*Regulatory Space*

There remains significant regulatory uncertainty, given the regulatory gap between traditional and non-traditional finance today (part of the reason why DeFi has grown). A recent example is the passing of 6050I, which makes the failure to report crypto transactions &gt;$10,000 a felony, posing a threat to DeFi in the USA. With DeFi, the contractual party is a wallet address rather than an entity, making this bill difficult to satisfy.

**3. Management and Ownership Overview**

WonderFi’s management team has significant experience, including expertise from both traditional and non-traditional markets. Its CEO, Ben Samaroo and other members of the executive team were members of First Coin Capital, a cryptocurrency startup later acquired by Galaxy Digital. The management team is technically strong and well connected with relationships with securities commissions and FINTRAC (Canadian equivalent of FinCEN).

What’s more impressive is the strategic investors, who include Kevin O’Leary (Canadian investor),and Sam Bankman-Fried (founder of FTX). Its consortium of investors also includes highly reputable names in the crypto space, including Animal Capital, BIGG Digital, O’Leary Ventures, Alameda Research, and Argo Blockchain.

While the limited amount of options and warrants are positive given companies at this stage typically have more dilutive securities, the total share count has since has increased since to \~74.0mn. We are cautious about further dilution and are hopeful that the platform will be able to grow without significant further equity issuances. 

**4. Market Overview / Competitive Landscape**

*Industry Overview*

WonderFi operates in an emerging space, and has few direct competitors (one being Alice Finance, which aims to provide a similar service, built on the Terra blockchain). However, we see a larger incumbent, such as Coinbase or Square creating a similar platform as a greater threat to WonderFi. This is mitigated by WonderFi’s competitive advantages below:

*Competitive Advantages* 

* Strong institutional and strategic backing (mentioned above)
* Superior product offering: WonderFi likely has the furthest developed product, and in our research we have not come across a similar product at WonderFi’s current stage (first-mover advantage)
* Access to capital: WonderFi has strong access to capital through equity markets and eventually as the company gains users, through the debt capital markets; this is a competitive advantage compared to smaller, private companies
* Existing relationships with regulatory authorities: relationships with FINRA and securities commissions will reduce any major hurdles that will delay launch

**5. Recent Developments / Strategy**

WonderFi’s stated corporate strategy is outlined below:

1. Build: develop WonderFi’s app
2. Invest: hold crypto and DeFi assets and generate yield
3. Acquire: non-organic growth to support growth and expansion 

We are confident in WonderFi’s ability to execute on its first two priorities, given the experience of the team and backing. However, WonderFi’s team lacks expertise and experience in inorganic M&amp;A, and we expect them to build out the in-house team over time, given the priority on releasing the platform as soon as possible.

WonderFi also continues to enter into strategic partnerships and investments, likely facilitated through Sam Bankman-Fried and their strategic investors. On November 8, 2021, the company announced investments in Solana and Serum. The company also has a strategic partnership with Compound Finance, a leading protocol to facilitate the lending and investing to provide yield for its users.

**6. Valuation / Key Risks**

*Historical Valuations*

WonderFi previously raised capital through several funding rounds, which are detailed below.

Strategic: CAD $0.13/sh

Seed Round: CAD $0.25/sh

Pre-Public: CAD $1.00/sh

Pre-Public: CAD $1.05/sh

Today: CAD $2.50/sh; market cap = CAD $186mn

*Key Catalysts to Increase Valuation*

* Demonstrated execution - progress and successful eventual launch will provide valuation upside
* Partnerships and strategic investments - through strategic investors and backing, expect partnerships and investments continue to be announced
* M&amp;A transactions - existing relationships enable proprietary deal flow, expect shares to gain on M&amp;A news

*Key Risks to WonderFi’s Valuation*

* High execution risk - ambitious product offering still in development 
* Existing and new competitors (e.g. Alice) developing a more attractive, more widely adopted product offering
* Increased regulation in the decentralized finance space (recent passing of 6050I) poses significant threat to DeFi in the USA
* Risks inherent in DeFi space (rug pulls, impermanent loss) may result in significant losses (mitigated by use of reputable protocols)

stocks,What's the best stock or ETF to confidently park a lot of money and cash that's well priced right now?,"I had a CD with a locked in high interest rate, back when interest rates were actually high, like almost 3%, which has now sadly expired, so want to move it somewhere else, but then becomes issue that interest rates are low right now, not sure if any plans to increase them either. 

I know many recommend SPY or QQQ, but all of them are at their highs right now, not sure if it's safe to put it inside. I know stocks and ETFs typically make highs several times per year, but it's growth in the last 1 year, seems a little extremity. 

Then again, I've had times in the pasts where I thought I was ripping myself off, but decided whatever thought I had was probably wrong, so decided to buy anyway, and it ended up continuing to rise and did wonderfully. An example is buying that gaming meme company after it went up 5x, before the squeeze, which ended up going up another 7-8x after I bought. Of course I've also been wrong, like buying ARKK at highs, which never bounced back in the end. 

Time horizon is probably at least 1 year, if not maybe several. I have about 18 months of expenses saved up, and little embarrassing, moved back home, an age now closer to 30 than 20. I probably could park it for a while, but just want the option to withdraw anytime, like if I end up changing courses and making plans to now buy something with it.",finance
btc,"Good news, and answers to some very important SmartBCH Bridge questions","Good news everyone! After our last post discussing the importance of selecting the correct number and type of Federators, we are now on our way to having a unique, secure, and decentralized bridge. You can find our discussion here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/qmkth9/comment/hjb1idm/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/qmkth9/comment/hjb1idm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Multiple people reached out with some questions that we believe are important to clarify. These are: Why not create competing bridges, and why is so important for bridges to be a protocol and not a business product.  We made some quick illustrations to try to better answer these questions.

While initially opposing competing bridges sounds like a bad idea, it is counterintuitive, so we like to illustrate the different options to show why a single bridge set is actually the right choice.

**Please keep in mind that when we refer to ""Bridge"", we are not referring to the main BCH to SmartBCH bridge, but actually the set of secondary bridges that connect SmartBCH to Ethereum, BNC, Thorchain, and many other important blockchains.**

# Multiple competing bridges

[Competing bridges divided the community](https://preview.redd.it/rzby75uu9sz71.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f12d5aeac74f2b14f5fa568be4981d2611477eb8)

**Multiple competing bridges** result in the community being divided across multiple tokens that represent the same asset. Other blockchains we compete with have consensus over the bridges connecting them. Bridges are part of a protocol, and not a business. They integrate different components of a blockchain, into a single decentralized platform.

**Consider it would result in not just 2 bridges, but 10s or 100s of different bridges.** Imagine the community having to deal with the support of users using multiple bridges. **Consider for example a user depositing ETH on a DEX, yet the DEX list ETH from a different bridge**. Do you see the issues having to be faced by users and DAPPs? Complexity, confusion, **security risks**, divided liquidity, and especially a **disincentive for other DAPP builders to port or create their projects into smartBCH.**

It is for this reason we consider it of such big importance that we as a community should agree on a unique bridge set. Who deploys the contract is less important, because **it is a protocol,** if done correctly, it will be secure as we discussed in our previous post.

# Anonymous bridge

[Anonymous bridges turn into a business. A business is incentivized to increase profits by increasing fees. The High fees then result in a disincentive for value to flow into SmartBCH.](https://preview.redd.it/bq9ks8k5asz71.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f65841fcec5c3145edc3d0e68b2415c2764593a)

Now let's go over the option of a bridge run by several anon users **without** community-aligned interests. Federator voting to select a validator was already well discussed in the previous post, we discussed how it is a bad idea.

**A business is incentivized to increase the fees to make more money, there is nothing that the community could do in this case.** It becomes very difficult to change things when DEXs and DAPPs have already listed the bridged tokens, LPs. etc. To sum it all up, the profiting interests of the anonymous federator group come before the interests of the community.

Further, a business seeking income would be **targeted by regulator agencies**, creating risk over the whole Bitcoin Cash community. There can be entrepreneurial spirit around the bridge, but not at the protocol level.

# Aligned federators bridge

[Aligned bridge set create incentives for new users and DAPP builders. The low fees are an incentive for value to flow into SmartBCH.](https://preview.redd.it/rszc1ia8asz71.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=611358d1319e982796c3d2be84855ca2fd8f08fe)

And finally, let's go over a single bridge set with Federators that we already have trust in and that have aligned interests to the community. First, being part of **a decentralized protocol, regulatory agencies wouldn't be able to target: as like Bitcoin it is just a protocol.** Keep in mind a federator only certifies something happened, **it does not directly create or** ***move any value***. Value is moved by a protocol, just like Bitcoin. It does not make a profit from the bridge fees.

**Aligned federators are incentivized to lower the fees of the bridge, they make MORE money not from the fees on the bridge but from the increased activity on the blockchain.** Low fees result in more users, stronger network effects, reduction of the BCH supply, and a healthier ecosystem. Users from other blockchains are incentivized to move their funds into SmartBCH, generating value for anyone holding BCH. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Moving forward

**Market competition is good,** just as there is a competition to create the best bitcoin wallet, there will be competition to create the best bridge front end. Users will then have to decide which front end to trust, just as they trust the  Bitcoin Cash wallet they use. Hopefully, there will be many alternatives and direct integration with DEXs and other DAPPs. At the protocol level, we need to make sure it is done correctly and only one bridge set is adopted by the community, summating liquidity and creating the right conditions to attract DAPs and **new** users.

Notice that as the 5th Federator we suggested a ""Bridge DAO"" or ""Bridge team"". This would be a team of multiple people working on the bridge, running a single server/signature for the bridge. It will oversee things like security, users support and coordinate any work required to maintain the bridge set working correctly.  We would like to request the **community** to kindly consider letting us participate in this team.

What we are currently missing is a common ground to openly discuss the project. While most of the discussion happens on Telegram, /u/BCHPleaseOrg currently in charge of deploying the bridge would prefer a different method. Hopefully, we can soon agree on what to use and help move things forward.

This post is already too long, We have one more post ready with information on how beyond SmartBCH becoming a primary DEFI choice for the world, we can also turn the Bridge to be so efficient and inexpensive so that SmartBCH becomes an Ethereum scaling solution generating a lot of value for everyone in the ecosystem. We believe we can create an incentive for users on other blockchains to move to SmartBCH. Will share all the details in an upcoming post.

financialindependence,I Bonds vs High Yield Savings Accounts,"I’ve tried approaching the following decision analytically but am checking if others with high savings rates have experienced similar decisions or can see any of my blind spots.

I have a pretty high savings rate (roughly 37%-57% not closely tracked) and hate to leave my dollars working inefficiently. The more I save, the quicker I can reach financial independence. In my 20’s I’ve stayed in 100% stocks and have not purchased any bonds. I have a pretty tough skin and risk tolerance and didn’t even consider selling during the short 2020 market crash.

However, I also understand the importance of an emergency fund. I started with around $10,000 in an Ally savings account and have increased it up to $25,000 over the past few years.

More recently, I’ve considered putting most of my emergency fund into I-bonds. I understand they are less liquid than a savings account but in the long run will be less affected by inflation. Looking at historic rates, they almost always are at least 1-2% higher than a high yield savings account.  https://imgur.com/a/agSHRni

The pro to an online savings account is only liquidity and money available within a few days. 

From what I can tell about I-bonds the pros and cons are:

Pros:

1. Higher Inflation Protected Interest Rates

Cons:

1. Locked up for 1 year from time of purchase.

2. Forfeit 3 months interest if redeemed within 5 years

3. Limited to $10,000 purchased per year 

4. May take longer to redeem in an emergency 

I think I can deal with all of the cons in my current situation. If I purchase 10k this year and 10k towards the end of next year I could limit my exposure to liquidity issues. My plan would be to buy 10k this December, bring my emergency fund savings account back to 20k by next December, then buy 10k more. At that point I would have 20k in I-bonds and 10k in a savings account. Ideally for small emergencies I wouldn’t even have to touch the I-bonds. Even sacrificing 3 months of interest after 1 year I would still be ahead relative to a high yield savings account. 9 months at an I bond rate beats 12 months at current savings accounts rates.

In the short term, 15k liquidity is plenty. I have a local safety net and could both cover a 6-month lease liability ($3750) and the maximum out of pocket for health insurance ($6500). Worst case I could also move back in with parents and just pay for partial utilities and food. My current industry also has a pretty high demand so it wouldn’t be difficult to get another similar paying job.

One of my main concerns is how difficult it is in practice to redeem I-bonds. Could I put a large emergency expense on a credit card, cash in the same amount of electronic I-bonds the same day, and be able to pay off the credit card within 3 weeks?",finance

CryptoCurrency,How to leverage DeFi to pay off CeFi loans,"Hey everyone! So yesterday I made a post about Defi and why you should pay attention to it and got a lot of interest on how I was able to leverage my crypto to pay off some debts I had in traditional finance. This post will go over how I managed to accomplish that, the risks, benefits, and process to get it done. This will be a long post most likely and will not include a TL;DR as I firmly believe that it's important to understand what's going on here. Also wanted to link this [article](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-pay-off-your-student-loans) which inspired me to do this. So feel free to take a look at that as well. The post I lined was done on the polygon network, my post will focus on the avalanche network.

&amp;#x200B;

Before the rest of the post beings I want to stress two things: This is not financial advice so DYOR and figure out what your personal risk tolerance is in the Crypto space. Your risk tolerance may look VERY different than mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

There will be a few sections in this post to really breakdown the whole process.

1. Brief overview of what I did
2. Benefits of this approach
3. Risks Associated
4. Reasons I decided to take this risk
5. Tutorial on how this is done

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview**

I had credit card debt in traditional finance that I wanted to pay off and was planning on selling my crypto to do so until I discovered AAVE. Basically I borrowed USDC from the DeFi platform AAVE, sent that to Coinbase to sell for USD and withdraw to my bank to pay off my debt. I used my crypto as collateral to take out the loans. I did this because currently the interest I am getting for staking my crypto on AAVE is greater than the interest I have to pay for the loan I took out.

The flow was as follows:

Converted the crypto I was going to sell to pay off debt into AVAX -&gt; sent to metamask wallet on avalanche network -&gt; converted some to USDC.e (Avalanche's USDC) -&gt; Deposited USDC.e and AVAX into AAVE -&gt; took out a loan in USDC.e -&gt; converted to Avax -&gt; sent to Coinbase -&gt; Sold -&gt; Withdrew -&gt; paid off debts

&amp;#x200B;

**Benefits of this Approach**

1. No Repayment Period - unlike my debt in traditional finance that had a monthly payment with interest, DeFi loans have no repayment period, only an interest rate. This means that I can pay my loan when I want and how I want. This gives me extreme flexibility that isn't available in traditional finance. In short I am the house and the player. No impact to my credit if I don't pay one month, no stress in having to pay on time or accrue fees, no needing to wait multiple days for payments to go through.
2. It pays to borrow - DeFi protocols will pay you to use their platform. At the time of this writing my loan costs me 10% APR but I am getting paid 2.65% APR on the amount of the loan paid in AVAX. This essentially brings my interest rate on the loan to 7.35% if I use those rewards to pay off the loan.
3. Incentives - Piggybacking off the previous point it also pays extra to deposit. Currently I am receiving 8.81% APR on the USDC.e I deposited and 1.80% APR on the AVAX I have deposited. Those are both paid in those respective currencies. So as I pay down my loan those balances continue to grow. I also am receiving bonus rewards for using the protocol paid out in AVAX. My USDC.e is 5.07% APR and my AVAX is paying 11.88% APR.

If I use my AVAX rewards to pay my loan the loan essential pays for itself since the incentives I am getting paid is greater than the interest I have to pay. At the time of this writing I am getting paid 16.95% in incentives alone (this doesn't include the APR for staking my USDC.e and AVAX that'd being my up to 27.56% APR) and I only have to pay 10%. So currently the loan is paying for itself (slowly, but still technically free).

4) Upside Exposure - Some of my collateral is deposited in AVAX that I believe in the long run will continue it's up and to the right trajectory. I am still able to enjoy the upside potential of AVAX while also paying off the debt I wanted to that lived in CeFi. This is similar to what wealthy folks do where they'll often take loans out against their stock to avoid losing out on potential growth.

5) Layer 2 - AAVE allows you to chose what network you want to work on whether it be ETH, MATIC, or AVAX. I chose AVAX because the rewards are higher and the fees are very cheap. Most things you do on the platform require smart contract interaction which has an associated cost. I have to deposit, borrow, claim rewards, and pay off my loan which would kill me in fees if I weren't using a layer 2 solution with super cheap fees. I also get to learn more about how this network works and how to navigate the Avalanche blockchain.

6) Self Paying Loan - I mentioned this earlier but I will say it again, the loan basically pays for itself as long as all the reward rates I am getting are &gt; loan interest rate. Ill touch on what happens if this isn't true in a later section and why I am ok with this risk.

&amp;#x200B;

**Associated Risks**

With anything in crypto, especially in DeFi, there are a ton of risks that need to be taken into account. It is important to figure out what your risk tolerance is and whether the rewards outweigh the risks or not. For me, in this case, the answer is yes it's worth it, but to you that may not be the case. I can't make that decision for you. Here are some risks:

1. Liquidation - While we talked about there not being a repayment period or monthly payments that doesn't mean we don't have to pay attention to our loan at all. We are at risk of getting liquidated (aka getting rekt) which means that the platform sells your assets to cover themselves if they believe you are at risk of not being able to pay off your loan. AAVE needs to make itself whole by selling enough of your deposited assets to bring you back to a safe Loan to Value (LTV) ratio. LTV is basically how much you have borrowed compared to how much you have deposited on the platform. Different loans have different LTV thresholds where your collateral will be sold to cover. I'd suggest reading what those thresholds are on AAVE. (Ill mention this later but this is one reason why part of my collateral is in USDC.e since it's pegged to the dollar it really reduces my risk of getting rekt).
2. Smart Contract Risk - smart contracts run the AAVE protocol which means that everything is controlled by automated processes. There isn't anyone that is processing transactions for you when you interact with the protocol. Smart contracts are always at risk of being exploited which means you could lost everything that's on the platform. There are many protocols that have been exploited through their smart contract. Avalanche is the newest layer 2 solution on AAVE so it's not as tested as say L1 (ETH) which can be scary. Bugs and exploits are certainly something to be aware of.
3. Variable Rates - I mentioned all the rates associated with my loan and deposits earlier. These are all subject to change based on what the supply/demand is on the platform. Since I took out my loan all the rates have changed slightly, however, my rewards are still higher than what I have to pay. If my rewards become less than what I owe my loan is no longer free.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reasons I decided to take this Risk**

In this section I am going to discuss why I decided to take this risk and will break it down based on the risks I provided above. Ultimately, I think I will be fine but you never know, I had to determine my own risk tolerance. Ill also touch on how I mitigated risk if possible or how I justified taking that risk.

1. Liquidation - This is very scary because I could end up losing my assets which is what I wanted to avoid in the first place. However, DeFi gives you a lot of flexibility. If I am ever in danger of liquidation I have multiple options - deposit more collateral, pay off some of my loan, or get rekt. I liked the fact that I have flexibility to do what I see fit in this scenario. I also deposited a good amount fo USDC.e which as long as it stays pegged to the dollar (which I don't see why it wouldn't) I am not at the mercy of market fluctuation. My AVAX can fluctuate but my USDC.e keeps my loan relatively healthy. This reduces the risk of liquidation quite a bit since not all my assets can fluctuate. AAVE allows you to deposit a number of tokens and you can choose which ones are used as collateral or not. #flexibility
2. Smart Contract Risk - This is a risk with everything in the crypto space pretty much that requires smart contracts. Nothing I can really do here, but AAVE has been around for a while and they do have quite a bit of liquidity on their protocol which makes me feel better about it.
3. Variable Rates - Currently I am living the life with my loan paying for itself. I am at risk of my loan having a higher interest rate than what I am pulling in, but if I hadn't paid off my debt in CeFi this way I would still have to pay interest on it or would've had to lose my upside potential of my crypto. That loan would cost me so even if my loan is only ""free"" for a while it's still a W in my book. Also if AVAX continues to trend upwards in the long run my loan can essentially never be paid by me because my LTV would go closer and closer to 0. IMO worth the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, time is going to tell if I end up fucking myself but I really think it's less likely that I am screwed than this working out for the best. The upside potential is much greater than the worst case scenario of me losing that money or having to the loan rather than it paying for itself. If I sold the crypto I'd be out that money anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Well if you've made it this far thank you for reading. I will say I am not a tax expert so please don't ask how this is going to affect my taxes, IDK and don't feel comfortable giving out any tax information. As mentioned before DYOR. I'm pretty sure whoever does my taxes this year is going to have a FUN time. Alright that's it. This next part is simply going to be a tutorial as to how I was able to do this so only read on if you're curious.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tutorial**

This tutorial will be focused on doing this on a computer using chrome, it can be done on mobile but it's more of a pain imo. The process is more or less the same. This is how I did it, there are multiple ways to do this.

1. Install Metamask
2. Add the Avalanche network to metamask. Here is a nifty [link](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-do-i-set-up-metamask-on-avalanche) from Avalanche that breaks down how to do it. Once you do this make sure you're on the Avalanche network on Metamask
3. Converted my crypto I wanted to use to AVAX in Coinbase
4. Sent the AVAX to my metamask wallet. Note: The avalanche network has like 3 different chains on it. It can get pretty confusing to use and if you do this a different method you may need to make an avalanche wallet and send your funds there to switch chains to then send to metamask. If you send from Coinbase like I did it's already not eh ETH based chain which lets you send directly to Metamask on the Avalanche network. I'd also recommend sending a small amount first to make sure you did this correctly.
5. Go to [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home) to swap some AVAX to USDC.e. You'll need to connect your wallet to their app to make the swap. Gas fees should be pretty negligible at this point since we aren't on L1. Also you'll probably need to approve your funds for swapping then you'll be able to swap.
6. Go to [AAVE](https://app.aave.com/#/) and connect your wallet, make sure you click on the Avalanche version AAVE on their market page
7. Deposit the USDC.e and AVAX (leave a small amount in MM for transactions) If you just want to earn rewards stop here. If you want a loan continue to the next step.
8. Go to the borrow tab and select what currency you want to borrow. I borrowed USDC.e. There is a play you can do here which involves borrowing USDT.e. Lots of people fear that USDT could unpeg from the dollar and if this is the case and the price of USDT unpegged and dropped you'd only owe the USDT amount borrowed not the USD amount. For example if you borrowed 100 USDT.e and it unpegs and is now worth $0.50. You'd still owe 100 USDT.e but it's only be $50 in USD that you'd owe.
9. Go back to Trader Joe and swap your USDC.e/USDT.e/Whatever you borrow for AVAX
10. Send AVAX to Coinbase
11. Sell AVAX for USD
12. Withdraw to CeFi bank account and pay off whatever

&amp;#x200B;

At this point you can go to the AAVe dashboard and claim your rewards monthly or whenever you want and convert to USDC.e (or whatever currency you borrowed) and pay down your loan.

Quick note there are a ton of different APRs on the site. If you look in the deposit column the Bold number is the APR you receive in the currency you deposited. The number below it with the AVAX symbol is what you'll receive in AVAX for depositing that currency. The same is true for the borrow APR. The bold one is what you'll owe on the loan and the number under it with the AVAX symbol is what you're paid for borrowing.

CryptoCurrency,Attempts at crypto before Bitcoin!,"Attempts at Crypto before Bitcoin!

When bitcoin was developed in 2009, it launched a new generation of digital currencies. Bitcoin differs from many of is predecessors in its decentralized status and its development of blockchain technology. However, it's difficult to imagine the creation of bitcoin, let alone the hundreds of other digital currencies which have since launched, without the earlier attempts at cryptocurrencies and electronic cash in the decades before bitcoin was launched. Here are some examples of these attempts.

Attempts in the Netherlands
According to a report in Bitcoin Magazine, one of the earliest attempts at creating a cryptocurrency actually predates bitcoin's creation by about 20 years. Petrol stations in the Netherlands were suffering from nighttime thefts. Rather than post guards and risk their safety, a group of developers attempted to link money to newly-designed smartcards. Truck drivers who needed to access the stations would carry these cards instead of cash, and the stations would not have paper money lying around. This may have been the earliest example of electronic cash, which has links to digital currencies as we know them today.

Blinded Cash
Around the same time, or perhaps even earlier, American cryptographer David Chaum experimented with a different form of electronic cash. He conceptualized a token currency which could be transferred between individuals both safely and privately; again, the similarities to modern day cryptocurrencies are striking. Chaum developed a so-called ""blinding formula"" to be used to encrypt information passed between individuals. ""Blinded cash"" could thus be safely transferred between individuals, bearing a signature of authenticity and the ability to be modified without traceability. Chaum founded DigiCash to put his concept into practice several years later. Although DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998, the concepts the company put forward as well as some of its formulas and  Encryption  tools played an important role in the development of later digital currencies.

Web-Based Money
In the 1990s, a number of startups made efforts at furthering the goals of DigiCash. Of these, perhaps the company with the greatest lasting impact on the broader financial world was PayPal. PayPal Revolutionized person to person payments online. It allowed individuals to quickly and securely transfer money via web browser. By connecting itself to the eBay community, PayPal secured a dedicated userbase which allowed it to grow and thrive. It remains a major payments service today. PayPal also inspired its imitators, including companies which attempted to provide a means for trading gold via web browser. One of the more successful of these operations was called e-gold, which offered individuals online credit in exchange for physical gold and other precious metals. This company ran into issues with various types of scams, however, and was eventually shut down by the federal government in 2005.

B-Money
In 1998, developer Wei Dai proposed an ""anonymous, distributed electronic cash system"" called B-money. Dai suggested two different protocols, including one which required a broadcast channel that was both synchronous and unjammable. Ultimately, B-money was never successful, and indeed, it was quite different from bitcoin in many ways. Nonetheless, it was also an attempt at an anonymous, private, and secure electronic cash system. In the B-money system, digital pseudonyms would be used in order to transfer currency through a decentralized network. The system even included a means for contract enforcement in-network as well, without the use of a third party. Although Wei Dai proposed a whitepaper for B-money, it was ultimately unable to garner enough attention for a successful launch. Still, Satoshi referenced elements of B-money in his bitcoin whitepaper roughly a decade later, so the impact of B-money on the current digital currency craze is undeniable.

Bit Gold
Not to be confused with the contemporary gold-based exchange of a similar name, Bit Gold was another electronic currency system which dates back to the same period as B-money. Proposed by Nick Szabo, Bit Gold came with its own proof-of-work system that in some ways is mirrored by today's bitcoin mining process. Through this procedure, solutions were compiled cryptographically and then published for the public in much the same way a modern blockchain would function.

Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the Bit Gold concept, however, had to do with its movement away from centralized status. Bit Gold aimed to avoid reliance on centralized currency distributors and authorities. Szabo's aim was for Bit Gold to reflect the properties of real gold, thereby enabling users to eliminate the middleman entirely. Bit Gold, like B-money, was ultimately unsuccessful. However, it too provided inspiration for a large group of digital currencies which would enter the market a decade or more after its introduction.

Hashcash
Developed in the mid-1990s, Hashcash was one of the most successful pre-bitcoin digital currencies, according to The Merkle. Hashcash was designed for a number of purposes, including minimizing email spam and preventing DDos attacks, Hashcash opened up a wide array of possibilities which would only be realized nearly two decades later. Hashcash used a proof-of-work algorithm to aid the generation and distribution of new coins, much like many contemporary cryptocurrencies. Indeed, Hashcash also ran into many of the same problems as today's cryptocurrencies today; in 1997, facing an increased processing power need, Hashcash eventually became less and less effective. In spite of the fact that it eventually fizzled out, Hashcash saw a large degree of interest in its heyday. Many of the elements of the Hashcash system worked their way into bitcoin's development as well

personalfinance,Should I take out a home improvement loan to hedge against inflation?,"This idea has been kicking around in my mind, and I was hoping for some feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

Debt and money in general become worth less as inflation rises. Inflation would erode the value of the debt payments over time. My salary is tied to my state's CPI and will rise in response to inflation. Given all that, does it make financial sense to take out a home improvement loan while interest rates are low and inflation is high? Hopefully that question make sense.",finance

personalfinance,Should I take out Subsidized Student Loans?,"Hey!  


So I'm going back to school to get an additional bachelors degree online. I'll be working while doing this, which I'm not worried about as I've always been good at school. I've been offered some student loans, and it looks like I'll be able to cover the program with only subsidized federal loans (I'll also apply for some scholarships as I go, but I don't expect anything from them.)

I've been working for a few years, so if I wanted I could pay out of pocket for the program (in-state tuition is so so cheap). It would wreck my savings, but I could do it. I've been trying to run the numbers though and I honestly think with subsidized loans only I'll actually be better off taking them out and paying them off aggressively once I graduate. Like I think with inflation I'll end up paying less since they won't be accruing interest while I study.

I'm not looking for advice on whether I should get the degree, and also I want to say upfront that I'm very good with money and budgeting, so I know I'll have the money still once I graduate unless something incredible happens. And in that case I clearly needed it anyway so it's a good thing I had it.

Just looking for an outside perspective on taking out these loans. Does this plan seem to make sense? I'm scared of debt.

personalfinance,Early IRA withdrawal,"30 years old - I'm stuck in paycheck to paycheck hell and barely making my minimum payments on the entirely too much debt I hold. I've successfully held up all my accounts without defaulting for now, but once federal student loan repayments start back up, Im going to be in a world of hurt &amp; I have no idea what I'm going to do for the next emergency expense as it is. 

I have no general savings as I can only afford to save OR pay debt.  My 401k contributions can be described as minimal at best, but I do have about $29k in a rollover IRA and about $4500 in a Roth  IRA. 

I'm estimating about $15,000 after taxes and penalties if I were to withdraw those accounts to pay off debt and reduce my monthly payments.  This would allow me room to save, pay student loans and start over with higher 401k contributions.  I'd also like to move eventually/find a roommate to cut housing expenses as well, but can't do so as of now because I'm so indebted and can't afford moving expenses. 

I've already looked into debt management programs and they don't seem like they'll help enough and debt settlement program risks horrify me not to mention they don't seem like enough help as well.

Am I being reasonable? I understand I'd be losing the exponential growth with withdrawal, but if I can't afford to live and could save so much on interest payments isn't it worth it? Is my estimate of $15,000 after taxes in the right ball park? Any other advice?",finance

Once the pandemic hit, I made around $60,000 on the following rally.  
Almost 2 years later and the market has now most definitely hit a ridiculous PEAK.  
The FED has announced tapering coming up VERY SOON. This will be the needle that makes everything burst. Evergrande is just a big fat bearish cherry on top.  
Elon is cashing out and so are the other big boys.  
When SPY drops 20% in a few weeks time, BTC will drop 50% in a few DAYS time - that is something I believe as much as I believe in LRC becoming a top-ten coin one day.  
Prepare yourselves for this upcoming volatility.  
My other ""sure thing"" holdings like VET and HBAR will most definitely lose 50%+ of their value in DAYS.  
With that said though, I will continue to hold LRC because we have certain historic (for the project itself) catalysts coming up that I believe will bypass the overall market dip.  
We might still have flash crashes of 20-50% but I am not one to time the market and risk my precious looprings. All eyes are on the project and money is just waiting to flow in.  
Prepare yourselves for the long game, which can be 4-6 months like the last time BTC halved and the recovered but I do believe we can hit $20-50b market cap by the end of 2022 especially if the crash happens in Q1-Q2.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,85 seconds with machine-gun Natalie (Natalie ₿runell),"Charles, Yes. This why I am so passionate about Bitcoin.

I mean, we used to be the world’s greatest creditor nation. We made stuff. Now we are the world’s biggest debtor nation. We hardly make anything except debt.And so, everything is distorted, Charles. I mean, up is down, inflation is good. Our economy is like an airplane flying without an altimeter, because we have no price signals based on real interest rates and we haven’t for a long time. Instead, we have system where insiders print money and they benefit. They create disproportionate access to capital with low interest rates, and that capital goes where? Into stocks of companies that have no real growth. They just use easy government money to finance debt and buyback shares and create synthetic growth and these market bubbles. They buy up real estate and turn the country into renters. I mean inflation sucks the life from workers and savers, and it benefits the asset holders. So all of a sudden we have this ballooning wealth-inequality. \[Charles tries to interrupt\] And politicians who contributed the problem, who have no clue about basic economics, saying hey I’ll come fix it by spending and handing out more easy money. \[Charles tries to interrupt\] And it’s like the government cripples you and then hands you crutch and says, Aren’t you happy I was here to hand you this crutch.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Nov 15, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 15, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow Jones (DIA) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closing modestly lower, as market participants digested upbeat economic data coming from China and await for a key report on retail sales in the US later this week. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed on the day, closing 0.44% lower.

Stronger than expected economic data coming out of China helped lift the sentiments of market participants following last week’s inflation report. The world's second-largest economy saw both retail sales and industrial production unexpectedly rise in October in a year-over-year period, suggesting that China’s economy is holding up better than expected amid new stay-in-place restrictions and ongoing power shortages. However, prices of new homes dropped 0.25% in October versus September, marking the biggest drop in more than six years as the nation’s real estate market remains under pressure from the Evergrande situation. Here are the numbers:

* Retail Sales: +4.9% YoY vs +3.5 expected
* Industrial Production: +3.5% YoY vs +3% expected

Tomorrow, market participants will receive the Commerce Department’s monthly Retail Sales report, which is expected to show a 1.3% year-over-year rise in retail sales, improving from September’s disappointing 0.7% rise. Moreover, major retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe’s (LOW) are set to report Q3 earnings, which will offer additional data regarding the state of consumer demand.

Last week, markets were spooked by the pace of inflation, with the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) showing the fastest pace of increase in roughly 30 years. which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand.

Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients, “The surge in core inflation in October marks the start of a run of big gains, thanks to surging used auto prices, rebounding airline fares, and faster increases in housing costs. We think core inflation will peak at almost 7% in March, which will pose a serious challenge to the Fed's benign medium-term view. Chair \[Jerome\] Powell will have to convince markets that the combination of rocketing payrolls and soaring inflation does not threaten the transitory story, to which he appears still to be committed. We remain of the view that the Fed will start to hike in September, but a June hike can't be ruled out. If labor participation shows no sign of life by the March FOMC meeting, we expect the Fed to accelerate the taper and then hike in June. This would play badly across all asset markets.” As always, it is important to acknowledge and understand the risks present in the market.

* Shares of Boeing (BA) surged after the company said it was “hopeful” China would resume order of the 737 Max two years after its grounding.
* U.S. crude oil output from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico is set to jump to a record 4.95 million barrels per day in December, a new government forecast showed on Monday. This would bring production in the key U.S. shale patch well above its pre-pandemic average from March 2020.
* Shares of oat-milk maker Oatly (OTLY) fell more than 20% after missing earnings expectations and cutting guidance. The stock is down roughly 50% since IPO back in late-May.
* Shares of Snap (SNAP) were up after the company reached a deal with Sony Music Entertainment to allow the company to use its artist and sounds on the Snapchat App.
* Twitter Inc said on Monday it will expand free access to the social networking site's data to help software developers create tools and products that could promote safer online conversations or curate content. The move is part of Twitter's growing effort over the past year to decentralize the company, a vision that aims to give users more control over what content they see in their Twitter feed or have new ways of sharing content on the site, Amir Shevat, Twitter's head of product for the developer platform, said in an interview.
* Amazon.com Inc has reached a deal to sell virtual medical services to Hilton Hotels in the United States, one of the first major customers for the company’s burgeoning healthcare business. Amazon Care is an on-demand health offering that lets users message or video-chat clinicians and receive home visits in some cities.
* UK ministers are expected to order an in-depth investigation of Nvidia Corp's planned $40 billion acquisition of British chip designer ARM over antitrust and national security concerns. As a huge NVDA bull, hope all goes well!

personalfinance,How to calculate Average credit card interest?,"Hello Folks,

&amp;#x200B;

Can you please help me figure out how to calculate the average interest of all credit cards?  


Eg: Card no.1 has APR of 12.99%

Card no.2 has APR of 15.99%

Card no.3 has APR of 23.99%

 and so on.

What is the average interest that I'll be paying? Is it even possible to calculate this?  


The reason I am asking is I am looking at Credit card debt consolidation and for that I am planning to take a loan.  So, I would like to know if it will be worth taking  one or not.

Eg: Let's say I secure a loan at  17% interest rate but the average interest of all credit cards is 15% , so in this case, it won't make sense to take a loan but instead continue to directly payoff Credit Cards.

Hope I am clear in phrasing my question. Have a wonderful day ahead! 

Thanks,

Sid",finance
economy,"How is it that with inflation, US dollar goes up?","We have inflation due to reckless monetary policies, can someone explain to me how is that when there is more of money being printed and inflation is rampant, the value of U.S dollar goes up?

Edit: I am referring to USD as compared to other currencies and I am wondering why does it go up compared to other currencies when US fed is printing money in par with other western countries.

Edit 2: Some point out that it is because there is global inflation, even though inflation is beyond US economy, United State has higher inflation compared to most of EU, Canada, New Zeeland, Japan and Arab Countries. So the reason is beyond relative inflation!

personalfinance,Pay down my mortgage or invest in the stock market?,"Hi everyone. I’m just looking for some advice on where the best place to put my money is right now. I’m working multiple jobs and finally have some cash to spare. My question is, should I pay down my mortgage (3.65% interest rate until 2036) or invest the spare cash in the stock market? I’ve been doing quite well with stocks recently (via the Stash app), but I’m still learning. 

The reason I’m leaning towards putting it into my mortgage is that I can be debt free sooner, and my principal:interest ratio will increase in each monthly payment the more I pay off.

Is it as simple as the stock market would have to make me more than 3.65% in a year to be a better option than paying down my mortgage?

Any advice would be really appreciated. Thank you.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Negative Fiat Interest Rates?,"How long until fiat interest rates become negative? At what point do people get sick of it and start investing in assets that are not on the downturn from centralized control (crypto)? 

It’s interesting to watch how banks, in the states specifically, keep pushing interest rates lower. 

Jason A William (author: Bitcoin Hard money you can’t f*ck with) illustrated people’s potential to tolerate initial negative rates. 1% negative, people will validate that banks are taking safe care of their money so it’s fine. 3%, maybe people think “hmmmm, wtf is going on?”. 5%, maybe people start to say “no more”. 

At what point do you say no more? There are risks such as crypto market volatility and potential legislation. What else?

CryptoMarkets,"Current dip, quick (DD) (ETH genesis wallets) (Bullish) (bull-run confirmed)","Ok so i'm down to talk about any coins y'all want, but i'm going to focus on BTC &amp; ETH for this **DD**.

BTC's current strongest line of *support* is about **60300**. This line was not broken. If broken, *new* strongest line of *support* is **53k**.

Eth's current strongest line line of *support* is about **4300**. This WAS broken. New strongest line of *support* is **3970**.

Today we have now had four big red candles on the hourly &amp; of those four, TWO were LARGE for the relative recent past. And in my experience I have only ever seen 2-3 LARGE red candles (**whale market orders**) during a dip before we usually continue sideways, continue up, or run up before continuing going back down.

This is my current prediction… but this is actually super **bullish**. This dip was crucial to continue the run, on crypto quant we are in the **beginning** **stages** of ETH genesis wallets starting to sell rather than accumulate. So to put that into perspective to last year, genesis wallets started to sell at 17k-23k then stopped after the peak dip 5 months later from 64k-51k, then started to accumulate all summer again. The eth genesis wallets are important because most of these wallets are owned by veterans in the crypto space who saw the importance of ETH before anyone else and now there bags are huge with the biggest positions in most all mainstream cryptos. So **tracking** these wallets is the smartest way follow the general market.

My own bull case for crypto or (BTC) going to 100k+ by EOY was and has been *unrealistic* imo. But now, after this dip and finally starting to see genesis wallets sell. If we continue up, as i think we will, this next part of the run is usually followed by very steep upwards price movements **directly after the first wave of genesis wallets** start taking profits.

Thus, overall, as a quick DD, if we stay above the current strongest support line of 60300 for BTC and not break 4000 for ETH, then I will be FAR more bullish on this run than I was 3 weeks ago. And if this does play out, then the **parabolic** part of the bull-run is confirmed imo. PLUS Biden signed the new 1 trillion dollar **infrastructure** bill today... very bullish.

The only thing I see bringing us further down from these new recent lows are either unexpected global/national news, new negative global/national stock market FUD, or complete FUD targeting strictly crypto , but most **realistically** I think it will be from the fed announcing an **acceleration** in the f**ed taper plan**. Of which I don't see happening till March 2022.

**Current positions**: Long on everything (no bearish positions currently) (have only taken profit on 10-15% of my bag over the past 10 weeks.

**Current Trade Positions**: Limit long on **BTC** at 60375 (no-hit), Limit long on **ETH** at 4344 (Hit)(Active), Limit long on **EOS** at 4.5 (Hit)(Active), Limit long on **Atom** at 29.2 (Hit)(Active), Limit long on **LTC** at 225 (no-hit), Limit long on **AVAX** at 80 (no-hit), Limit long on **DOT** at 39 (no-hit), Limit long on **Matic** at 1.5 (no-hit), Limit long on WOO at 1.49 (no-hit). There are others that I see as good trading positions - relative to coin price but, I don't have any limit orders on them. And my current swing trade positions (no leverage) that I think are good value are 1inch, sushi, SKL, MIR, and Link.

Edit: ALL my Limit longs hit and i’m riding them on 8-14x leverage each hahah",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Home equity loan,"Hi folks. We bought our house for $625k in Austin this past January. We want to modernize the house so we plan to remodel. Our plan is to stay here in the long run so we did a lot of research to fund our remodeling projects. We looked at refinancing for cash out, helocs, home equity loan and decided that home equity loan is the best option for us right now. We have a 538k mortgage left on our house and applied for a home equity loan of $100k with a credit union at an interest rate is 3.2%. We have a good credit score of 800. 

The lender got back informing us that the home value using their automated valuation model is 591k and they cannot approve the home equity unless we pay for an appraisal.

When we bought our house in January, our home appraisal value was $665k and our Redfin/Zillow estimate is $900k now. Our neighbors sold their house around this price just last week for a similar square footage.

My concern is this lender wants us to pay $800 for an appraisal and I am now starting to doubt if the appraisal will even be close to $900k. Can we hire our own appraiser? Should we just pay and see what happens?Thoughts?",finance

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano. [https://twitter.com/seal\_kiman/status/1443593563846193155](https://twitter.com/seal_kiman/status/1443593563846193155)

29. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

personalfinance,Cash Out Refi - Primary House,"Guys, I’m thinking about doing a cash out refi. Here is the stats:

- Cash Out Amount: $300K
- New Loan Amount: $890K
- Interest Rate: 2.99% (3.01% APR)
- New Monthly Mortgage Payment (principal + interest only): $3.8K
- Current Monthly Mortgage Payment (principal + interest only): $2.5K
- Remaining equity (after refi): more than 20% of the current fair value
- After Tax Monthly Income: $11.5K
- After taken into account property tax, maintenance, child care, car payment, monthly expenses, I have $1K left. 
- I don’t count bonus here since it changes year over year. I assume it is about $20K - $30K every year. I get this as a lump sums at the end of the year.
- Use of the $300K: 
   + $100K: Divide equally into FAANG
   + $200K: Go into SP500 index 
- With the 10% average return on the SP500, I will make 20K each year. FAANG is unknown but let’s just say 5%. So in total, it is $25K per year. The difference in interest only is about $10K per year. So I’m making $15K each year, which equates to 5% net return. It doesn’t sound like much but I can get my money working for me instead of me working. 

Question: Should I do it? Or, should I change anything, like my cash out amount or investment allocation?",finance
Bitcoin,"So you've probably heard at some point some economist say: ""the REAL inflation rate is a lot worse than what the Fed reports in their data"". Here's why they say that:","Technology is a deflationary force. Many say if it weren't for the Fed's intervention, everything should be falling in prices at a rate of -5% per year due to the rapid innovations in the 21st century that increase productivity. Basically, we are always increasingly being able to do more with less, our dollars are always being stretched farther, which is a constant downward pressure on prices. In this era of robotics, internet, automation, excel, AI this rate of deflation is higher than ever before.

Which is why many economists criticize the Fed's CPI data, because their CPI metric doesn't factor that technological deflationary force in the methodology. The Fed is misleading the public by saying they are only inflating the economy at 2% per year, but it's something more like 10% per year because they start from a reference point of 0 instead of -5% if they factored in deflation.

 The CPI is also weighted in goods that are disproportionately getting affected by technological deflation, and underweighting things like housing and asset prices which aren't.  Innovations in farming equipment, genetic modifications to the crops, and new pesticides are always making a Cob of Corn cheaper to produce, while innovations in home building haven't been anywhere as significant. That's why you see such a divergence in the inflation of housing and asset prices vs the actual goods and services within our economy.",cryptocurrency

Crypto has been my go-to method for receiving or transferring any kind of money, and it's better than any kind of bank or payment method I can ever think of.

**What I need to make any bank account where I live:**

* An ID card with biometrics
* Birth Certificate
* Fingerprint + Signature
* Utility bills
* Initial deposit
* Address
* Photos
* Years of personal financial information
* Phone number
* Name
* A ton of fees

All of this to receive, send or save money. Oh, and they give me 0.1% interest rate which is way below the inflation rate. 

**What I need to make a Crypto wallet:**

* An internet connection (Optional if u buy a cold wallet with Crypto)
* A device to store Crypto (Optional if u get a paper wallet)

I get up to double digit interest rates on multiple coins, complete immunity from inflation, send/receive with very little fees on most coins and excellent privacy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, the fact that only 100 million people currently use Crypto astounds me due to how easy and rewarding Crypto is. It is already freeing millions of people from banks and inflation. I truly believe it is going to be the future of money.",cryptocurrency

economy,Tax the rich or don't?,"Corporations are sitting on huge stock piles of cash, money printing is instead causing a deflationary effect because the the money ends up in the stock piles.


 The rich borrow against their assets and get loans with almost no interest rate, preventing the selling of stocks for capital gains tax.


The rich pursue venture capitalist projects, like space exploration which one could argue does not flow back into the economy.

stocks,Taxes aren't the only reason Elon Musk is selling Tesla stock,"Elon Musk’s sales of Tesla stock last week came as little surprise to those who have been following the story of his potential tax bill of $10 billion to $15 billion on stock options granted in 2012. Yet according to accountants, most of his sales don’t appear to be connected with taxes — which could mean he will unload far more stock than expected.

The options on Musk’s 23 million shares expire in August, which is also the deadline for the tax bill due to California and the Internal Revenue Service. Musk started exercising the options Nov. 8. He exercised $2.5 billion in shares and sold $1.1 billion of those exercised options to pay the taxes.

“The shares of common stock were sold solely to satisfy the reporting person’s tax withholding obligations related to the exercise of stock options,” said a footnote to his Securities and Exchange Commission filing for Nov. 8.

On Nov. 9, however, his sales took a turn. Rather than selling as part of an options exercise, Musk started selling from his existing shares. Accountants said it would be impractical for Musk to use those existing shares to pay the tax on his options, since they carry a much higher tax bill.

Musk’s options are taxed as ordinary income, since they are considered compensation. The combined federal and California rate could be as high as 54%. The strike price on the options is $6.24 per share, and Tesla’s stock price on Monday was over $1,600 a share, so he would pay higher taxes — more than $10 billion on his gain of over $20 billion.

Typically, executives sell the exercised shares immediately after they’re purchased to pay the taxes, in what’s known as a “cashless” exercise. Since the shares are sold immediately, there is no additional capital gains tax owed on the shares sold.

Because Musk’s sales beginning Nov. 9 were straight stock sales with little or no cost basis, he would owe long-term capital gains taxes of up to $1.3 billion. Using those proceeds to pay the options tax would amount to paying taxes twice — once on the capital gains and once on the options.

“It wouldn’t make sense from a tax perspective for him to use those proceeds for the options tax,” said Toby Johnston, partner in charge of the Silicon Valley office of Moss Adams, an accounting, consulting and wealth management firm.

Musk admitted that the regular shares are less tax efficient than selling the option shares. “A careful observer would note that my (low basis) share sale rate significantly exceeds my 10b (high basis) option exercise rate, thus closer to tax maximization than minimization,” he tweeted Sunday.

So why is Musk selling the non-option stock given its relatively high tax cost? Tax experts and Tesla analysts say he will still exercise the options before August, since letting them expire would leave billions on the table, along with added ownership of the company, even after paying the taxes. That means he still has billions in stock to exercise and billions to sell to pay the taxes.

The $5.7 billion and whatever additional non-option shares he sells are straight cash-outs. While he does owe federal capital gains taxes on the sales, he likely won’t have to pay state taxes on the gains, since he is likely now a Texas tax resident. The same rule doesn’t apply to his options taxes, though, since those are considered employee benefits and earned while he was in California.

Accountants say the sales aren’t likely for charity, since he would have simply donated appreciated shares rather than selling and paying a capital gains tax first. He could be using the proceeds for Space X, his privately held space company, or for another private venture. Or he could simply want to take money off the table after years of being stock-rich and cash-poor and borrowing off his stock price to fund his lifestyle. Federal taxes are also likely to increase next year, creating an added incentive if he were already considering a cash-out.

Whatever the reasons, Musk will likely end up selling far more than the $10 billion to $15 billion he needs for taxes. He conducted a Twitter poll Nov. 6 in which he asked his followers whether he should sell 10% of his stock and said he would abide by the results. In the vote, 58% of those who responded said he should sell 10% of his shares, which could mean over $20 billion in sales in total.

“For people at his level, taxes aren’t always the primary driver of investment decisions,” Johnston said. “It still feels like there is a piece missing to the puzzle that we may not know about.”",finance
Banking,Out of Balance,"So I work at a bank, were currently short staffed. I’ve been there since Aug. 30th, we had a new guy start on Nov. 1st, then its just my manager. I was recently out of office for a few days(vacation). Been with the company for almost 3 years but just recently tranferred to this department. During my time off my boss was apparently out of balance by $1,100 on the Friday. Monday half way through the day the money showed up and she’s the one who found it. What are the chances she’ll get in trouble? The whole situation sounds sketchy. 3 people, I’m not one of them, looked everywhere for the money and couldn’t find it on both Friday and Monday(yesterday).Then all of a sudden it showed up around 3 PM. I was not involved at all, but was audited anyway and everything related to me was fine and I passed all my audits. I know her boss and her boss’s boss got involved and when I left last night they were still there. I mean the money turned up, but like if 6 eyes couldn’t find it on Friday, and there’s only 3 spots it should be, then on monday it appears in the first place they should have looked, does that not sound like an attempt to steal? My manager doesn’t seem like the type, but she’s been making some big errors recently like losing Power of Attorney papers and Death Certificates in the last 30 days. Now moneys been misplaced and then magically appears? I din’t know it just sounds a little weird.",finance

My goal is to minimize any kind of closing cost. Since the plan is to sell the current home and repay the loan within a year, the interest rate doesn't matter so much to me.

personalfinance,Can someone help clarify the wiki on Roth vs Traditional?,"“Mid income: If you're in the 22% or 24% federal tax bracket, you should probably read the long version. Sorry! Note that if you decide on Traditional contributions (401(k) and/or IRA) and those bring your MAGI down enough that your marginal tax rate is definitely 12% then you should almost certainly make Roth contributions (401(k) and/or IRA) for the remainder of the year.”

I am married filing jointly with a taxable income of ~$100k and max out my Roth 401k. With the standard deduction, my taxable income is ~$75k, which means the money I put into my Roth is taxed at the 12% rate. I expect a pension and other retirement income so it makes sense to me to put money into Roth instead of traditional. 

However, I currently have some non-taxable income that I expect to convert to taxable in a few years that will bump me to ~$125k, which is where I’m confused. 

With a standard deduction it’s about $100k taxable. Contributing to traditional would lower that to ~$80k, which puts all of my income in the 12% bracket. If I put it in Roth, my taxable is still ~$100k and the money I put in Roth is taxed at the marginal rate of 22% or 24%. 

The Wiki says I should put it in Roth, but aren’t I exposing myself to additional tax unnecessarily? Am I just hedging against future tax increases or jumps in salary?

# [Stock futures are flat as investors evaluate big retail earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained after better-than-expected results from Walmart and Home Depot.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow, which contains the two big retailers, added 70 points, or 0.19%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly in the red.
*****
&gt; Walmart kicked off a busy week of retail earnings by saying third-quarter profit and revenue was well above estimates with U.S. same-store sales jumping 9.2%, excluding fuel. The company also raised its forecast for 2021, saying adjusted earnings per share will be around $6.40 versus its prior expectations of between $6.20 and $6.35. The shares moved slighly lower in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Home Depot gained more than 1%, however, after its third-quarter earnings beat estimates on a 9.8% sales burst.
*****
&gt; Retail sales figures for October came in 1.7% higher than 0.7% in September, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected sales to have jumped by 1.5%.
*****
&gt; Industrial production numbers will also be released Tuesday, as well as the NAHB housing market index survey.
*****
&gt; During regular trading Monday, the Dow dipped about 13 points, or 0.04%, for its fourth negative session in the last five. At the high of the day the 30-stock index gained about 136 points. The S&amp;P 500 finished the day unchanged at 4,682.87. The benchmark index moved between gains and losses during the session, at one point gaining 0.3%, while also trading 0.21% lower. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.04%. The Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer, declining 0.45%.
*****
&gt; Stocks’ move came as interest rates rose, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note topping 1.62% while the 30-bear Treasury bond rose above 2%.
*****
&gt; Inflation fears are weighing on the market after last month’s consumer price index posted its largest annual increase in more than three decades. Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he believes inflation will moderate in 2022, but that “the path to lower inflation [will] begin with higher inflation in the front half of the year.”
*****
&gt; “The stickier drivers of inflation are likely to persist, but our base case is that they will not outweigh the improvement we expect in the transitory elements,” he wrote in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; On Monday afternoon President Joe Biden signed the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law. The package includes funding for transportation, broadband and utilities.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off their first negative week in six, but stocks are still trading around all-time high levels. As Wall Street strategists look to 2022 some, including Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, believe the picture looks muted.
*****
&gt; “With financial conditions tightening and earnings growth slowing, the 12-month risk/reward for the broad indices looks unattractive at current prices,” he said Monday in a note to clients. “However, strong nominal GDP growth should continue to provide plenty of good investment opportunities at the stock level for active managers,” he added. His 12-month base target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,400, which is 6% below where the index closed on Monday.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my education loan in a single payment or keep my company stocks?,"Hello, this is my second post here within a short period of time. This time, it's in regards to paying off education debt, which comes with a 12.5% interest, high interest rate since the loan was sanctioned in India. however, with the currency exchange, my payments have decreased over the last few years, from ~900 down to ~850 per month. 
I will be vesting some of my employer stock in Feb 2022. I plan on using that money to pay off my student debt + kitchen remodelling for our house. 
My employer is considered a growth stock, and people expect the stock to go 10x or more within the next few years ~5-8 ish would be their bets I'd imagine. 
So do you think I'm missing out on more gains by selling those stocks or is a guaranteed ~10-12% return always worth it? 

P.S. if I don't use funds coming up this Feb, I may end up using some of the stocks I vest later on in the year or from a past employer, I have those stocks but they're under moratorium to sell till summer next year but none of those will fully cover my debt payments.",finance
stocks,The Rivian IPO got me thinking. Clearly the US stock market is overvalued. And yet it keeps going higher.,"Out of 698 US businesses worth over $10b, you've got 25% of those selling at 10x sales. So, if you have only $1b in sales, you're worth $10b.

You'd have to grow sales 20% per year for the next 13 years to get to 1x sales.

Only about 4% of companies worth over $10b have grown sales at, or above, 20% over the last 10 years. This figure drops to 2% if you include all US SEC reporting businesses.

That means, roughly, about 20% of your stock market valuations are insanely overpriced. Rivian being one of them. That paired with the Shiller P/E being close to all-time highs, and inflation spiking well above expectation, signals potential disaster on the horizon. Be careful out there peeps. If the FED starts talking rate hikes, expect a sell-off.

cybersecurity,What is life like working in Cybersecurity?,"I'm currently working as an IT engineer, and I have been working a job that is below my skill level in the public sector because it doesn't require on-call or anything like that. I'm considering pursuing cybersecurity as it has always been an interest of mine, but I have two major concerns. I worry that this move would put me in a situation where my work life would take up a much bigger portion of my time (longer hours, on-call etc.), and that most of the jobs I would be looking at applying for would be for either big tech silicon valley companies or the federal government. I have no interest in working for either type of organization for a whole host of reasons that I'm not going to go into because this isn't the appropriate forum to do such a thing. 

Overall I'm trying to get a sense for how stressful and time consuming the lifestyle of a cybersecurity engineer really is. In the end I would rather have free time than make more money, but it would be nice to do something more challenging and exciting if I can find the right fit.

personalfinance,Looking for some advice on how to proceed with financing our new home,"We (my wife and I) accepted on offer on our home a couple weeks ago and close on 11/30. We have 1 month free rent back and another month at the new owners prorated mortgage if we need. Just this past weekend we had our offer accepted on a new home. This was the 3rd home we had offered on, and with our finances, we would have only been able to submit an offer contingent on the sale of our home, which would not have worked in this market. So we offered the home with my father-in-law's name on the title/loan, because he has the finances to qualify for an additional mortgage. The idea would've been to buy the home from him later through a real estate lawyer.

But, the current owners of the new home asked for a late closing date (12/28), so in theory, we'd have enough time to switch the title/loan to our name and qualify for a loan ourselves. Complicating the matter, my FIL qualified through Fairway at a 3.25% interest rate with 0 points, and I've seen rates a quite a bit lower online at about 2.875 with 0 or little points (ex. Better.com). The interest rate wasn't the primary concern when my FIL qualified for the loan, it was mostly the ability to close quickly and competition against potential cash offers. The total loan amount on the home would be $528,000, so a difference of that much is something like $142 a month, which isn't nothing.

Some info that may or may not be helpful:

\-Current home is in Oregon, new home is in Washington state

\-We do plan on staying in the new home long-term, 10-20 years or more

Here's what I think our options are:

1. Continue with the plan with my FIL's name on the loan/title, and qualify ourselves separately, and work through a real estate attorney after the fact.
2. Continue like we're buying the home through Fairway with FIL's name on the loan, then down the road, but before closing say we're switching lenders and names on title
3. Switch our names over to the current loan/offer, and refinance later (probably the most expensive option

Any thoughts how how to proceed would be much appreciated. Thanks!",finance
CryptoCurrency,US Idea: Have a bracket in short term capital gains tax where it isn't taxed similar to income,"So I was thinking about how in the future we most likely will see commonly the average person staking and making passive income with crypto. Like it highly depends on how banks want to do this, but I imagine sooner or later some bank will basically have similar soft staking abilities like you have on exchanges even if the coin outside of that requires it to be locked. And in this it would push for people to bank with them vs other places.

&amp;#x200B;

So with this in mind, I can see most/all banks doing what [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) is doing where you can use your crypto to buy things. Where it auto-sells, converts, and sends fiat to the store (at least that is how I think it works there, but I think this will be how it will work with banks).  

This means there will be a ton sooner or later who never paid capital gains taxes because they stay mostly out of investments. And maybe they are getting paid in crypto. Like even if fiat changes to crypto, the FIFO and other rules would apply where average people will be paying capital gains taxes or breaking the law not knowing what they did was a capital gains tax.

# Even if it is the banks will send the person the tax stuff, the problem is capital gains tax is much higher than income tax and now this massively hurts those in poverty.

So lets the USA gov switches it's fiat to crypto or it's some midway point but the crypto version for security reasons has staking ability. (yes, it makes it far more secure than not and it's smart to have this ability for something that is 100% meant for trade)

Now only you get paid min wage and lets say that is about $7.25 but it is in the crypto $. You live paycheck to paycheck or debt to debt, but your pay goes into your bank. And since the bank auto stakes things, now whatever you get paid makes more money on it's own.

Because you're paycheck to paycheck or debt to debt this means you're going to use 100% or near 100% of your balance. This means the poorest of our society will now have to pay 

1. Normal income tax giving they make above a given amount depending on the area.
2. Income tax on what you made during staking. IMO staking and mining shouldn't be taxed because you're helping in minting new coins while doing a bunch other things.
3. Sells tax and other tax dealing with what they have or are buying.
4. But now they have to pay capital gains tax **for every cent of the value difference.** And keep in mind, since it most likely will be in the account less than a year (most likely less than a month). This is taxed as short term capital gains tax which is taxed at a much higher tax rate and there is grace period where you don't need to pay taxes.

Currently income tax it is something like below $11k income per year you're not taxed federal. And most states won't tax below that too. Long term (holding for 12 months or longer) capital gains below $40k isn't taxed. But short term $0.01+ is taxable at a much much higher tax rate than the other 2 even where they start taxing. 

If you agree with me that short term capital gains tax shouldn't be taxed until the person hits a given number (for me I think it should be the same as income tax). Then please let your representative know, share it with others, and lets work on this to make it likely.",cryptocurrency

defi,Reduced Volatility and Fixed Interest Rates: The Need of the Hour for DeFi,"[https://btcmanager.com/volatility-fixed-interest-rates-need-hour-defi/](https://btcmanager.com/volatility-fixed-interest-rates-need-hour-defi/)

Daily headlines, crypto price charts, and social media have engraved the narrative of volatility being a feature of DeFi and crypto in the masses. Anything DeFi or crypto with no mention of the word ‘volatility is viewed with a filter of skepticism. Contrarily, most content on DeFi and crypto use ‘less volatility’ as a must-have for a better future. 

While volatility is exciting and keeps the users on their toes, it also deters investors who yearn for stability, making DeFi inaccessible to the masses. In this position of stalemate, there is a definite need for products that are built on the lines of stability for future adoption and use. This not only empowers current users but also paves the way for newer market participants to adopt DeFi products. In the current DeFi landscape, however, there is a serious lack of such products. 

**The Current Landscape Of DeFi Products**

The whole DeFi ecosystem seems to be growing at an unprecedented rate today. Even though the market made a pitfall in May this year, it was able to effectively recover and most DeFi projects are now more valuable than ever. But, if you look beneath the surface you realize that this industry is teeming with projects that lack innovation and a future vision. Most of the DeFi products today are built around short-term profits and hardly seem to incorporate the vision of mass adoption. 

This gives rise to a highly volatile landscape that does not appeal to the world markets. To add to this, a majority of projects in DeFi also face a lack of liquidity. This further increases the market volatility and creates an atmosphere where asset prices can easily be manipulated. For DeFi to outgrow and eventually replace traditional finance it is important to incorporate some of its tried and tested systems. Especially in the aspect of decentralized lending and borrowing, DeFi could take a cue or two from traditional finance to unlock and better utilize locked liquidity.  

**The Void In Decentralised Lending And Borrowing**

The global lending market is worth $6.9 trillion. In comparison to this, the DeFi lending market [worth $106.58 billion](https://defipulse.com/) accounts for only 1.5%. Behind this unparalleled success of the traditional lending market is a system of tools that have enabled financial institutions, businesses, and individuals to effectively control their yield and better utilize liquidity. Products like rate trading and interest swapping have existed in the financial markets for decades and enabled players to have a level of control over their expected yield. 

In the DeFi landscape, however, there is no way for lenders to control their expected yield. They’re on a constant rollercoaster ride with APYs fluctuating between extremities. This is because the interest rates on DeFi lending protocols are also constantly fluctuating. If users could have control over their interest rates, they would also have control over their overall yield, creating a stable financial environment. The kind that can attract larger financial institutions. 

While there have been quite a few protocols attempting to achieve this, it is Unreal Finance that hits the bull’s eye with its vision. 

**Concept Of Fixed Interest In Yield Farming**

[Unreal Finance](https://unreal.finance/) is a DeFi yield futures platform that revolutionizes the concept of lending and borrowing in DeFi. Taking cues from the established traditional finance, the protocol aims to bring to DeFi the tools that have made that industry so successful. But, along with this, the protocol also introduces a combination of products that set up DeFi for the big goal of mass adoption. 

While facilitating interest swapping in DeFi, Unreal Finance gives it a new dimension by allowing users to tokenize and lock interest rates on the platform. This gives users a break from fluctuating interest rates and an unprecedented level of control over their expected yield. When users provide liquidity to DeFi protocols through Unreal Finance, they receive yield-bearing tokens and ownership tokens.

These tokens separate the yield from its underlying staked assets and create opportunities for users to speculate on and trade this yield across platforms. This means that they get access to their future yield instantly.

The advantage? Unlocking a tremendous amount of liquidity that can be used across the ecosystem. When liquidity increases, stability increases across DeFi protocols. This combined with controllable interest rates and instant yields significantly reduces the volatility, attracting world markets to DeFi. 

**Reducing Volatility; The Gamechanger For DeFi**

The future growth and worldwide acceptance of DeFi are largely dependent on volatility. Only when volatility is reduced will DeFi become appealing to the vast majority of users. In this aspect, the introduction of fixed interest rates by Unreal Finance can gear up the industry for mass adoption by significantly reducing volatility. Along with this, the amount of control it gives users over their yield earned can create a sense of stability among investors, attracting them towards this space.

CryptoCurrency,Here is how crypto could realistically save the economy,"# Problem

The fact is, what it takes to repair a road doesn't change. The amount of it really doesn't change. I'm sure we all agree on that.

But when a gov has to print more money to pay for it + all the corruption + everything else that is or isn't needed. This means down the road will need to be repaired, the materials and amounts is the same. But the prices increased due to money printing and this means more money would have to be printed in order for the gov to afford the new prices. And then the loop keeps happening.

**Note when the gov prints money the $ loses buying power. What is buying power? It's simply what you can buy with the amount of money you have. A lost in buying power is the increase of prices which means you can buy less to nothing at all with the amount you hold.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Solution

There is only 2 ways to fix this without taking down the gov.

1. All federal programs their budget will have to be cut by 10% of last years budget, and it must stay there for 10 years. And no more money printing. The gov owes over $200T or $300T and each tax season they collect about $3.3T while the base pay to keep things is higher. If I remember it is closer to $4t. Which means the money printer has to brr just to make up the difference. A cutback on spending fixes the difference, and after 10 years the gov should have enough there to start increasing the budget of things.
2. Switch to a deflation asset. **Basically switch the pay back from $ amount to value**, and if they want to jump the value of things. They would do the reverse and remove money from the system. This increases the buying power for anyone holding, this making their own money far more valuable, and it is far far far easier to pay for things. The deflation asset IMO I think it should be crypto. The problem with gold and a number of others is security + if we find a crap ton more gold then this lowers the overall value. Where with crypto what you have is all that is out there.

IMO 1 isn't possible due to corruption. So I am waiting for 2 to be a thing

NOTE: The numbers I was remembering off the top of my head so they might be a little off. But the point of it isn't the numbers, it is the methods on how to fix it. For 1 to work we would have to cut a ton of waste, get the gov nearly completely out of our life outside of security and a few minor things, and we would have to somehow end corruption. For 2 to work, we just need to switch to a deflation asset, and switch the system from $ amount to value of $. While I don't want the nanny gov or any of the other stuff. It won't hurt us in that way anymore at least.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: With 2 (switching us to a deflation standard again). When the gov does end up trying to push for corrupt programs or whatever. Since the focus isn't on how many $ to pay something off, but the focus is now the value of the $ to pay something off. This means when the gov wants to do what they want to now (print money to pay for a program). They must burn money to pay for programs since printing money would devalue the value and it would act as burning money today to pay for programs. This means if the gov wants to be corrupt, it actually increases your buying power while punishing the gov itself since outside of that 1 time thing. There is only so much money they can burn.

**But note for it to work the key is the system would have to be based on value of the $ and not how many $ it takes. So contracts would instead have to switch from something like $13m for completion of contract, to x amount of y crypto paid in $.**

&amp;#x200B;

And again, why not gold or something like that. When we get into a space society where we are mining things in space. It is likely we will easily find gold or whatever which would devalue the economy. Where as crypto is highly controlled, highly secure, and it is man made. It's one of the few if not only current deflation assets that could work.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

I forgot to add 2 is a trustless system. For 1 to work, this would require the gov to never be corrupt again, and for them to always do the right thing. This is a trust system and when they break your trust the system breaks down. 2 since it is a trustless system it doesn't require your trust or their trust for it to work.  

What that means is as long as the system doesn't change or abandoned then you don't need to trust their side and their side doesn't need to trust you. It just works.

The interesting thing with crypto is it is transparent. Then if you switch things to the value of the dollar and not the amount of dollars. It forces the gov to not print more money and stay within their limits. Like printing money takes away their power and burning money gives power to the citizens since sooner or later that path will equal families or people having more money than the gov itself and with the buying power increase during that it means the ones in poverty won't be harmed by bad government spending.

That's the thing. The system has to be trustless. And the only way I see that happening is through this method.

Now is it likely? No. But it only has to happen 1 time. Like once it is in place the only way the gov could remove it is by changing the law.",cryptocurrency

&amp;#x200B;

# How would this get it's value?

This can get it's value by the people. So the crypto the gov uses to measure it's value shouldn't be crypto that is used to buy/sell things. It should however be treated the same as currency trading. This opens the door on multiple fronts. The biggest is it allows the people themselves to having a indirect vote on things and the gov job would mostly be down to trying to get this value up as much as possible while not leaving the system.

So lets say if country x their companies in the country goes into space and fines a lot of resources from mining in space. Chances are people/investors will invest more heavily into the crypto, and this will help drive up the value. Where as lets say if the country does horrible things to it's people and people don't want to be link to that country, or if the country doesn't do anything. Then the reverse will happen. Then to top that off, instead of countries like the USA sending plane loads of money to another country and who knows what happens there. The country like USA could just invest directly into the crypto representing the value of their $, and if they end up doing something stupid the USA gov could pull their money back out. And since liquidity values are important, it is much easier to tank the price vs increasing it. And since it would be stupid for the gov to through all it's money into other economies, this means the people have maybe slightly less but almost equal power as the gov.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the big thing is since the gov does put money into other systems and the gov doesn't lose any access to the money they put into a foreign system. It is let me boost your economy by investing into the crypto your economy is based on. This means as their economy takes off, the gov just like normal people could slowly pull back out to pay for programs and they can use this to lower taxes or in some cases eliminate the need of taxes some years. This also could mean smaller groups within the gov like states within the USA could use the money they have to do the same. So it could help both nationally and locally wise.

I am a 1st year grad student in the Boston area and I'd like some advice on how to figure out and pay for my taxes. Before you say that I could look this up and figure it out, believe me I tried! But it really makes no sense to me and I am so worried to mess it all up. I tried asking around and seeing what other students are doing but I am getting mixed advice. My stipend is about $3386/month and some students are saying I am supposed to pay about $725 in federal taxes and $145 in state taxes monthly. However, other students say my taxes should be more like half of that (Around $400) and that I should save up and pay quarterly instead. I have no clue how to figure out which one is correct and how to go about paying them? Can someone please teach me how to do this? Any help is very much appreciated! Also not sure if this is important but my family lives in Colorado and I just moved to MA.

Thank you!",finance
investing,Is a correction even possible under current market conditions?,"Genuine question. Is a broad, cross-index correction possible given the current market conditions? I honestly think not. I think due to QE and Fed bolstering there is so much cash sloshing around looking for a home that anything with an even remote prospect of return is instantly invested in.

Hear me out. I really think this is a new paradigm, not as in oh market goes up forever and this time is different, and more as in this amount of QE and stimulus mixed with bare bones low interest rate has never been achieved before. We have never had a market with the combination of those 2.

So here's how I see things going forward:

1. Dumb money is here to stay. There's just too damn much of it flooding the market looking for a home. 

2. Retail investor sentiment has changed. No one is risk-adverse on a broad scale anymore. Investors are willing to hold through dips and plunge more cash into them.

3. Interest rates are rock bottom, and there's the possibility they stay that way or go negative due to debt implications if they're raised.

What's going to change? Is retail suddenly going to become risk adverse? Is the amount of capital flooding the system going to be reigned in? Are interest rates going to drastically rise, if at all?

I don't think so. I quite literally think that given market conditions and sentiment a correction is not even possible. Do all the remind me's you want. The market is unable to correct.",finance

personalfinance,How much should I expect to get for a 2021 tax refund?,"I won't go into details, but 2021 is the first year in my adult life (48yo) that I have made any kind of decent money. Given that I have been getting a LOT of taxes taken out, I've been expecting a decent-sized refund for 2021. I've used some tax calculators I've found online, and most say that I should only expect maybe $2000-$2500usd back. Where the hell did all my money go?!

As of my last paycheck, I've grossed $76,763, so I'll probably have made $80,000 by year's end. My YTD taxes so far (Federal, Medicare, Social Security, State W/H, State disability) come to $21,025. I have also been contributing 10% of my gross into a 403b, if that counts for anything.

investing,Why is the Fed not raising rates?,"I hear a lot of arguments about the fed simply opening the floodgates to please Wall St and keep the economy rising, but that argument could have been made at any point in history; yet in the past the fed have acted responsibly.

Surely this reckless inflatory push has something to do with competition between the US and China/Russia?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Nov 16, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 16, 2021**

Stocks gained today, with market participants releasing a sigh of relief as new economic data showed consumer demand remains strong despite ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages. Moreover, major retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Lowe’s (LOW), and Home Depot (HD) are set to release quarterly earnings this week, giving us more information into the state of consumer spending in the US. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP.

The Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers

* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected
* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%
* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%

The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. 

Matthew Shay, President of the National Retail Federation, said of the report, “Today’s numbers show that consumers are getting a jump on their holiday shopping. We continue to urge consumers to shop early and shop safely, and we fully expect this holiday season to be one for the record books”.

Meanwhile, two of the largest retailers in the US, Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD), reported earnings today, with both companies demolishing earnings (though WMT stock did not react positively). Here are the numbers:

* **Walmart (WMT)** 
   * Revenue: $140.53 billion vs $135.60 billion expected 
   * Earnings per Share (EPS): $1.45 vs $1.40 expected
   * Sames Store Sales: +9.2% vs +6.9% expected 
   * eCommerce Sales: +8% vs +1.9% expected 
* **Home Depot (HD)**
   * Revenue: $36.82 billion vs $35.01 billion expected
   * Earnings per Share (EPS): $3.92 vs $3.40 expected
   * Same Store Sales: +6.1% vs 1.9% expected

These reports came at the tail end of what has already been an exceptionally strong earnings season. As of Friday, 92% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported actual results, and of these, 81% of them had reported better-than-expected earnings results, according to FactSet.

**Highlights**

* Somehow, someway, shares of Rivian (RIVN) keep rising after its blockbuster IPO, with the company now being the third largest auto manufacturer by market cap at roughly $150 billion despite barely completing any deliveries. This is, by far, the craziest valuation I’ve ever seen. 
* The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that import prices rose 1.2% on a monthly basis in October, coming in well above the 0.4% rise for September. This was also above the 1.0% increase consensus economists expected for October, according to Bloomberg data.
* Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are on fire after the company projected that its chipset business will average “midteens” revenue growth through its fiscal year 2024. That’s well above the 8% average contemplated by Wall Street’s current estimates.
* Netflix (NFLX) is set to release the highly anticipated sequel to Tiger King tomorrow. It seems like Netflix has been on an amazing roll as of late and now has a higher market cap than Disney (DIS)
* Lucid Motors (LCID) has now overtaken Ford Motors (F) in market cap
* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly working to make its own in-house modem chip that allows wireless connection for iPhones by 2023. Qualcomm (QCOM), which currently supplies modem chips for all Apple devices, estimates Apple will self-supply 80% of modem chips by 2023. 
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***

CryptoCurrency,"Fractional Reserve, The Unsung Hero of the Ages","It all started with gold bullion vaults over 100 years ago. They discovered they could issue 10 times more promises than their actual reserves, and usually everything would be fine. Except sometimes they would go bankrupt because 11% of (greedy) people wanted their gold back. Oops. 

Then some very nice men realized that fractional reserve could still work, but only if everyone did it together. So they invented the Federal ~~Fractional~~ Reserve and made the 1920s roar. Everything was going great until everyone went bankrupt again.

The wise and generous banks realized that it was because everyone was still owning their own gold. *They weren't fractionally reserving hard enough*. So they issued everyone the freedom of having their gold confiscated. Things were back on track until some racist European dude convinced everyone to try out fascism.

But little did mustache man know, that fractional reserve thrives in warfare. After the big flex in Europe, everyone ~~had no other choice~~ voluntarily embraced the big guns of fractional reserve. For some weird reason the continent of Asia had doubts for a few decades, but eventually they figured it out too.

Recently, some guy name Dorian invented magic internet money; and crazy as it sounds, he *didn't* make it fractional reserved. We're not sure if he was just ignorant of history, or maybe he really did want to start another war. But luckily, everyone else already knew that fractional reserve is the way, and they went to work. 

Starting with Mt Gox. It was a good first try, but much like the gold bullion vaults of old - too many greedy people tried to withdraw at once. But then, some very smart people at iFinex realized that we should just copy the banks. First you start with some reserves, make some tokens, and then distribute them. Ah but remember, we need *fractional* reserve if we're going to avert disaster. 

So in their wisdom, they started loaning out newly minted Tethers to benevolent market makers ... Similar to investment banking ... New Tethers (effectively) don't exist until the loan is issued -- fractionally reserved! This worked so well, that just like the dollar dominates international trade; Tether now dominates crypto exchanges.

Okay! So now we're getting really close to the ideal, but we're still not quite there. You see, most coins have a transparent ledger; which sadly, prevents the exchanges from fractionally reserving them too. For some weird reason, when people *know* that an exchange only holds a fraction of their coins, they always end up doing a run just like the old bullion vaults, and just like Gox.

But luckily, there is one coin that's really good for this purpose. It has an *obfuscated* ledger, and so people can't see that their coins are fractionally reserved on the exchanges. This is really great, because it prevents human greed from interfering with the profits of our wise and benevolent leaders. 

Now you're probably wondering which coin I'm talking about; but really, it's best not to say. I'll just call it coin X.MyRecent investigations show that human greed has already caused too much problems for fractionally reserved exchanges. Just trust that TheSmartGuys™ are taking care of everything, and they have personally assured me that we will never see a run on this (or any) coin. Ever.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I learned the power of the CFPB,"TLDR; After almost a full year of trying to get my money from closing an account with my credit union, I finally received it today because I filed a complaint with the CFPB. 

In February of this year, I closed an account with my credit union because I hadn't made any transactions with them in years due to having no locations in the area I moved to. The initial interaction with staff was pleasant. They were able to close my account and they assured me a check would arrive within 2 weeks to the new address I provided to them. I waited the 2 weeks and nothing came in the mail. I called back the credit union and the representative was apologetic and said to wait just a bit longer and call back if nothing changed. She gave me the check number and told me to keep an eye out for it. But, if I wanted them to send me a new check, I could fill out their forms and cancel the original. 

I took a look at the forms and there were two issues I had. 1. They required it to be notarized, which would cost ME time and money for an issue that wasn't my fault. 2. It was an indemnity form. So, if for any reason the original check got cashed, even after putting a stop on it, the responsible party to pay would be ME. Again, for something that wasn't my fault. I refused to sign it. 

I waited the 3 months for the check to be invalid on it's own, and no one had cashed it. It was lost in the mail. I called back the credit union AGAIN and spoke with someone new. She, again, was very apologetic and assured me she would issue a new check and it would arrive in \~2 weeks. No need to sign the forms to stop the check, because so much time had passed. 

""Great!"" I thought. I hung up and waited 2 more weeks. And no check arrived. I decided to wait another 3 months so the check would expire on it's own again so that I wouldn't need to go through that whole process of arguing against signing that indemnity form. 

3 months go by, no check. Once again I called the credit union and spoke with yet another representative. She informed me that no check was ever re-cut or re-sent 3 months ago, the previous rep had lied to me. This new rep said that because I never signed the indemnity form, they couldn't re-cut a new check. I asked to speak to a manager, because at this point I was angry and felt like the bank was jerking me around. She refused to let me speak to a manager and insisted she could handle it. She kept talking over me and was rushing to get me off the phone. Eventually, she said that they would waive any fee associated with getting a new form signed and that a new form would be sent for me to fill out. I was frustrated and agreed and hung up.

The form she sent me was THE SAME FORM from before (she gave me the impression it would be something different). I was furious at this point and went to my husband to rant. He was able to calm me down and insisted I report this issue to the CFPB. So, I did. After, I sent an email to the newest rep stating my disappointment. I stated that she refused to let me speak to a manager, refused to listen to my plight,  and she wanted me to repeat steps I had already taken; I told her that I reported the issue to the CFPB. She responded within the hour stating that she never said I couldn't speak to the manager, basically called me a liar, and was over-all nasty. We sent a few emails back and forth and neither of us budged. I left it as is and waited for a response from the CFPB. 

They were saints. They didn't cover closed account issues, but opened a new case for me with the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), who in turn also didn't deal with those issues, who then forwarded it along to the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. From the time I submitted that request, to today (about 2 weeks), I finally got my money. The credit union sent a FedEx priority mailed check, with a letter of apology AND 8% interest for the 11 months I was without my money. I wish I summitted that issue a long time ago. 

I'm relieved to have my money and can put this all behind me. But, a few tips for anyone in my shoes:

Transfer as much money out of your account that is allowed (if there are minimums to keep it open) and THEN close the account, once you have the money cleared in your other account. 

Make frequent calls. Don't assume the representatives actually followed through on their actions, follow-up frequently yourself. 

Contact the CFPB if they refuse to work with you. I can't stress this enough, I'm confident this is why my money was returned to me so quickly after I submitted that issue.

Best of luck to you all, and thanks for listening.",finance

Joe Biden says infrastructure bill will build new infrastructure like roads, clean water, public transport, provide internet to the people in the USA and many more. I am confused, is USA a poor 3rd world country like a poor country in Africa that does not have these facilities and are required to make the USA a developed country?

The president also says that this is deflationary that is increase competition between companies causing lowering prices and he said it fixes the supply chain issues/shortages that will lower prices.

Is the Infrastructure bill paid by the taxpayers or from the money printer from the fed? If Money printer then how is the infrastructure bill deflationary cause the fed printed a s\*\*\* load of money to pay for this which is inflationary right?

Why is the DXY Dollar Index Chart going up when there has been high inflation, there has been no interest rates increased and there still is Quantitative Easing still going on till the middle of next year. I don't get it confused.

DXY is putting pressure on Bitcoin otherwise Bitcoin would have been $100k by now.

I don't understand how the fed can keep inflation under control unless they raise interest rates matching the inflation rate &amp; stop QE too. I'm talking about raising interest rates to like 10% minimum as I don't understand how a silly small 0.25% quarter of 1% raise will tackle inflation. I don't get it.

personalfinance,Roth IRA for 22% fed tax bracket,"Hi all,

Looking for some advice or thoughts on my retirement situation. I started maxing out my 401k at work a few years ago. This year, I recently switched jobs and will not be offered 401k participation for 3 months. This means that I will not be able to max out my 401k this year. 

I have a few options to make up for this, but let me know if I am missing anything.

1) do a back door Roth even though I am currently in the 24% bracket (even with all deductions). I can easily max this out and not miss the money.  I am behind on my retirement contributions because I took the long route in school. Doing more Roth will allow me to diversify buckets in retirement even if my tax rate stays the same. 

2) open a solo401k for the side gig income that I make doing Rover. I expect to have made about $2000 net this year (1099 income). 

3) just save up more money towards my down payment (very HCOL) area. We are aggressively saving to attain a 20% down payment. 

Let me know your thoughts and if I missed any other options.

Say what you will about Elon in the cryptospace, his tweet about Doge woke up a lot of people to get into Cryptocurrency.  Now, what you do once you jump into Cryptocurrency but only stick with a meme coin without learning anything else is up to you.

Heck, I only discovered Reddit because I was trying to learn more about Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency space. 

Then I started to learn about the history of currency in civilization, learned a bit about The Roman Emprie and their down fall due to defacing their currency, learned about the history of currency, found Cardano and started learning about NFTS (that isn't just about Art).

I looked over my report in more detail and I have marks that are not legitimate, but I have no proof. I have three credit cards that are in my name, but it was my ex wife that used them and I kinda knew about them but I wasn’t fully sure about them. I have a collections (paid) mark that was supposed to be removed, but I lost the proof of the agreement. 

I also, have multiple hard pulls that I didn’t give written or verbal consent. I also, have a ton of old information that’s no longer accurate. 

What, should I do or where should I start. Any advice or support is welcomed.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Schools Showing Anti-Crypto Propaganda to Students,"I thought some may be interested in this. My son told me that the student news channel they watch was on the topic of crypto today. He said it was all about how crypto mining and NFTs are destroying the environment and causing climate change.

He said they also talked about people getting paid in crypto. The episode suggested that paying people in crypto is some horrible inhumane practice because it’s unstable. 

Just to be clear, I haven’t seen this myself but I trust that my son wasn’t making this up. He said he thought that some of the things they were saying weren’t true so he was looking for clarification on it. 

Personally, I find it a little disturbing that they’re misrepresenting and showing only one viewpoint on this technology to middle school children. A lot of them just blindly believe what they’re told because they haven’t developed critical think skills at that age.

Update: I asked my son what the news they watch at school is called and I have the exact video in question. What they’re watching is CNN 10, “an on-demand digital news show ideal for explanation seekers on the go or in the classroom.” I have some people complaining that I’m just calling fair criticisms propaganda. I’ll post the link and you can watch it yourself and decide if it seems fair to you.

https://www.cnn.com/videos/cnn10/2021/11/14/ten-1115.cnn

I don't want to respond to everyone who is telling me everything in the video is true so here is my explanation for what I personally think is wrong with the way the video presents the topic. 

Keep in mind that I hadn’t seen the video myself before posting this. I posted the link for people to judge themselves.

Personally, I think the video is extremely biased. The host briefly mentions a benefit of crypto but then immediately brushes it off and starts debunking it. The video also gives the impression that government oversight and regulation is not only good but necessary for a currency to work which I believe is at the very least subjective opinion and probably downright false.

Finally, the thing about buying an NFT using the same amount of energy as driving 500 miles is false. That’s not how ethereum works. The host also acts as if banks, state and Federal governments and the Federal Reserve don’t use electricity. I don’t think bringing up electricity is a valid criticism of crypto unless they’re going to compare it to the existing financial infrastructure.",cryptocurrency
cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown November 17, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. IOHK has dropped their new article on eUTxO dApp architecture. It explains in detail a design for an eUTxO order book.  [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/16/architecting-dapps-on-the-eutxo-ledger/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/16/architecting-dapps-on-the-eutxo-ledger/)

3. Looks like Cardano is seeing a huge amount of on-chain activity.  The crazy part is this is all pre-PAB. Just wait until dApps can actually launch! Unsurprisingly, some supporters of other chains were shocked to realize they didn’t understand the difference between exchange trading volume and actual blockchain use volume.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

6. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It’s notable that Cardano’s Djed solves this.

8. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM.

9. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a “what if” scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised.

10. The so-called “Pandora Papers” reveal globally widespread cases of wealth concealment by public officials and bring up the question of whether blockchains like Cardano should take this into account when dealing with nation-state regimes as partners. [https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/)
11. Remember! There is no mobile Daedalus wallet. There is no browser extension version of Daedalus. These are fakes! They will steal your ADA. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853)

17. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle.

19. COTI is a licensed payment institution in Singapore. This could get very interesting given their status as the issuer of Djed and the ongoing Monetary Authority of Singapore Blockchain Challenge in which Cardano is a finalist.

26. Coinbase is launching an NFT market. How will this impact the CNFT scene? Coinbase tells us: “...initial launch will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards with multi-chain support planned soon after.” [https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html)

28. The first project that actually looks like it may one day be a virtual world launches on Cardano and it already has a community built parcel explorer. [https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/](https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/)
29. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

36. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan Müller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we’ll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)

42. In the Cap Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative Fireside Q&amp;A, Charles mentioned he is talking to Colossol Labs about the possibility of having the Mammoth DeExtinction Project take place on his bison ranch.

personalfinance,Wife wants retirement account,"So my wife wants to set up a retirement account, but what she said she wants to use it for is not really a retirement account. I currently have a 401K with matching from work that I contribute a significant amount to. She wanted to make one as well but stated she wanted to use it in the future to pay for our kids wedding or schooling or help with a down payment for a house, just general things like that. I told her that it’s not really a retirement account she’s looking for. What do you guys think we should set up? Should I have her just put a certain percentage of her paycheck into like an s&amp;p 500 index fund or is there something better suited towards this. We don’t want to use a general savings account as the interest rates are awful and we want the money to hopefully grow.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto Fud, it's just putting Crypto and Bitcoin to the test. Or the other way around?","This might be an unpopular opinion, but I believe that with all the Fud and opposition from Governments, politicians, Banks, the Fed, and big investors like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and so on… Crypto and in todays scenario Bitcoin it’s just getting a stress test and it will only make it stronger over time.

Don’t get me wrong I would love to see the cryptoverse go on a steady and non resistance grow, but nature it’s not like that, when something new comes along, and that something it's disruptive, it will face a lot of stepbacks, resistance, and Fud, and often in history it’s coming from people who either doesn’t know anything about that new something, or it will ruin their position on the market/system.

As Crypto and Bitcoin specially, it’s getting a stress test, Governments and the entire system it's also being putted to the test. Why? Because with Bitcoin we just checkmark the 5 things that something needs to be *MONEY*: Divisibility, Durability, Recognizability, Portability, and the most important property the one that makes Bitcoin go ahead of Fiat money, it's **Scarcity.** 

So if you have something that's putting Governments, and the system to the test, you will face huge recistance 'cause you're getting into a guys meal, and most of us know already, that the system it's rigged, that inflation it's just a way of robbing people from their well earned money, that the money printer never stops, so with that little bit of knowledge we can speculate, that in the future, when the word comes out, and more and more people learn about this thing called Crypto, and learn about money and how it's getting manipulated, they will just notice how hard they are getting f\*cked by people who just doesn't care about them. Crypto will go out of this victorious.

We are due to hard resistance, and a lot of Fud, but please make your research, study the history of banks, and money, and how Bitcoin and Crypto, it's changing a lot of things on the environment of making money, and businesses.

TLDR; Crypto it's getting tested, and it will backfire on Governments and regulators as people learn more about money, history, and this new Technology.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Me and my husband are about to purchase a condo, are we signing up for financial ruin?","Me and husband live in the Austin, TX area. We makes a combined 225k a year. We expect our salary to increase over the next few years. We have about 118-115k left in student loans with the max interest rate of 4%. This is the only current debt we have.

We have rented for the past 5 years as we went through job changes, cross country moves, etc.

We like the location we live in and feel confident we will stay in the area in the next 5 years, but who can really predict the future?

Our monthly take home savings after considering our mortgage, PMI, prop tax, HOA fees, and student loans min payment plus all of our other average required expenses will be about $3k-4k.

Another thing to note is that our lease does not end until middle of next May.

Lastly, the unit were under contract for is in a great location but we are still assessing the competency of the HOA. For example, the unit has some wind damage which resulted in broken shingles. The seller cannot fix them because they have to request permission from the HOA to do so. This will be probably about $500-800 in repairs. 

We will have about 6 months of emergency funds after the purchase if we go through with it. Still feels too risky.

The market in Austin is ass for the $300-500k range which is what we could comfortably afford. Unfortunately, we also have some constraints as me and my husband work on opposite sides of town, and neither of us want a 30 min commute. We could wait and start looking again in Jan/Feb, but I’m worried housing prices/rates will rise.

CryptoCurrency,Am I getting bamboozled by a scammer that's actually a bot?,"Recently I got messaged in Reddit by someone named Janet, very good looking on the picture, single digit Karma and a single post/comment.

Obligatory friendly questions about  what do I invest in, do I actually hold my coins and how long I've been in crypto. This is where I hit her with the big one!  
Woman, ''I've been day trading crypto since 2016!'' to which I got no response for more than a day. Makes sense to give up, but no.   
The next day I've got another batch of friendly questions and a request, if we could move this to Whatsapp, like it was a private motel room or something.

To spare you the details, this conversation went on for 3 days more with a text every couple of hours.  
What keeps bugging me is that usually scammers are some weird third world country fellas with some pretty scuffed up English and they always call me Sir.  
This was different.   
It got to a point where I had to use google translate for some of the more sophisticated words, but the simple part of the sentence made no sense at all?  
It was like trying to have a deep conversation with Siri.

Is it possible for them to be using some sort of AI to lure victims?   
Have they really gone that advanced?

personalfinance,Part year resident PA to MN,"Hello everyone this year I moved from PA to MN for a new job. I’m trying to understand how much I’ll be hit for on taxes in 2022 tax season. And how it’s calculated. Minnesota is bracket based like federal. 

So it’s a mess, I lived in PA, and worked in NJ. Now I moved to MN for work a few months ago. My wife was working we both worked. Now I only work for now until my wife finds a new job. 

So PA/NJ have agreement I only have to file PA since I lived there you file and owe where you lived. PA is flat 3.07% then you pay local which ranges based on your county. I’m not worried about that as much because 95% was withheld for PA and local. I’ll owe maybe $100-200 to PA and should break even on local or owe $10. Federal we should be ok with as well might get little refund. 

Minnesota is what I’m worried about because now I’m having taxes withheld and MN is bracket based like federal. And i don’t think it’s withholding enough because it doesn’t know what my wife made before and all that. So I guess my question is how does this work. 

Will Minnesota look at total income what we submit for federal gross between what wife and I made all 12 months or will they only look at what I made while living in MN? I know I’ll only owe income based on what I made MN but how is bracket calculated? I’m worried I’m under withholding as I selected married joint which I think will be fine starting January 1 when it’s just me having income until wife finds job. But right now i only have a job but she made income in PA for 9 months. I have three paychecks left until 2021 ends so I want to adjust withholding to help if I can even tho it’s hard now cause single income. 

I Always do our taxes myself this year I’m going to have to pay TurboTax or pay a professional I’m hoping to do TurboTax so it’s cheaper. I usually use credit karma but I can’t this year because they only allow single state filing but starting next year I can.

Thank you.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Looking For Resources To Help Explain Advantages of BTC over Banking To Wife..,"Just wondering if any of you happen to have any resources on hand that clearly detail/highlight some of the reasons why it can be better to invest in BTC than to just have money sitting in the bank.

I’ve been trying to explain it to my wife but I’m not always great at articulating certain things, and even when I do she is the kind of person who (rightly) requires solid sources especially when it comes to money. She’s prone to think I’ve perhaps just come upon a fad or something. This is partly because her dad is a big finance guy but he doesn’t know anything about crypto so he’d steer her away. 

Basically I’m just trying to convince her that instead of having thousands just sitting in our bank account where you get almost no interest, it would be more advantageous for us to take some of that money and buy bitcoin/ETH and move it to a wallet to sit for the next  5-10 years. Technically it would even be “safer” since the Fed has been hacked but the BTC blockchain hasn’t ever been. 

Looking for resources that either explain it in laymen terms (doesn’t use a ton of financial lingo/language) or easy to read graphs/charts.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Wife and I both getting higher paying jobs and paralyzed about what to do,"TLDR; wife and I both got big pay increases this fall, need input on preparing for 2022 taxes, vehicle purchase, home improvements, and investing

I just accepted an offer with a new company in my industry and leveraged my skills for a big pay increase. I was making ~$57k plus commissions, 401k match up to 4% with 10% going in, reasonably priced healthcare for just me, company car with gas, insurance, maintenance all paid for. My new job starts in 2 weeks and will pay me $100k base salary, $25k annual bonus, 100% company paid healthcare for the whole family, $10k/yr car allowance (paid as regular earnings), and fuel costs expensed to the company. 

This year my wife made $63k plus annual bonus of $12k, relatively expensive healthcare for her and our son, 401k match of 3%. Her new job at the same company starts in 2 weeks at $110k salary, $1,000/mo car allowance, fuel expensed to the company, annual bonus of $15k. 

We’re going from W2 wages of a combined ~$140k depending on my commissions to $232k with another $37k if we both get full bonuses ($269k), all while lowering our cost of living by thousands every year by not paying for health insurance and my wife now getting a car allowance and free fuel. This big change is kind of freaking us out and we’re kind of paralyzed about what we should do. 

Our current finances and assets: FICO score of 839, zero CC or student loan debt, ~$360k on our mortgage at 2.75%, home is worth ~700k, healthy but not as good as we’d like 401k for each of us, $25k emergency fund, $50k saved for a garage addition, wife’s car in decent condition 6 years old with 80k miles, have a cheap truck for side business and towing a trailer.

When I finished school 11 years ago, we had my wife’s $45k/yr job, I couldn’t find work, had $52k in student loans, a $15k car loan, a $12k car loan (both of our old cars died at the same time), and about $10k combined in credit cards and a personal loan. 

We got out from under all of that mess pretty quickly by living simply- no vacations unless we stayed with family or spent hotel points from work travel to pay for lodging, no season tickets for sports teams, no fancy dining out, driving modest cars, no closet full of expensive clothes, etc. 

That frugal mentality paid off for us while our income has increased steadily and we eliminated our debts and purchased a home. We’re now facing this big jump in income and want to reward ourselves a bit while still making good decisions for the future. If we wanted to retire super early, we would eat rice and beans and shut off our YouTube TV account, but we’re young-ish and healthy and I don’t want to spend some of our best years living meagerly just to save every penny for an unknown future. 

We want to reward ourselves for the hard work in a couple of ways, while still making good financial decisions. I’ve always wanted a nice truck and since I’m forced to buy something now (old job wants their car back), it makes some sense to go ahead and bite the bullet despite the awful car market. I don’t like the idea of buying a cheap new car or a used car at an inflated price with a plan to sell it when the market calms down as that doesn’t add up in the end. Used trucks in particular are going for just a couple thousand less than brand new and obviously won’t fetch as low of an interest rate. I have an older truck that I use for towing a utility trailer, hauling materials for my metalworking side gig out of the garage, etc but I don’t feel confident driving it every day especially when the company is giving me money to drive something respectable that won’t be in the shop every other month.  ‘Nice’ trucks have been skyrocketing in price over the last 10 years and have exploded under the weight of the chip shortage. I hate to spend that kind of money on a vehicle (~$1050/mo), but I spend a ton of time in that seat and having modern driving aids to help with fatigue while also being super comfortable is a tempting splurge. The other area of spending is on our house- it’s perfectly fine and comfortable, but at 14 years old it needs new carpet and the bathrooms could use some updating since the original owner opted for cheap countertops and sinks. We live in the hottest of hot places and would like to have a pool to make the summers more bearable. Finally, less of a splurge and more of a smart money and environmental decision, we want to add solar panels to the roof to reduce our electric bill. The hope with these improvements is to spread it out over the next couple of years.  

The tentative plan is to buy the expensive truck I’d love to drive by trading in the old truck for ~$10k and putting down $10k in cash (Ford is offering 0% for 60 months), max out Roth IRAs for each of us, max out 401k contributions, and open an investment account to grow our money so our son (3rd grader) has a better start to adulthood than we did and can graduate college debt free or go to trade school and have a nut to start his life with. 

What should we do to optimize our current quality of life and take advantage of our fortunate circumstances to prepare for the future?",finance

personalfinance,Should I look at selling my car?,"I bought my 2016 Mazda 3 with 18k miles as a certified pre-owned back in 2018 for $16,800. At the time I put down $5,000 cash and financed the rest. 90 days after the initial purchase my local credit union took over the loan at a lower interest rate of 3.25%. My wife and I have been aggressively paying on my car to pay it off as it is our highest interest rate debt currently. As it stands I only have $5100 left on the car and my current budget slates me paying it off by 3/1/2022. To head off any additional questions, we have a fully funded 6 months emergency fund and are actively overpaying on debts to pay them off sooner.

I hadn't really considered selling my car because I do enjoy the car, it's the manual transmission and it's just fun to drive. However, I accepted a new job 4 months ago in which I am now 100% remote and was a 50% salary increase over my old position. So needless to say my car now gets driven pretty infrequently, as such the mileage is only 29,500. Any trips out of town etc we use my wife's SUV. My car is garage kept and I enjoy taking care of it and keeping it clean etc as I enjoy having a ""nice"" car where previously I had some beaters.

For the heck of it I did a Carvana quote to purchase my car yesterday and they came back with a quote of $21,369 to outright purchase the car. If that holds true I could essentially pay the car off and have close to my original purchase price back. My wife is encouraging this and pushing me to buy a $6,000-$10,000 vehicle and then the remainder of the money can be thrown at some of our other debts. Also, a replacement car could be lower insurance coverage for further savings. Big picture wise, the only thing on the horizon is that my wife and I are trying for a child as well.

I'm at a loss, my heart says keep the car as I enjoy it. My brain says to sell and make good financial decisions.

Thoughts?

Edit: probably smart to add, I also have a motorcycle, so I have two forms of transportation for me. Granted winter is upon us, and I strongly prefer not to ride in the cold. So selling my car wouldn't leave me completely vehicle-less.",finance
personalfinance,How to get an auto loan for a super cheap car?,"Hi personal finance nerds! I have a bit of a dilemma on my hands and need some help. I have been wanting to buy a fun and cheap sports car since the first Fast and Furious movie came out. However, instead of indulging in my vices I've been really financially responsible and have invested a substantial portion of my income while simultaneously keeping my regular expenses to a minimum. 

However, I still want that fun, cheap sports car.

Enter my dilemma. I have found a car listed locally on craigslist for $4,500 that would perfectly fit my needs. In curiosity I looked at my two banks I am already a part of, Chase and Ally, to see what kind of loan rates and terms I could get. Neither seem willing to provide a loan for a car of this age. 

The reason I am looking for a loan for such a cheap car is twofold. First, I do not have $4,500 lying around in ""fun money"" to blow on this car. I've got my investments and my emergency fund but nothing in this category. Second, I do not have any auto loan history on my credit history and diversifying credit history is something I have been told to do. 

Speaking of credit history, it's impeccable, just shy of 800 according to the Chase website. 

Looking at the Google loan estimator I could get a 24 month loan and pay just shy of $200/month which is easily doable or I could stretch it to 60 months and pay $81/month. The 60 month option is particularly tempting because if inflation holds then I will end up paying a little over $4,800 at the end of the loan assuming a 3ish% interest rate, but inflation would value the initial $4500 at just north of $5k after 5 years. With inflation as a factor I would be coming out on top.

About the car, it is a 1991 Mazda Miata in very good condition. If the pictures and description are to be believed there is no rust on the car and it has been well maintained and regularly serviced. There are no aftermarket modifications. It his high mileage for some (150k) but I drove my last car until the repair bill was more than the car was worth and that sucker ran for 278k before kicking the bucket, and likely because I neglected some maintenance along the way being a broke college student. 

Speaking of broke college student, I am now working a steady job and was recently promoted. My position pays be $55k annually and I am living with my partner who makes a bit north of $60k. Though we share all of our household expenses any individual expenses would be entirely mine, and this would fall into that category. Whether a monthly payment of $80 or $200 it will not substantially impact my lifestyle. 

So, the question: where should I look for a loan for such a cheap car? Should I explore a personal loan? What kinds of options are open to me?

One last note I forgot to mention: the car is being sold by a private party, not a dealer, so getting financing may have that added layer of difficulty.",finance

personalfinance,40k student loan debt.,"Hello, I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Arkansas. I attended a community college last year and saved a great bit of money.

CryptoCurrency,The sad truth.,"Agree or disagree but I will be right about this, but what I’ve been saying for years is now becoming closer and closer to full reality, slowly but surely.

THERE WILL NEVER be a currency under true control of the people. Besides gold and silver, and or things you can barter with of actual real physical value. People are so stupid these days (real money and corruption isn’t taught in schools) they actually believe the narrative of the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto that one person, for the benefit of the people created Bitcoin. Bitcoin and crypto would have been shut down and or made illegal by the US government IMMEDIATELY if they didn’t actually know who the creator(s) was/were and could’ve simply called it “terrorist money”, and it never would’ve been a thing. Now Bitcoin and crypto is being broadcasted and accepted as good and normal, and as a potential safe haven, and future currency. Do People really think that the governments and elite wealthy don’t won’t power? And that the Federal Reserve bank does not want to control the creation of money anymore? Of course they still want the power. The only thing that makes sense, using common sense is that the people behind the scenes knew about Bitcoin and crypto from the beginning. It was all a plan. The same people who control US dollar (and people with close ties to these people) and all fiat currencies around the World with a central bank, created crypto currency and bought it for pennies on the dollar. THEY ARE YOUR WHALES. They can already control the market, sending it to any price they want, literally whenever they want. But they slowly built up the narrative of crypto, getting people to ditch the idea of cash, because physical cash is as anonymous as it gets, just like gold or silver. Now eventually when they centralize crypto to the max every person on the planet using this crypto currency system will be able to be tracked, traced, and not be able to avoid taxes in any shape way or form for any purchase, trade, or even an attempted private transaction unless two people agree on a physical form of currency. Crypto was, is, and will continue to be easy to sell unto the people and get them to accept it, because it CAN in fact, do these things.

1. Make taxes, trade, security, insurance, purchases, other methods of business, and more done at a record time of convenience. Everything will become more simple, trusted and and less stressful. The majority of people, will eat this up and love this new smart contract system.

2. The prices of crypto will continue to price, create good, to great, to massive profits  for investors whether you are poor, of medium wealth, or rich, it’ll create profits for everyone against the dollar and fiat currencies. 

3. Fool people! The central banks have been scamming people through their fiat currencies from inflation for centuries now. A lot of people are woke to this corruption now, but the majority won’t be, because they’ll never tell you this on mainstream media news outlets. A narrative will be preached to praise crypto, because it was/is the peoples money which finally helped either defeat the banks, or make the banks give more benefits to the people, like more anonymity, and higher interest rates on savings. People will think this is the end of money corruption in the world, and that the people gained more power using this new crypto currency system. When In reality, the same people who control your fiat money, control this new crypto money, and are fooling the people all over again. 

My only advise is get your money outside of fiat because this is the new system that is coming. I have made the choice to bow down to crypto and I’m not proud of it. But if we hold on to dollars our wealth is being stolen from us everyday through inflation. Crypto, land and houses, guns, ammo, and other valuable tools and resources are the things that will hold and appreciate in value. I would mention gold and silver as being king, but another reason crypto was created was to keep gold and silver prices down, and looked at by the people as not useful. People gold and silver is always a threat to the system and being the real money. Even the elite banks and people have been buying and hoarding physical gold and silver (look at jpmorgan) because they know after all this crypto madness. They’ll have so much wealth in crypto they’ll buy most the gold and silver in the world (and then eventually send the price to the moon when most common people don’t have any) so even if someday the people woke up and wanted to stop using crypto, they won’t be able to use enough gold and silver for exchange because there won’t be enough available to the billions of people in distress when the time comes and the people will come crawling to government to help them. However this will probably not happen in any of our lifetimes, but it could! Never know.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, November 17, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 17, 2021**

Stocks mostly drifted lower to hover below record levels, as market participants further digested yesterday’s US retail sales report and new corporate earning results from major retailers, which provide further data into consumer spending patterns amid supply-chain disruptions. 

**Here are some key numbers for today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.25%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.05%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.58%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.27%
* Apple (AAPL): +1.75%
* Target (TGT): -4.73%

The Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers

* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected
* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%
* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%

The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. 

Steven Wieting, Citigroup’s Global Wealth Chief Investment Strategist said, “The markets generally are looking at it \[the pace of inflation\], benignly - they are not discounting some longer-term inflation of more than 2.5%. You can see this in the pricing out on the yield curve of Treasuries. You can see this in the composition of the market with growth stocks not really being beaten down by any concerns about some lurch higher, tightening of monetary policy. We think that story is largely correct – it’s benign for markets. It doesn’t mean we get to repeat the returns from the past year, however.”

Today, Target (TGT) and Lowe’s (LOW), two major retailers in the US, both reported better than expected earnings. This comes on the heels of both Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) both reporting strong earnings results earlier in the week. Here are the numbers (second number were analyst expectation):

**Target (TGT)**: “With a strong inventory position heading into the peak of the holiday season, our team and our business are ready to serve our guests and poised to deliver continued, strong growth, through the holiday season and beyond,"" said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. 

* Revenue: $25.7 billion vs. $24.20 billion
* Comparable Store Sales: +12.7% vs. +8.3%
* Gross Margin: 28% vs. 29.80%
* Operating Margin: 7.8% vs. 7.68%
* Diluted EPS: $3.03 vs. $2.84

**Lowe’s (LOW):** “Our momentum continued this quarter, with U.S. sales comps up nearly 34% on a two-year basis, as our Total Home strategy is resonating with the Pro and DIY customer alike. In the quarter, we drove over 16% growth in Pro and 25% on Lowes.com. We also delivered operating margin expansion by driving productivity through disciplined operational execution and cost management”, said Lowe Chairman, President, and CEO Marvin Ellisoln. 

* Revenue: $22.92 billion vs. $22.06 billion 
* Earnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.36
* $1.90 billion in profits vs $692 million Q3 2020
* Same Store Sales: +2.2% vs -1.5%

**Highlights**

* The party seems over… after a blockbuster IPO, shares of EV startup Rivian (RIVN), which had a market cap of $150 billion on essentially 0 revenue, fell 15% today. In my humble opinion, I’d get out if I had profits (not playing this at all). Shares of Lucid Motors (LCID) were also down roughly 5% in sympathy
* CME Group (CME) the world's largest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading everything from agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes to digital currency futures, announced it was planning to move core trading systems Google Clouds, a massive move in financial markets. Until very recently, it was assumed that cloud computing was ill suited for high frequency trading, forcing these companies to build and develop complicated systems geared for time sensitive markets. If this works, it could reduce the cost of operations by a lot. 
* Fisker (FSR), another EV startup in the market, announced an electric SUV with higher driving range than Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y. Fisker announced the OCean Ultra SUV, which is planned to begin production next November, has a range of 340 miles and costs $50,000 compared to 300 miles and a cost of $60,000 with the Model Y
* Apple said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The iPhone and Mac maker said Self Service Repair would begin in early 2022 with a focus on the most common serviced modules, including phone display, battery and camera, with additional repair options to be added later in the year. The right to repair has been a big controversy surrounding technology sold by companies. 
* According to recent filings, Elon Musk is roughly halfway done with his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla (TSLA). You can see it here [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity)
* Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday it is expanding its partnership with United Parcel Service (UPS) to move freight using autonomous trucks between two of the parcel delivery company's Texas facilities during the holiday season. This comes amid a shortage of delivery drivers in the US.

personalfinance,Who and how do I get loans for school? Unique situation inside.,"Hi everyone,

I got a full-ride to a college for a second degree. Normally tuition would have cost me over $100,000 alone, but I got exceedingly lucky by getting a full-ride scholarship. That said, I still need to take out loans for cost of living. I'm going to need a lot as my state and city have a high cost of living (unfortunately).

I have about $16,000 saved. Over four years for everything (rent, insurance, car, utilities), I estimate needing approximately $90,000. It's a lot of money, but I'm confident in my choice of major to justify it.

That all said, I need help knowing where to apply for loans. I have approximately $45,000 remaining in FAFSA federal loans after my first degree. After that, I have no idea what to consider. I've heard of Sallie Mae and similar services, but their reputations seem to be poor at best.

For what it's worth, I have a strong credit score of 765. I'm unsure of where to go from here. Any and all help would be appreciated.",finance

Anyways, when I was hired on I was promised a raise after 90 days of employment at 5-7%. In all actuality I didn't receive this raise until I was nine months in with the company. Probably could have gone after them for back pay but I was genuinely just happy to have finally gotten it. 

Now that I have been here over a year and am honestly an asset (don't mean to toot my own horn but the only other person with seniority is a lady who has been here 14 years) everyone else has left. I'm having a hard time making ends meet and feel like either a raise or maybe fuel compensation (I commute 30 miles one way) would be beneficial.

I know there's a ton of people with a lot of money (in my mind, this group that people vaguely allude to all of the time as pent up money on the sidelines has to be typically families making $250k/yr+, no?) chasing returns. There's nowhere else to park money, I get it. I'm just asking... when is that going to stop being the answer? 

When are people going to run out of cash to deploy? How many people are really buying in at these levels weekly with any sizable volume?

personalfinance,Figuring out how to build credit and buy a car,"So recently I got married - on the honeymoon my car broke down and it's scrapped. I'm looking for a reliable car that will last the long haul. My FICO is 790, I have two credit cards that I pay off on time, every time, and I have no student loans or other debts. I pay rent, and have had a full-time job since graduating a year and a half ago. I have enough cash to make a substantial downpayment, as well as investment accounts that I regularly fund. I'd like to buy a house within a year or two. My wife has less assets and about 30K in student loans, but a 780 FICO.

&amp;#x200B;

When I applied for a loan I was offered a 18.4K 60 month term, 9.7% APR, no prepayment penalties (1.5K down). It's a used car, so I expected the interest rate to be higher, but not that high. I was told the rate was high and other lenders even denied me, because I lack recent installment loans.

I have a few options in my eyes, but please, let me know your thoughts:

1. I can make a down payment of something like 6-8K - this will not deplete my emergency funds. Then, I make regular payments for the length of the loan.
2. I can buy the car in cash, and my parents will give me a loan for the rest, offering a 30 month term, 2.5% APR, no prepayment penalties.
3. I can finance the car, make a down payment between 6-8K, and then have my parents lend me the rest of the money, with the terms outlined in 2. I will then make monthly payments on that loan for 1-2 years until it's closed.
4. I can finance the car, make a down payment between 6-8K, then make monthly payments for the life of the loan (60 months)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking 3 might be a better option for me, with or without a loan from my parents, but I'm unsure. On one hand, I'd like to have at least some history of installment loan payments, so that when I apply for home mortgages I don't get screwed on interest rates. I've seen a lot of conflicting views on paying off car loans early. It seems like if I pay it off early, that will lower my average account age and may not serve to provide much history of installment loan payments. If I make a very large first payment, but then monthly payments for the life of the loan, I can still show a history of installment loan payments and avoid paying as much interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other options could be having my Dad cosign, and potentially getting a lower interest rate, or just shopping around more with different lenders and look for a different car.",finance

stocks,A fun exercise: how useful is the P/E ratio at forecasting returns?,"I thought it would be interesting and helpful to share some research I've done in my professional career on how useful the P/E ratio is at forecasting future returns.

A couple quick disclaimers: This analysis pertains to broad market (beta) returns, not individual stocks. This analysis uses price returns. Even though using total returns is more ""correct"", price return data is more accessible and the conclusions are not directionally different.

TLDR / key takeaways:

\- I believe the Robert Shiller Cyclically-Adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio is one of the most reliable ""off the shelf"" tools that any investors can use to try and gauge future market returns (note that I intentionally use the word ""gauge"" instead of ""predict"").

\- I find the CAPE ratio is only useful at longer time horizons (i.e. 10+ years), and is not useful at all as a short-term market timing tool.

\- The uncertainty around point estimates is very high (this is very common in finance). In simple terms, it's far more useful to look at a range of possibilities as opposed to attempt to forecast returns ""to the penny"". If you attempt to use this tool to do the latter, it will likely be wrong.

\- The CAPE ratio today suggests we'll see modestly negative or at best below average returns over the next decade. I am pretty doubtful that ""this time is different"". But would love it if anyone can make the case!

Let's first talk about how I interpret the P/E ratio and why it's useful. I think of the P/E ratio as a ""rough and dirty"" way to approximate the cash flows of a business (or index) relative to current price. I often like to flip the P/E ratio upside down (E over P), as it lends to a more intuitive interpretation: The E/P ratio can be read as the no-growth cash flow yield of a security. Or in other words, a very conservative way to estimate future returns, assuming steady state cash flows (no additional growth). I personally prefer the CAPE method, developed by Robert Shiller, which uses smoothed earnings as opposed to the standard 12-month forward or 12-month trailing earnings figure (you can read more about the logic here: [https://www.gurufocus.com/shiller-PE.php](https://www.gurufocus.com/shiller-PE.php)). The data for this analysis uses CAPE, which is downloadable and completely free here: [http://www.econ.yale.edu/\~shiller/data.htm](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm).

Onto the results. I tested the CAPE ratio at multiple different time horizons and sample periods, using data from 1881. I put together a simple chart to summarize the output (link here: [https://imgur.com/qarNXR3](https://imgur.com/qarNXR3)). What I found interesting is that the predictive power is almost entirely non-existent at short time horizons, and improves drastically at longer time horizons (10 years and beyond). I also found that the CAPE ratio didn't become useful until the 1940s. In fact, since 1940, the CAPE ratio has explained more than half the variation in S&amp;P 500 returns over a 10-year window! Why did the CAPE ratio become suddenly useful in the 40s, but was quite a poor indicator before then? My best guess is that's when the P/E ratio became popularized in investing. This was roughly around the time the famous ""Security Analysis"" book by Dodd-Graham came out.

What does the CAPE ratio tell us today? The results are not pretty, but point estimates need to be taken with a grain of salt (see the chart I created here: [https://imgur.com/ryxUoXH](https://imgur.com/ryxUoXH)). The CAPE ratio suggests the S&amp;P 500 return will be -1% (annualized) over the next decade, with a 95% prediction interval of +5% to -7%. That's a wide band, however, you can conclude that if history is a guide, then returns should be at best below average over the next decade (this doesn't necessarily mean it's better to hold cash). If you're building a personal wealth/financial plan, these figures could provide a data-driven basis to your return assumptions.

Could ""this time be different""? Could the CAPE ratio breakdown as a useful gauge of forward returns, even after a pretty successful run since the 1940s? You'd likely have to believe two things: 1) we are in a new policy regime (""stocks can't go down"" thanks to the ""Fed put""), and/or 2) we may see explosive earnings growth in the coming years (i.e. thanks to some sort of innovation, such as a genomics breakthrough, web 3, climate tech, etc.). I'm more doubtful of the former, but the latter is more believable. Generally, I like to ""follow the data"", especially for an indicator with a decently long track record.",finance
vet,Side effects from Proin?,"I have a 10 year old husky mix who was diagnosed with incontinence in August of this year.

Over the past few days I have started to be able to feel her hip bones and spine through her incredibly thick coat. She seems to have lost more weight and is becoming distant. Also, since being prescribed Proin she has become a huge food thief and will literally steal food right out of your hands. This is a new behavior for her and she has always respected boundaries. It's as if she can't get enough food or water and she is being fed the correct amount. I did feed her a little more than normal tonight and she threw some of it up. I am guessing it was too much.

personalfinance,Refinance mortgage every 6 months w/ big lender credit,"I'm currently refinancing my house - we just bought the house 8 months ago, and rates are slightly better than when we bought, but not good enough for me to do a refinance staying at the 30-year term (we couldn't reduce our monthly payment by &gt;5%), so I decided to switch to a 20-year term. 

For the 20-year refinance, I decided to go with a big lender credit (sacrificing rate by about 0.25%-0.375% above par, but still 0.25% lower than my existing 30-year mortgage) option to fully cover origination fees, title costs, prepaid interest, and escrow. To throw some rough numbers out:

|Origination fees|$1.2k|
|:-|:-|
|Title costs|$1.9k|
|Prepaid interest|$0.4k|
|Escrows|$4.3k|
|Lender credit|$(7.8)k|

I know the first three items are additional expenses I am incurring because of the refinance (and are being offset by the credit), but the escrow amount is basically getting refunded to me when I close my old loan, so I view that amount as a ""gain"".

This had me thinking - **is it really possible to just refinance again every 6 months to take advantage of the lender credits (resulting in the old lender refunding my old escrow and new bank paying for the new escrow via lender credit)?** Even if you don't fall under the ""benefit"" of reducing your payment by 5%, you could switch between 15/20/30 year terms.

In my specific scenario, assuming rates stay pretty flat, I would be able to get a 30-year loan at 3.25% or 3.375% with a significant lender credit to cover all (or nearly all) my costs. So basically get back to my first loan's rate, but get two escrow checks (\~$8k-$9k) in the process.

I fully understand the risk of rates rising - which of course could stop the plan to refinance as one wouldn't want to refinance at a significantly higher interest rate than they currently have - but in a theoretical case where rates are relatively flat, this seems like a way to bring in cash flow while keeping one's principal balance relatively the same (increases in the principal would occur during the months in which payments are skipped, but those obviously would be offset by the fact that you're not making those monthly payments - effectively getting a small cash-out loan).

I also believe this is a zero-sum type of activity, and the mortgage banker will get a solid commission each time I refinance, so he/she would clearly be a winner in all of this as well. **But who effectively loses in this process of transactions? Is it the lender that underwrites the loan? If they are a wholesale broker and sell the loan right away, is it the acquiring investors that lose when I subsequently refinance?**

Open to other risks or thoughts I may be missing in this example. Thanks in advance!",finance

stocks,"Why the stock market could hit a peak Friday, before a ‘minor’ dip during the Thanksgiving week","The stock market has scaled a wall of worry in 2021 and stands within shouting distance of a fresh round of records for the major indexes, but Fundstrat’s new technical analyst makes the case that the benchmarks are nearing a peak this week as the holidays are about to get under way.

Fundstrat’s technical strategist Mark Newton said cautious buying in markets, with areas of the market considered defensive gaining traction, suggest that a pullback is likely next week as volumes thin out due to Thanksgiving in the U.S. Only four of the S&amp;P 500’s 11 sectors are higher so far this week, led by gains in consumer discretionary SP500.25, +0.59%, 1.9%, utilties SP500.55, +0.14%, 0.9% higher, tech SP500.45, -0.39%, up 0.5%, and real estate SP500.60, +0.65%, advancing 0.5%.

The Fundstrat folks appear to hold a fairly bullish view on the market longer term, but made the case that in the near term, a renewed surge in cases of COVID-19 in parts of the U.S. and elsewhere in the world and persistent inflation jitters (though some economists are starting to voice the view that price pressures also are nearing a peak) might create a chance for a “minor ‘wall of worry’ to build” into the coming week.

U.S. markets will be closed next Thursday in obersvance of Thanksgiving, and that Friday will mark an abbreviated session that is historically one of Wall Street’s lowest-volume days. Newton appeared reluctant to give the downturn more relevance than an air pocket in a market that appears to be otherwise on a bullish trajectory, despite a host of pesky issues, including uncertainty about the leadership of the Federal Reserve.

“But as we would be ‘buyers of this dip’ — thus, even with the expectations for near-term weakness, and expect markets to be strong into \[year-end\],” wrote the Fundstrat folks. Newton, a prominent technical analysts on his own, joined Fundstrat, co-founded by Tom Lee and John Bai in 2014, back in September as its head of technical analysis. The markets have already showed some unsteady trade after all three benchmarks on Tuesday closed within a hair’s breadth of record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.58% is down 0.5% so far this week, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX, -0.26% is nursing a 0.1% weekly gain, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.33% is 0.4% higher thus far this week. Meanwhile, the small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, -1.16% is down 1.4% on the week.

Fundstrat has set its price target for the broad-market S&amp;P 500 at 4,800, lifting it from 4,700 about a month ago, making the case that strong trading in October, a month that can be weak for stocks, tends to lead to more buying the rest of the year.

retirement,Fear of pulling the string,"I am 63 and work for the US govt out of my house (for now). My office is about an hour away. I have tried getting the location of my office  changed in the past but was never able to. I have also never been able to get a promotion, change positions, get a ""thank you"", etc, regardless of being highly educated, and very successful/sought after for advice in my org. Been there 15 years. On a personal note,  I wanted to move to a 55+ community in a cheaper place but they are expensive and my wife doesn't want to, due to the convenience of our house and her inability to talk with other people.

Bottom line, my confidence at work has been shaken after seeing all my co workers (slightly younger) get promoted out of the group. Now it's just me and ""kids"". I also get paid fairly well, about 135k/year, for my effort and work about 40 hours, never really killing myself. So my job has its pluses and minuses. Almost all of my contemporaries have already retired. I just reached getting 25 paid vacation days/year plus holidays and generous sick leave. In the past it was not unusual for employees of this org to stay well into their mid 70s. Things are changed.

My wife stopped working and has no pension. We have about 1.9M in stocks/bonds (50/50) mostly in inherited IRAs, and a stone house worth about 540k in a very   expensive NYC suburb, 10k/year in taxes. My wife wants to save the house to gift  to my daughter who is 26 and is getting a PhD in the medical tech field about an hour away at a public U where she is being paid to attend. So I am not too worried about her future. We also receive about 40k/year from a family real estate investment I inherited. Our property is heavily wooded and I have a chainsaw and a chainlink fence winch to fix the fence when trees fall and take out the fence. But at 63? It is difficult to get workmen here due to their high cost and prevalence of multimillion $ clients available. I will get a federal pension (1% for each year worked), not a great amount.

I have been developing a software package, nights and weekends, that will, I hope, allow me to consult in my field..it will also help American small business so it is somewhat altruistic.  One side of me wants to just  retire my job to work full time on my project. This will entail consulting with clients over zoom. But I ran into a technical issue for the past 3 months that is depressing me and delaying release. I have budgeted about 50k to advertise it, when I finally release it.

I am just not excited about my job and feel passed over. But I'm scared to retire. We live in a convenient, but noisy location. We just gave up alcohol. But I just feel bad about the large number of expensive cars parked at the market. Like I failed. And it snows a lot. I was unable to hire a snow plow to plow my little property's driveway so we bought a huge commercial snow blower that I will need to run (at 63?). I am in pretty good shape since I worked out my whole life but live on a 4 lane road and get totally plowed in. But still.

Let me add that I have no friends. No friends from work since I live so far away, and because of my position can't mingle with my clients. And i don't have lots in common with many people in my area. We also have no close neighbors. For fun I take my dog walking in the beautiful Hudson Valley, except when it is too cold, about 60% of the time. My big joy is talking to people I meet on the trail.

How do I get the confidence to retire from an easy, stable, but lonely position? Life is not forever.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Supply shortages and energy costs are already rising. The current inflation statistics are nowhere near where the real picture is. Your money will be eroded like crazy unless you are invested in Crypto.,"By February 2021, the dollar supply in circulation increased by +40% since the start of the pandemic. That is probably like +50-60% by now. The rate at which your buying power is being eroded is insane. Even if you get a raise higher than the current federal estimate of the inflation rate, you are still getting a pay cut this year.

The CPI also does not include investment items, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and life insurance. The real inflation rate is undeniably much higher. Your money has probably already lost a significant amount of its value. This is going to become even more apparent as inflation will speed up even more in the future. We already see a huge surge in energy demands and supply shortages everywhere.  They won't be able to control inflation forever after increasing the currency supply by 50%.

 A $1 Trillion infrastructure bill also just got signed, all that money is likely to come through printing or as  debt, both will devaluate your savings significantly. The best thing you can do right now is to invest in Crypto. It is not only a hedge against inflation, it is also a wise investment. You might've heard this a lot, but it's genuine advice. If you bought last year, you'd already be a few times up from your previous investment.

Decisions made by a centralized government to cut interest rates at the peak of an era of strong inflation has perpetuated a loss in currency, in otherwise an economy which may have been able to recover. In turn, a loss of confidence has destroyed the currency over the last few weeks, effectively resulting in many people, including myself, to completely stay away from the lira. This is discomforting and depressing, considering I and many others are continuously losing economic wealth due to getting paid in the Lira.

In its current state, I am worried that regulators will take further measures to try and ease the loss of the Lira, including prohibiting purchases and sales of foreign currency. They started asking for IDs at brick-and-mortar exchanges. Something which would never fly by in a decentralized money market. While it may be a word of caution for those out there not affected, I strongly urge you to remember that currently it takes the word of one man in power to make a bad decision.

CryptoCurrency,"Don't feel ostracized about about posts shunning selling ""low""","Hi all, now we have mild correction which probably will be followed by sideway movements, followed by new year which is known for people taking profits out, please do not feel bad or silly after selling at current highs. And by highs I mean anywhere between 4k-4.8k. Look at charts, we had movement up since we bottomed at 2.8k. It means that whoever bought before now still is in green and can take profits like most traders do. 

People here need to realize that investors invest to profit in meaningful time, not to hold through another bear market and then posting excuses like ""oh well it's too late to sell, I am in it for 5-10 ears hold anyway"", when they bought recently, or are hardcore holders that claim will never sell. Most people are not like that and they buy coins to ultimately sell in short period of time since crypto does not pay dividends, is high risk and 98% of coins do not survive bear-bull cycle.

Me personally I have liquidated all my positions of ETH with prices of 4k, 4.35k and 4.3k 1.5 week ago. Would I make more profits by holding little bit longer? Yes. Can price go up now and I will miss on another leg? Yes, of course. I did not rebuy yet because I believe we are heading to 3.5k -3k. Ofcourse I might be very wrong.

Unfortunately this sub is a circlejerk room where people live in their bubble either not realizing or just refusing to accept the fact that we are at 4-year bull cycle, Christmas and new year is around the corner, FED started Tapering and they will probably be even more aggressive now that 6.2% inflation report came in. 

Yes, inflation is great for asset appreciation but it will not go forever, there won't be apocalyptic event of ""fiat-crypto flippening"", Blockchain at the end of the day remains risky asset class with high volatility and no sign of mass adoption on scale that can replace current fiat systems, it will probably take another 2-5 market cycles for this to happen.

So if you sell and then price goes up but regardless you profitted from your investment, you are in 15% of investors who did not lose their money investing, congratulations. I went through 2017 cycle and I was upset at myself for not selling during mania phase where everyone was shilling any coin they found. 

If you decide to just ride the ride and not sell, please do not ridicule people who sell when they took even minimal profits, heck even if they sell at a loss they still might dodge the bullet of their tokens sinking 40-60% like it always happens in crypto. Bull run is drying up and daddy JPOW will either be soon replaced or will stay and slowly start tapering more because economy can't keep up with inflation.",cryptocurrency

To what extent new asset classes that aren't backed by real-economy elements (such as land, cashflows, metals) could be helping central banks to expand the monetary base while keeping interest rates low, since the volume of money that flows inside these markets is kept out of the real economy, and is not captured by any inflation indexes that should drive the monetary policy?

Is this a political move by Erdogan? I do not have a great understanding of Turkish politics, however, Erdogan does not seem to be well liked by Turkish people I know and this decision seems irrational. Erdogan apparently holds the view that high interest causes inflation rather than tame it. Where else has this type of thinking been seen? Is it that common at all?

You're even smarter than you think, you're making the moves that nobody else it's doing right now. When you take a look around you, at least at my point of view from society, and see that all these people are just spending their money on things that will not bring them wealth nor benefits at all on the long run, you can't take a deep breath, and take a little credit for yourself, you're investing on a groundbreaking technology that it's so disruptive that bankers, politicians, governments, the fed, and big investors are afraid of it. It is no surprise that governments try to regulate poorly, and with bad intention the crypto world, and this might be not so popular, but they are NOT STUPID, 'cause you hear people often say ""Politicians are stupid"", no they don't, they know what they are doing, they know that they are against an invention that can bring them down, and give people financial freedom for once and for all, so what will they try to do? REGULATE the hell out of it, but it will backfire at them.

personalfinance,Carvana car sale offer - too good to be true?,"Hello all,

I have been considering getting an EV for some time now since my driving has been minimal (WFH so just to school and back, occasional outings, and errands) and I've been eyeing the Chevy Bolt since it seems to have the best range and features for the price. Now, I currently drive a 2019 Honda Civic EX-L with about 28K miles and in great condition, so I submitted it for sale to Carvana just to see what they would offer.

I currently owe $13,082 on the loan and they came back with an offer of $27,093, which is slightly more than the full sticker price from the dealership when I got it. I think I financed about $22k after negotiations. Is there some catch I'm missing here, or would I be insane to pass this up? That's about $14k profit after taking care of the remainder of the loan, which I understand Carvana will handle since I've sold one car to them before.

I could use that to essentially put half the value of a new car down and get some ultra low monthly payments on the Bolt, right? My current monthly is about $335 so I could really use the reduction, plus when I bought it the interest rates were kinda high so I got like 4.7% which could also be reduced since rates are pretty low currently.

Anything else to consider? This seems like a home run but I welcome any feedback to consider.

EDIT: I should add that I am aware new and used car prices have risen as well, but I have already identified several potential buys for the car I'm seeking for around $25-26K, so I'd be able to put about half the cost as a down payment on that.",finance

I imagine it's too late to change what's already done, but so I know for the future and my kids, did I mess up really bad?

investing,"Rather than comparing P/E to History, Compare Earnings Yields to Treasury Yields","S&amp;P 500 forward price to earnings ratios are at the highest they've been since the tech bubble. This may lead to the question- are we in a bubble?

One way of valuing the true value of a stock is how much in earnings it will produce in the future. Present earnings are worth more than future earnings. Generally, a discount rate is used, which is based on treasury yields, but at a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning equities.

Historically, the S&amp;P 500 earnings yield has often closely tracked the 10 year treasury yield, because earnings are expected to grow over time, providing further upside potential, whereas treasuries pay a fixed rate.

https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf

This hasn't been the case in current years. Currently, the S&amp;P500's forward earnings yield is 4.68%, vs a 1.53% treasury yield.

Contrast this with the '99 tech bubble, where treasury yields were much higher than the S&amp;P500 earnings yield prior to the crash.

The big risk is of course rising treasury yields as the fed tapers, and eventually raises benchmark rates. Rising treasury yields make bonds more attractive relative to current equity prices, which can lead to a decline if earnings aren't growing.

Fortunately, there is a way you can hedge against this risk. During periods of rising interest rates and inflation, ""Value"" stocks usually outperform ""growth"" stocks. This is because earnings are discounted based on current interest rates. 

Because interest rates are at historical lows, companies like Tesla, Roblox, Rivian, Lucid Motors are valued at extremely high valuations. This is because when you use a discount rate of 1-2%,  future earnings are worth very close to present earnings.

With a discount rate of 2%, earnings in 30 years are worth 55% of present earnings. However, if you raise that discount rate to 7% due to higher treasury yields, earnings 30 years from now are worth just 11% of present earnings!

On the contrary, value stocks like Intel are currently very cheap. In this market, no one wants to own ""Dinosaur"" companies that aren't growing. They would rather own the companies they expect to be bigger in 30 years, like AMD, Nvidia, etc. And with a 1-2% discount rate, the math checks out. 

When interest rates rise substantially, if they do, growth stocks that depend on low rates to justify their valuation will get hit HARD, with as much as 80% downside. Value stocks will be hit as well as their future earnings are discounted further, but not nearly to the same extent that growth stocks do, since they have high present earnings.

Personally, my portfolio is tilted very high towards value stocks and profitable stocks. I hold Fidelity Large Cap Value and Fidelity Small Cap value, and Fidelity Real Estate, as well as VYM and VIG as an indirect way to factor tilt towards profitable stocks.

Of course, stocks always carry market risk. A recession can drive a crash due to lower earnings, as it did in 2009, and in 2020. If you are investing for the short term, it may be smart to avoid having too much in equities.",finance
personalfinance,Taking out money from trad. IRA to put into Roth IRA,"I had a traditional IRA with primerica and I recently discovered how terrible they are.

I was so upset to find out primerica never changed the misspelling of my first name. Well I tried to take care of it by contacting primerica to change my name but they told me only my agent could do it. Well my agent hadn’t been answering my calls.

personalfinance,"Which is cheaper, paying student loans or continuing to be a student?","Firstish time posting here, I don't think this violates 

So this is more to check my own math than anything else. This necessitates subsidized federal loans, as I believe those are the only type that defer while enrolled. Currently, I owe 26k in 3 loans, all at about 2.5 to 3% interest.Edit: these loans are all subsidized. If I pursue grad school, this could be anticipated to triple, depending on program. Edit: However, those are a separate consideration from the current hypothetical plan.

Napkin math, assuming 100 bucks a month, that's 35 years to pay off, with 16k in interest.

A single credit at my local community college costs 100 bucks, plus around 150 in enrollment fees. So broken down by month, that's around a $85 a month, plus the added benefit of continuing my education. An added benefit, I currently work at said community college, so tuition up to a point is free. Which makes the cost more like $50 a month.

I get that this doesn't make the debt go away, but it does prevent it from accruing interest, potentially giving me a better chance to deal with life expenses. Or even pay it off while in school, attacking the principle directly.

Potentially, I could accrue certifications and licenses that would increase my earning potential as well. Welding licenses, drone piloting, etc.

personalfinance,"New to this subreddit, should I restructure?","Hello everyone!

I recently got an offer for a personal loan. When I tried to apply for it, they said I wouldn't be able to get one until I met certain criteria.

Here's the backstory:

I've been great at paying my credit cards (more than the minimums, but keeping a small balance) up until 2021. I have a lot of medical debt that I try to keep up on, but it seems like new collection agencies call all the time. I try to get as much info from them as I can, but it's hard to keep track of it all. I've been paying the minimums on my federal student loans up until the pandemic when they've been in forbearance. 

This year went to hell. I'm married and we had a baby in March. There was a lot of complications (Mommy and Baby are okay now!) so we had a lot of co-pays and additional debts. We also had to both take family leave. I took a month off and my wife took 2 months. After I came back to work, my appendix ruptured so I was back out another month. We've been having trouble getting disability and our family leave from the state due to them being so busy. We're both back at work again finally. Our cards are maxed and we owe friends and family.

We paid our rent, groceries, etc, but we're late on utilities and my car payment. Never late before.

The company, Liberty 1 Financial, has good reviews and an A+ from BBB. I only gave them my info for the offer that was rejected. They told me my credit score dropped from mid 600s to mid 500 in less than 8 months, mostly due to one missed car payment, and a collection I missed. The associate told me that the drops in credit have been more severe this year (maybe due to covid?). Between my score, and the missed payments, no bank would lend to me.

They told me about a restructuring. He said it wasn't bankruptcy. It would drastically lower my monthly payments and while it would temporarily reduce my credit, in the end I would be paid off and my credit would increase. He told me based on my income, it would take 30 years to pay off my debt (which is 82k he said), but with the restructuring, if I paid on time, it would be done in 2 years. It would close the accounts that they restructured though, which I believe would hurt my credit? After 6 on time payments, I could reapply for the loan they said.

I know very little about all of this. Should I take the restructuring? Should we call back and include my wife's income and accounts? Should I get more info?

stocks,"Remember, the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock!","Before I start, letting you know I have no short positions on any company whatsoever. As someone greatly explained it to me,   

***The problem is that with shorts you are not betting that the stocks is undervalued, you are betting that people will realize within a short span of time that it is overvalued which is more risky than the former.***

Anyways, I been seeing and hearing lately a lot of people looking for long-term investments during 2021. Don't mean to be a bear, but it's important to understand that the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock.

There are plenty of companies out there going mainstream with potential for a bright future. EV sector, Renewable sector, Crypto, Fintech &amp; Tech, etc. 

I agree. I firmly believe renewables, electric vehicles, and internet-based payments are, in fact, the future. EV vehicle sales are growing at exponential paces. Solar panels will be seen more and more in your neighborhoods. ATMs probably won't even exist in 2030. Major cities are pushing for 100% electric buses by 2035. Major car dealerships are expecting to sell only EVs by 2040. Crypto is making a push as well.

But what's important is also hopping in the stock at the right price. Now, I'm not advocating for market timing. But hopping into Rivian, whose currently valued at $100B with 0 sales is just insane. Lucid being another one whose valued at $75B with a QUARTER of a MILLION in sales. Don't even get me started on $PLUG. $PLUG is a leader in hydrogen fuel cells for forklifts that reported negative revenue (wtf) and is valued $23B. We all know Tesla is a leader in its sector as well, but the price is outrageous. History has shown prices will always correct based on the company's fundamentals. Too many posts on $TSLA so I won't go into this. 

It's no doubt we are in a bubble. Lots of ""Stock Gurus"" on Instagram promoting all these overvalued stocks just because their ""future looks bright"", and here come all these people commenting talking about how they just invested for the long term. Not saying their future isn't bright, but it's important to know when a stock is reasonably priced as opposed to just hearing a pitch line and going all in if they convince you. 

I have no ounce of doubt the prices will drop substantially. I'm not worried about missing out on these hyped stocks. And no, I'm not talking about a 30% correction. Check the dot com bubble companies. I'm talking 95% corrections. Several bankruptcies across the globe. 

 ***The 2000 dot-com market collapse was triggered by technology stocks. Investors' interest in internet related companies increased to a frenzied level following massive growth and adoption of the internet.*** 

***It was the unprecedented rise in equity valuations of internet-based tech companies during the bull market of the late 1990s*** 

***The dotcom bubble burst when capital began to dry up. In the years preceding the bubble, record low interest rates, the adoption of the Internet, and interest in technology companies allowed capital to flow freely, especially to startup companies that had no track record of success.*** 

I'm not here to spark rage or scare you. It's just the hard truth, lots of inexperienced investors have no idea how crazy the outcome could get. Once the big banks and heads at Wall Street realize its insanely overvalued, the rug pull will come.

personalfinance,Trad vs Roth retirement for middle-aged (relatively) high earners,"Hello all! I am contemplating changing our retirement mix for next year and was hoping for some thoughts on the Roth vs. traditional account question. I am satisfied with the amount that we're putting away but I'm wondering if we should change the Roth vs traditional mix. I know the reddit personal finance world is very pro-Roth, but I wonder if that's something that really more applies to people who are younger and/or not as far along in their careers.

To give a little bit on our current situation: my wife and I are in our late 40s, and, to the extent that anyone can predict this, are probably towards the high end of our earning life, making pretty good money and living in a relatively high-tax/high cost-of-living state. At the moment, we are in a 31% combined fed/state tax bracket. Our ultimate goal is to retire to a lower tax, lower cost-of-living state.

Probably we should've put more into Roth accounts when we were younger, but obviously that can't be undone now. At the moment only about 12% of our retirement savings are in a Roth account. It would be nice to have a bigger pool that we could withdraw money from tax free upon retirement; however, to the extent that it's possible to predict, we seem like the prime example of people who are in a higher tax bracket now than we will be upon retirement, in which case it seems to me that the math of a Roth doesn't make much sense. The immediate tax savings we get from putting money into traditional retirement accounts definitely frees up room in our budget to put more into retirement.

Anyway, just curious on people's thoughts on whether we should stick with traditional retirement accounts or shift a portion to Roth, and the rationale behind it. Thanks in advance!",finance
stocks,"SROs, Complexity and Market Structure","Last week I actually lost sleep due to frustration and anger at the current self-regulatory structure in markets. While this is kind of silly and a bit absurd (though it did happen!), I think it’s worth examining and explaining how the incentives for a self-regulatory, for-profit company lead to extreme complexity and subsidization in US markets. It’s easy to say “self-regulatory BAD!” but harder to understand the web of complexity that such perverse structures create.

This is a long post. By the end, I hope you understand what the self-regulatory structure is, why it exists, why it creates perverse incentives, and how I think it should be fixed. I’ll do my best to explain the context of these archaic structure, why it leads to unnecessary complexity, and reduces competitive forces. Most importantly, throughout the piece think about how such perverse incentives leads to lax enforcement and wrist slaps, and a cozy relationship with the industry being regulated.

The financial services industry is the only industry in America (that I am aware of) in which for-profit, publicly traded firms are “self-regulatory.” What does “self-regulatory” mean and where did it come from? The structure came about from the member-owned stock exchanges that existed prior to 1934. In 1934 these exchanges were brought into partnership with federal regulators in the Exchange Act of 1934. This actually made a lot of sense. There was nobody better positioned to monitor and enforce the rules of a stock exchange (where trading happened in a physical location, on the floor of the exchange) than the exchange itself. There were conflicts-of-interest, of course, but there were also practical considerations of what technology and communication systems looked like in the early 1900s.

So what does “self-regulatory” mean? Now of course, I’m no lawyer, so take everything I say with that in mind. Essentially the self-regulatory structure gives the regulation arm of the exchange quasi-governmental powers (it’s been explained to me that this structure means the exchange is supposed to act as an extension of the SEC) – and gives the exchange itself immunity from prosecution when carrying out regulatory functions. It basically means that US exchanges set the rules for trading in US markets, and for interacting with their business, are then in charge of enforcing those rules and have no legal liability in the operation of that business. Those rules include things like fee structure, order types, matching priority model, co-location and data feed costs, and many other things.

That means each for-profit exchange is setting its own rules, and responsible for enforcing those rules. Each exchange is responsible for monitoring its own market for manipulation (called “market surveillance”). In reality, the responsibility for market surveillance is outsourced to FINRA. FINRA is another SRO – they are not a for-profit exchange, but they are responsible for setting the rules and policing broker/dealers. You may have heard of some of the other SROs – the DTCC, the OCC, the NSCC and others listed [here](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml).

FINRA, DTCC, OCC and NSCC are not for-profit, of course, but they are deeply conflicted. They operate on the fees generated by their members, who they police and regulate; stock exchanges do too – their best customers are high-speed speculators (aka HFT), who submit 95% of all orders, and are a party to \~90% of all trades. These speculators also pay for expensive, proprietary data feeds, high-speed connections and cross-connects, and other exchange services. SROs are supposed to police these customers, and are charged with ensuring that their best customers follow the rules.

*Gee Dave, that sounds like a conflict-of-interest! At least it’s not for anything important, like the foundation of the US economy, right?*

It is generally the SROs that have made breaking the rules a cost of doing business (naturally following the lead of the SEC, of course). While they don’t have the authority to press criminal charges (again, not a lawyer) they could easily make referrals and work with the DOJ, who does have that authority. Instead, nearly all of Wall St has decided that breaking the rules is nearly always only worth a fine, very rarely an industry ban, and practically never a perp walk and prison.

Just like nobody lost their banking license for fraud following the Great Financial Crisis, can you remember a time when a major broker/dealer had their license revoked? Robinhood has been fined well over $100M by FINRA and the SEC for lying to their customers, failing to provide best execution, and underinvesting in compliance, technology and any system for protecting their customers. For some reason, none of this was enough to lose their license to operate. Those guys are laughing all the way to the bank. Fine after fine is charged to every broker on Wall St, paid by the shareholders, and everyone keeps collecting their bonuses.

**First SRO Problem: Reluctance to exact severe consequences because the fees being collected from the perps are paying for SRO operations and bonuses.**

However, there’s another side to all of this. Let’s take a concrete example to start. In 2014, BATS and DirectEdge merged. Together, they represented approximately 20% of trading in the US. Each of them operated 2 copycat exchanges – a maker/taker exchange (BZX and EDGX) and an inverted exchange (BYX and EDGA). In any other industry, such a merger would result in the consolidation of these exchanges so that the resulting company would only operate 2 exchanges. But that didn’t happen here. They continued to run 4 exchanges and do to this day. Why would they do that when it costs way more to run 4 exchanges rather than 2? The answer is actually quite simple and obvious – money. To understand why, we have to take a quick step back, and reference another law.

The 1975 Amendments to the 1934 Exchange Act established the need (and gave the SEC the authority) to create the Securities Information Processor (SIP). It was groundbreaking at the time. The SIP is the “ticker” – a record of quotes and trades on all national securities exchanges. Ultimately the SEC did NOT create such a system though, it delegated the authority to the exchanges. The exchanges created the NMS Committees, which are responsible for managing the SIP and setting fees. From last year’s SEC press release announcing changes to the SIP:

&gt;In  1975, one of Congress’s principal objectives for the national  market  system was to assure the availability of information with respect  to  quotations for, and transactions in, securities.  The national   securities exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority   (“FINRA” and collectively, the “SROs”) have acted jointly to collect,   consolidate, and disseminate information for NMS stocks.  For each NMS   stock, the SROs were required to provide specified NMS market data to   exclusive securities information processors (“SIPs”).  The SIPs then   consolidated that information and made it available to the public.  The   rules adopted today are designed to modernize and improve upon that   historical infrastructure, by expanding the content of NMS market data   and replacing the historical “exclusive SIP” model with a decentralized   model of “competing consolidators.” 

**ALRIGHT ENOUGH HISTORY DAVE, WTF IS THE SIP??**

Sorry, it’s hard to talk about this stuff without getting deep in the weeds. The SIP is generally referred to as the “public data feed” – at the moment (though this is changing), it provides top-of-book quotes across all US exchanges, calculates the NBBO and publishes it, communicates regulatory halts and other information, and publishes all trades both on- and off-exchange.

**And guess what? You pay for it.**

That’s right – you are paying for the SIP. Nearly every retail broker subscribes to the SIP, and generally speaking when you see the prices that a stock is being quoted at, or trading for, you’re seeing SIP data. This public data feed costs $4 per user, per month, for non-professional, display-only users – if you’re not a financial professional, and you’re only seeing the data with your eyes (rather than programming a trading system that will automatically look at the data), then you are a non-professional, display-only user.

What are all of those user fees worth? Something on the order of &gt; $300M per year. That money is collected by the operators of the SIP (NYSE and Nasdaq), and distributed according to a very complicated formula to each of the exchanges. On the whole, it gets divided up based on quoting and trading market share, and means that approximately $100M every year goes to CBOE, NYSE and Nasdaq (with much less going to the smaller exchanges). That’s why BATS/DirectEdge (and now CBOE, which acquired them in 2016) was incentivized to continue to operate 4 exchanges, because it meant that more of this public subsidy would go to them. Talk about perverse – it’s the exact opposite of what the 1934 Exchange Act was established to do:

It gets even worse (No way Dave! How can it be worse than this??). Each exchange sells private data feeds that are faster and contain more information than the SIP. So the exchanges are incentivized to ensure that the SIP remains slow, and has less data, so they can make more money selling their private feeds. Pretty sweet gig if you can get it, right?

Now, I’ve simplified the issue, of course. It gets even more complex with Reg NMS and order protection, which requires all exchanges to connect and route to one another, and brokers to manage that complexity as well. It means that CBOE gets double the revenue for private market data, and other connectivity fees, all of which ensures that CBOE earnings per share are robust and growing, and which accomplishes the opposite of the intention of the 1934 Act.

**Second SRO Problem: SRO structure is a classic example of regulation and subsidy creating inefficient and costly complexity.**

The BATS/DirectEdge example is only one of so many that highlight the unnecessary complexity at the heart of US markets. I’ve talked many times about the need for regulators to understand complex systems and systems theory, to understand evolving regulatory structures in that context, and to focus on simplifying markets rather than making them more complex. Unnecessary complexity leads to several problems:

1. Opacity – it becomes very difficult to understand these complex systems. That leads to mistrust, and potentially loss of confidence. We are seeing that play out right now in the retail community, and for good reason. Nobody trusts Wall St.
2. Fragility – unnecessary complexity can lead to fragility. For example, the segmentation in US markets that diverts retail order flow to the duopoly of Citadel and Virtu leaves exchanges as toxic cesspools that discourage market making. This both widens spreads and reduces market making diversity, leading to behavior that can result in illiquidity contagions (mini flash crashes).
3. Rent Seeking and Concentration – unnecessary complexity incentivizes a select few firms to master the complexity. This puts them in a privileged position, and creates economies of scale where the more of the market they master and control, the more information they have that others don’t, and the more they’re able to master and control. They push SROs to create ever more complexity to maintain their incumbent position, and are able to extract rents as a result. The SROs listen to these firms because they are responsible for more and more trading activity, which means they are the SROs’ best customers. Instead of SROs following their duties under the 1934 Act, they act in the interests of their shareholders to maximize revenue. This cycle continues unabated.

**Third SRO Problem: Unnecessary complexity makes markets opaque, fragile and leads to a feedback loop of rent seeking and concentration of power. The for-profit motive overrides the SRO’s duty to create fair and efficient markets.**

I mentioned before that SROs have legal immunity. This means many things, but primarily it means that the brokers who are members of the exchange don’t have legal recourse when something goes wrong. It is for this reason that retail brokers who don’t accept PFOF still route to the off-exchange duopoly of Citadel and Virtu, because they want someone’s neck to wring when something goes wrong. The legal immunity that exchanges enjoy is one of the reasons that we have dramatically segmented markets.

**Fourth SRO Problem: Legal immunity for for-profit, publicly traded companies leads to perverse incentives and terrible outcomes.**

So what’s the result? A huge amount of unnecessary complexity, enforcement becoming a cost of doing business, and ultimately fragile markets with low participant diversity delivering poor outcomes for investors as the for-profit SROs focus on creating churn and volume to increase earnings per share.

More complexity means more fragmentation. More fragmentation means more complex order types. More fragmentation and complex order types means more unnecessary trading and churn. More unnecessary trading and churn means more earnings for publicly traded SROs. Rinse and repeat. It ultimately means that we end up with so much complexity that it’s impossible to keep track of. Take a look at the results of this 2018 RBC study on exchange fee structure (the picture is awesome, but I can't seem to add pictures to a post in this sub-reddit):

* Exchanges have at least 1,023 pricing “paths”
* 3,762  separate pricing variables across the exchanges – “strongly suggest  that exchange prices are tailored and offered on a bespoke basis”
* Extreme complexity, customized for specific firms
* Extreme routing distortion (TD’s “virtually all” limit orders routed to EDGX)
* Fee-agnostic brokers had 7x better VWAP performance (Clearpool)

If someone can explain how this fee structure “promotes just and equitable principles of trade,” “protects investors and the public interest,” and is “not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers” I’m all ears. Go ahead, give it a try!

Now, let’s take this convoluted, inefficient structure, add in a regulatory revolving door, corrupt campaign contribution system and corrupt politicians, mix it all together, and out comes the US crony capitalist system.

**GET OFF THE SOAP BOX DAVE, WHAT DO WE DO?**

So glad you asked. I’ve been asked a bunch of times what I think should change about US market structure, what I would do if I was SEC Chair (imagine that), etc. My answer is nearly always the same – reduce complexity. When I say reduce complexity, this post is what I’m talking about:

· End the self-regulatory structure.

· Build a proper regulator (complete overhaul of the SEC) with experts who are compensated appropriately.

· Prioritize handcuffs, not wrist slaps and fines. Make the industry fearful of regulatory and enforcement consequences.

· Reduce the number of exchanges, end public subsidy through SIP fees, get rid of every copycat exchange.

Bitcoin,Would you rather put your money in the bank or Bitcoin?,"Now the global monetary solution seems to be just to keep cutting interest rates and printing money. 

Over the past decade, with loose monetary policy and credit policy. 

Both the real estate and stock markets have grown sharply, and banks' balance sheets are at unprecedented levels. 

And interest rates are almost negative. 

Cash is unlikely to be a profitable way of saving any time soon.

Bitcoin,value vs. expected return,"quoting from [here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/the%20rise%20and%20rise%20of%20the%20global%20balance%20sheet%20how%20productively%20are%20we%20using%20our%20wealth/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-global-balance-sheet-nov-2021-full-report_final.pdf):

&gt;Strikingly, net worth is still mostly tangible. While investment in intangible assets has grown relative to investment in tangible assets in many countries when broadly measured, under current accounting standards, intellectual property—including research and development, software, and original artworks—is assumed to rapidly lose its value to competition and obsolescence. On paper, intellectual property products make up less than 4 percent of global net worth and real assets. Intangibles do, however, generate economic returns. The OECD reported in 2015 that intangible assets had expected returns of 24 percent, the highest rate among produced asset categories.

my first question is specific. **what does this sentence mean**: ""under current accounting standards, intellectual property—including research and development, software, and original artworks—is assumed to rapidly lose its value to competition and obsolescence."" **what are you investing in, when you invest in google, if not in the value of its intellectual property?** i realize google has not been around for very long, in the grand scheme of things, but it would be quite a surprise if it weren't still a major player in five years, no?

now my questions start to get vague.

if you read someone like buffett or sam altman, you leave thinking that only productive things are valuable (buffett likes a sure linear function; altman likes a possible exponential function), but that is obviously in some sense absurd, not just because valuable things are also valuable, but also because it is not at all clear that there is a clear distinction between things that are valuable for being productive and those that are valuable for having a personal canon of historical value. (indeed, altman does make caveats for land, even at the crescendi of his [hymn to productivity](https://moores.samaltman.com/).) again, from the mckinsey report:

&gt;The global economy has undergone a vast transformation over the past two decades, as rapid technological progress including digitization has taken hold and investment in intangible assets has soared. Yet over this same period, global wealth has grown largely as a result of the rising value of household real estate, a historical store of value

my rough read (very possible that this is not just a simplification, but downright inaccurate) is that they (mckinsey) basically attribute this discrepancy to loose monetary policy — i.e., it has been, on average, easier to increase net worth by taking out a loan, buying a tangible/valuable thing, and paying off that loan, than by buying an intangible/productive thing.

**but then why are all the largest companies in the world precisely those that principally (?) own intangible/productive things (tech)?**

i read [something](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/) recently that includes a lemma (see the ""Scratching the surface"" section), referencing another [article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3667309), to the effect that the housing valuations in 2008 were in some sense *not* inflated, insofar as the run-up basically amounted to an increasingly accurate assessment, on the demand side, of the intrinsic (even *productive*) value of living in certain properties.

i think the best tl;dr, here, is that i am becoming increasingly suspicious of the distinction, which seems pervasive (especially the higher up you go in the intellectual totem pole), between speculation, on the one hand, and investment in productive/technological assets, on the other.

not really done with this, but [no one gives us any time any more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khnokW3Mw24), so i'm just going to post it and make edits/clarifications later.

#### P.S.

 i think some of the impetus for this post was simply my brain balking at the statement that intellectual property products (including all software) make up only 4% of global net worth. i am also having trouble understanding why the valuation of (or: the net worth held in) real estate would not diminish in proportion to the difference between (a) the average rate of return on real estate (rent + capital gain)[1] and (b) the average rate of return on intangibles (24%, according to that first quotation in the original post).

[1] just found another long-term [article](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1225/5435538) on this topic:

&gt;In terms of total returns, residential real estate and equities have shown very similar and high real total gains, on average about 7% a year. Housing outperformed equities before World War II. Since World War II, equities have outperformed housing on average but had much higher volatility and higher synchronicity with the business cycle. The observation that housing returns are similar to equity returns, but much less volatile, is puzzling. Like Shiller (2000), we find that long-run capital gains on housing are relatively low, around 1% a year in real terms, and considerably lower than capital gains in the stock market. However, the rental yield component is typically considerably higher and more stable than the dividend yield of equities so that total returns are of comparable magnitude.

more concretely, page A25, table A19 of a third [article](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1640194258&amp;Signature=KMtwxYshgxY4XJDCivdvlmRkrpJilDCRNnTItdOggrNsb8FlVD-M6saSiU-FTh2lJlbTS2evJvF0q~lcld90bR0Q7-gGuzbBGIj7KBWTSPcvEH0yLK~9s1O8mEfTddVbxEri48l1OTWTGZ18p3sNjU7MNoHWTGZ7GVh5lGBT40W~jbLtyQZpHuBj6FYFrtC2FCOVEj4b9fC9l5m0CAztwEK3rbWe5ndBY66tL7t7yN8Q6aNM-Va6B3d3RO0UN2~0ot6WhZGsncdXfTY8AlRmRThCofYpOWRMG5pzdU0JrOIcE97ZH6dFFMeovTerbo63VAUGL72N0ktCbJhGXRncxA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) article puts long-term, average rental yield at 5.33%. elsewhere this same article cites figures closer to 4%. the real capital gain on real estate, on the other hand, is only 0.90% (same table). so the most naive version of my question in my original post could be something like: **if the average return on real estate is, say, 7%, and the average return on ""intangibles"" (tech, IP, etc.) is on average 24% — why hasn't all liquidity moved into intangibles?** (Or: why is as much or more net worth still tied to real estate (see page 9 of the mckinsey [report](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/the%20rise%20and%20rise%20of%20the%20global%20balance%20sheet%20how%20productively%20are%20we%20using%20our%20wealth/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-global-balance-sheet-nov-2021-full-report_final.pdf), specifically the chart titled ""Net worth has grown much faster than GDP since 2000, with variations by country"")?)

#### P.P.S. / tl;dr

i actually put the original post (above) in a couple of other places and got some sort of answer to all the explicit questions in it, but the thrust-confusion still feels undissipated: **if productive assets yield higher returns than non-productive stores of value like real estate, why wouldn't net worth track or start to track productive assets, in the long run?** (i understand that the phrase ""in the long run"" can function as a sophistical backdoor, here.) moreover, it is not just that net worth has grown faster than productivity (as per the mckinsey report), it is that this differential *has itself grown* *since the rise of big tech* (again, see the chart titled ""Net worth has grown much faster than GDP since 2000, with variations by country"" on page 9 of the mckinsey report).

i do have a secret, weirdo perspective on this, which i did not include in my original post because it hasn't really crystallized into a coherent sentence yet (can't procrastinate for more than 6-7 hours of my 8 hour work day without someone noticing), and which is part of why i was stirred by the report to write the original post. my attempt at an articulation would be something like this: the importance of productivity increases in proportion to the unimportance of the product — **i.e., things that are very important require relatively little work in order to maintain their value or growth against some benchmark, whereas things that are unimportant require a frequency of renovation that is elevated in proportion to the thing's unimportance.**

take the internet, for example: if it were not constantly refreshed, built on, etc., it would be immediately useless — my reversal, here, is that this can be taken as a symptom of the ""thing"" being unimportant in itself **(e.g., the fact that google (or even coke, for that matter) has grown so much would here be taken as a** ***symptom of the unimportance of its kernel rather than as a proof of its ""intrinsic value""*****)**. silicone valley rhetoric is emphatic that innovation creates value where it wasn't, but what if we just phrase this as: **value ""creation"" becomes more necessary the smaller and more vacuous the principal.**

this would be a reversal in the mindset of the typical entrepreneur: you are not trying to make a thing that people want or value, you are trying to start from the cheapest principal and maximize its *currency —* i.e., its fungibility, its cultural relevancy, its pervasiveness — its function as a *medium* not as *content*.

the medium is always just the most abundant structure, not the largest or most valuable structure.

this is *not a finished thought.* i am fully aware of that. but i have a stand-up in a few mins.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What's saving more on my mortgage - Points or Credits?,"Hey all,

I'm trying to get some advice on what might be a better cost-saving route when deciding my rate.  Right now I'm working with my builder's lender on a new construction we purchased for 745K in CA. We're putting 16% down and our rate options range from 3.375% (with $5426 cost for points) to 3.875%. (with $3876 lender credit).  

Most advice I've seen is that people recommend NOT paying for points and for the higher interest rate and plan to refinance with a lower rate. However, by my calculations it doesn't make a lot of sense.  The higher interest rate we'll quickly eat up the difference of the monthly payment and I'll be paying more interest overall. I also don't see the rates going down anytime soon since they were already historically low. The other variable is the plan is to possibly leave the house in \~5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

This is definitely not me shilling anything. In fact, it's probably the opposite. I read a commentary article on some news site I visit that was all about how blockchain could be the solution to ransomware problems. The article is here for reference. [https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2021/11/dont-make-ransomware-harder-for-cybercriminals-make-it-impossible/](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2021/11/dont-make-ransomware-harder-for-cybercriminals-make-it-impossible/)

It calls for a next-gen blockchain with ""unlimited scalability, exceptional security and inherent flexibility"" to solve the issue. Ok, my BS-detectors are going off. What's going on here? Next the author goes on to explain how TPS is to blockchains what bandwidth is to internet. I don't particularly like this comparison because a blockchain requires a network connection which would also be restrained by bandwidth. And a ""transaction"" could be a few Kb or a few Gb depending on what the blockchain is doing and what you consider a usable transaction. He talks about how streaming wasn't usable on 56k modems but are now that bandwidth has increased so much. I think a lot of blockchains could be infinitely scalable if resources are also infinitely scalable. But ok, maybe he's boiling it down in simpler terms to reach a broader / newer audience. I can get past the comparison but he's counting on tech leaps that haven't happened yet. Or have they...

Then he uses the term ""military-grade encryption"". The military has to use FIPS 140 compliant encryption. FIPS compliant encryption doesn't mean it's the most secure encryption out there. It means it's the most secure encryption that has been approved. I wouldn't call their approval process simple so I have to believe this lags behind industry quite a bit. But again, maybe he's just appealing to the federal community he's writing to. 

Once you finish the article, you see it's written by the founder and CEO of Upheaval LLC. Oh look at that, they're a company who claims to have blockchain solutions. But the author doesn't mention them in the article or make any claims as to what their company can do to fix it. Maybe they didn't want to buy ad space. So dude writes a ""There has to be a better way..."" article prophesizing about how some magical blockchain could solve all these problems. Then you look up his company and they're claiming to have all these solutions. 

I've never heard of the company or their solutions before. So I wanted to check here because if there's one place I can count on to poke holes in something, it's reddit. If you go to their website, you get to meet their leaders and can learn more about investing. But there's no white paper. Nothing to tell me anything about the technology.

CryptoCurrency,My story on why crypto is the future,"Here is a story and  3 reasons that helped me confirm my own thoughts that crypto is the future.

I had a small but significant wad of notes (call it enough for a nice lunch for 2 adults) from an overseas trip, there are not many near exchanges in my town (reason 1) so  I head to the nearest place one town over

I get there, the cashier is rude as s**t and is even talking to someone else through her headset while I'm speaking to her

I swap the money and probably get screwed on the exchange rate (reason 2), but as soon as I have the money in my hand the casher exclaims 'WAIT!'and stops me

'I'm sorry there is a 10% fee' she says (Reason 3)

Now at this point I could have just bolted out the door and nothing bad would probably have happened, but at that moment I just decided to be passive and let her take the 10%, whatever, I couldn't be doing with an argument with this witch

So as we planned on having lunch next door, I just stuffed the money in my pocket (quite loose fitting pants) and headed out

I walked a very short distance to my girlfriend who was waiting in the car, walked back to the lunch place, made my order and by the time I rummaged in my pocket the money was gone, it had most definitely fallen out of my pocket sometime between me walking from the car to the store

In 10 minutes I went from exchanging money, to losing 10%, to have nothing left.

Now crypto will never stop anyone being stupid and losing money like me, but it would have stopped the stupid exchange process taking place in the first place.

Lunch was still good though. C'est la vie",cryptocurrency

Well 2 months later my phone was dead and sadly I took it to the store, they wiped the phone and I did not get those screenshots back. I reached out to the wallet company themselves they said:

Stocks traded mixed on Thursday, with Nasdaq (QQQ) massively outperforming on the day, driving by strength in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell for the second straight day. Market participants continue to digest the tail-end of a better-than-expected corporate earnings season amid a backdrop of rising inflation. 

Key Numbers For Today 

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.34%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.04% 
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.13%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.41%
* Apple (AAPL): +2.9%
* Amazon (AMZN): +4.14%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): +8.25%
* Alibaba (BABA): -11.26%
* Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID): -16.4% and -10.47%

After a monster run-up last month, the choppiness in the market can be attributed to mixed economic reports coming out recently. While US retail sales came in better-than-expected, a great sign that consumer demand  is staying robust, the recent report on inflation showed the fastest pace of growth in roughly 30 years. 

Earlier in the week, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), two of the largest retailers in the US, reported earnings. While the report was better than expected, executives from both companies raised concerns over rising prices, rising labor costs, and supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. 

The possible staying power of inflation remains the central focus for market participants, as a potential damper to consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP and as a catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than originally expected. Despite starting to taper the pace of quantitative easing, the Fed has remained very accommodative and says an interest rate hike could take place sometime near the middle of next year. It would be really bad for markets if the timeline is accelerated. 

Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. 

The Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:

UniSwap,It's Value for Money,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.  

 

**TLDR**:

Money accrues value either from the material used to make it (e.g. weight and price of gold coin) or by the power of the state (e.g. central bank). They differ in monetary policy. To legitimise money using the power of the state, there is a 3-step process. Bitcoin is on its path to becoming a powerful money with the 3-step process.

 

# General Conclusion

You've probably heard enough about the whole argument of ""money used to be gold"". In this episode, we will uncover the fundamentals of **how money accrues value** from 2 perspectives — metallism and chartalism.

There are plenty of research and papers talking about the justification of value. From Bretton Woods to equation of exchange explanations, this episode will take a more fundamental view of money. After all, economics design is about understanding the basic fundamentals of an economy so we can build upon them.

# 1. Metalism vs Chartalism

1 penny is worth 1 cent on its face value. But if you melt that penny into its copper and nickel material, it is worth 1.5 cents in 2016. That difference in value of the penny is the difference between metalism and chartalism.

**Metallist** money is where the **thing has value** in its own rights. That is the value of copper in that coin, 1.5 cents.

**Chartalist** money is where the **thing** **represents value**. That is the face value of the penny, 1 cent.

In metalist money, money only serves the function of a **medium of exchange**. Chartalist money has 2 other functions, **unit of account** and **means of payment**. Chartalist money has a balance sheet function. Why? Money (asset) is generated from debts (liabilities).

Why is this important?

1. Different monetary policy approaches to the different money
2. How these 2 money both exists in our international economy today (IMF's special drawing rights VS sovereign currencies)
3. Money being an independent vs dependent *thing*

# 2. 3-Steps to Legitimising Money

What is legitmise money? That is when money has a stamp by the central bank as legal tender.

Here, we are not asking the what. We are asking the **HOW**. How to legitimise money.

* Step 1: social debt obligations via taxes
* Step 2: social and legal contracts
* Step 3: credit system

# 3. Application to Bitcoin

Bitcoin moved from metallist money (pre-2016 period) to chartalist money (especially post-mining). Following the 3-step process, we also observe a boom in credit infrastructure compared to 2009.

Notable **credit infrastructure (step 3)** in the Bitcoin ecosystem:

* wBTC and pTokens that are ERC-20 tokens, used in the ethereum defi platforms
* Atomic loans to lock Bitcoin in an escrow and borrow DAI and USDC
* Ren provides access to intern-blockchain liquidity in Dapps
* Various other fiat on-ramp to allow for btc as payment like Carbon Fiber and Moonpay
* Lightning network to enable instant payment

# What Does this Mean

The future of money could go in at least 3 ways:

1. Public Money by Central Bank *(Government)*
2. Private Money by Companies *(Facebook)*
3. Private Money by Machine *(Bitcoin’s code)*

These systems can all coexist at the same time. It is perhaps high time for us to think of a new monetary world order. E.g. money based on geography (money #1), money based on corporate power (money #2), money based on ideologies (money #3).",cryptocurrency
CryptoMarkets,It's Value for Money,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.  

 

**TLDR**:

Money accrues value either from the material used to make it (e.g. weight and price of gold coin) or by the power of the state (e.g. central bank). They differ in monetary policy. To legitimise money using the power of the state, there is a 3-step process. Bitcoin is on its path to becoming a powerful money with the 3-step process.

 

# General Conclusion

You've probably heard enough about the whole argument of ""money used to be gold"". In this episode, we will uncover the fundamentals of **how money accrues value** from 2 perspectives — metallism and chartalism.

There are plenty of research and papers talking about the justification of value. From Bretton Woods to equation of exchange explanations, this episode will take a more fundamental view of money. After all, economics design is about understanding the basic fundamentals of an economy so we can build upon them.

# 1. Metalism vs Chartalism

1 penny is worth 1 cent on its face value. But if you melt that penny into its copper and nickel material, it is worth 1.5 cents in 2016. That difference in value of the penny is the difference between metalism and chartalism.

**Metallist** money is where the **thing has value** in its own rights. That is the value of copper in that coin, 1.5 cents.

**Chartalist** money is where the **thing** **represents value**. That is the face value of the penny, 1 cent.

In metalist money, money only serves the function of a **medium of exchange**. Chartalist money has 2 other functions, **unit of account** and **means of payment**. Chartalist money has a balance sheet function. Why? Money (asset) is generated from debts (liabilities).

Why is this important?

1. Different monetary policy approaches to the different money
2. How these 2 money both exists in our international economy today (IMF's special drawing rights VS sovereign currencies)
3. Money being an independent vs dependent *thing*

# 2. 3-Steps to Legitimising Money

What is legitmise money? That is when money has a stamp by the central bank as legal tender.

Here, we are not asking the what. We are asking the **HOW**. How to legitimise money.

* Step 1: social debt obligations via taxes
* Step 2: social and legal contracts
* Step 3: credit system

Even when we have legitimate money, there is still a hierarchy of money. This is important when it comes to international trade.

personalfinance,Check my math on ROI from buying Treasury I Bonds?,"So I've been seeing a lot of posts recently about Treasury I Bonds and when I did the math regarding potential interest earnings, it doesn't seem all that good of an investment. 

Here is the scenario: 

I Bonds report a composite interest rate, which from Nov 2021 to Apr 2022 is 7.12% given the bonds were purchased in that period. The interest is compounded at the end of the 6 month period.

Suppose I buy $10,000 worth of bonds in Nov 2021 and another $10,000 in Jan 2021. Right now let's just calculate the interest as of Apr 2022, not too worried about after that. 

So the first $10k will be eligible for interest for 5 months (Dec to Apr), which would be:

0.01 * 7.12 * 10,000 * 5 /12 = $296.66

The second $10k would be eligible for 3 months (Feb - Apr), which would be:

0.01 * 7.12 * 10,000 * 3 /12 = $178

So, I know I couldn't touch this money for a while, but around Apr 2022 I should have $178 + $296.66 = $474.66 interest accrued. Is this correct?

Much appreciated if you read this far, thank you. 

The reason this doesn't seem to be as good an investment is because looking at the history of interest rates, 7% is a very high marker. It can't continue too long. If I'm gonna invest this money for 5 years and only make 10% total at the end of that, to me that's not worth it.",finance

algorand,Using Algorand as a savings account? Good or bad idea?,"I currently have my savings in your typical bank savings account that has a super small interest rate of like 0.01%. I recently purchased some Algo and moved it to the official wallet, and I noticed I am making more Algo's just by having them in the wallet and at a much better rate than a bank savings account.

I checked out the Algo rewards and it looks pretty sweet, so I was thinking could I just use the Algo wallet as a savings account basically? I'll get far more rewards than I ever did with bank interest, and I can use them in the Algo eco system once I learn more about it. The only downside I can really think of is having to pay Taxes when I withdraw them for fiat.

personalfinance,Is there really no alternative to stocks? (the TINA trade),"I am in my 20s with a decent income. I have 12 months emergency funds saved up in a high yield savings account, little debt, I don't have a 401(k) at work but I max out my Roth IRA each year and put all my excess money into my regular investment account.

My portfolio consists of: 60% VTI (total US stock market etf) / 40% VXUS (total international stock market etf). In other words, I am 100% in stocks. This is because I don't see any good alternatives for my money. There is a term for this: TINA (there is no alternative).

So is there really no alternative to putting your money in stocks? Let's look at some of them:

1. Bonds: Traditionally a long term portfolio would consist of a mixture of stocks and bonds. But with interest rates so low and only poised to go up, bonds seem like a bad deal. As someone young and is looking for growth anyway, I probably wouldn't go for more than 10% at this point which wouldn't affect my portfolio much.
2. REITs: Real estate investment trusts. These are more like a class of stocks that invest in real estate and have special rules that most of their money must be paid out to the shareholders. I already own some of these as part of my index funds so I don't really see a reason to go overweight in this sector. If you backtest REITs vs the broader stock market, the broader stock market has outperformed historically anyway.
3. Actual real estate: This would be actually buying and running properties. Way too capital and work intensive. I dont' want a second job so I'm looking for passive income. If I was to get involved in this sector it would likely be through REITs.
4. CDs / Savings accounts: Interest rates are too low right now to keep anything other than an emergency fund in the bank.
5. Precious metals: Precious metals have historically been poor investments. Even as inflation hedges they have been sub-par compared to stocks. Buying physical metals is a pain to store them and you pay high fees when buying or selling.
6. Cryptocurrencies / NFTs: I am not a crypto believer. At best they seem like digital gold (see above for why gold is not a good investment) and at worst they are a ponzi scheme. The fact that they are gaining 500% per year seems like speculative mania. And NFTs seems like more digital fugazi.
7. Alternative investments: There are sites that will let you invest in wine, sites that let you invest in art, sites that let you buy personal debt from people, sites that let you invest early in starts ups and all sorts of niche investments. All these seem to have one or more of the following properties: high fees, high risk, long lock up times on your investment.

So, are there really no alternatives to my current strategy of putting all my money into stock market index funds? I'm not too concerned about a crash or volatility due to my age and income. Despite the diversification I get from owning basically every publicly traded company on the planet, it feels a bit un-diversified to put all my eggs into the basket of stocks. Especially when there are a lot of articles coming out saying how the stock market is overvalued and low interest rates have pushed it to a bubble, etc. But I can't think of any other good investments.",finance

personalfinance,How would you manage a raise?,"I just got a promotion, and with it a 7.5% raise. 

We currently have an emergency fund saved, have no debt besides our mortgage and a small balance on our one and only credit card that is paid off in full each month. 

I  don’t really know what to do with money so I just usually add on about 1-2% a year to my 401k. I am currently contributing 9% into it. I’m willing to take some of it and move it around, but my company matches up to 6% so I will not go below that. 

What would you do with the extra money? Between the raise and 401k “extra” have about 10% of my income to play with. (We are at a comfortable place right now with income, not the richest people in the world, but also not worrying about how well pay bills or put food on the table). 

I’m considering just adding 6% to the 401k to bring my contribution up to 15%, but I realize that might not be the best option. Especially because I essentially can’t touch that money if I were to need it. 

I do have the mortgage, I could put that percentage directly on the principal (our interest rate is 3.0%) 

I would love to put it in an account to earn interest (“let your money make you money”) but I’m not sure if there are any saving accounts that would make it worthwhile.

Maybe you guys could help me with some of the math in choosing the right one, and some noob questions.","I looked at 3 Pre price speculation only current price and estimated the percent return I’d get in the coin itself based on interest and how often it compounds. 


1. Algo. Pays 4% interest daily. I can get 2,762 coins. 1 year return: 164,880, 228% 

2. Cosmos 5% interest once a week. I can get 190 coins. 26.42/coin. 1 year return: 1,173%. 

3. Tezos: 4.63% interest every 3 days: I can get 1,043 coins. 4.79/coin. 1 year return: 24,532%

The above is all assuming the price remains the same for a year (it won’t)

Current US dollar value for these are Algo 1.81$, cosmos 26.59$, and Tezos 4.8$.

Before I hear price predictions and whatnot I have noob questions. Algo says 62% of all coins are already in circulation and has a max listed. 1. Does that mean interest return percent and frequency will drop over time? In the next year? And 2. The Algo percent return seems ridiculous to me. So something doesn’t seem right there: Cosmos and tezos do not tell you a percent of total in circulation just how many are currently in circulation. Does that mean there is currently no max limit on the amount that can and will be Produced? 

Some of you may have additional math to add. But the real factor is price per coin speculation over the next year. Which of these three has best long term value and will rise the most in the next year? Or do you think any or all of these will be down a year from now? I’m interested in any math I may have messed up, and about the max supplies versus interest rates and speculation about these three coins.

personalfinance,The Franchise Tax Board of the state of California just froze my bank account....HELP,"Let's start from the beginning, Back in 2014 I worked for a company with offices in California and Washington DC.  When I received my W2s for that year, I was listed as a resident of DC and filed federal and DC taxes. Two years later I start getting notices from the Franchise tax board of California (FTBC) saying I never paid my state taxes and that I owe hundreds of dollars.  The problem is, I never lived or worked in the state of California.  

I called the FTCB and let them know about the mistake.  They tell me this can be fixed by submitting copies of my W2 showing my address in DC,  a copy of my state tax returns, and a letter explaining the error.   I sent over this information and expected that to be the end of it. It was not the end of it, a few months later another letter arrives saying I still owe taxes and now I owe late fees.  Again, I reach out to the FTCB to let them know about the error and ask if they ever received the documents I sent a few months ago.  They had not, so i resent everything hoping this would get things handled.  They continued to send the letters.  At this point I'm frustrated so I call them again and ask to speak to the head the department who handles these things and hopefully get it all resolved.  She apologizes and lets me know she will get this fixed.  IT NEVER GOT RESOLVED! So me being a foolish person just decided to ignore it.  Plus i was frustrated. In my mind I had proved numerous times they had made a mistake, everyone I spoke to at their office agreed, and it was on them to fix it.  That was until today.

I get a notification from my bank saying my account balance is zero. I immediately login to my online banking expecting it to be fraud and I see no suspicious activity so I decide to call customer support.  They let me know its the FTCB and they are freezing my account. 

What do I do in this situation?  How can i get my bank to unfreeze my account?  How do I get the FTCB to stop trying to garnish me?

Please dont kill.me is just my humble.opinion maybe  in my mind is good for the coin and the community maybe the experts in the matter have better ideas than me on how to do/dont do it

Thank you all for read this.

The tax will be $600 for transaction on apps like zelle, cashapp, venmo, paypal etc, 

The bad news is that those app companies says is ok they will cooperate with the IRS reporting this transactions

IRS or goverment know that a lot of personal business are selling goods and receiving the money with apps so now the goverment using IRS are trying to get money taxing everything that they can 

If this was an idea from a gov during 2019 or 2020 i think most of this companies will.reject it, media would be talking about it, as a bad idea for the country, some federal judges will block it, lawyers would be suing the gov, all kind of politics will be defending the small and personal business people etc, but, not now, because now every bad/good idea has a free pass, as we can see and the regular joe as us will.pay taxes for everything i think even for breathing hehe

sorry for my small explanation and the title but the main goal or what im trying to say is people using.this apps can now use our coin

personalfinance,Buying my first car without a loan,"Hi,

I just turned 29 and I would like to buy my first car for my 30th birthday next October. I've been freelancing most of my life and in my country banks/insurances don't really trust people with ""non-traditional"" revenue streams. I've never taken any credit before, but since I'm now able to save a decent amount of money I thought I'd just save until I can afford the car I want. I could still get a credit if I really wanted to but I like the idea of staying credit free.

I don't want to spend over 20K USD, but I'll be saving about $25K between now and December 2022, so this covers the budget. However that would also mean less money going into my emergency fund so I have a couple of basic questions.

- Should I create a separate bank account just for this project or just ""merge"" it with my emergency fund? My reasoning is that the higher the amount in my account, the higher the interest rate (my bank offers up to 4.5% for accounts with over $20K) so is splitting the money worth it?

- I've seen a few years ago that the emergency fund should cover at least 6 months of your monthly expenditures if you are freelancing, and I've been living by this rule since. But I'm still uncomfortable with the idea of spending around 65% of what I'll have in bank in next October. Is there any other rule of thumbs I should be aware of? 

Any advice would be appreciated because I've always lived with that kind of uncertainty, focusing on essential expenditures and saving as much as I can, with good and bad months although things have gotten a lot more stable in the past couple of years.

7. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle.

19. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)

CryptoCurrency,Old man happy with just 1.3%!?,"So I was recently in a local bank (I live in New Zealand) and overheard an older gentleman setting up the next term for his term deposit. While discussing interest rates he was overwhelmed to learn that the bank would now pay him 1.3% on a 1 year term (min $10k deposit) up from 0.7% the year before.   


For those behind the times I bet that would be amazing, but I know crypto. Stable coin staking offers 8% APY+ on good platforms. For a touch of risk you can stake CAKE for around 70% APY and for a lot of risk we have platforms like OHM and TIME offering insane APY's in the thousands!   


I couldn't help but feel sorry for this man and others like him trusting the miniscule payout from the banks who make over 12x what they will pay you. For a visual, you would make $130 over 1 year off $10,000. I wouldn't dare introduce him or anyone else like him to crypto. While there are amazing gains to be made, most people would lose it all and the older folks tend to fall for more scams.

stocks,"Are stock still the best investment for an era of inflation? If so, what kinds of stocks perform best?","I see inflation coming, as far as the eye can see -and for reasons that have nothing to do with anyone's politics or policies.

For now, price spikes are the result of supply trying to catch up with demand from an exploding economy.

Long term, I see inflation.

Starting with your grocery bill as global warming, drought, extinction of pollinators, and depletion of fish stocks creates endemic food shortages (America lost half it winter wheat crop this year due to drought - other nations are experiencing the same).

Labor shortages triggered by retiring Boomers (2.6 million retired during the pandemic ahead of their planned retirement dates) and the collapse of birthrates with a never ending labor shortage - a world wide issue now affecting every advanced and developing economy.

Declining EROI (energy returned over energy invested) for all fossil fuels leading to higher real energy costs (Europe's cost for natural gas is 8x what it was a year ago).

And most importantly, a need to cut Boomer retirement benefits without committing political suicide.

The military and entitlements now make up 90% of the federal budget. Aside from gutting the military, there is nothing substantial to cut from the federal budget and nobody wants to pay taxes - hence massive deficits (Japan is in even worse shape with deficits equaling 3x their GDP directly caused by their declining and aging population).

Nobody wants to pay taxes, so we print money.

35% of all dollars that ever existed were printed in 2020.

That alone triggers inflation, which is a feature - not a bug - for politicians looking to rein in entitlement spending before we truly become bankrupt without getting crucified by older voters (who vote a lot).

So inflation will be deliberately allowed to quietly cut the real value of our retirement benefits without the need for any unpopular vote in congress.

I've tried reading about these coins tied to the price of USD but I'm not understanding what the benefit of buying them is. The coins are always 1:1 with the currency so even if you wanted your money to be ""safe"" I would think it's just as well leaving it in the bank? I mean even if the interest rate is 0.01% it's still more than 0 lol. I also have seen arguments about which coin is ""better"" and I genuinely don't get it.

I figure this is the best place to ask so is anyone able to ELI5 what the benefit(s) of these coins are and how you compare them when they are priced the same and don't change in value?

CryptoCurrency,"HEAR YE, HEAR YE! THE END IS NIGH! (Why I'm extremely bearish)","Bearish posts are not usually welcome, so I'm expecting a deluge of downvotes. SO BE IT!

I see three data points that indicate we are in for a long, deep, protracted crypto winter within the next 3-6 months.

1. Broader macroeconomic trends

The broader economy to me is nearing a breaking point. Inflation is at 6%+ and doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. The U.S. has just passed an additional 3T in spending between the infrastructure bill and BBB. And the Fed is tightening monetary policy by tapering bond purchases and eventually (they claim) raising interest rates. This is in contrast to the past 18 months, where inflation has been low (only recently became high on a prolonged basis) and the Fed has had very loose monetary policy. This is a dangerous ""perfect storm"" for the broader economy.

Any asset that goes up 400% in a year (as Bitcoin has) can also crash. Cryptocurrency has NEVER been tested against a broad market downturn, the likes of which many of us are expecting to experience given the money printing, inflation, low interest rates, sluggish GDP growth, and the fact that we've had a long-lasting ""bull market"" since 2009. I know we are all expecting that inflation will cause crypto prices to increase -- but the market has a way of  performing opposite to what is broadly expected. Crypto is still a risk asset by and large.

2. Longer way to drop

Perhaps you saw the post in this sub on why to be bullish on crypto. One of the points in that post was that there is an influx of institutional investors. However, to me this is a reason to be fearful. Institutional investors are not true believers like you and me. They are profit-chasers, and are only getting into crypto because it was making money. If it begins to lose money, they will have no problem cutting and running and moving on to the next thing. That can be a HUGE amount of money leaving the system. Add to that the BTC being used as collateral for borrowing and any drop in price could lead to a cascade of margin calls, forced liquidations, and further selling and drops at a time when buyers are moving to more stable, safe-haven assets.

3. Market ""Top"" signals

The ""Great Resignation"" - people are quitting their jobs [because of life-changing gains from crypto](https://civicscience.com/crypto-is-creating-newfound-wealth-and-job-freedom-for-many-americans/). Massive pie-in-the-sky price predictions. And the quintessential market top indicator -- [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) buying the naming rights to the Staples Center.

solar,Impossibly Small and Cheap Chinese Battery? I'm skeptical,"Edit: Looks like these are all stuffed with 6 lousy 26650 batteries. Definitely a scam

And I am contributing to Teacher Rerirement: low projected retirement monthly allowance anticipated to be $1,854.28

And I have a check for $17,000 that I am rolling over from a Fidelity account (old job).


My Question:

I just learned that my company will not match my 403b because I am a ""Teacher"". I am considering putting the $17,000 into a Merril Lynch account to take advantage of their investing options.

And I am considering either halving or stopping contributions to the 403b to either put into Merril Lynch or save up for a house.

I'm really miffed they don't do a company match.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation?

Anyone have some input on if this is a horrible idea or not?

personalfinance,Maximizing net worth - 4 year financial plan help,"Looking to pick the collective brain of the masses to decide the ""best"" financial course of action to maximize net worth over the next 4-5 years. I am up for any suggestions (such as getting into stocks/crypto, etc) although I am not a financial guru.

I have been researching private refinancing of student loans (SLs) to 2.44% and then maximizing debt payments (avalanche method) over 4 years (I am aware that refinancing will lose federal benefits, my main concern is potential cancellation at some point in the near future). 

The refi + avalanche method would save \~$11k in interest. I am not concerned about the ""feel good"" aspect of being debt free, but I am partial to the ""financial freedom"" of having positive net worth and the potential to be able to retire early. 

Both of our jobs are in public health, so PSLF is an option, but we would need to drag these out for another \~8-9 years to qualify. Over the next 5 years, I'd estimate job security of \~80%. We are fairly frugal, but travel more than average and enjoy the occasional night out (which we budget for).

# Pertinent details

**Me:**

* Age 40
* Income: $136k/y, HSA match, 6% 403b match (3% of that is at 50%), currently at $75k
* SLs: $178k (100% federal, avg \~5% interest)

**Spouse:**

* Age 30
* Income: $155k/y, HSA match, 3.5% 403b match, currently at $60k
* SLs: $20k (100% federal, avg 5% interest)

   * Mortgage: 120k, 3.4%
   * Vehicle: 30k, 2.5%

CryptoCurrency,Largest crypto theft from individual ever: Police arrests the suspect,"In the town of Hamilton, Ontario in Canada, someone was arrested today who was allegedly involved in the theft of as much as $46 million CAD (36.5 million USD or 32.1 million EUR) in cryptocurrencies. This was reported by local police on November 18:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/elr1h4r4al081.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d11466f322caa0e34dbdef163465b82e1a000fd

Hamilton police launched a criminal investigation back in March 2020 along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Electronic Crimes Task Force (ECTF) of the United States Secret Service (USSS). The investigation focused on the theft of $36.5 million in crypto from a victim in the United States. The victim was the target of a so-called ""SIM swap"" attack.

&amp;#x200B;

SIM swapping is a form of identity theft where the victim's phone is taken over. Hackers gain access to data traffic by, for example, convincing the provider that they have supposedly lost their SIM card. The thieves can then access data needed in so-called two-factor authentications such as with cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. As much as $46 million CAD worth of crypto was stolen from the victim using the SIM swap attack. Police are not reporting exactly which crypto, such as bitcoin (BTC) or ethereum (ETH), were stolen, but are calling it the largest crypto theft ever from a single person.

&amp;#x200B;

Police tracked down the suspect when the investigation revealed that someone had used some of the stolen crypto to buy an online username. This is reportedly a rare username in the gaming community. The person from Hamilton was eventually arrested for the theft of $5,000 CAD worth of crypto. It is unclear what happened to the remaining $45,995 CAD million. It is also unclear if this person was directly involved in the theft or had purchased the stolen crypto. The case is now being arraigned.

&amp;#x200B;

Hamilton police also report that it made multiple seizures today for more than $7 million CAD worth of crypto. It is also unclear if these crypto are connected to the above case.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Jumbo Mortgage Cash Out Refi - Buying Points,"Hi,

Quick summary: We've just finished a construction loan and we are looking to do a cash out refinance. We aren't financial experts by any stretch, but for us it seems like a no brainer to buy as many points as possible. Please let me know if we are missing something. Also I recognize that our income and home value etc are high for what is usually discussed in this sub, but hope you will still give us some solid advice as we are a young family who happen to have really high paying jobs, and could use the input. Thank you :)


Household annual income: $490k 

Credit score: 713

Liquid assets and other reserves: $400k

Estimated current property value: $1.5m

Estimated loan amount: $1m, 30 year fixed

Current mortgage amount: $820k


**Edit to add: We plan to live here until we die, we are 33 ish years old so figure another 120 years ;) , we built our dream home and do not intend to move - know this is relevant for points discussion**

Cost per point: ~$10k - comes out of the 'cash out' part of the refinance

Principle/Interest as follows: 

0 points ($0) - 3.5%: $4,423

1 point  ($10k) - 3.11%: $4,153

2 points ($20k) - 2.75%: $4,021

3 points ($30k) - 2.5%: $3,891

3.93 points (max we are allowed to buy - $40k) - 2.375%: $3,828


The way I am looking at it, using 3 points as an example: Spending $30k now on the points saves us $532/month or $6,384 annually, which (again, the way I am looking at it...) is a guaranteed ROI of 21% - nothing else is going to give us that kind of return, and so this seems like a no brainer given that we can afford to buy the points. 


Even using the 3.93 points which has considerably less impact on the interest rate, the ROI still looks to be to me ~18% - again, isn't that a no brainer? 


But I feel like I must be missing something...Like we are borrowing $40k at 2.375% interest, to get the 18% return, but how is that not a great idea? 


Anyways, thank you again!",finance

personalfinance,Looking for feedback - getting my financial house in order [long],"Hi All, 

I've found this subreddit so helpful over the years, and am looking for feedback on some of my financial goals/planning and hope this can also be helpful to others to see a full breakdown of my financial situation and how I'm trying to improve it. 

**Financial Background**

I come from a household with two (divorced) financially irresponsible parents. My childhood included frequent visits to cash advance stores, repossessions, paying for school project materials in coins scrounged from around the house, and waking up to find my video games had been pawned to pay bills. As an adult, this is all the more frustrating because both of my parents were consistently employed and had good paying jobs. Our financial struggles were due to a lack of responsible budgeting, ignorance, and the inability or unwillingness to learn how to manage money. 

As you will see below, I am behind on where I 'should' be in terms of healthy financial metrics. I take ownership for my own financial position, but to others who may have come from similar backgrounds: it is so hard to know what you don't know, and to venture out as an adult and start making big financial decisions with no parental guidance. It is never too late to improve your position, and there is no shame in asking for help, even if it's something like this subreddit. 

**Basics + Budget**

I am a 34 year old single person living in a HCOL area in the US; I make $82,500/year pre-tax, and my credit score is in the low 800s. A rough budget breakdown is as follows: 

&amp;#x200B;

|Expense Name|Cost|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent|$800|Renting a room in a larger unit with one housemate|
|Utilities|\~$150|Internet, electric, trash/sewage/water, HOA|
|Car Payment|$330|2016 Honda purchased used \~2 years ago; $13,658 remaining, 5.3% interest rate|
|Gas|\~$85|Trying to keep this as low as possible; I work from home but live in a state with high gas prices|
|Car Insurance|$125|6-month premium paid in full every six months. Minor fender bender (my fault) 2 years ago on my record inflating this somewhat|
|Groceries|$225|Work hard to keep this low by shopping sales and meal prepping|
|Restaurants/Eating Out|$125|Nothing too fancy, when I need a break from cooking, also includes coffee/bubble tea etc when I'm on the go|
|Alcohol|$50|A few bottles of nice wine or a fun new pack of sour beer|
|Health/Fitness|$210|Includes gym/studio subscriptions, apps (meditation and yoga), and medicine/doctor copays|
|Entertainment|$12.99|Hulu; shared access on other streaming services|
|News|$27|NYT and Washington Post subs; access to other publications through work subscriptions|
|Personal Care|$150|Toiletries, makeup, personal care|
|Student Loans|$646|Paying down balances during the pandemic freeze, normally on an income based repayment plan. Total of $92,635 in Federal loans, varying interest rates|
|Savings|$468|Saving for a house downpayment|
|Debt Paydown|$250|Paying down $750 on a 0% interest credit card from a medical procedure|
|Discretionary|\~$200|Fun money|

**Debt**

As noted above, I have significant student loan debt (currently \~$92k in Federal loans, varying interest rates) from undergrad and graduate degrees. I am paying off \~$750 of credit card debt on a 0% interest rate card, and have about $13,500 I owe on an auto loan. 

**Savings**

I was able to build up my savings over the pandemic, part of which I spent living with family rent free. I have $10k in an emergency fund, and \~$7.1k saved for a house downpayment. 

**Pre-Tax Dollars**

I have \~$8k in a 403(b) retirement account. I pay in $600 month in contributions, and my company matches 3% of my salary. 

My PPO premiums amount to \~$90/month. As of next year, I will be contributing \~$80/month to an FSA. 

**Goals and Planning (feedback welcome!)** 

With all of that context out of the way, here's what I'm looking to do. Would love input on this or any of the above, if there are any non-obvious things I'm not thinking about to optimize my financial position. I am strict about budgeting and good about tracking where my money goes, so at this point it's about setting the course vs. the discipline of getting those habits ingrained.

1. **Saving for a house** \- I am working to having $10k saved by June of 2022. I don't have immediate plans to buy, but want to have the cash ready when I am. I would like to have $20k saved by June of 2023 and will reevaluate goals based on where I am in life and financially at that point. 
2. **Boosting retirement savings** \- I know I am behind here, and want to do as much as I can to set myself up for success here and have the retirement that neither of my parents were able to achieve. My goal is to have $12k in savings by June 2022 which I am on track to achieve, and $30k by June of 2023. I do have some questions about the best way to go about this - max out my 403(b), open an IRA (Roth vs. traditional), if anyone has any insight here. 
3. **Increase income** \- I have been working really hard over the last few years to establish myself in my chosen career, and am about to start applying for new jobs. I think I am well positioned to land a $100k plus salary in my next position, which is what I am aiming for. 
4. **Pay off student loan debt** \- I have been working for nonprofits since I obtained my graduate degree, so PSLF is potentially an option, but I want to make progress here to reduce my DTI ratio for when I am ready to buy a house (hopefully in the next few years) and to not have such a huge figure hanging over my head. I'm on an income based repayment plan, but want to refinance my highest interest loan ($15k at 7%) to help achieve this. By June 2022 I will have paid off \~$8k of my student loans. 
5. **Other** \- I would like to refinance my car, or potentially trade down (the market is so crazy right now car shopping feels super intimidating. I had a good credit score when I bought my car, and I think was taken advantage of in terms of my interest rate (currently 5.3%). I've shopped around and could get this down to \~2%. For anyone out there reading this, do your research and hold firm when negotiating with dealerships. It's hard to realize after the fact that you were taken advantage of. 

Thank you all for any advice or insight you can share, and happy to clarify any of this.",finance
personalfinance,Is it smart to buy or should we continue to rent?,"My husband and I have a combined income of $110k. We have about $130k saved up including our emergency fund and investments. Rent is going for $2,100 for a two bedroom in our area. The only debt we have is my student loans for about $30k.

The problem is my husband is on a visa and we are working on getting his green card. The interest rate we were quoted was about 6.75% since he is on a visa. Would it be smart to buy or should we just hold out and wait until he receives his green card which could take about 1-2yrs?",finance

CryptoCurrency,An Introduction to DeFi Part 2,"Welcome to part of my Intro to DeFI series. If you haven't read part 1 I would recommend taking a read, especially if you aren't familiar with the space at all. It can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qx637g/an_introduction_to_defi_part_1/)

&amp;#x200B;

In part 2 I am going to discuss the AAVE Dapp and talk about decentralized exchanges. Before we get started on that let's do a brief overview on wallets as a wallet will be necessary. There are two types of wallets out there: custodial and non-custodial.

**Custodial Wallets**

Custodial wallets are wallets where third parties keep and maintain control of your crypto for you. Think of centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. When you hold your crypto on these exchanges, your crypto lives in their wallet and you are trusting that the'll store your coins safely.

**Non-custodial Wallets**

Non-custodial wallets are wallets where you take full control and owneship of your crypto. You are responsible for storing your crypto safely and have full control over what you do with it. You'll need to be fully prepared to store your private keys safely as if you lose them, you'll lose access to your crypto. Many people believe in the ""not your keys, not your coins"" mantra and therefore will use non-custodial wallets to remain in control.

The most popular wallet for users is MetaMask. It's a simple web browser extension and they also have an app available for your phone. I'm going to assume you have a MetaMask wallet, but if you don't I would suggest setting one up, it's pretty simple and self explanatory.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright now that we have wallets out of the way let's dive in to some DeFi. Many people new to the Defi space are generally confused as to how they can access Dapps. Where do you go? Is it simply a website somewhere? The short answer is yes. Remember, Defi is just using financial services without the need for a central party like a bank. You may be wondering, well how decentralized can Defi really be since an DApp/protocol is being used. That's a very good question. The truth is that there currently doesn't exist any protocol that is TRULY decentralized. The best we have are Semi-decentralized Dapps which are generally non-custodial, are permissionless, have decentralized interest rate determinations, decentralized development/updates. The examples I provided in post 1 (AAVE, Compound, dYdX, etc) are semi decentralized opposed to completely centralized places like BlockFi, Nexo, or Celsius.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright let's dive into a Dapp. I have recently used AAVE for borrowing/lending which I personally believe is one of the biggest benefits of DeFi, so let's start there. Note: this isn't advice and I don't think people should over-leverage themselves although DYOR and do what you're comfortable with.

&amp;#x200B;

**AAVE**

Aave is a decentralized money market protocol that has been around for a while and has a very large amount of funds locked in it's smart contracts.

Aave has 8 key features that it makes available to users:

1. Lots of asset supported for lending/borrowing
2. Stable and variable interest rates on loans
3. Rate switching - able to switch between stable and variable rates (depending on assets)
4. Collateral swap - you may choose what you provide as collateral and are free to swap it to other assets
5. Repayment with collateral - you can pay your loan with collateral at any time
6. Flash loans - loan taken out with no collateral that must be paid in the same transaction
7. Flash liquidation - ability to utilize flash loans to borrow capital as part of a liquidation bond (allows for a liquidator to get a liquidation bonus without using their own capital)
8. Native credit delegation - borrowers can extend their credit lines to other who wish to borrow with higher collateral in exchange for a higher interest rate

As you can see there are a lot of things you can participate in on their Dapp. Depending on how you use the Dapp can expose you to a varying amount of risk. It's up to you how much risk you want to take on and what your risk tolerance is. 

The Aave market is built on Ethereum and as we know gas fees can get pretty extreme. Unfortunately, just about everything you do on their platform requires smart contract interaction, which means you have to pay gas. Luckily, they have added the ability to use a couple L2s. The polygon network and the Avalanche network are both layer 2 solutions you can use to lower fees substantially. I am personally using the Avalanche network on AAVE as the rewards are currently higher than polygon.

So how do you use it? Well it's as easy as going to their site, connecting your wallet and depositing some funds.  You can deposit a number of different coins and begin earning interest on it. Essentially when you deposit funds into their smart contract you are adding to the lending pool and people are borrowing your crypto and you get paid a part of the interest they have to pay back. At the time of this writing if you were to deposit USDC on the avalanche network you would earn 2.86% interest for simply keeping your funds tied up in their smart contract. There are also bonus rewards for using specific blockchains. For depositing on the Avalanche network you would also earn 4.78% interest on the amount of USDC deposited paid out in AVAX. Deposit funds on to the platform and earn interest and boom you have now participated in Defi! Honestly, not as exciting as it may seem when you hear about Defi but that's honestly as easy as it is. It's technically no different than staking your crypto somewhere. For instance, if you were to deposit into BlockFi you'd earn interest on your crypto, the only difference is that their platform is completely centralized.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: rewards are generally paid out in a wrapped from of whatever asset you are getting. On Avalanche you receive wAVAX (wrapped Avax) which essentially is the smart contract saying you are owed that amount in AVAX. the wrapped version of the asset is worth the same as the unwrapped version, and to get from the wrapped to unwrapped version you simply need to swap it on a Dex like TraderJoe.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people use this platform to yield farm. Yield farming is an investment strategy where people stake or lend crypto to generate returns. Recursive yield farming can get very risky, but can also lead to higher returns. Many people will stake, for example USDC, on AAVE and then take out a loan against that USDC also in USDC. Then they deposit that loan back into the platform and repeat the process. Say you deposit 5K USDC into Aave and then take out a 3k loan in USDC against it. You would then deposit that 3K bringing your total deposited USDC to 8K and now you're earning interest on the 8K deposited rather than initial 5. Some  people will even take their loans and move to other platforms where they can earn higher returns. Again, this can get very risky and it requires you to pay attention to your LTV ratio to ensure you don't get liquidated. Granted, with USDC it's a bit safer since there isn't market volatility, but if you begin to do it with other assets the risk goes through the roof.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is quick tutorial on how to get funds to Aave and stake them (and take a loan out if you so choose). Again this is educational and not me telling you to do this. DYOR and figure out what your risk tolerance is. Ill explain the process using the Avalanche network since there are better rewards currently. There are also other ways of accomplishing this, this is just how I did it.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Install Metamask
2. Add the Avalanche network to metamask. Here is a nifty [link](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-do-i-set-up-metamask-on-avalanche) from Avalanche that breaks down how to do it. Once you do this make sure you're on the Avalanche network on Metamask
3. Buy some AVAX on Coinbase (or whatever exchange you prefer)
4. Send the AVAX to metamask. Note: The avalanche network has like 3 different chains on it. It can get pretty confusing to use and if you do this a different method you may need to make an avalanche wallet and send your funds there to switch chains to then send to metamask. If you send from Coinbase like I did it's already on the ETH based chain which lets you send directly to Metamask on the Avalanche network. I'd also recommend sending a small amount first to make sure you did this correctly.
5. Go to [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home) (this is an example of a Dex) to swap some AVAX to USDC.e. You'll need to connect your wallet to their app to make the swap. Gas fees should be pretty negligible at this point since we aren't on L1. Also you'll probably need to approve your funds for swapping then you'll be able to swap.
   1. Alternatively, if you just wanna stake your AVAX no need to swap for USDC.e, you can continue on to the next step.
6. Go to [AAVE](https://app.aave.com/#/) and connect your wallet, make sure you click on the Avalanche version AAVE on their market page
7. Deposit the USDC.e and AVAX (leave a small amount in MM for transactions) If you just want to earn rewards stop here. If you want a loan continue to the next step.
8. Go to the borrow tab and select what currency you want to borrow. I borrowed USDC.e. There is a play you can do here which involves borrowing USDT.e. Lots of people fear that USDT could unpeg from the dollar and if this is the case and the price of USDT unpegged and dropped you'd only owe the USDT amount borrowed not the USD amount. For example if you borrowed 100 USDT.e and it unpegs and is now worth $0.50. You'd still owe 100 USDT.e but it's only be $50 in USD that you'd owe.
9. Do whatever you want with your new loan. Restake it for more rewards. Take it to another platform and stake for higher rewards. Literally whatever you want. 

When you do this you'll see two interest rates for each asset. The top interest rate (and this is true for deposits or borrows) is the interest rate you are paid in the asset you deposit (for deposits) or the interest you have to pay (for borrowing). There is then a second interest rate below that with an AVAX symbol, that is what you will be paid in AVAX for using the platform. You'll get paid AVAX for depositing and for borrowing. You can claim it whenever you like and you are always free to claim it and deposit it to continue growing your bag. AVAX deposits are currently paying 13.42% (1.72% for depositing and 11.74% as an extra reward for using the platform).

Most other Dapps work similarly to what I described above. Deposit and asset and get paid on the interest. Some other Dapps pay for providing liquidaty pairs (meaning you are putting in a combination of assets so people can swap between them, you get paid a piece for every swap that occurs). This can be very risky, and Ill briefly touch on it below.

Now that we have discussed a Dapp let's discuss briefly a Decentralized Exchange (Dex)

**Decentralized Exchanges (Dex)**

While centralized exchanges (coinbase, binance) have plenty of liquidity and allow large trades, there is still the inherit risk of users not holding the custody over their assets. DEXs use smart contracts and on-chain transactions to reduce and eliminate the need for an intermediary. 

The two types of DEXs are order book-based and liquidity pool-based.

Uniswap, dYdX, Curve Finance, and SushiSwap are all examples of DEXs available for use in the Defi space.

Order-book DEXs, like dYdX, work similarly to CEXs where users can set buy and sell orders (market or limit orders), but the main difference is that the assets for the trade remain in the users' wallets rather than on the exchanges' wallets.

Liquidity-pool DEXs, like Uniswap, let users essentially become market makers by providing a liquidity pair to a pool of assets. Liquidity providers earn a small fee for each swap performed int hat pool, generally proportional to how much liquidity that user provided. Think of how Coinbase takes a fee for transactions made on their platform, instead of Coinbase getting paid for facilitating the transaction, the liquidity providers get paid that fee, hence decentralized finance.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, DeFi isn't really as exciting and mystifying as it seems when you don't know much about it. In a sense, it's basically all the same things you would do normally in crypto with the exception that there is no centralized party you need to trust to make this happen. Instead, everything is handled by smart contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

The more you dive into DeFi the more complicated things you can do and the more exciting things can get. With that the risk also tends to climb higher. I am using this mini-series as a brief introduction into the Defi space so keep that in mind!

&amp;#x200B;

My next post will probably be my last and it will discuss some of the risks associated with DeFI and probably some pros/cons about the DeFi space. If there is anything else you'd like for me to expand on feel free to let me know!

investing,Is there any kind of black swan event that could crash the entire tech sector?,"Even if we don’t explicitly choose to be overweight tech, most of our 401k’s are heavily exposed to tech, considering that FANG, Apple &amp; Microsoft make up 25% of the S&amp;P 500.

The NASDAQ-100 has had a remarkable run since 2003, having had only 1 negative year (2008, -41%) on a total return basis and 2 (2018, -1%) on a nominal basis.

Everyone’s moving to the cloud, and there are plenty of exciting new technologies on the way (autonomous driving, virtual reality, internet of things, etc. etc.) 

The internet bubble popped in 2000 because it was being driven by a lot of lower quality companies. This time, FANG+ are generating massive profits and Facebook/Apple/Google are trading at 24 to 28 times earnings - high but not extravagant. And it took 6%+ interest rates to pop the bubble back then.

Many people, myself included, cannot conceivably think of a scenario or black swan event that could sink this industry &amp; produce steep losses like in 2000-2 &amp; 2008. But it‘s precisely times like this when it’s good to get defensive and hedge against downside risk ... yet in consideration of the above, hedging just feels like throwing money away.

What do you think? Are you hedging your tech exposure?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Guys finally it's here.The white paper of Jack's decentralized Bitcoin exchange: https://tbdex.io/whitepaper.pdf,"Introducing tbDEX

When the Bitcoin whitepaper was published over thirteen years ago, it laid out a vision for a world where individuals no longer need to rely on trusted third-parties to conduct business between willing participants in the economy. It changed everything. The idea, forged in math and game theory, created a universal ledger and new currency that is native to the internet, accessible to all, and secured by competitive market forces.

We believe that the economy should be inclusive. We need to build on-ramps to this future where everyone can access and participate in the economy.

In order to achieve this, the nature of financial institutions needs to evolve. We can either embrace this change — by investing in this future as a public good by rethinking our business models and ways to create value — or we can let this future happen to us.

As we create this future, we also have to be realistic about where we are today. The vast majority of people receive wages and pay for goods and services in fiat currency. They must pay taxes in fiat currency. So how do we unleash the potential of bitcoin and decentralized financial infrastructure, when most of us still live in a world of fiat? To do so, we need to build bridges between the fiat and cryptocurrency worlds. Through these connections, we will massively improve the accessibility and utility of crypto assets by reducing the overhead of moving in and out of these assets in order to perform daily economic transactions.

The tbDEX protocol aims to create ubiquitous and accessible on-ramps and off-ramps that allow the average individual to benefit from crypto innovation.

There are serious challenges to realizing this vision. Fiat rails are regulated, and no interface with either the traditional monetary system or “real world” can be completely trustless. We can’t atomically swap a crypto asset with a physical good or service. Nor can we atomically swap a crypto asset for fiat currency or real world assets that require social trust.

This means that such exchanges of value must necessarily be based on other means of governing social trust. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) provide part of the solution by enabling verifiable digital identities that facilitate trustworthy exchanges between counterparties. But the main benefits are lost if the DID method is not implemented in an open, permissionless, and censorship resistant manner.

We propose a solution that does not rely on a federation to control permission or access to the network; nor does it dictate the level of trust required between counterparties. There is no governance token. Instead, the tbDEX protocol allows participants to negotiate trust directly with each other — or mutually and voluntarily rely on trusted third-parties to vouch for the counterparty. Transaction costs are ultimately driven by risk. At maximum anonymity, transaction costs will necessarily be higher; at maximum disclosure, they should be lower. This approach to price discovery allows the marketplace to find the right balance.  

The tbDEX protocol also facilitates the secure exchange of the minimum necessary identity information acceptable to counterparties in order to satisfy requirements, be they legal, regulatory, or related to any other consideration of risk. The protocol itself neither collects nor records any personally identifiable information.

When we announced TBD to the world, we committed to being an open source, open development, and open roadmap business. Today, we make good on that promise by sharing the first draft of the tbDEX whitepaper with the world. We've published it in Github so the community can contribute. If you have feedback, ideas or concerns, please send us a pull request.

personalfinance,Applied for a home equity loan to invest the money… Should I do it?,"I bought a house at the end of September all cash for $85,000.

Now, I am considering whether I should get a 30 year home equity loan or not. A lower term isn’t really an option, I’m a sever and on paper I only make $15,000 a year roughly. 22 years old. 

I’ve got about $19,000 in cash currently. I have zero credit card debt, and own my car outright (a 14 Ford Expedition, 168,000 miles and was in a fender bender I took the cash for so probably worth $9k. 

Yearly taxes are $2700 on the house, home insurance is $750 a year, and my car insurance is $1300 a year. Works out to a total of $396 a month roughly. 

I have $10,653 in subsidized student loan debt and am going to have an additional $2653 next semester for $13,306 in student loan debt at 0% interest now, but the rate will be about 4.5% overall when I finish school and it is looking like I’ll need to do at least summer/fall of 2022 part time. The  loan servicer on my loans does offer a .25 percent discount with autopay, so the real rate once I take advantage of that would be about 4.25%. Student loans payments are done over a 15 year period for amounts between 10-20k so I would be paying $100.10 a month after autopay if I do not pay them off. Could possibly also in the future get these to a lower rate if I refinanced privately. 

Going to owe $4153 in the Spring for college as well, which I will pay cash for. 

I can get a home equity loan from KeyBank for a 4.39% interest rate with the only cost of the loan being a $295 origination charge. The APR is 4.427%. There is no prepayment penalty. KeyBank offers a .25% discount for having a checking and savings account open with them, so I already did that when I applied for this loan. Only had to put $10 in each account to open them and no fees, so not a big deal. With that in mind, the rate is then 4.177%. This puts me at a $332 a month payment for the home equity loan after the .25% discount.

In total, I’d be looking at payments of $332 for 30 years, and $100.10 for 15 years for a total of $432.10 as my highest monthly loan payment at any time. 

My plan is to take the $68,000 and immediately put it in mutual funds. I figure a 5-6% return should be realistic over 30 years.

With the student loans, once they start accruing interest I should be able to have the money saved up to put that amount in mutual funds too.

Then, I plan to just make monthly payments on both the loans out of my income until they are paid off. If an opportunity comes up to refinance at a lower rate in the future I would do it.

If I do decide to sell my home before 30 years, it shouldn’t be too big of a hit since there is no penalty for paying the home equity loan off early. 

Am I approaching this correctly? It’s not too risky to expect a 5+% return over 15 and 30 years respectively is it?",finance
personalfinance,Refinance or not?,"I owe almost $132,000 on my 30 year mortgage. It was originally $150,400 when I first took it out. I took the loan out 6 years ago. Would you refinance it from a 3.75% interest rate to 2.99% or does the cost of refinancing make it not worth it?",finance

The stock market traded mixed today, with the both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) slipping whiled the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed on the day, driven higher by a strong performance in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Market participants continue to digest mixed economic data, with retail sales surprising to the upside despite the fastest pace of inflation in roughly 30 years. Moreover, market participants are growing increasingly concerned about a wave of new COVID with new restrictions announced in Europe and cases in the US ticking back higher after two consecutive months of declines.

Notable Numbers Today

* SPY: -0.19%
* QQQ: +0.56%
* DIA: -0.76%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.91%
* Apple (AAPL): +1.70%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.14%
* Roblox (RBLX): +6.82%
* PayPal (PYPL): -3.44%
* Lucid Motors (LCID): 17.34%

Markets were unsettled after a slew of European countries announced new COVID-related restrictions as the winter holidays begin. The Austrian government announced a full lockdown starting Monday in response to surging COVID cases. The lockdown will include both those vaccinated and unvaccinated, it will last for 10 days minimum, but could be extended for 10 days further. 

Jim Reid, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, said “although all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the U.S. be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter? Recent history suggests the U.S. has a higher bar for economic restrictions related to covid but it also has a lower vaccination rate than their European peers.”

In particular, the price of oil sank by over 3%, reflecting jitters that lockdowns will curb energy demand. However, Goldman Sachs said “Just like with headlines on Wednesday, we estimate this move lower has far overshot the actual fundamental risk due to low trading volumes.

Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. 

Yesterday, the Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:

* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:** 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week 
* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week

**Highlights**

* The FDA approved boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE, BNTX) and Moderna (MRNA) COVID-19 vaccines for all adults in the US.
* Apple regained the mantle of most valuable company from Microsoft, with the company reaching a fresh all-time high today
* After a pop in the beginning of November, weed stocks continued their steep declines as nationwide legalization efforts in the US continue to falter. The largest fund tracking the pot industry, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) tumbled to its lowest price since last year and is down 60% from its high in February.
* As talked about yesterday, Apple (AAPL) is reportedly accelerating development on its fully autonomous Apple Car, set to debut in 2025. A Morgan Stanley analyst said the car would double revenues and market value.
* The Pentagon announced it has issued formal solicitations to Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Oracle (ORCL) for a multibillion-dollar cloud-computing contract to replace the JEDI procurement, which became mired in litigation between Microsoft and Amazon and objections from Congress.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 22nd, 2021.

# **Stocks may be entering an optimal period in the Thanksgiving holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/stocks-may-be-entering-an-optimal-period-in-the-thanksgiving-holiday-week.html)**
*****
&gt; If history is a guide, the market should do well in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was slightly higher in the past week, buoyed by positive economic reports, particularly the unexpectedly strong 1.7% jump in October’s retail sales. There are a number of economic reports in the week ahead. The most important release is Wednesday’s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the inflation measure most watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; “The last five trading days of November are traditionally positive, since 1950,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “There’s a two-thirds likelihood the market is up on the day before Thanksgiving and a 57% likelihood the day after Thanksgiving, and a 71% likelihood that it’s up on Monday.”
*****
&gt; This year that holiday rally could depend on whether Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continues in his role after his term expires in February. Biden has also interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is supported by progressive Democrats.
*****
&gt; Strategists expect market volatility around the appointment, particularly if it is Brainard. She is viewed as more dovish than Powell, meaning she may be slower to raise interest rates. Elevated levels of inflation have been a concern in the market, and the worry is Brainard would not be as aggressive fighting it with rate hikes if necessary.
*****
&gt; “Barring a change at the helm of the Fed, I think the market trajectory is going to continue to be higher, as we move toward 2022,” said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist with ClearBridge Investments. “Given that Brainard is even more dovish than Powell, I think markets would recover very quickly... the markets are unsure whether the new Fed chairman could command consensus within the FOMC to effectively deliver policy,” he added.
*****
&gt; Schulze said the economic momentum is improving, and he expects that fourth-quarter gross domestic product could be in the double digits after the disappointing 2% pace of the third quarter. The second reading for the third-quarter GDP is released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; In the past week, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index also showed solid, better-than-expected activity in the mid-Atlantic region. “It really confirms the view that despite supply side constraints, the recovery is on track after the Covid-related slowdown in Q3,” Schulze said. “I think the markets are going to price in better earnings as we move into fourth-quarter earnings and 2022.”
*****
&gt; But Stovall said the market may take a pause before it moves higher, and he expects a choppy period. The S&amp;P 500 gains on average 7.2% between its October low and the end of the year. But by early November, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 9% from its low, and was overbought, he said.
*****
&gt; Stovall also said the market could become concerned again about the spread of Covid in Europe and beyond. Due to a high rate of new cases, the government of Austria announced a three-week lockdown and a vaccine mandate.
*****
&gt; Stocks reacted negatively to the Austrian news Friday, though the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained. Stocks were mixed for the week, with the Dow down 1.4% and the Nasdaq up 1.2%, lifted by tech stock gains. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.3% for the week, ending at 4,697.
*****
&gt; “There is still upside potential. The worry about inflation and now Covid are reasons for the overbought condition to work itself through,” he said. Stovall added the market could move sideways to lower for awhile, but it should end the year higher. “But right now, there’s a bit of choppiness because of Covid, because of the Fed chair possibly being replaced the worry about inflation and now and a whole variety of things,” he said.
*****
&gt; For investors who watch the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, Wells Fargo bond strategists point out that long-term Treasury yields generally move lower on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving.
*****
&gt; “Our take is straightforward, and is essentially the same rationale as for moves around Labor Day: risk appetite is low on both the buy and sell sides,” they said. But later in the week, starting Wednesday, the yield tends to rise.

&gt; # Tech is Leading Again

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector has gained 27% in the past six months, outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 by more than 10%. But could its run of leadership just be getting started? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the sector just broke out to fresh relative highs for the first time since September 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.18.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; 14 months without a new relative high may not sound like a lot, but that actually represented the longest streak of underperformance for the tech sector since a more than 3-year run that ended in 2015. And while the sector’s breakout does not mean that it will automatically go on another run of multiyear outperformance, we do believe context is important and that investors should recognize that just because technology has had a strong run recently, over the past 14 months the sector has performed just in line with the broader market. We would also note that these are not all-time relative highs for the sector, as it still sits below its early-2000 peak.

&gt; “The theme of 2021 has been rotation, rotation, rotation,” said LPL Financial Technical Strategist Scott Brown. “But technology is the only sector to recently hit a 52-week relative high and we believe that sets up a favorable outlook heading into 2022.”

&gt; From a fundamental perspective, technology continues to be a key enabler of higher productivity and home to many of the fastest growing companies. Despite topping all sectors with 9% earnings growth in 2020, earnings growth this year is on track to exceed 30%.

&gt; So does this mean investors should be shifting all of their assets over to growth stocks again? We don’t necessarily think so, and continue to find opportunities in both growth and value styles. In our proprietary sector trend rankings, technology comes in at #2, trailing only energy and just ahead of financials, both of which sit firmly in the value style and have benefitted from the continued reopening and above trend economic growth. We believe quality growth and more cyclical value companies can both do well in the current environment and remain most negative on defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities that have traditionally underperformed during early-to-middle stages of the business cycle.

&gt; # Sentiment Back to Average

&gt; The past week has seen the S&amp;P 500 hover right below but not at record highs. The lack of new highs in price appears to have left individual investors apprehensive as bullish sentiment in the AAII survey pulled back 9.2 percentage points to 38.8%. That was the biggest one-week drop since a 16.5 percentage point decline in the week of September 16th, though back then, bullish sentiment sat much lower at 22.4%. At the current level, bullish sentiment is still within one percentage point of the historical average.

&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a sharp reversal lower, bearish sentiment rose modestly to 27.2%. That is the highest level since the end of October and that remains roughly 3 percentage points below the historical average.

&gt; Those inverse moves resulted in the bull-bear spread falling to 11.6. While lower, that still indicates overall sentiment favors optimists.

&gt; A greater share of the losses to bullish sentiment shifted to the neutral camp with around a third of respondents reporting as such. That is the highest level since the first week of October. That reading is a few percentage points above the historical average meaning that like bullish and bearish sentiment, current survey readings do not indicate sentiment is elevated or depressed to any sort of notable extent.

&gt; # 2021 Now Has The Second Most New Highs Ever

&gt; The incredible bull run of 2021 continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index only 0.02% away from the 66th all-time high this calendar year, tied with (for now) the 65 set in 1964 and behind only the record 77 set in 1995. “We’ve run out of superlatives to describe what we’ve seen so far this year, so we’ll keep it very simple. Years like this don’t happen very often, so let’s remember to enjoy it,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 66 new highs this year would be second only to 1995. With about six weeks to go this year, 2021 is on pace to just barely miss setting a new record of new highs, but they say you won’t hit the pitches you don’t swing at and 2021 still has a lot of swings left, so anything is possible.

&gt; As we noted at the start of the month, November has been the best month of the year for stocks and it has been quite strong yet again this year. But be aware that November is historically rather strong early and late, while the middle can be choppy. Suggesting new highs could be a little tough to come by in the near-term, at least until we all get our fill of Turkey next week.

&gt; Additionally, post-election years can get quite choppy from now until late in December. After the run we’ve had lately, maybe some sideways chop is necessary, but we see further gains ahead through year-end.

&gt; # Small and Mid Caps Gain Ground

&gt; Equities broadly have been in rally mode so far this quarter, but in the month of November smaller market caps have generally outperformed. Month to date, the small-cap S&amp;P 600 ETF (IJR) has gained 5.88% as of this morning while the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 ETF (IJH) has risen 4.21%. Large caps as proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY), meanwhile, are up less than 2% MTD. While there is plenty of time left in the month for things to change, the spread between the month-to-date performance of small and mid-caps versus large caps is on pace to be on the wider side of all months of the past twenty years. As shown in the charts below, IJR is currently outperforming SPY MTD by 4.05 percentage points, and that reading is 2.37 percentage points for IJH versus SPY. Those rank in the 91st and 86th percentiles, respectively, of all months of the past twenty years. That also marks the first month with significant outperformance of smaller market caps relative to large caps since the stretch of large-cap underperformance that ran from the fall of last year through this past February. Prior to that, you would have to go back to March 2018 to find the last time that small and mid-caps both outperformed large caps by as much as they are this month.

personalfinance,Is it a poor idea to take out a small loan at say 5% apr to buy additional stocks?,"&amp;#x200B;

So, my finances are a slight mess but not in a bad way? I owe about 3k in credit card debt. I make about 50K a year on my job but profited on the stock market about 29k last year, turning 25k invested into 54k. I think i am good at investing and mitigating risk with a combination of reliable companies and a healthy amount of higher return investing.

I recently did a discover balance transfer for a 0% transfer and a 5% apr. I moved all of my credit cards here so I can use my spare dollars and overtime to pay down that debt which I am confident I can do by Feb or maybe March.

I'm considering since the APR is only 5%, would it be a poor idea to take an extra 3k  from the transfer and use that to boost my portfolio from 54k to 57k invested? Its not like I don't have the capitol to pay it down in a year if I want to. The markets are growing at crazy rates that a 5% apr seems like a drop in the bucket. I am relatively confident that even conservatively invested in an index stock that 3k would be 4k in 12 months. Given the nature of the loan I think I would put the money into a safer index. Perhaps even a super safe one like VOO.

It exposes myself to a small amount of risk, but I have some long positions that I can sell in June or July to pay back the 6k loan with relative ease. I guess I am trying to decide if this is a reasonable risk to take given the low interest rate on the balance transfer.

Any thoughts on this?

EDIT.

Better yet I saw I could borrow 3k at a 0% apr for 12 months and I absolutely have the collateral to pay that off in 12 months. Very tempting.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Are we on the Event Horizon? The Black Hole of Mass Adoption,"I feel like the general consensus is that certain advertising campaigns raised by exchanges will continue the upward trajectory of the market , but to what end? Are they binance competitors at that level? Are we on the horizon of mass adoption and is this what it looks like? 

Economists are predicting a crash like 2008 due to American National Debt levels (See 100 FUD article posted daily in r/cc), but is the reality more positive. 

I'm geared in a positive way post covid, meaning I think banks will raise interest rates and I think defi could be a factor in their decision (consider mass adoption in my reasoning please). 

If mass adoption of crypto and defi markets occurs, banks will need to raise interest rates to compete. Why keep your savings in a bank earning 2% when you can get 8%-12% in a wallet or exchange. Obviously it's not an issue they (banks) feel impacts their business model currently, as crypto doesn't have the same customer base percentage that banks do. 

Tldr: Banks will be raising interest rates regardless over the next 5 years to recover from the mortgage pauses and loss of revenue through covid. Does mass adoption of crypto contribute to that and are we on the event horizon?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,When can I start house-hunting?,"My partner and I recently had a child and its becoming increasingly apparent that our current home is too small for the long-term. We own our current home but it is our first home and I don't understand what is the best way to buy and sell. I would prefer not to have a time constraint when choosing our next home (e.g. if our current home sold and we needed to leave within a certain amount of days) but I'm wondering if my current financial situation permits us to buy first and then sell our home later.

Monthly take-home: $12k (after 401k and HSA contributions)

maxing out Roth 401k (both of us work, so two accounts), maxing out HSA (one account), contributing $500/month to 529

Current home:

* purchase price $200k
* remaining mortgage $120k
* monthly pmt $1,000
* est sale value $235k

only debt outside mortgage is $22k in student loans (federal) 800+ credit scores for both adults

cash on hand: $30k

Target purchase price for new home: up to $650k (we are pre-approved for $800k even if we don't sell so its not the top of the budget from the lending standpoint)

Please let me know if there are any other details I left out

TLDR - I want to buy a house before selling, we also have low cash on hand but a relatively high income and low expenses otherwise

01.13.22 Update in case anyone cares - we ended up purchasing a house for 580k, 5% down, 3.173% interest and we still own our townhouse. I got a reimbursement of the CARES Act payments that I made on the student loan ($22k) to cover some of the downpayment and closing costs. The monthly payment will be $3,000 (no HOA). Planning to sell the townhouse in a few months after we are moved in and settled so that we can stage it properly. I will be using the proceeds from the sale of the townhouse to pay off the student loan around May.",finance

personalfinance,"Laid off on Tuesday, filed for unemployment today. How to handle health insurance. [PA/US]","Simply stated, I was laid off on Tuesday. My former employer offered a severance package agreement that guarantees they won't contest any unemployment claims, and the agreement was executed today. Thus, my initial Pennsylvania unemployment application was submitted today as well.

My employer-provided healthcare insurance runs through the end of the month, so I am attempting to enroll in a [pennie.com](https://pennie.com) plan with a start date of December 1. Due to the pandemic, those who receive unemployment in 2021 or 2022 are eligible for the maximum benefit amount on the healthcare exchanges. Unfortunately, *applying for unemployment* is not the same as *being approved for unemployment*. I'm expecting significant delays with getting my unemployment application approved due to the holidays, so I'm not sure how to proceed with my [pennie.com](https://pennie.com) application. I'm trying to conserve money due to potential unemployment delays, and paying $700 or so upfront for coverage does not seem appealing when I have to pay rent and other living expenses.

What should I do?

With everything stated, I've already gone through my monthly expenditures and have been canceling all unnecessary services. Opted in for Federal tax withholding on each claim as well :)",finance
personalfinance,"Citibank has stolen $48,000 fro me!","# Guys, I can't believe this is happening to me. I will start from the very beginning:

My dad passed away last April (2021). His life insurance policy paid him out $140,000. My mom was the beneficiary. My mom gave me $70,000, as a gift. I put $40,000 into the citibank savings account. I then added $8,000 from my personal checking with TCF. Then I added $5,000 from the same account. Well, when I added the $5,000 from TCF, that was the week they changed over to Huntington bank. So account numbers changed. The deposit was denied. Okay fine, no biggie. A few weeks later, they send me a letter in the mail saying that my account is being closed to due fraudulent activity with the mention of the $5,000 deposit that was denied. That was the only thing mentioned. My account has been blocked for about 10 days and I have no access to that money.

I have spent hours and hours on hold with citi bank, and transferred around with different people because nobody has any idea what they are talking about. They are literally reading from a script. Nobody could tell me why my account was flagged for ""fraudulent activity"".

I finally got to talk to someone today who gave me some information. He didn't tell me the reason it was being flagged, but he did tell me this.

THIS IS WHERE IT GETS CRAZY.

My money has been transferred to the federal government because it has been determined by the fraud department at Citibank that the money *is not mine.* My money isn't even with citibank anymore, it is with the federal government.

Nobody has contacted me to get more information, or proof that it is my money. Nobody has investigated. They just decided ""ope, that's not her money"". And gave it to the mother f\*cking government.

I spoke to my financial advisor and he told me to file a police report.

Any other advice?

EDIT: Citibank called me and informed me that my complaint to the CFPB was received with the proof that my money was actually my money and they overnighted me the check. Phew. Glad I didn’t have to go through the court systems with this one.",finance
CryptoCurrency,When are taking bank loans in cryptocurrency worth it? DISCLAIMER!!!: (Please don't take out loans for things you can't afford to do. This question is purely hypothetical and you should not take any advice from this post whatsoever),"Even though this is a whole new asset class, how is someone who uses their business credit or personal credit to buy something safe like a node or a rebase token which pays dividends back to you different than someone taking a loan to buy a house?

 I can see it being really stupid for someone to get a loan for a fork of Shiba Inu coin but why would it be bad for you to get a loan for some land in Decentraland where you can make passive income off people gambling their life savings away? I personally believe that Decentraland is not a good project for this but if a company can fix the problems that Decentraland hasn't solved, what stops you from buying a digital investment property? People get loans on really stupid things such as brand new cars known to have mechanical problems just to brag to others.

Even though you can use every excuse in the book about how cryptocurrency is a volatile asset, how better are you holding a fiat currency which is printed into oblivion by greedy governments while having monopolies of banks give you a 0.6% apy on a savings account? The whole point of getting a mortgage is to borrow Fiat currency at a fixed price so later down the line by the time the currency is worth 50% of what is was when you borrowed it, you will have a paid off asset that you can use to get more loans or to sell. 

I am not saying that you should be blindly bullish on the crypto market but if you truly believe that this market can save us from greatly devalued currency, why would you ever be afraid of a slight market crash? The federal reserve can't keep this charade up forever and now inflation is the highest it has ever been.",cryptocurrency
ethereum,ELI5 What's APR and APY in crypto farming??,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

 

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

What Are They Different?APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
and APY  
of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",cryptocurrency

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

What Are They Different?APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
and APY  
of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Denied tax credits; Health insurance premium up by $800. Need help pls.,"Hello,

I'm new here and need some help around tax credits and health insurance premiums.

I'm close to 70, widowed and live in WA. I have always been eligible for tax credits to help with health insurance premiums (I go thru wa health plan finder via an agent). I was notified that I don't qualify for tax credits starting next month, and my payments will be $800 higher, which i cant afford. My living or income situation has not changed between november and december this year. I was directed to an appeals process, but I think I need some legal help.

Any advice on what kind of lawyer/organization/website I need to contact? If someone has a reference, that would help too. I appreciate any assistance I can get. God bless. Thank you.

adding: My agent seems to think that they don't have access to my tax return to ascertain income eligibility since i filed an extension in 2020, but I can't verify that other than get confirmation that I have given them permission.

personalfinance,HSA contribution question,"I just started a new job, the medical plan started on Nov 15th which qualified for HSA. Employer contribute $750 a year. I have only 3 paychecks left for 2021, and I did not have HSA before.

-	based on the last month rule, I am qualified to contribute full 2021 amount of $3600, and my employer will only contribute 2/12 months, which is 750 *2 /12= $125 total for these three paychecks. Which means I can contribute the rest (3475) all at once from my paycheck? (Paycheck is roughly $7000 pretax)
-	if so, I will need to ask the payroll to set the deduction amount for, and only for, my next paycheck. 
-	I could make it simpler by just contribute from my bank account (after tax), and I can get the fed and state tax refunded next year, BUT NOT FICA, which is roughly 8%. So basically I will loss 8% of $3475. Is this right? (Don’t care about the employer part)
-	for next year’s contribution, I want to max it as soon as possible (have some medical expenses planned). Since employer will contribute $750 total over the 26 paychecks, I can actually ask payroll to deduct 3600-750=2850 in the first paycheck of 2022, and wait for the employer contribution to finish the rest. Is this right?
-	in case I mis-calculate it, and accidentally contribute over the limit (probably by not much, maybe $20), I will have to pay tax on those, since it’s not much to begin with, should I worry? Would it be less hassle by intentionally contribute slightly less to avoid?
-	in terms of investing, if the money is invested in mutual funds in HSA account, and I need to pay bills, do they automatically sell the fund for exactly the amount I charge? Or I have to do it manually sell it prior to using the HSA debit card?

CryptoCurrency,"I've been using defi for a year now. Here's my take on the Good, Bad, and Ugly of Defi","# The Good

No more &lt;1% interest rates, no more management fees, no more discrimination, no more paperwork, and no more long lines. And you can actually beat inflation with passive income and living off of interest. Bonus points because you can do so while being invested in crypto.

With Defi you can *Be Your Own Bank* and do most things that a financial institution would do without getting discriminated and without paying someone to give you access. In addition, because defi is open-sourced and collaborative, it works like Legos—dapps building on top of one another. This makes defi hyper-efficient unlike traditional finance, which is inherently closed in nature. 

# The Bad 

Banks exist for a reason. It's not easy to 'Be Your Own Bank'. It's not easy to set up all these accounts and manage multiple assets across a number of platforms. And—when I first used it—Defi wasn't very user-friendly at all. Here's what I had to do:

1.	Buy a stablecoin from a centralized exchange
2.	Trade the stablecoin for the gas token (ETH for Ethereum, MATIC for Polygon, etc.)
3.	Install a Web3 wallet (then for Metamask, you had to manually add the network details)
4.	Secure the private key
5.	Send token to Web3 wallet (did a test transaction first, as always!)
6.	Connect Web3 wallet to the dapps I was using
7.	Approve the tokens in the dapp
8.	Swap, deposit, and finally do defi things

It took me 2 hours to set up a Web3 wallet for the first time (takes me 5 mins now). On the early days, you didn't have on-ramps yet for networks like Polygon so the initial onboarding was expensive. I avoided most of the fees by going to BSC first and then bridging to Polygon, which involves extra steps like *buying BNB &gt; sending it to wallet &gt; setting up a bridge dapp &gt; sending BNB from BSC to Polygon &gt; approving the unwrapped BNB &gt; unwrapping the BNB &gt; swapping coins/tokens*

Another difficulty of being your own bank is that you're solely responsible for managing your assets now. So when crypto crashed in May, I had to manage my positions. I remember being quite frantic, moving all of my assets—spread around multiple dapps—and also rushing to funnel money in to manage my positions. 

Of course, I was never in any REAL danger, *per se.* I think I was ~20% away from paying liquidation fees at that time; but that was pretty much the floor amount of risk that I wanted to be in. Still, if I wasn't actively managing my positions, I would've been punished when the market continued to crash. If I wasn't online--for example, if I was out on vacation--then, quite frankly, I'd be royally f*cked.

# The Ugly

A study recently came out that ~50% Liquidity pool (LP) providers using Uniswap were at a net loss while participating in a LP compared to if they just held their assets. This is because of impermanent loss. I reckon, this would also translate to most of Defi at its current state.

Impermanent loss is a major issue in Defi and also one that newcomers will typically be encounter. And it’s hard to spot also because you aren’t always losing money. Sometimes, you would’ve just been better off putting your money elsewhere.

I realized this when I was using the SOL-RAY pool while on the Solana ecosystem. This was around July to October when Solana had its run up. LPs are actually great if the market isn’t pumping. I wish I knew this earlier because when Solana did pump, despite earning 70% APY on the LP fees, I was actually down $200 had I just held SOL, which did a 8x while RAY only did a 4x.

And the current state of Defi is undeniably unsustainable. The way most of it works is that protocols incentivize users with high rates but high rates are only possible with high inflation. High rates will cause high demand, because everyone wants a piece of the pie, and high demands inflates the price. At first, this makes it seem like a good opportunity (because price is rising while rates are high) but eventually, rates will decrease because there’s more users to distribute awards to. And when that happens, users leave. 

The people who benefit from these trends are the people who made it in early, while people left holding the bag get rekt. While I don’t see anything inherently wrong with this—I mean, technically early birds should get the most rewards since they’re the ones who took most of the risks—protocols and users who are late to the party are at the mercy of these nomadic farmers who come and go. Most protocols end up being in no-man’s land after a few months and users always have to be on the move.

Sticking to the theme of Defi user being farmers, Defi is currently at an era of nomadic pastoralism and needs to adopt sustainable agriculture practices. 


# Silver Lining

Defi is young and rapidly changing. Developers and users are aware of the problems and innovation is always seeking to find solutions. 

There’s a movement in the space referred to as Defi 2.0, which revamps the current model in a way that still makes Defi fair and decentralized, while also making protocols less reliant on users who come and go. 

It’s also getting easier to use and a bunch of protocols are being created to broaden the spectrum for those who prefer to have more security (of course, at the expense of trade offs in rewards). 

When in doubt, zoom out. And looking at the world of Defi as we know it today, It’s really only just been 2-3 years. Since then, the Defi ecosystem has grown to an estimated $250B + in total value locked. Imagine what it can accomplish in the next few years.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The market has left the rational stage at the end of 2020,"I often see posts and comments where newcomers and noobs were told to do their own research. People debating about the technical merit, pros and cons of different projects. comparing the tech in terms of ""matic active adresses are on a record high, price will follow"" or ""rollups like loopring or optimism will be the next big thing in ETH scaling"" or "" Solanas transaction speed actually outperforms other networks"".

In my opinion this is all completly pointless in the current stage of the market. The market has left the rational stage at the end of 2020. Actual tech, usecase or adoption does not longer matter in the current stage of the market. We are in the bubble area now and the complete market is fueled by hype and fomo. Actual fundamentals are pointless at this stage. 

This is the environment where all kinds of dogmoney and other scams starts to outperform actual projects. This is the environment where underdeveloped centralized sh\*tchains reach top 3 spots in terms of market cap. This is the environment where buying name rights of a stadiums and sponsorships pump the price of obsolete sh\*tcoins which are only meant to bind your liquidity at questionable places. This is the environment where computer generated .jpeg are sold for millions and barely used metaverses pump to the moon. I saw the same thing happening in 2017. Suddenly nobody even bothered about how bitconnect can offer these interest rates. This usually marks the final stage of the 4 year cycle.

As a result threads of the noobs are popping up, where they complain about the missed gains they would have had, if you guys here would not have advised them to sell this digital waste.

Therefore this is my advise to all newcomers. At this stage the market is purely based on hype and you are as capable of investing in this environment as any crypto veteran. At this point it is purely based on hype and has nothing to do with actual fundamentals. If you are a noob and new in the space, the projects you recently heard of are probably not worse to go for than the well thought and technically evaluated collection of some veteran. 

**TL;DR: The Market is in a completely irrational stage right now and fundamentals mean nothing for the foreseeable future. The chances of some newcomer to pic the next moonshot are the same as for a veteran or probably even better because its all just about hype right now.**",cryptocurrency

Soon after, I got a copy of my tax bill which says it was requested by PNC. I prepaid property taxes at closing and the title company who handled the closing made the payment of property taxes for this year.

However, PNC also made a duplicate tax payment even though I only had $700 in my escrow account and even though I informed them that the title company already paid it. This created a shortage in my account and I asked them to reverse the payment. 

I discovered a week later they they actually reversed this month’s mortgage. PNC and my bank blamed the other for it even though I made the first payment in October without any problems. 

After going back and forth between PNC and my bank, I finally got a representative with PNC who seemed to understand what was going on. In attempting to reverse the duplicate tax payment, the processing department misinterpreted the situation and reversed my mortgage payment. I have not been charged a late fee but he said they could waive it if I get charged. He said the mortgage payment was sent back yesterday and I should get it back within a few days.

I wrote a letter to PNC informing them of these errors. Under federal law, they must fix them within 30 days but may extend it an additional 15 days in some situations. What recourse do I have if it’s still not fixed on the 46th day?

We’ve saved about 9 months’ worth of emergency funds. We each have retirement matching contributions through our jobs (mine is a IRA and hers is a 401k).

We own our home that’s valued at $400,000 and there’s about $230,000 left on our mortgage with an interest rate of 3.99%. Monthly payments are about $1300. 

I have $90,000 in student debt with an interest rate of 6.125%. Our monthly payments are about $380. I work in public service but since I’m not working full-time, it would be a long time before the 10-year PSLF. 

We have about $8,000 on a car loan with interest rate of 7%. Our monthly payments are about $270.

We started contributing to a 529 plan for each of our kids. If we continue at the current rate we felt comfortable with, it will pay for 2 years of higher education tuition for both of them by the time they’re 18. Monthly contributions are about $300.

retirement,Seeking advice helping successful father transition to retirement,"Hey there,

After 6 or 7 years of letting my dad figure it out for himself, his stumbling into retirement has pretty officially face planted. His lifelong drinking habit got out of hand and he's now grudgingly in a rehabilitation facility.

In his career, he was a powerful, successful and widely admired leader. His list of unique achievements is as long as my arm and he dotes on those professional years in an unhealthy way that imo has prevented him from moving on with his life. Just my opinion, but I think he failed to accept and grieve the loss of that chapter in his life, choosing instead to drink when his new surroundings left him unfulfilled in the ways his brain was trained after years of professional excellence to experience fulfillment.

What I'm looking for is advice from either children of similar parents, or from men or women who retired more gracefully from similar career circumstances. He is very obviously a born leader with nothing to lead, whose closest interpersonal relationships over the past 50 years were admiring colleagues and subordinates. He attaches so much of his sense of self worth to being the admiration of his peers that he has locked himself into a long lasting depression. He's nearly impossible to talk to about this stuff because he compulsively sees himself as the smartest man in the room and doesn't easily submit to the perspectives of others over his own intuitions.

I've tried finding books on the psychology of this transition, but have so far found them to be the types of self-help books he would view as beneath his intellect, with covers more suited to an inspirational poster in a guidance counselor's office than to a peer reviewed journal (he's a PhD scientist) and I just know they would end up stuffed on a shelf in his study behind pictures of himself shaking the Prime Minister's hand or whatever.

Anything I get back from this would be appreciated. It's a bad situation and I fear his inability to engage with his own loss or personal shortcomings could very plausible destroy his marriage to my mother and/or send him to an early grave from alcohol abuse.

CryptoCurrency,Staking is overrated,"Ok, first things first, what do I see wrong about staking? Well, I think people misinterpret what staking really means, in PoS blockhain, staking is a method to help secure the network, but it isn't the same as earning interest on a stablecoin for example, but how is it different?

When you earn interest in a stablecoin the money you get isn't being created, unlike the FED, that money is coming from somewhere else as collateral on some place. When you're staking a PoS coin instead of ""earning"" so much, you are receiving reward of newly created coins, but the thing is, yes, you have more coins now, but the supply is also bigger, so each coin has less value due to supply and demand.

""Oh, but I still get more coins"". Sure, staking is good, it helps secure the network and also you get rewards, the thing is, staking is more about not losing money (due to fighting inflation) than actually making money.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I have a plan but don't know if there's a better way to do this.,"So context of the situation first I guess. I'm 26, married and live with my mother in-law and brother in-law. The wife and I moved across the country to GA to help her Mom, Grandma, and brother, and so my wife could be close with her family. Grandma owned the home, mom and brother live with grandma on her retirement. Mother in-law has not had a job in over 2 decades, brother in-law is 14. Sadly grandma passed in January of 2021 and I've been the only income for the house. 

Since then I've been paying my bills, the utility bills, there car payments, my BIL and MIL expenses, food clothes, ect. We had started a savings and had it to about 10K, but it's been wiped out.

The house is payed for, so no mortgage. They owe 4,000 to title max at 37% interest, I owe 2,000 at 15% interest for my work tools, and we got a new car for 20,000 at 14% interest before grandma passed.

I haven't been able to get approved for a personal loan because of lack of credit history which is in part why I got a newer car, and my bank does not offer any loans. 

So my plan is to get a mortgage on the home to consolidate all the monthly bills into one at a lower interest rate. Im thinking maybe 30,000 to 40,000, enough the get my heaviest debts payed and then some for savings. On paper it seems like a good move, monthly right now we pay roughly 1,300 on just those three alone and they are set to go as far as six years. With a mortgage it could be around 700 if I'm doing my math right. 

I'm just worried about if there might be a better way to do it or if there is anything I need to look out for. Thank you in advance!!

CryptoCurrency,Stake / not stake greatly depends on your personal Fed/ state tax situation or your country tax treatment if you outside USA,"Not sure what’s up with all the posts about stake / not stake but like everything in finance it’s very personal 

When you get staking / interest rewards from crypto you need to assess its FMV ( fair market value ) and recognize it as ordinary income in that amount and depending on your state and Fed taxes it can be very significant since there is no preferential treatment like dividends or funds in 401k /IRA



FMV then becomes your cost basis for long / short capital gains losses / gains 


Example from my understanding that can really bit you in USA :

I receive staking rewards of 1 coin worth 100$ in November 2021, I don’t sell coin till the end of 2021 and coin goes down to 50$ 


I file 2021 taxes and owe income tax to Fed and state on 100$ , let’s say 35$ 

I sell my coin in 2022 at 50$ with cost basis 100$ and can claim 50$ capital loss to offset my taxes when I file for 2022

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin Magazine- BTC as a the foundation for a new financial system,"by Pascal Hügli. Opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC, Inc. or Bitcoin Magazine.

[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-how-we-build-new-financial-system](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-how-we-build-new-financial-system)

Led by Ethereum, a new financial system based on blockchain technology is being built. As reality currently unveils, the foundation this new financial order is built on poses significant challenges. This is why a true new financial order built on Bitcoin is already underway.

Ethereum is commonly referred to as the pinnacle of decentralized finance (DeFi). With more and more blockchains such as Solana, Cardano or Avalanche racing to fame throughout this year, more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are starting to doubt whether Ethereum’s pole position as the number one DeFi chain is really beyond reach.

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons for the rise of these alternative blockchains are swiftly found: Ethereum has turned from a hyper-inclusive idea into a hyper-exclusive blockchain for the wealthy. Its network is severely clogged up, and insanely high transaction fees need to be paid to transact on Ethereum.

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem that keeps on plaguing Ethereum (and other smart contract platforms) are the various smart contract heists and hacks. Seemingly month after month, there is news about a DeFi protocol on Ethereum having been hacked due to a smart contract vulnerability. Interestingly enough, Bitcoin’s blockchain is usually critiqued for being too rudimentary in terms of its smart contract capability, but what Bitcoin lacks in expressiveness, Ethereum appears to have too much of. Ethereum’s smart contracts are notoriously complex – one could even argue that they are unnecessarily complicated because of their Turing-complete nature.

&amp;#x200B;

Consistently-high transaction fees congesting the blockchain, as well as continuous hacks that cost users millions, are among the chief challenges Ethereum faces. Within the Ethereum community, people are diligently working on solutions. Hotly anticipated is Ethereum 2.0. While the excitement and the hope for improvement remains, some still believe that even this total overhaul of the Ethereum network might not enable Ethereum to scale to the capacity a global and efficient DeFi ecosystem will need.

&amp;#x200B;

ETHEREUM HAS IT BACKWARDS.

Some would argue that Ethereum’s approach was flawed from the get-go as they have built the house first, only to recognize later that they also need to integrate a foundation. Back in 2014, Ethereum was launched as a world computer. As this world computer was developed, the demand for an infrastructure grew, giving rise to the massive appearance of Web3 applications in 2017. Again, three years later in 2020, DeFi got popularized as the need for payments persisted. With the significance of payments for financial applications growing, vocal exponents of the Ethereum community started recognizing the inevitable need for sound money.

&amp;#x200B;

Although most within the Ethereum community have denied that ether is money, or rather have stated that ether does not need to be money, the chickens are starting to come home to roost as the importance for a proper foundation, a sound money, resonates with more and more Ethereans. The question is though: With all the historical baggage and the path dependency Ethereum has maneuvered itself into by having it backwards, there remain big question marks about whether Ethereum will turn the corner or not.

&amp;#x200B;

BUILDING ON A PROPER FOUNDATION

So, are other blockchains like Solana, Cardano or Avalanche the better Ethereum after all? Not likely. When it comes to a foundational sound money, Bitcoin is unmatched. Compared to other blockchain assets, Bitcoin has had an immaculate conception.Also, Bitcoin has an elegantly simple monetary policy and an immutable supply freed from human discretion – something no other cryptocurrency asset can provide.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin's monetary policy is based on algorithmically-determined parameters and is thus perfectly predictable, rule-based and neither event- nor emotion-driven. By depoliticizing monetary policy and entrusting money creation to the market according to rule-based parameters, Bitcoin’s monetary asset behaves as neutrally as possible. Bitcoin is truly sound money since it provides the highest degree of stability, reliability and security.

&amp;#x200B;

Most crypto enthusiasts would probably object that while Bitcoin might be the soundest money, its technical capabilities do not allow for DeFi to be built on top of it. As a matter of fact though, nothing could be further from the truth. This may have seemed to be the case originally, as the Bitcoin approach was precisely to build out a real foundation first. Compared to Ethereum, Bitcoin has been doing it the other way around by building from the ground up.

&amp;#x200B;

A FULL-STACK MONETARY AND FINANCIAL ORDER

As we speak, Bitcoin is morphing into a multi-layered financial order of its own, especially now with the implementation of Taproot said to be allowing “a clear path to smart contracts” on the Bitcoin network. Similar to the traditional financial system, Bitcoin is also built in many different layers. Serving as a foundation is Bitcoin’s base-layer asset. It can be considered a new digital base money.

&amp;#x200B;

This base money, also referred to as on-chain BTC, is settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, which acts as the final settlement layer within Bitcoin’s multi-layered stack. The beautiful thing is that Bitcoin’s global settlement layer is operated by distributed actors.

&amp;#x200B;

This idea of distributed markets is exported to other layers as well. On top of this base layer, an infrastructure layer is emerging. This additional layer allows it to incorporate more sophisticated financial logic and consists of things like sidechains, second-layer protocols or alternative Layer 1 blockchains running in parallel to Bitcoin. The latter approach is pursued by Stacks as one of the latest examples. The most popular second-layer solution is Lightning.

&amp;#x200B;

On this second layer of Bitcoin, Ethereum-like functionalities can also be implemented. Offering this is the Bitcoin-based sidechain called Rootstock Smart Contracts (RSK). RSK’s blockchain works like Ethereum because of its Turing-completeness smart contract capability. Just like Ethereum, RSK has its own virtual machine (RVM), which allows for the execution of smart contracts. As a matter of fact, RSK allows for Ethereum dApps to borrow from Bitcoin’s security, which is why they are ultimately linked to bitcoin and not to ether. RSK’s native asset rBTC functions like a bitcoin surrogate backed by locked bitcoin, the base money held as collateral.

&amp;#x200B;

A BITCOIN-BASED FREE MARKET: ALLOWING FOR ALTERNATIVES

The alert reader might object at this point: While it might be a win to be tied to Bitcoin as the ultimate monetary asset and profit from its sound monetary qualities, RSK’s Turing-complete smart contract capabilities introduce the same complexity that ails Ethereum. So, is this any better? It might not be and only time will tell. With Bitcoin, this is not the end of the story. Bitcoin’s base layer allows for innovative alternatives to emerge on the infrastructure layers.

&amp;#x200B;

Another ambitious project attempting to broaden Bitcoin’s capabilities is Mintlayer. As a Bitcoin sidechain protocol, Mintlayer aims to bring financial applications to Bitcoin. Its self-described goals are to specifically eliminate Ethereum’s flaws. As such it also pursues a different approach than RSK. With Mintlayer, gas fees can be paid in any digital asset that is going to be tokenized on Mintlayer’s blockchain, giving users greater flexibility than known with Ethereum.

&amp;#x200B;

A decisive distinction is the fact that Mintlayer is non-Turing-complete. Still, the smart contract capability it plans to bring to Bitcoin should be just as diverse as that of Ethereum. After all, studies have shown that only 6.9% of smart contracts built on Ethereum’s virtual machine truly require functions of a Turing-complete language. It is also noted that the majority of Ethereum’s smart contracts can be coded to function the same way with a Turing-incomplete setup. This is how complexity can be avoided without losing expressiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

Mintlayer’s approach also plans on saving on transaction fees with features like transaction batching and signature aggregation. By combining Mintlayer’s infrastructure with the Lightning Network – another second layer protocol on Bitcoin’s infrastructure layer – transaction throughput should be increased. Mintlayer will implement Lightning Network, which also represents the solution for a real decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem to scale, thanks to the so-called “Lightning swaps.” Suppose two parties have a Lightning channel in Bitcoin mainchain and a Lightning channel in USDT on Mintlayer’s sidechain, then BTC and USDT can be exchanged with a DEX transaction without requiring any on-chain transaction. Not all users are expected to have Lightning channels though, but specialized entities (like liquidity pools) can act as intermediaries, exchanging with final users through on-chain atomic swaps, while having Lightning swaps with centralized exchanges (or other DEXs) so that all on-chain congestion between arbitrage bots that you currently see in Ethereum should be avoided.

&amp;#x200B;

BITCOIN REPRESENTS CHOICE

The innovation happening on Bitcoin has only just started. By being the base layer for various infrastructure projects one layer up its stack, Bitcoin serves as a free marketplace for anyone to join and build distributed markets that complement and compete with one another. Through having these different options, the market can decide which one to choose.

&amp;#x200B;

Financial operating systems like Sovryn that represent Bitcoin’s third layer will have the choice to choose whatever infrastructure layer they consider best to launch their financial applications on. These financial dApps on Bitcoin will then represent the fourth layer. Wallets making it possible for users to interact with these dApps will make up Layer 5.

&amp;#x200B;

With more and more solutions emerging on all the different layers, Bitcoin’s multi-layered financial order becomes ever more tangible. There’s a lot of reason to suspect that because this financial order is built on a perfectly-designed base money and from there is gradually morphing out into the different layers, it will persist and in the long term triumph over all the other solutions currently out there.

Now I am three years into the loan and still owe around $8800. I got one of those ""we desperately want to buy your car!""

So my question is, does anyone know if, if the loan ends up being more than what the dealership is willing to pay me, do I have to come up with the rest of the money for the loan right then and there?

stocks,130/30 long-short strategy - what are your experiences and short sale recommendations?,"Although market might seem inflated and ripe for a pull-back, in fact many bears are calling for a crash for quite a time, I believe due to FED's pandemic-response monetary policy there's a ton of liquidity and excess reserves and with interest rates this low, stocks have no alternative. That being said I think that the market at the moment is reasonably stable and I doubt there will be a huge pull-back or a crash in a foreseeable future, however small corrections of 5-10% might be possible along the way.

I'd like to reduce my exposure to this small corrections by having positions that could be closed for a profit in downturn and proceeds to be used to double down on the long-conviction ones. I'm aware that the short selling can be very risky with possible unlimited losses, therefore I have no intentions of entering a naked position, rather having a long-dated OTM call together with a short position against which I'd sell weekly puts. I've been doing this with NKLA for the last month with positive results.

From what little I understand this seems to tick all the boxes to edge Australia into a stagnant economy,  decades of low rates but zero growth, money under mattresses and a sludgy retail sector,  a booming tourism industry to keep us going as long as it doesn’t all catch on fire/flood/bleach/pandemic again.

investing,Is the inflation trend in the US really that scary?,"The October inflation in the US was 6.2% on an annual basis, which is super high given the recent history of sub-3% rates.

That said, I come from a place where people were high-fiving when they get anywhere 6% inflation. Double digits were the norm back there. When I was a kid we lived under hyperinflation which is a complete shit show, people get their paychecks and immediately go buy their groceries for the month. This is not a figure of speech, they really did go IMMEDIATLY because the prices were readjusted 1 or 2 times IN THE SAME DAY. Concept of savings was non-existent. Either you buy as much US Dollars as possible or put in some asset that has intrinsic value like real estate. The house I grew up was huge, and I learned that was not because my father was in a good financial situation, but rather it was the only option to dump all his savings before it lose half of its value in matter of weeks.

Long story short, my bar is a bit out of place here... so should I be concerned with the 6.2% rate? My take on this: likely FED will increase rates, which will devalue bonds and stock prices. But then this should be already embedded in the current asset prices, so I don't think I should be doing anything with my portfolio here.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off student loans now or making regular payments?,"This sub has been really helpful to me when I've posted before, so I was wondering if anyone has any input on something I've been thinking about recently. I have the following student loans (all federal) about to convert to repayment:

* \~$5,500 at \~5.1%
* \~$5,500 at \~4.5%
* \~$4,500 at \~3.8%

I have about $20,000 in cash, a job paying $95,000/year, and have low enough monthly expenses that I would be okay with having just the remaining \~$4,500 in cash as an emergency fund if paying it all off up front is the best option, particularly because my checks will start coming in at the end of this month, so by the time I actually make the payments I'd have more than $4,500 left over. I'm currently leaning towards just paying them off, except:

* I've read on here that you'd be better off making monthly payments and investing the rest if the interest rate is less than 4-5%, so it might make sense to pay off the 5.1% and maybe the 4.5% loans and just make payments on the cheapest one, investing the remaining cash. I-bonds currently seem like a pretty good way to beat the interest rate of at least the third loan, even if I just keep them for a year and pay off the loans afterwards.
* I've also read on here that paying off installment loans can negatively impact your credit score. My FICO score (according to my credit card company's monthly report) is about 740 and I can't seem to get it any higher. The only negative thing that my report notes is length of credit is low (5 years). I've never missed a payment, I don't max out my cards, and I don't apply to credit very often (I have a credit card, a store card, and these student loans). I'd like my score to go up, of course, but I have no plans to take out new installments loans after these so I'm worried that paying them off will negatively impact me.
* I've heard talk of widespread student loan forgiveness, which would be nice to take advantage of if possible. I haven't seen any indication of it happening anytime soon, but I would feel like I fool if I paid it all off only for widespread forgiveness to happen a few months down the line. 

Again, I'm leaning towards just paying it all off, but I'd like to hear anyone else's opinion on it. I'm mostly curious about the second bullet point above because I don't want my credit score to take a dive but I'm not really sure how much of an effect this would have. The potential for loan forgiveness and the potential to beat the interest rate through investment alone aren't really enough for me to hold off on paying because forgiveness seems unlikely and even if I could profit via investments, the returns on such a small amount don't seem too important. However, if I could beat the interest rate with bonds (or another investment option), keep the door open for the possibility of loan forgiveness, *and* improve/maintain my credit score by just making regular payments, I guess it could be worth it?

While I'm here, I also have a secondary question about these loans. My loan provider's website states that my payments begin March 2nd, 2022 but they will convert to repayment status on December 11th, 2021. Will interest start accruing on December 11th? If I'm going to pay them off now, I'd like to do it before they start charging interest.

personalfinance,Buying a House at 23 with 70k of student loans,"Wouldnt mind some other peoples opinions on this:

Just graduated college, got a nice job in my field paying 60k a year salary, I have 70k in student loans but only a 3.4% interest rate on them with a minimum payment of 550 a month. 

I was looking into getting a house closer to my job instead of getting an apartment, as its cheaper than renting and id be building equity in the house instead of throwing my money away. 

I was looking at houses 150k and lower and was going to do an FHA loan with around 10k down. 

Is this a good idea to get a house with all this student loan debt or will I be putting myself in financial ruin?

personalfinance,Mortgage - Lower interest rate ads,"Hi /r/personalfinance

I purchased my first home just over a year ago. Recently I have been receiving a ton of advertisements in the mail from several different companies advertising lower mortgage rates. These advertised rates are significantly lower (1% average). Based on the information in the ads, my monthly payment would be a lot lower. That's great to free up cash flow but a lower interest rate will also save me a ton in the long run.

Again, I am a first time home buyer. My question is - are these worth pursuing at all? What are the catches? Will I have to pay closing costs again? Am I better off sticking with my current interest rate at my current lender?",finance

personalfinance,Credit Card Payment Situation,"hello financial wizards,

First off, id like to state that i am not in any debt or anything. I have enough money to pay my balance.

Here's my situation.

I got quite fed up with my BoA travel rewards card after using it for about 5 years. So i have a bit of travel points to redeem. About like $150 worth AND I accidentally overpayed my bill this one time so its at a positive balance of about $90. so total about $240 worth of money on that card.

As I got fed up with BoA travel rewards card, I decided to open a new credit card line. Chase sapphire preferred. I'd like to start using it as soon as possible to get the introductory bonus points. 60,000 points after I spend $4000 in the first 3 months of opening. 

Looks like my very first expense would be buying a plane ticket going back home for the holidays. Which seems like itll cost about $480. 

Here's my question: If I purchase the plane ticket through chase with that credit card, how would I go about paying part of that plane ticket with the $240 from my BoA? I've done some VERY basic research which resulted in a basic answer of: NO i cannot pay off a credit card with another credit card hence why im asking. 

Any tips are appreciated! Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,I bond questions,"With the I bonds at now a 7.42% interest rates they are starting to look really good to dump some money into while waiting for my Credit Report to clear out some of the old hard hits and prepare for a new set of churning.

However  i need to be sure im getting the i bonds right.

\- The interest rate is only guaranteed for 6 months or the end of this buy period (until april 2022) ?

\- If i sell them again at shorter than 5 years form now i loose 3 months of interest rate ?

\- They cant loose face value ?

# Technical:

***How to read the table:***

* The rank represents the times the crypto was mentioned in this sub.
* The values on bearish and bullish columns are the ratio of bullish or bearish comments to how many times the coin was mentioned.
* Reliability index  is percentage of strongest sentiment (except neutral) with respect to all sentiments in the comments and averaged over all the comments. It can also be seen as average sentiment distribution (per comment) for the coin.
* Change 7D (%) is the percentage change in the price of the cryptocurrency in last 7 days.

***Methodology:***

*For Sentiment Analysis:*

* Data collection for sentiments (comments) are performed everyday at 12PM UTC -8:00.
* The comments with less than 6 words are not included in the analysis anymore as many research papers argue them to be low quality sentiments.
* Another filter that is applied that a post or comment should at least have 2 or more upvotes to be included in analysis for this table.
* For this analysis, only one mention of a coin/token per user is considered.
* The sentiment analysis is performed using lexicon model and natural language processing ([nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) module for python).
* Emojis are also considered in sentiment analysis and are demojizied using [Python emoji library](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/).

***For WordCloud and n-gram:***

* A word cloud (aka a tag cloud) is **a visual representation of words** in a picture format. These representations are used to highlight popular words based on frequency and relevance.
* An N-gram means a sequence of N words. For example, for 1-gram or unigram, we consider the frequently occurring single words, for 2-gram or bigram, a sequence of two words and similarly a 3-gram or trigram a sequence of 3 words. They are basically a set of co-occurring words within a given text or in this case, this subreddit.
* For the wordcloud and n-gram analysis, all the comments (without any filters) are collected and popular stop words are removed using ([nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) module for python).
* N-gram analysis is performed using  WordNetLemmatizer from nltk module for python.

btc,Summarized Bitcoin News from Last Week,"Hey everyone, back again with 8 interesting Bitcoin-related headlines from last week. I've summarized the articles but also provided sources below in case you're interested in reading the full article.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitrefill Expands its Scope of Services in Salvadore**: Bitrefill, a company that sells Bitcoin-funded prepaid cards for various services globally, has introduced a new bill payment service that enables Salvadorans to use Bitcoin to pay for a variety of essential requirements. Bitcoin has been legal tender in El Salvador since September 7. Still, many establishments are yet to use it as a payment mechanism. Hence, Salvadorians can use Bitcoin to pay for 150 various services, including internet, water, insurance, loans, taxes, mortgage, social security, and university expenditures. Bitrefill’s mission is to provide companies with a solution to effortlessly transition to Bitcoin and alleviate their present concerns.

**Fidelity Will Launch Canada’s First Bitcoin Custodian**: On Wednesday, Canada’s Investment Industry Regulatory Organization granted Fidelity Clearing Canada a license to start a Bitcoin trading and custody platform. It is targeted at institutional investors, including pension funds, portfolio managers, and mutual funds. It would be the country’s first of its sort. Additionally, the business intends to appeal to regular investors via its recently published regulatory registration for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund and mutual fund. Fidelity has about $4.2 trillion in assets under management globally as of September. Additionally, exchange-traded cryptocurrency products are gaining popularity, with over 40 pending approval in the United States alone.

**PrimeBlock Plans $1.5B SPAC Merger to Become Public**: Prime Blockchain, also known as PrimeBlock Bitcoin mining enterprise, is considering combining with special purpose acquisition company 10X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp II to go public in the United States. The SPAC wants to raise more than $150 million via a so-called private investment in public equity, or PIPE, to finance the acquisition, bringing PrimeBlock public and valuing the amalgamated corporation at roughly $1.5 billion. Following the news, shares of 10X Capital venture surged 11 percent in early pre-market trading in New York on Thursday, November 18.

**Bitcoin Went Through a Major Upgrade Since Last Four Years**: Bitcoin has completed the most significant network update in the last four years. The improvement, dubbed Taproot, is intended to simplify transaction processing and make it more effective in speed and cost. Taproot upgrades several signatures and transactions at the same time. On the Bitcoin network, digital signatures are needed to validate transactions. They are produced and verified against public keys using private keys. Before the installation of Taproot, transaction verification on the Bitcoin network was sluggish because each digital signature was confirmed against a public key. This strategy increased the time necessary to complete complicated multi-signature transactions requiring several inputs and signatures.

**Bitcoin Miner Marathon Digital Plans Fundraising for Bitcoin Acquisition**: Marathon Digital Holdings, a publicly listed bitcoin miner with a market capitalization of $5.5 billion, is launching a $650 million senior convertible note issuance due in 2026. Due to high demand, the offering was rapidly raised from $500 million to $1 billion. Marathon plans to utilize the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate objectives, which may include the purchase of bitcoin or bitcoin mining equipment, the business said. The notes bear an annual interest rate of 1% and provide an opportunity to raise an additional $97 million from authorized investors. Due to their bitcoin holdings, this offering may be more akin to a collateralized loan from the stock market, which would explain the demand for it and the comparatively low interest rate since the market seems to believe it is a pretty safe investment.

**Bitcoin Mining Raises Power Concerns in the US**: Texas, already home to the US’s most fragile power infrastructure, is set to see a spike in electrical demand twice the size of Austin. Following China’s May ban on Bitcoin mining, the US became the world’s largest Bitcoin mining center, particularly in places like Texas. However, what was first seen as a tremendous opportunity for the city seems to be devolving into a problem. Texas is highly popular among cryptocurrency miners due to its business-friendly policies and low power costs. The bulk of large crypto mining cooperatives are expanding their current capacity with additional mining rigs. This has raised serious concerns about the electric grid’s ability to sustain the tremendous strain.

**US City Gets a Bitcoin ATM at Airport**: Williston, North Dakota, announced a partnership with cryptocurrency ATM provider Coin Cloud on Wednesday to deploy cryptocurrency ATMs at its international airport. Moreover, Williston also accepts cryptocurrency for utility bill payments. The city underlined that it does not operate as the fund’s custodian or oversee any cryptocurrency transactions, underlining that Coin Cloud handles all purchases and withdrawals. The official stated that the City of Williston’s next move would be to install a crypto ATM in City Hall in response to increased demand at the airport. “As part of our strategy, we want to ultimately extend these payment pathways to licenses, permits, and other local payments,” he said.

**China Warns State-Owned Companies to Cease Bitcoin Operations**: China’s state-owned firms have been warned to halt cryptocurrency mining. Additionally, China warned that it would hike power bills for businesses that continued to disregard the rule. China’s government declared all cryptocurrency trading illegal some months ago. Following that, cryptocurrency miners and exchanges such as Huobi and Binance started relocating to nations with crypto-friendly policies. Additionally, Beijing officials have begun monitoring residents’ IP addresses to detect crypto mining activity. Additionally, officials in Zhejiang province are investigating government personnel suspected of unlawful Bitcoin mining.

This has raised serious concerns about the electric grid’s ability to sustain the tremendous strain.

**US City Gets a Bitcoin ATM at Airport**: Williston, North Dakota, announced a partnership with cryptocurrency ATM provider Coin Cloud on Wednesday to deploy cryptocurrency ATMs at its international airport. Moreover, Williston also accepts cryptocurrency for utility bill payments. The city underlined that it does not operate as the fund’s custodian or oversee any cryptocurrency transactions, underlining that Coin Cloud handles all purchases and withdrawals. The official stated that the City of Williston’s next move would be to install a crypto ATM in City Hall in response to increased demand at the airport. “As part of our strategy, we want to ultimately extend these payment pathways to licenses, permits, and other local payments,” he said.

**China Warns State-Owned Companies to Cease Bitcoin Operations**: China’s state-owned firms have been warned to halt cryptocurrency mining. Additionally, China warned that it would hike power bills for businesses that continued to disregard the rule. China’s government declared all cryptocurrency trading illegal some months ago. Following that, cryptocurrency miners and exchanges such as Huobi and Binance started relocating to nations with crypto-friendly policies. Additionally, Beijing officials have begun monitoring residents’ IP addresses to detect crypto mining activity. Additionally, officials in Zhejiang province are investigating government personnel suspected of unlawful Bitcoin mining.

CryptoCurrency,The true effect of Staking rewards explained,"There's quite a bit of misconception about what staking actually does to a cryptoasset. Apparently, nearly everyone here thinks it's free compounding interest (See top comments in [1](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qy4hzw/is_staking_really_worth_it/) and [2](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qy7qjh/yes_staking_is_really_worth_it/)). While it is true that staking is better not staking, it is very misleading to assume that a staker's Purchasing Power will increase equally to the advertised APY.

**TL;DR: Staking is actually a form of supply redistribution from non-stakers to stakers. Without any external factors, the total value of a network remains constant. Anyone who doesn't stake will generally lose Purchasing Power (PP) while anyone who does stake will generally gain PP, but at a lower rate than the advertised APY. The higher the percentage of coins staked, the lower the true interest rate received by stakers. Nearly all staking rewards are paid out from either:**

* 1) Monetary inflation (aka supply inflation)
* 2) A pre-mined rewards pool.

In additional, staking rewards are also paid for the risk of securing the network. Some networks like Ethereum slash rewards for stakers who make mistakes when validating while others like Cardano pay less rewards for mistakes and unavailability.

Also, staking should not to be confused with earning rewards from lending out cryptoassets on platforms like BlockFi and Gemini, which are rewards paid for the risk of lending. There is currently so much price-volatility for cryptoassets that it basically masks the inflationary effect of staking. No one's going to notice a 5% yearly change when a cryptoasset changes that much in price weekly.

(Nearly all decentralized cryptoassets with staking rewards behave this way. There are a few centralized exceptions, one of which is Celsius Network's token. Because Celsius is a centralized authority and collects revenue through lending, they are able to buy back directly from the market supply for their token.)

-----

**Let's looks at an example:**

Assume that there exists a theoretical stablecoin tied to the price of an Apple. The overall total Purchasing Power (PP) of the whole network does not change. We can use an algorithmically-determined stablecoin with a rebasing model like Ampleforth. Due to the rebasing model, the total supply of coins changes dynamically so that the total value of all coins remains constant. (For simplicity, we will also assume perfect network efficiency and zero infrastructure cost.)

**Anyone who doesn't stake will lose Purchasing Power (PP) in Apples while anyone who does stake will gain PP, but at a lower rate than the advertised APY. The true APY stakers earn is inversely proportional to the total fraction of coins staked.**

In this example, everyone starts with 100 coins equal to 100 Apples, staking is at 10% APY, and the fraction of the total cryptoassets that are staked is **y**.

|Initial Apples|APY|Fraction staked|Final Apples for stakers|Final Apples for non-stakers|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|P Coins|x|y|P * (1+x) / [y * (1+x) + (1-y)]|P * / [y * (1+x) + (1-y)]|
|100|10%|0%|-|100|
|100|10%|25%|107|98|
|100|10%|50%|105|95|
|100|10%|75%|102|93|
|100|10%|100%|100|-​|

* If 50% of the coins are staked, after 1 year, stakers will have ~105 Apples of PP while non-stakers will have ~95 Apples of PP.
* If everyone stakes, everyone will end up with exactly 100 Apples of value.
* If no one stakes, everyone will end up with exactly 100 Apples of value.",cryptocurrency

Thoughts ?

TL;DR

This is not, by and large, a pandemic-related supply problem: as we’ll show, supply of almost everything is at all-time highs. Rather, this is mostly an Monetary Policy 3-driven upward demand shock.

The Monetary Policy 3 response we saw in response to the pandemic more than made up for the incomes lost to widespread shutdowns without making up for the supply that those incomes had been producing.

personalfinance,How to tackle student loan debt?,"Hello, using a throw away account. This thread has been really helpful for me and I wanted to thank everyone. I'm hoping to get advice for my situation. I currently have $415,000 in student loans mostly related to dental school. It's all in federal loans paying 5.8-7.3% interest. I was paying \~$2800/month using income based repayment with $2200 of it going to interest payments. The pandemic relief has allowed me to put a pause on things and not accrue interest, but that's coming to an end in March. I currently rent an apartment for $2200/month. Due to family issues, I've been supporting my family and have a mortgage on my parents house (\~$200,000 left with about $500,000 in equity). I make about $225,000/year and have $250,000 saved up (my intention was to buy a house to get out of the rental market, but I'm leaning towards managing my student debt rather than getting a home, not sure if that's smart). I feel like I'm am just wasting money with the student loans (and rent) and am trying to figure out the best way to address it:  


1) Continue with federal loans and existing repayment. Pay down some of it with the money I have been saving so as to reduce the interest burden and repayment period.  
2) Refinance the loans through a third party service at 3.11%

3) Refinance or get a HELOC on the home and roll my student loan debt into the house (30yr at 3.2%; 15yr 2.6). Wasn't certain if having the debt be structured under a mortgage amortization is the best idea, but the rate is lower. Any thoughts here?

4) Continued with income based repayment until I hit 20 years (I have 14 years left).  


I'm open to other options, those were just some that I came up with. I also feel like like federal loans are ""safer"" than dealing with a private company, but that's just my feeling not something based on fact.  


Anyways. Appreciate everyone's input.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Decentralization of Cryptocurrency,"So I see so many posts here talking about decentralization, and I wanted to get some thoughts and discussion out there about that. I think there are really two types of decentralization that people discuss that frequently get muddled together: decentralization of mechanism (what much crypto is coded for) and decentralization of unit of account (which almost no crypto is designed for, yet many seem to want).


Crypto can’t change the nature of resource accumulation. Those with the best education, understanding of systems, delayed gratification and most capital tend to have more capital flow to them. A lot of crypto is designed to decentralize the recording mechanism, whatever blockchain is being used.

When people talk of decentralization here, they often as not, mean decentralization of unit of account. How would that ever happen in crypto without people programming for it? You’d need a functionality much like negative interest rates to encourage frequent transactions. Some of the meme coins have tried to create decentralization of unit of account by frequent inflation and no supply caps, but I don’t think that alone undoes coin concentration. Founders’ coins certainly don’t help. Most crypto networks currently can’t even handle the number of micro transactions that would come about from true decentralization of the coins on a network.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Planning for chronic illness with unknowns (multiple sclerosis),"How do I plan for the unplannable? (Chronic disease/illness)

I’m a planner, so maybe this is how I’m coping while trying to support my partner. We’re middle aged (38, 32),  no kids/won’t have kids and to this point we’ve tried to do everything “right” financially. She got a later start saving for retirement and we weren’t able to contribute much early on.  We are both nurses, making roughly the same income and bring in about 140k year gross. We have between 250k-300k across our retirement accounts mixed between Roth, 403b, and 401a and have an emergency fund of 30k. I out 6k in my Roth each year as of 2019, we put 25% of pre-tax income into retirement and get 8% employer contribution. It would be tight, and difficult to save anything, but I think we would survive on just my income with our current expenses. 

We own a modest home, that we owe about 140k on, valued in the mid 300’s thanks to whatever this bubble is. 

We both owe about 8k each in student loans we’re dragging our feet on paying back in full just in case there’s any loan forgiveness, and I should note my wife is finishing up a masters and her work is paying for most of it and we’re just paying up front each semester. 

My mother-in-law is “retired” and gives most of her retirement income to my brother-in-law to support him, but he recently got divorced and she had decided to move in with us and pays no rent and we buy all the groceries/supply transportation. I don’t know her financials, but I don’t think she makes enough to support herself even if she wasn’t still trying to support her adult son. 

Now all of this on paper probably sounds fine and possible on paper, and I don’t mean to brag, I know so far we’ve been lucky and we work hard to live within our means.  

Then my wife was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Now luckily, her onset of symptoms has gone into remission. She’s back to her baseline, but this is a chronic, progressive disease and I don’t know how to plan for it. She could have few or minor relapses and she could be functional and working for the next 20-30 years, or she could be unable to work, wheelchair bound or require full time care in 5 years. 

I’m not too concerned with affording her treatment while we are both able to work, we have good insurance and her out of pocket max is only 2k or 4K per year, but if she ends up needing full-time care that can be thousands a year, or some form of custodial care can be upwards of 100k/year. I transitioned to a less physically demanding roll than bedside nursing  so I could theoretically do it into my 70’s if needed, because I don’t know how else we could afford her care if she declines. 

Do we just continue with our current plan/saving and hope for the best? Do I need to pick up a side-gig to increase my savings rate? Should I stop saving and pay off the house cause that can’t be taken from us if/when we need Medicaid for her care? What can so do now to prepare for the worst case scenario?

She was diagnosed so quickly (which is nice because we can get her on DMTs quickly) but her only life/disability insurance is through work and I’m guessing she is blackballed from any private carriers now due to her diagnosis.

Sorry for venting.  Any directions on where to even begin preparing for the worst would be appreciated. I looked up some MS financial planning articles and they just say shit like “save for a rainy day and get whole life insurance!” And other advice ranging from no shit to that’s impossible.

Bitcoin,El Salvador’s prospective Bitcoin Bonds do not have nearly enough interest to be good investments,"TLDR: El Salvador’s debt is suspect, and so capital markets charge high interest.  They are now going to bitfinex with ridiculously low interest.  You should not buy these bonds unless the interest is significantly better

As you may have heard, Nayib Bukele is selling bitcoin bonds to build a bitcoin city. These bonds will be 5 year bonds, trading at 6.5%. Put bluntly, that level of interest on Salvadoran bonds, even in Bitcoin, is ridiculously low.

Let me explain. If you look at regular Salvadoran bonds, you will see that the interest rate on their 20 year bonds due 2023 is 7.75%, and on their 10 year bonds due 2029 is 8.625%. You may think that is an acceptable bitcoin discount. However, this is not the correct number to use-we need to use yield.

Yield is, basically, the interest rate scaled to the bond’s current price. This makes sense, because if you buy a $1000 bond paying 4% for 500 its really paying you 8%. So lets look at El Salvador’s yields. The first one, due 2023, has a yield of a [whopping 26.5%](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bond/usp01012aj55-el-salvador-republik-7-75-02-23). The second one, due 2029, has a yield of a [still-high 15%](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bond/usp01012bx31-el-salvador-republik-8-625-17-29). If these bonds would be due in 2027, you could reasonably expect a yield between those two figures (a linear approximation would expect 19%, but linear approximations are not very useful in bond trading).

Now, you could tell me that its worth buying a bitcoin bond at full price for 6.5% interest, or even at a premium-if bitcoin goes up, you win, after all. Not so fast-this runs into what’s called currency risk. If the price of bitcoin doubles, and El Salvador has spent the bitcoin it gained from the bonds on construction of Bitcoin City, then El Salvador will have to come up with more value to pay you back than they recieved. This happens in countries where there is little faith in the home currency-when Mexican companies issued dollar denominated bonds and the peso crashed, there were significant concerns about ability to pay. Same thing applies here.

Bitcoin Bonds are a cool idea, and a novel one. However, they should not be sold at 1/3 of the yield as a dollar-denominated bond. Bukele is trying to take advantage of Bitcoiners to raise capital cheaply-be cautious. I would advise against buying these bonds at anything below a 10% yield.

Edit 1: People have informed me that this bond is likely dollar denominated.  In that case, it should certainly get a yield in between the 15% and 26.5% figures, and you as an investor should, if you want a Salvadoran bond, pick either of those over this offering.  This is because theyd be in the same currency and from the same government.",cryptocurrency

I was single and all, and my financial advisor suckered me into a life insurance policy with a dividend scale payout.  The plan was to have a retirement savings plan / ""tax shelter"" in which I can borrow against my cash value as collateral and pay interest to the bank.  That way, I wouldn't have to pay income tax on the amount that I borrow from because my tax bracket is already so high.  When I die, the payout will cover whatever I owe if I were to borrow.

I don't want to say how much I pay for the premiums, but it's a pretty big chunk of my salary (like 10%).  Even worse, the dividend payout sucks compared to inflation and my estimated premium offset keeps getting delayed year after year...

I'd like to purchase the best house I can possibly get because I feel a good roof over my head is personally life's utmost importance.

All said, I do plan to get married very soon and maybe have kids, so it would help protect my eventual family in a forward thinking perspective.  But I just don't know if I should bother keeping my life insurance policy because it's eating so much of my capital.  I could just borrow against my cash value, but geeze... with the wild swings in the world today, who knows what's going to happen 20-30 years down the road honestly.  Borrowing against my cash value will also mean I'll be paying prime + x interest rate, which I think is around 4.x% to the bank.  I think my dividend payout might be able to cover that interest though.

So if I surrender my policy, I think I'll lose maybe 6-7k of my premium.  I've been contributing to it for around 5-6 years now, and I'm 35 years of age.

Can you guys let me know what your thoughts are?  Should I borrow against my cash value, or just surrender it, or any other alternatives?",finance
personalfinance,Is refinancing student loans a good idea right now?,"Over the past couple of weeks or so I've gotten multiple junk mail ""pre-approved!"" offers. 

I'm inclined to be skeptical because no doubt a lot of these offers are predatory, capitalizing on the fear that student loan payments may once again resume in the US. One would lose all protections federal student loans offer - forbearance when necessary, the ever-present carrot of forgiveness - but the interest rate is 5% lower.

I'm sure that it's a case-by-case basis and I'll be doing my homework to see if it's a good idea for me but, if anyone else has already done their own homework, I'd love to peek at your paper.",finance

4. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs.

7. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it’s unclear how much Rep. Emmer’s solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the “registration or exemption” hurdle.

16. Coinbase is launching an NFT market. How will this impact the CNFT scene? Coinbase tells us: “...initial launch will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards with multi-chain support planned soon after.” [https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-a-marketplace-for-nfts.html)

19. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC’s current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it’s fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa. [https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830](https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830) [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08)

26. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan Müller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we’ll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzdTyV5Jejc)

32. In the Cap Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative Fireside Q&amp;A, Charles mentioned he is talking to Colossol Labs about the possibility of having the Mammoth DeExtinction Project take place on his bison ranch. There are probably some obvious NFT or tokenization use cases there.

personalfinance,Deciding to pay off student loans versus investing,"I am currently expected to have $17883.63 in student loans when I graduate. Fortunately, I have enough to pay that amount in full but I’m wrestling with the fact that some places say it’s better to invest that amount in something like an I-bond that has a higher interest than my loans. However, I’m having trouble understanding this position, considering the risk-to-reward ratio.

To solve my issue, let’s define my situation as I own $17883.63 in student loans with a 3.75% annual interest rate, I have $1000 to invest every month, and I have $17883.63 in cash. There are two options here; 1) I pay the entire loan immediately and begin my investment account at $0 adding the $1000 monthly, or 2) I put the $17883.63 in an investment account that we will assume yields a constant 5% annual return, adding the $1000 monthly to it and using the monthly return to pay the loan off. 

Given this scenario, going with option 2 it would take about 84 months or exactly 7 years to pay off the loan, leaving me with an investment account with $101882.63 in it. On the other hand, had I went with option 1 and paid the loan in the beginning and started my investment account with $0, by the 84th month I would have $101746.69 in that account. So therefore I save $135.94 by going with option 2 and not pay off the loan immediately. Does it make sense to accept risk in a bond just to save $135.94 after 7 years, however?

Let’s also consider two more extreme scenarios. In one extreme scenario I can invest $3500 monthly instead of $1000. It would only take 47 months to pay off the loan and I would have an account with $182382.63 if I went with option 2, and $185552.10 if I went with option 1, leaving with a savings of $3169.47 if I go with option 1 and pay off the loan immediately.

In extreme scenario two, I can only invest $100 monthly. Here it would take 215 months or almost 18 years to pay the loan, and have $39382.63 in my account with option 2 and $34920.20 in my account with option 1, leaving with a savings of $4462.43 if I go with option 2 and invest.

So what I understand here is that the more you can invest monthly, the better it is to pay off the loan in full immediately, and the less you can invest monthly, the better it is to invest. But even in the second extreme scenario, you are willing to spend 18 years to pay off a loan just to save about $5000, or $248 a year. Is that even worth it, once again bearing the risk of a bond? 

Am I missing something here, because in any case it seems a lot better to pay the loan off immediately. So why do people say it’s better to invest when your investment return is greater than the loan interest if by the end of the loan payment you’re almost always going to be better off not accepting risk and only forgiving a minimal amount of savings by investing?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Risks of holding account services like Vauld, celsius etc","I have just place all my XRP into a Vauld account. There is an option to make my stake a fixed deposit and there seems to be no penalties/fees for leaving early.

I am extremely ignorant when it comes to crypto technology.

What are the risks to holding these assets with these companies?

Should I make a fixed deposit?

Issue of federal level insurance = I don't understand this.

What is a flare system?

It seems that XRP cann't obtain staking rewards due to not having a proof of stake system it seems. How does that work? I don't understand this.

Is it true that there are only three ways to get a passive income for holding cryptocurrencies? If I understood correctly, they are these three: - 1. Holding in a specialized crypto bank    2. Holding with a website like Vauld  3. Getting rewards for staking with specific coins

Is the process of minting a coin like xrp just a fancy term for putting your coins up for a fixed deposit? If not, what the hell is minting?

Should I just buy crypto and hold and not think about the stock market like the SMP 500 when it comes to multi decade long investments and is this better than trading cryptocurrencies?

Should I just hold crypto and not give myself the option for gaining interest and then sell it later or should I opt for putting my assets into these interest accounts?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Buy a house in a good location and become house poor?,"Hello!

Me and my husband are potential home buyers. We make a gross income of 226k a year. We have 70k saved for DP + closing costs which leaves us with a good 5.5 month emergency fund.

Our current monthly debts:

Student loans: $1000 (about 118k left in student loans).

We don’t plan on paying these off for another 2 years, as we want to purchase a home and we live in Austin TX which seems to be on a path to continually increasing home prices. They are federal student loans with interest rates less than 5%. 

Car payment: $277 (9k on auto loan, might pay off within the year if we find that the interest rate is high on this one)

Alimony: $950

Potential mortgage (including PMI, Interest, prop tax, home owners insurance, utilities, HOA fee): $3200

That leaves our DTI at around 28%.

This potential mortgage is on a townhome that would be about 590-570k in a very desirable neighborhood.

We did find a bargain, however. A townhome going for $430k right next to my work. The neighborhood is kind of “meh”, however, on the precipice of suburbia. Not the “sexy” neighborhood of the higher priced house. 

The less expensive house is perfectly fine and newer, but it is not in an impressive neighborhood. It’s in a gated HOA community and it seems tranquil but boring. However, it is only 5 minutes from my work. 

The more expensive house would be amongst million dollar mansions. It is older by 20 years than the newer home.

Which townhome should we choose? Forgot to mention they are both townhomes. 

Cheaper house leaves us at 25% DTI. More expensive house would be 29% DTI.

Our concerns our that the townhome in suburbia won’t appreciate as nicely as the other home due to it being in a neighborhood that’s a bit “sleepy” and not as cool or luxurious as the other house.

My husband argues that we will be less financially stressed with the less expensive home and we may as well go with it as it checks off all of our boxes except the location being kind of lame. Ability to save up for investing in stock market, diversify portfolio, vacations, etc.

CryptoCurrency,EU Negative Interest rates. Just my thoughts this morning.,"I sometimes worry that maybe I am a hopium user. That my confidence crypto investments are partially standing on the foundation of ""This is bullish!"" &amp; ""X coin is the future!"" sentiments that have worked their way into my subconscious through media consumption, posts/comments etc. I ask myself ""Is this the right thing to be doing with my savings""

This morning I have read about **negative interest rates** in the EU. Banks take interest from accounts above a given threshold. It has been around since 2014. This doesn't cover every account but accounts that are considered large by the bank. There are some good intentions behind it -- incentivise money to flow as it makes sense to spend/invest the money somewhere is more logical rather than let it shrink in the bank. This is also to work against inflation, and we know how that is going.  **More** savings accounts are being affected as the threshold gets lower, e.g.&gt;1 million euro @ 0.5%. The Neg Interest net seems to be cast wider as we are inflated. This is straight-up money devaluating by just owning it. Unfortunately, I am not affected by this but this does show the pressure from inflation (pun intended) is showing.

Volatility and gains aside, I do feel confident that most of my long term savings were earned from my 9-5 resting in decentralised ecosystems. Blockchains are released to be governed by the poopulation rather than the system governed by exploitable ""suits and pens"". Saving for my future makes so much more sense this way. I would hope that by the time that I plan to use my savings that I would not even need to convert it back to spend it.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I think some people are misinterpreting what I mean above. 

I am not saying inflation is a good thing, it is **bullshit**. It's a broken tool that only kicks the can down the road taking money from the everyday man. A snooze button for panic.

Negative interest rates are another tool that is breaking. It was supposed to reduce inflation but is instead being destroyed by inflation. The idea was for the ultra cash-rich incentive to try to take a risk with just **some** of their capital to improve the economy as it's better invested in businesses than in a bank. Creating new businesses and jobs improves the economy. But now bank accounts as small as 1 million can't keep their money as they exist in a broken system. Negative interest may start moving onto smaller accounts at a higher rate as time goes on which is not its intended purpose. 

Fiat Inflation = Shit 

Negative interest rates =  Shit

**My point** 

Current fiat system = Broken and unfair. 

Cryptocurrency = Building a better fair system that can learn from the mistakes of the past.",cryptocurrency

All their finances being public information, you would be able to see their information on the blockchain, who sent them money, when, and how much, all these businesses lobbying governments would be exposed and the people would boycott them, the current financial system helps them conceal what is happening behind the scenes, they control inflation, interest rates, everything, it doesn't matter that purchasing power is ever declined, the current system needs to artificially create problems to justify it's existence.",cryptocurrency
Economics,Biden Chooses Jerome Powell to Lead Federal Reserve for Another Term,,finance
stocks,Biden picks Jerome Powell to lead the Fed for a second term as the U.S. battles Covid and inflation,"Jerome Powell, who guided the Federal Reserve and the nation’s economy through the staggering and sudden Covid-19 recession by implementing unprecedented monetary stimulus, has been nominated for a second term as chairman of the U.S. central bank.

President Joe Biden made the announcement Monday morning following weeks of speculation that a push from progressives might see Fed Governor Lael Brainard get the spot.

Brainard instead will be vice chair of the board of governors; she had been widely expected to get a separate vice chair for supervision post, which oversees the nation’s banking system. As vice chair, she would succeed Richard Clarida, whose term expires Jan. 31, 2022.

“As I’ve said before, we can’t just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I’m confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard’s focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before,” Biden said in a statement.

The nominations next head to the Senate for confirmation.

In making the decision, Biden praised the Powell Fed for its “decisive” action in the early days of the pandemic.

The Fed rolled out an unprecedented array of lending programs while also cutting interest rates back to near zero and instituting a monthly bond-buying program that would increase the central bank’s holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by more than $4 trillion.

“Chair Powell has provided steady leadership during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve,” a White House statement said. “During that time, Lael Brainard – one of our country’s leading macroeconomists – has played a key leadership role at the Federal Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country’s robust economic recovery.”

Though Powell carried the day, it was not without controversy.

The Fed has been under fire lately following an ethics scandal in which multiple officials engaged in trading stocks at a time when the institution was implementing policies aimed at boosting markets. Powell disclosed that he owned municipal bonds, which the Fed also was buying, and he also bought and sold funds tied to the broad stock market indexes.

At the same time, the Fed has been hit with inflation running faster than it had anticipated – in fact, at the sharpest pace in 30 years. Official Fed policy since September 2020 has been to let inflation run somewhat hotter than the standard 2% target if it allows for full and inclusive employment, but prices have been rising well above that level.

Powell has held to the line that inflation will cool off once factors associated with the pandemic return to normal. But the recent readings have raised questions about the so-called average inflation targeting that signaled a historic turn in central bank monetary policy.

The inflation also has come with a rapid economic recovery and a decline in the unemployment rate from a pandemic peak of 14.8% to its current 4.6%.

The White House statement said the recovery is “a testament to the success of the President’s economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America’s economy back on track.”

Brainard emerged as a key force in the race over who would carry the Fed through the next four years. She has taken point on several issues important to the Biden administration, particularly the need for the Fed to brace the banking system against disruptive climate change events.

A former undersecretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration, Brainard also has been a strong proponent of a digital dollar.

The White House statement stressed the importance of progressive for the Fed in the years to come.

Biden said that Powell and Brainard “also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system.”

“Fundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve – and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs,” he added.

Political pressure, and a Covid struggle
President Donald Trump appointed Powell to the position in 2018 in somewhat of a surprise. Trump chose to pass over then-Chair Janet Yellen, an unusual move in that Fed leaders are rarely removed after just one term. Former President Barack Obama initially appointed Powell to a 14-year term as governor in 2014.

Though Trump nominated Powell, he later fired withering criticism at the Fed chief when the central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2017 and 2018. The former president went as far as to call the Fed policymakers “boneheads” for trying to normalize policy as the economy recovered.

As for Brainard, she is now widely expected to be named vice chair of supervision, a key Fed post to oversee the nation’s banking system.

The Fed is empowered by Congress to fulfill two mandates: Maximize U.S. employment and keep inflation stable. Its leaders, known as governors, are nominated by the president and vote on how to adjust interest rates, regulate the nation’s largest banks and monitor the health of the economy.

To combat the spike in unemployment and recession that began in the spring of 2020, the central bank slashed interest rates and began buying some $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month. It also instituted a variety of lending programs aimed at keeping fixed income markets functioning after they endured significant stress at the beginning of the pandemic.

Economists credit that quick and sizable response for stabilizing financial markets and later repressing long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for corporations to take on loans to build new factories, or for individuals to buy homes or cars. 

“Under Powell the Fed has placed more emphasis on having the economy operate at maximum employment,” Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said via email.

“This is a goal progressive economists have long advocated and a goal which is presumably consistent with Biden’s agenda.”  

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, one of Biden’s top economic advisors and a counselor on his Fed nominations, told CNBC earlier this month that she is happy with the Fed chief’s work. Yellen was the first woman to serve as the Fed’s chair and is the country’s first female Treasury secretary. 

“I talked to him about candidates and advised him to pick somebody who is experienced and credible,” Yellen said. “I think that Chair Powell has certainly done a good job.” 

Powell is also popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised his leadership and amiability since he took over for Yellen in February 2018. 

The news is likely a disappointment to progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who said in September that the Fed’s role in relaxing banking regulations in recent years makes Powell a “dangerous man” and that she would oppose his renomination.",finance

gaming,2042 is a sleeper though,"I bought it release day despite everyone's panning of it.  Unlike my experience doing this with Cyberpunk, which I maintain is positive, 2042 loved up to the hype. It's just awful.  Aside from the absolutely abysmal glitchiness, stutter, instability, clutter popping in and out of existence, dropped frames, lag spikes, jankiness all around, they couldn't even be bothered to make intuitive menus.  It's just pre beta laziness.

But there's something in here.  Seriously, helicopters are bad right now.  But I don't think they're far from being well done.  I don't fly, I do carry a stinger often. And I don't hate the effects of shooting at them.  Countermeasure cooldowns can be increased just a smidge and they'll be pretty good.  And most maps have pretty good ratio of stuff for a help to hide behind and open space for them to be caught in.  I think the trophy system that the one dude deploys can be buffed a hair for this as well.  But not far away from well done.

Tank traverse is clunky and frustrating, and I like that too.  The swing of the barrel of over obstructions is a great balancing tool to these murder machines.  Keeps the game interesting for at infantry. I like the implementation of armor in this game.  Except for hovercraft. They should get some sliders adjusted somewhere.  I'm not a game designer, but they don't feel good rn.

Oversized maps are often brought up. This is a feature imo.  I appreciate the size, and the ability to call in free vehicles makes it bearable. The extra space allows flanking and surprise attacks on objectives.  It's part of the battlefield brand. Exception being the glacier map.  Verticality pretty much doubles the size there, and it's absurd.  Bad map, that one.  

Assault rifle muzzle flip is bananas, and I also (unpopular opinion) like that. Instead of making rifles into lasers, I think other guns should be brought closer to this philosophy.  Never been a fan of airsoft recoil in fps games.  Players should be rewarded for managing fire modes at different ranges.  But realizing the need for actual recoil is a good decision in my opinion.  

The visual clutter is better too in 2042.  Well, right now it's awful because you're constantly distracted by disappearing and reappearing assets.  But I think some effort has been made to make the environment less visually cluttered than most recent games that use a massive number of visual distractions to show off their graphical prowess.  Less is more, and they did reduce it a little.  Not a ton ,and it's still a lot more than the franchises hayday. But a reversal on the trend.

The abilities of the characters you choose are really quite good and feel balanced and powerful but not overpowered.  Super like this aspect.  I feel good choosing one and don't feel like there's any single soldier that's hands down better than all the rest.

As someone who has high hopes and tried hard to like 2042, let me tell you it's really not worth the buy.  But if some continued development happened, I can see this being a lot of fun in 6 months to a year.  

Keep an eye out, and if ea decides to earn your business next year then I don't see why they can't with this title, given a lot of hard work.

But not yet.",technology

personalfinance,Critique our financial goals for the year.,"Hi all, 

30 years old, married with a 2 year old and planning for another. 

The plan is for my wife to stay home for 1 school year (Teacher) with our next baby so we are trying to line things up properly. 

Current income for this year: ~207k
Will go down to around: 120k for the year when she takes off (in about a year). 

Debt: 377k mortgage (around 190k in equity)

Private student loan: 48k at 3.2%

Federal loans: 30k one at 6% the rest less than 4%

Highest rate is 6.80% at  2303.11

The rest are between 3.4%-4.6%

Cash: 21k

Crypto: 22k 

529: 4k

Vehicles: 30k (paid off)

Retirement: 91k

Our plan is to pay off the 48k in June to free up 700 a month to make the monthly a bit more relaxed. At that point, we’ll go down to around 10k emergency fund and will be able to continue 401k investing, funding two 529 accounts (new baby), and saving around 100-300 a month extra. We have everything budgeted from going out to car/home maintenance etc. So, the 100-300 after is including after all expenses. 

I am currently contributing 7.5% and my job contributes another 7.5% 

We have paused my wife’s retirement so we can add more to the debt this year. Then after her year off we will increase hers to 15%

After the year and my wife goes back to work we will ramp up our retirement savings and get back to normal. 

Does this sound like a good idea? Should we not pay the 48k loan off and keep all the cash in savings and pause 529 saving for the year then pay loan after she goes back to work? I’m not too fond of that option.

**Insight**

The market is continuing its slide down after a rebound to 60k 

over the weekend that proved to be the bull-trap that the [last report](https://medium.com/@TraderGabi/when-can-we-start-buying-again-c3ffc2a1cd3b) warned of. On-Chain metrics still iterates that the dip is not a complete sell-off. This is further supported with the success of a few alts that were completed unaffected by a sliding overall market. 7-day gains: EGLD +50%, CRO +56%, SAND +42% AVAX +36%. 

On Friday’s report, consolidated data from 3 separate metrics concluded a 56k BTC could prove to be an efficient area to start increasing positions. It’s now recommend holding off this area as tomorrow’s report will take another look into options data and max pain. Options data feed is currently unavailable. It’s still looking likely that this week will decide the bottom of this current dip as the Nov 25 futures expiration will have a strong influence on where price is heading. 

Tomorrow’s report will investigate good tokens to buy in anticipation of a rebound.

**NOOBIE Lesson of the day**

**What is Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin is a global digital decentralized currency that is completely digital and cryptographic by nature that began in 2009. It uses cryptography to verify transactions through nodes located around the globe. The transactions are then recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain. If one explores the elements of bitcoin vs our current form of money, you begin to see some of its benefits. 

Some aspects about Bitcoin that we will quickly explore. 

1. Decentralized

2. Fast and easy to send

3. Open-Source

4. Permissionless

5. Transparent

**Decentralized**

One of the most powerful bitcoin traits. It cannot be stopped by any one entity since its nodes are distributed globally by millions of miners. The free market is the only way bitcoin price is determined. 

**Fast and easy to send**

Bitcoin can be sent across the globe at an extremely low price. With the Segwit upgrade, Millions of dollars of BTC can be sent for less than $5, in less than 10 minutes. Transactions are peer-to-peer and no third party is needed. 

**Open Sourced**

Developers all over the world can participate in constant development and improvement of the bitcoin network. The recent Taproot upgrade will now allow easier application of smart-contracts on bitcoin. 

**Permissionless**

No third party is needed to send or receive bitcoin. Unlike most financial payments that require bank approvals, BTC is completely permissionless in nature. No information is collected to use the bitcoin network. It is available to anyone with an internet connection. 

**Transparent**

All transactions are recorded on a public ledger and can be seen anyone. People that utilize bitcoin can remain anonymous, but transactions are all recorded on this ledger. [Bitcoin Explorer Link](https://bitcoinexplorer.org/). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Tomorrow**

· What to buy during the dip

· Dig further into bitcoin

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Last week the reports were sorta heavy so this holiday week I’ll keep them short and sweet. I don’t anticipate too much news occurring this week, but data is showing that we can rebound. Keep a close eye on the market with the Friday expiration if you’re looking to pick up some more positions.

personalfinance,Continuing school for a second degree - what to do about my personal finance?,"Hello, 

After completing a B.S. in information and decision sciences, and working for about half a year in a corporate setting/ supply chain role, I find myself extremely disillusioned with what I am doing and the fact that I’ll have to do this for the rest of my life. 

In light of that realization, I decided to enroll in a mechanical engineering program at a university that is near my home. I’m not going to get into the details of why I chose this specific degree, but in short, I did it because I like it and want to.

I only have roughly 20k in debt from my first degree, and after discussing with advisors, if I take 15 credit hours a semester, best case scenario, the BSME would take about 2-3 years to complete. I would finance this degree by taking federal loans out. With the tuition data provided by the university, I estimate that I will end up with about another 20-25k in loans after this degree, totaling 40-45k in debt at the end of all this. 

My folks are very nice, so they are okay with me staying at their home for a couple more years to do this. I have about 6k in savings at the moment, and only a 200 balance on one credit card. 

Finally, my question is how to play this correctly so that I don’t burn through all my savings or set myself up for disaster? During the next two years I am planning on working part time (remotely if possible). I know that I will be forgoing the opportunity to contribute to 401k or similar investments. From a personal finance perspective, what is your assessment of this situation? How can I mitigate financial loss/strain while pursuing another 2.5-3 years of undergrad studies? 

Thanks",finance

stocks,"With Most Growth Stocks Falling, On Top Fears of Inflation and Interest Rates, Should Now Be A Good Time To Start Buying?","Most people believe that when and if interests rates truly end up rising, growth stocks will probably see a massive decline in value.

I'm 24 and aim to go to graduate school in the next 2-4 years. However, I am not 100% certain grad school in that time frame is what I want to do (maybe 70-80% sure?). I make enough money to put about $500/month away into a savings account right now, and have 8% going into my retirement fund. I'm matched up to 5%, so that's 13% total going into my retirement + I have a pension (federal worker). I don't have a mortgage (I rent), and have no debt. I recognize that overall I'm in a very good financial spot right now. 

What I'm wondering is what should I do with the $500/month I stash away? I've heard stock is best, but only if you can leave it there for a long time. I've checked out CDs but the only ones in the 2-4 year mark make just as much (or sometimes less) interest than the savings account I have right now. Right now I have about 28k sitting in my savings (10k for 'emergency fund' and 18k for 'grad school fund'), but I'm worried it's just wasting away in there.

btc,Reuters: Mt Gox bankruptcy liquidation risk may cause Bitcoin to record its worst weekly performance in six months,"Bitcoin's worst weekly performance in six months last week, Reuters analysis may be shocked by the expectation that creditors of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange Mt Gox may liquidate their funds. Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer of Stack Funds, a Singapore-based crypto asset management company, predicts that this situation may continue until Bitcoin finds support at around $53,000. He said that the Tokyo court has signed a plan to repay creditors of Mt Gox, triggering concerns about further declines. Those affected will receive a large amount of Bitcoin, possibly in the first or second quarter of 2022. In the longer term, this will bring some doubts to the market,"" as it is expected that those creditors may be sellers.

gaming,Halo Infinite has set a dangerous precedent for the series moving forward.,"I'm a diehard Halo fan. I read all the books as a kid (up until just after Halo 4's release), I know the lore in and out and I have played ever Halo game to death. I love Halo. I played El Dewrito before MCC was on PC, I've spent so many nights up late playing custom games.

As most fans will probably agree, the last 5 years have been a trying time for new Halo titles. 343 has tried their best to emulate the ""core 5"" games (CE, 2, 3, ODST, Reach) but, in my opinion, they've always felt... Off... Something about these games have felt like they're lacking what makes Halo, ""Halo."" That feeling you got when blasting through high charity as a badass one lining Chief just never seemed to come back after Halo 3. All the moments in the later games that were meant to feel ""epic"" have felt vapid and stakeless since Halo 4, and it always seems to come back to the same problem: 343 industries doesn't understand Halo.

I'm not going to repeat the same talking points that others have countless times but I truly believe this is the case due to their obsession with Halo Infinite being a ""return to the core Halo experience"" that they've apparently had. *And good on them for recognizing their weakness, and working to improve the series.* As of this post I am eagerly awaiting the campaign and DESPERATELY hope they have learned from their mistakes. But the more I play infinite, the more warning alarms are going off in my head about what the game is shaking up to be.

#### The positives before I shit on everything like an asshole
Halo Infinite is a beautiful game, I don't think most could argue against that. It looks amazing. It feels pretty good too. Good response from the weapons, good sound design (for the most part, there are some technical bus with the dynamic audio it seems), and the universe they're building for multiplayer feels... Alive... Something I've never experienced in a Halo game before. 

#### The Radar
Let's talk about radar for a minute. The radar has been a critical tool for Halo players since day 1. So critical in fact, that Bungie actively worked to buff the radar and make it as useful for players as possible in Halo Reach. Why is a properly balanced radar so important to a Halo game? I'm glad you asked!

1. A well made radar allows for players to have a quick understanding of their environment without having to physically look around. This spatial awareness is critical in a game like Halo because you have to think quickly and prioritize targets while being aware of the other players around you.

2. The radar rewards players who understand the tools of Halo. None of the people who don't use the radar will care that it got nerfed in this game, because they don't understand how to properly use it. Hell, most players probably haven't realized anything is even wrong/different because they barely glance at the thing. But those who have played Halo for a decade or more at this point have relied on the radar as a valuable tool to control the game. With it being so buggy and dumbed down, it's just hurting the people who have stuck with the series from day 1.

3. What's the point of sneaking without a larger radar? Crouch walking is almost entirely useless if you can just Sprint the 9 meters or so the radar has in range in a few seconds. That brings me to my second point...


#### Sprint
Full disclosure that I'm biased here, I really dislike the sprint mechanic in modern games. I feel that Halo 3 is a prime example of how you make a fast-paced Halo game without the need for sprinting. Sprinting in Halo infinite has caused the entire map system to be rethought, but did that need to happen? I don't know, I just feel like sprinting was added to Halo as a way to make the franchise more similar to other run and gun fps games. I don't feel like it adds anything unique or positive to the game and it feels like a crowd pleaser that 343 added to ""appeal to a broader demographic"" (which is at the heart of the problem, but I'll get to that shortly). The general game ""feel"" feels like it's made to cater toward non-halo players, which is so frustrating. Even the default controller controls are more similar to what you'd find in a Call of Duty game than any halo game in the MCC.

#### Player Collision and Physics
Some of my favorite moments in Halo have come from playing with player collision and other physics mechanics that other games simply don't have. The fact that it has been removed from Halo Infinite is just anti-halo imo. And I'm not just talking about stacking 3 people on top of each other just for a random sticky to fly in and ruin the moment... The entire feeling of the game is just off. The magnetism on melee kills, the lack of physics behind grenades, hell even the gravity hammer just feels bizzare and unnatural compared to precious games. Not to mention the countless clips we have already seen of people's teammates running through them and ruining their kill (or worse, killing the player). 

Why was player collision ever turned off? My hunch is it is a technical problem that 343 ran into late in the game and couldn't solve. It was an issue that was marked as ""low risk,"" and set aside on some software burndown chart somewhere (probably DevOps bc lul Microsoft) never to be heard from again. Anyway the point is, it should never have ever been conceivable that this feature would be removed and it's equivalent to turning off a basic game feature like crouching. It's a vital part of multiplayer that is now missing.

#### The problem with modern software development (and mostly Microsoft)
Have you ever heard the phrase ""you don't want to know how the sausage gets made?"" As a 26 year old software developer, this is how I feel about every piece of software that Microsoft has made in the last 5 years. Every tiny app, feature change, or video game that comes from the company REEKS of corporate meddling and greed. Everything Microsoft makes is subscription-based now. After all, why get paid once when you can get paid every month? From office 365, to azure, to the power platform, and now to Halo, this mentality of ""milking the cash cow for all she's got"" has KILLED modern multiplayer gaming. And the focus that 343 has clearly had to put on these money-making features has dramatically effected their ability to make a quality Halo game.

Now, is this just a problem with Microsoft? Of course not. This is an industry-wide problem that has become rampant, and is creating a giant ouroboros. Games aren't made to be fun anymore. They're made to be addictive and stuffed with vapid ""progression systems"" that only serve to show you what you chose not to buy. ""Oh, you are level 30 now!! You get this emblem, but see all the cool armor you'd get if you just gave us more MONEY??? Better spend your hard earned cash on these fancy pixels!""

Make no mistake, 343 didn't release infinite as f2p out of the kindness of their own hearts. They did it so they could release a buggy, unfinished game to as many people as physically possible as quickly as possible to make as much long-term subscription money as they can. This mindset can only make a bad game, and the more I play infinite the more I grow concerned that this game exists solely to separate as much as my hard earned cash from me as possible in as short a time as possible. On the Halo subreddit it has been discovered that you'd need to pay upward of $1k to unlock all items with the current plan that 343 has for the battle pass.

That being said, I hope 343i listens to feedback and I hope beyond hope that the campaign makes up for these shortcomings. Maybe things will turn around, but... ""Don't make a girl a promise...""

Tl;dr: Infinite has a lot of issues. Greed and in progression system is nefarious (f2p was NOT altruistic), it's a business not a game, f2p allows them to release an unfinished product.",technology

Video sums it up pretty well. If a central private bank that operates outside of the federal government is given a monopoly on our money supply, then they control basically everything. They want a recession to happen? Easy, call in all loans, issue no new ones and boom, the money supply is now tightened from the people. Want to raise prices? Sure lets print 40% of all money in 2 years. Hey US government you need some money? Sure, we can loan you some, with interest of course. Guess who's gonna pay that interest on that loan by the way? You. The tax payer.

The only way out of this mess is sound money that is issued by the people. AKA, a decentralized crypto currency. One that is easily adopted, fast, very low fees/feeless, and with no central authority to control it. Then, other cryptos could be seen as investments based on this crypto instead of the US dollar. Does something like or close to this exist?

CryptoCurrency,"Reminder that with crypto gaining legitimacy with global markets and government, you really need to start thinking about long and short term capital gains and taxes.","I live in the USA so the information I'm going to share pertains specifically to anyone transacting there.

With the holiday season coming up, I know a lot of you may be thinking about cashing out a chunk of your crypto for some gifts to others and yourselves, which is great!

But too many times especially on this sub I notice people with losses and gains completely forgetting about capital gains taxes that you will definitely have to pay, or you will have an IRS target on your head for pretty much anything over a grand.

These are ALL 2021 tax rates. 2022 are ever so slightly higher limits. 

For simplicity sake, let's assume everyone here is single (lmao) and filing for themselves, currently for long term capital gains (an asset held for more than one year) the rates are 

0% from $0-40,400, 

15% from $40,401-445,850, and 

20% on anything above $445,850.

This does NOT mean if you make $1 above the 0% limit you pay 15% on it all. It means that single dollar will be taxed at 15%, the rest is 0%. Same thing with short term.

Mind you these are all Federal tax rates. Local and State taxes vary widely and I'm not even gonna touch that. 

Short term (an asset held for less than one year) goes as follows.

10% - $0-9,950

12% - $9,951-40,525

22% - $40,526-86,375

24% - $86,376-164,925

32% - $164,926-209,425

35% - $209,426-523,600

37% - $523,601+

Of course these calculations may sway a bit depending on your losses and charitable donations and quite a few more nuances as far as full federal tax liability, but these are the simple ones you need to start thinking about if you've been buying and selling within this year. 

Please be careful and don't spend your entire liquid cash flow of your profits because the tax man will always want his cut, and he will come for you if you don't have it. 

Happy holidays!

P. S. - Obligatory something something boating accident 😉

retirement,ready to retire but afraid to because money,"FOLLOWUP:

Thanks to everyone for the responses.  Replying to some specifics:

Monthly expenses here for the type of life I have varies between $3800/mo to $4500/mo over the last year.  This does not include travel because, well, I didn't do any. Context: living by myself in my own house (small 'starter' home on the edge of a pretty nice in-town neighborhood with good neighbors), small reliable 10yr old car that I bought used.  That said, I don't know what my expenses slow travelling will be.  I read what a lot of folks are living on in different places (as well as numbeo and expatistan) but my sense is they are a lot more ascetic than I want to be, and I'm not sure I really believe the numbers I see in numbeo and similar.  my rule of thumb, based on no evidence at all, is to take those numbers and double them.

Regarding social things I am by nature a recluse.  That said, I have found I do enjoy limited time and interactions with fun folks.  Foodie groups, for example.

Regarding cash in hand, I generally keep 'one major expense plus a couple of months routine living expenses' within a couple of days availabity (assuming the intertubes stay up).  That's about $30K give or take.  Rest is all in low cost ETFs and mutual funds, both traditional brokerage accounts and in the 401K type pre-tax accounts.  

Regarding 'fixed income' and buckets, my original idea was to let the pension act as the 'fixed income' part of the portfolio.  After educating myself some more I think I will shift 5 years of current yearly spend that the pension doesn't cover into...something.  Normally it would be HYSA or bonds, but those are a mess right now.  Why 5 years and not the 8-9  that would cover historical downturns/recovery?  Mostly because 1.  That's a lot of money to be sitting idle and 2.  I expect my expenses to decrease in the future.  But who knows?

The working out and getting fit is a real issue. ""working out"" is not something I like or enjoy but I was doing pretty well maintaining discipline until everything shut down.  So I needed to start over again with a different regimen and I have been doing that.   But it was starting from the bottom.  Again.  I'm also getting all the usual health checks this year in prep for OuttaHere.

what else?  I understand about the 'life is short'.  But I still viscerally remember being past bottom dollar having had to spend down savings during two of the long unemployment periods.  Nuff said about that.

Loved the comment about 'overthinking it'.  I have been criticized for that before...

Thank you all for your thoughts.  I do appreciate them.

===============================================
ORIGINAL:

There seems to be a number of 'hesitant to pull the pin' posts lately so I'll go ahead and toss in another one.  Call it 'redditherapy' I guess.  Or maybe looking for a different take.  Obligatory stats at end. 

I grew up sort of a product of the Depression.  The 'lessons learned' from that Depression, in retrospect, had a profound influence through three generations.  Four if you count me.  And I have been long term unemployed a couple of times.  So I am finding I am very reluctant to quit/retire, not out of 'company loyalty' or 'what will I do' or any of that.  It's purely lack of confidence in the economics (probably another by-product of Depression era thinking.  A profound mistrust of the bankers/stockbrokers/etc.  But I digress).

Original plan was to retire at 60 (that was pension FRA).  The plan was to sell the house 
and car and everything else and Outta Here.  Set aside 500K for future housing and then slow travel the world until I found something
I liked, or until I didn't want to do it anymore.  And I was on track to do just that.  Then covid.  

Anyway, still working.  Still getting the paycheck. And it's not a bad place to work but I am 
not one that was ever married to the job or the company.  I was laid off enough times early on that any 
vestige of that was pretty well snuffed.  I work for the paycheck, nothing more nothing 
less.  Once I'm gone, I'm gone.  I can say that with confidence because that's how it's 
been when I've departed jobs in the past.

But I'm tired and don't want to do this anymore.  So much so that I hate alarmclock-waking up 
in the mornings so I can match their schedule.  And very time the phone rings I'm 
either/both annoyed or get that 'orrible sinkin feelin' even before I see who's calling.  And 
this really, truly isn't a bad place to work, and the folks are pretty decent.  I just don't want to have to work 
anymore. Or do anything on anybody else's schedule that I don't have to.

Plan now is to get into 2022 (which is close enough now that I'd be leaving money on the table if I quit before February).  Stay long enough to 
max out the 401K (probably April/May) and then pull the pin.    I know I can make it to January.  If I can do January then I can probably do February.  
Anything after that is anybody's guess.

The retirement simulators (shoutouts to ficalc.app, cfiresim, firecalc, ontrajectory, newretirement and the bogleheads) all say I'll be fine, even living in my current HCOL area (as long as I stay -very- frugal while I'm here).  Well, all except for the 'pessimistic' setting in newretirement which I configured as best I could for worst case recent-historical settings across the board.  (I do have some issues with the assumptions that all these calculators make about lifestyle and expenses, but that's a different post).

But...no paycheck coming in in an HCOL area really gives me the willies.  And I can guarantee that the world economy is going to collapse in ways not seen since the middle ages shortly after I quit.  Just because.  You heard it here first!

OK, this has been more of a discouragement dump than I had hoped.  I understand that this is a first-world problem, and lots of other folks would -love- to be in this position.  Including my parents when they were my age.
  
But still....

Thanks for reading.  I'd really be interested in different takes on any/all the above.


OBLIGATORY STATS:

62m.  Very good health.  Expect to live to 95.  No wives, exes, kids, quadros, debt except for mortgage (3 yrs left).  Around a $3K/mo (take-home) pension when I do quit.  Around $1.1m in 401K-type accounts, give or take depending on markets.  Withdraw as needed up to 1/CAPE.  Retiree medical coverage is pretty good by today's standards in USA.  LTC taken care of as much as you reasonably can.

CryptoCurrency,Governments will co-opt or ban cryptos most revolutionary use cases.,"Foreword: I hate karma. I have no moons. Do your worst. 

I love crypto, and the promise of it. But like the internet of the 90s, they will monetize what they can and ban what the rest. 

They seem OK with Bitcoin, cause it does ONE thing. Stores value, transparently. Big brother LOVES Bitcoin, they know every transaction.  They can asset forfeiture  enough of it off criminal networks to create a treasury. If BTC tries to become a privacy coin, or adds smart contracts, they will regulate it even harder. 

How long do you REALLY think the DoD would take to spin up an mega antminer factory in some bunker in the desert? 

They built a nuclear weapon from scratch in 5 years. If they wanted they could 51% us in 2-3 years time, and we wouldn’t know it until they all come online simultaneously. 

DeFi:

They will require KYC or consider it money laundering. They will blacklist wallets that have touched a Dex. So no way to off-ramp. So what? You wanna pay in crypto anyway? They will make it illegal for any registered business to do business with your wallet. 

It is only a matter of time. You’re kidding yourself if you think there will be some DeFi Valhalla that is P2P, no KYC. 

If there is, they will use big data to rake back your money, even if it takes YEARS to catch up.

Privacy coins:

What is to stop governments from banning, say, Monero? You can say “it can’t be stopped, only banned”. But they can make exchanges stop carrying it. And make off-ramps to fiat illegal. 

It’s the same argument with Bitcoin. China banned it and…it worked. Bitcoin ownership is a SERIOUS crime there now. 

If they make privacy coins illegal, then what? You’re telling me you’re willing to commit a FEDERAL OFFENSE to hold XMR, a coin you can’t (in this scenario) use for any legal purpose?

Or, do i need to 'diversify' this since its a single mutual fund? I read that for my retirement accounts i want to break it up into 50-40-10 (domestic, international, bonds) but wasnt sure about an individual account? Also, would it be better to do an index fund since there are no fees at all? My roth has index funds, but wasnt sure if it was stupid to have money in a retirement account and an individual account both for the same fund. 

Or is there a better place to put your money if you're lazy like me? I tried looking into laddered cds, high yeild savings, and cant find anything with interest rates worth a damn.",finance

CryptoCurrency,For those of you who are comfortable using lending platforms to earn interest on your coins.,"TL;DR at the end with link to the full resource. (I wouldn’t advise trying to zoom in on the snapshot pic). 

If you are familiar and/or experienced with lending platforms you can skip past most of this. 


These are several way to generate passive income on the coins you’re holding such as staking, lending, yield farming, and more. However, this post will be focusing on the lending option. Those of you unfamiliar with lending should start by lending me your ear (see what I did there?) 

Lending is the process of holding your coins on specific platforms, some of which offer other services such as token swap, fiat on-boarding, crypto credit/debit cards, etc. to generate a yield on your coins. Essentially what you’re doing is providing the platform with liquidity, allowing them to offer crypto loans for those seeking them. 

I used to hear many people discussing the added risk of this practice, however I’ve seen a shift in the general consensus about the safety of lending, as more lenders gain reputation/trust, and as more exchanges have begun offering lending services. 

Some lenders offer additional ways to earn higher yields, such as holding a certain number of their native token, locking your coins for a set duration, etc. 

There are many lenders to choose from that offer different rates on different coins. See TL;DR to learn about some of your options. 

TL;DR #1

Check out this 
[Interest Rates Comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/edit) that details rates paid on almost 150 different coins by some of the highest yielding and most reputable lenders, exchanges, and wallets. 

TL;DR #2

(This is reflected in the resource I linked) CoinLoan is offering a promotional rate on ADA until 12/23 with a base interest rate of 7.2% APY and the ability to earn up to 9.2% APY if you stake their native token.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Nov 22, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 22, 2021**

After trading mostly even throughout the day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) sold off sharply in the last hour. Early in the morning, President Biden announced this morning that Jerome Powell was renominated to lead the Federal Reserve for another four years. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who was Powell’s main competitor, was nominated as the Vice-Chair. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for more inflation data set to be released later this week. 

On Monday, President Biden announced he was nominating Jerome Powell for a second, four-year term as the Chair of the Federal Reserve and Fed Governor Lael Brainard as the Vice-Chair, ending weeks of speculation who would be tapped to run the nation’s Central Bank. Biden was expected to select either Powell or current Fed Governor Lael Brainard as Fed chair. Following the nomination, Powell will go before the Senate Banking Committee for approval, and if confirmed, will serve another four-year term. 

Eric Browne, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Pimco, said “I think this was largely expected by markets. Certainly there were some conversations in markets over the last couple of weeks about Brainard potentially being elevated to the Fed chair position. But by and large the expectation was for consistency. You may see a little bit of a rally on the back of this with the expectation that policy is going to remain in place and intact, and everything that’s been articulated already by the Fed is likely to continue into 2022 and beyond.”

Looking ahead, more inflation data is set to be released later this week, which will provide further insight into the pace of inflation and any potential reactions by the Federal Reserve. The Core Personal Consumptions Expenditure (PCE) , which is Fed’s preferred measure for inflation, is set to be released Wednesday and expected to show a 4.1% year-over-year increase. This would be the biggest annual jump in roughly three decades. 

**Highlights**

* Constellation Brands (STZ), the maker of Corona beer, is reportedly exploring for a deal to merge with Monster Beverage, according to a report by Bloomberg
* Private Equity Firm KKR made a $12 billion bid to bring Telecom Italia private, sending shares of the Italian telecommunication company higher.
* Sales of previously owned homes in the US unexpectedly jumped to their highest level in nine months in October, signaling that housing demand is picking up against a backdrop of low mortgage rates and strengthening labor markets. Existing home sales rose by 0.8% month-over-month in October, reaching an annualized rate of 6.34 million, according to data from the National Association of Realtors
* General Motors (GM) bought a 25% stake in electric boat startup Pure Watercraft for $150 million. 
* Netflix (NFLX) said it is acquiring special effects company Scanline VFX, which is behind the effects of “Stranger Things” and “Game of Thrones”. 
* Tesla Inc is planning to spend more than $1 billion on its new vehicle factory in Austin, Texas, and plans to complete construction by the end of this year, public filings with a Texas state agency showed.
* NVIDIA (NVDA) [today detailed an AI system called GauGAN2,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-absurd-beauty-of-hacking-nvidias-gaugan-2-ai-image-machine/) the successor to its GauGAN model, that lets users create lifelike landscape images that don’t exist using text. The program was developed by feeding 10 million high quality images into NVIDIA’s Selene supercomputer. This makes it faster and easier to turn an artist's vision into a high-quality AI-generated image. The practical benefi is that one can use a few words to get a basic image together without any drawing at all and then tweak details to refine the final output. 
* In other news, NVIDIA is fast tracking development of its “[Zero-Trust” cybersecurity platform built using their data processing units and Morpheus AI](https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/22/how-nvidia-aims-to-demystify-zero-trust-security/), citing vulnerabilities in it’s clients' datacenters. Very basically, traditional cybersecurity relies on a perimeter or firewall that prevents viruses and hacks from getting into your computer. Zero-trust is an architecture that also constantly monitors all the data in the system and is able to enforce strict control on what each user can do on the network. Manuvir Das, Head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA said, “You cannot just rely on the firewall on the outside, you have to assume that any application or any user inside your data center is a bad actor,” and “It is not our intention to be a direct provider of cybersecurity solutions. We have built the platform for cybersecurity companies to integrate into their solutions.”",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my loan?,"As the title says I am unsure if I should refinance my loan.

The details I have are that I still currently have 209,397.87 on my loan, and that closing costs to refinance would be 12,023.39. Bringing that total to 221,421.26.

The new loan is to be at 214,797.00 and I am being given a credit of 5,517.02.  So by the calculations I see on the refinance papers it says the total due from me is 221,421.26 and it is subtracting the total loan and credits of 220,314.02 and says that cash from me totals 1,107.24. 

The difference in interest rate is from 3.5% original loan, to 2.99% new loan and the monthly payment goes from 1746 and change to 1683 and change. I pay extra every month rounding up to 1800 a month and don't see that changing even if I refinanced it would still be 1800 a month that I would pay.

Is this worth it? When would I break even? Am I correct in thinking that this means I only need to pay the total of 1,107.24 in closing up front to refinance this?(just making sure I don't have to front the full 12k now with Christmas and all around the corner) How much sooner would this amount be paid off compared to what I am paying now?",finance

personalfinance,Paying off high interest loan with retirement funds ?,"Hello all, I was hoping someone may have some insight or experience on a situation I am in.
28 y.o. 90k a year, 15k in a 401k. I currently have a 20 percent interest rate on a 12,000 dollar loan. I can afford the payments and even a little more to pay it off early, however I would very much like to put the payment towards more savings for a house. I may have to move within a years time and I wasn’t sure how the loan would affect first time home buyers, and I would also like as much liquid cash as possible until I have my living situation figured out. My real question is would it be beneficial to borrow from my 401k to just pay this off. Or am I really screwing my future returns. Also there is no penalty for borrowing the money, as I pay it back with post tax income. I do plan to ramp up my 401k contributions and Roth contributions once I turn 30. But I’m just trying to sort everything out before then.

CryptoCurrency,"If you support crypto, please read.","I know many of us disagree on many things. We all have our favorite pet projects and argue about everything from proof of work versus proof of stake, to store of value versus medium of exchange. Some of us are into defi, for others its NFTs; maybe it's meme tokens that float your boat, or just plain old electronic cash.

But I like to believe we also all share something in common. We believe in the power of crypto. We believe in what it represents and what it can one day make possible. But it's not just going to happen on its own. The future isn't going to be handed to us on a silver platter and it's going to take as many of us as possible to fight the powers that be and make our voices heard.

I'm not proposing we take down the fed tomorrow, but what I am talking about is something much smaller, something I'm hoping you can help me set right.

The other day I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qyb6zt/an_open_letter_to_johnny_lyu_and_kucoin_exchange/) about the exchange Kucoin. I explained how they've been holding \~$50K of my BCHA (aka XEC on every other exchange) for over six months without letting me withdraw. I shared emails showing how they've given me nothing but the runaround since May, and how Kucoin themselves had [announced](https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-kucoin-will-support-bcha-upgrade-0820) their support of this project 3 months ago, causing me and others to buy even more.

[People's exchange my ass.](https://preview.redd.it/qwcsz21p09181.png?width=1370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85286d659c2edec9267f65c9b0496e13e328e285)

But they've failed to live up to their word.

While I was thankful to see so many kind and supportive comments, giving me hope for the crypto community at large, I'm sorry to say Kucoin still has yet to tell me when I'll be able to withdraw my coins.

To those who suggested I just sell my BCHA and withdraw in USDT, the fact is I can't because there is no liquidity left. Who wants to buy a coin on an exchange if you can't withdraw, and I hold enough coins that I would have to sell for cents on the dollar if I did. Not to mention I'd just be passing off the problem to some other poor soul.

But what's most important is that I shouldn't have to do any of that. And giving up would just be letting Kucoin off the hook, which I'm not about to do.

So I'm asking for help from the wider cryptocurrency community. I want to believe that people in this community, more than any other, understand the difference between right and wrong and believe in a sense of justice in this world.

I'm asking you to help me right this wrong, and share this post with as many people as possible. My goal is to reach the top of this subreddit and send a loud message to u/Johnny_Kucoin (Johnny Lyu, CEO of Kucoin) that his exchange can't get away with this.

At this point I know that \~$50K of my money is probably gone, but I want everyone in crypto to hear about this so they understand the type of exchange Kucoin is. Because if they can steal my money, there's nothing stopping them from doing the same to you.

I for one am tired of industry players who give crypto a bad name. It's time to call out bad actors and send a message to these companies that they must treat their customers right or we'll simply move our business elsewhere.

I know this is a longshot, but I'm asking you to spread the word, because I am confident that this space is full of amazing people who believe in supporting each other and holding bad actors accountable.

I'm not a vindictive person. I don't want Kucoin to go out of business. I just want them to do the right thing and make sure others aren't cheated out of their money like I was.

Thank you for reading and best of luck to everyone.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,I think the make it or break it is coming sooner than you think?,"I will provide the links but highlighted some key notes I would like to please share:

""Inflation rose to [a 31-year high](https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-cpi-october-price-growth-index-supply-chain-crisis-recovery-2021-11) of 6.2% year-on-year in October, data showed earlier this month. The next inflation print is due on December 10.""

""He said the US central bank could be forced to change direction abruptly at its December 15 meeting. 'There's where I think you're going to see more volatility in the equity market,' he said.""

""Siegel was far from completely pessimistic about stocks. He said he's still 'heavily invested' in equities because real returns on bonds are so low that 'there is no alternative.' ""

""The idea that there is no alternative to stocks — commonly known as 'TINA' — helps explain why equities are buoyant despite sky-high inflation and central banks considering turning off the stimulus taps.""

Some background knowledge for why this matters:  Jerome Powell was re-elected as the Federal Reserve. From the looks of it (second link will follow), he was selected by President Biden because the only other person was a progressive,  Lael Brainard , whom the board of governors feels is too progressive and someone who is inconsistent (you know, ""choosing the poison you know"" kind of deal).

Bottom line: the fed is forced to invest in stocks because they claim that THEY DONT HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE. But if you read them carefully... they mention nothing of crypto. There is a great chance that by December 15th, the fed will pull back, and cause a massive correction.... the kind that leave people homeless in the fucking street. If another massive correction occurs, I foresee two things: people are so poor they say fuck crypto, sell their shit, and roll bounce, causing everything to dip (an awesome time to buy), OR people will seek any alternative to their worthless stocks, and may run to crypto as an alternative to the US dollar (which will follow the path of Portugal).

cybersecurity,Amazon store card issuer compromised or just doesn’t understand security at all,"It appears that either synchrony bank who represent themselves as the Amazon credit services division has been compromised and credit card information has leaked, or they just don’t understand the concept of phishing email and asking customers to provide personally identifiable information from a link in an email.

personalfinance,Fraudulent Call?,"I just got a call from Chase at the number 18883731969 and I think it was fraudulent. What leads me to think this? Well, it isn't yet 8am on the east coast of the US so I doubt the department is even open for business yet. Also, they called me. That kind of freaked me out. I politely hung up on them. Is this number legit?

Edit: The answer is yes, the number is legit. Anyone seeing this post in the future. HOWEVER any number can be spoofed. If your bank/issuer calls you then just politely decline the call and don't give them any information. Call them back on a number that is on your card or listed on their website.Thank you to all the people responding and adding to the conversation. You all had good information to give. My only hope is that in the future this leads to more people making the right move. If it doesn't feel right, hang up.

CryptoCurrency,"I upgraded my Crypto.com visa card, here's how it went.","I posted yesterday asking if it was possible to upgrade from a ruby card to a jade card on [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com).  I had several people respond with helpful information that gave me a little more confidence in the process. Here's what I learned and how the process went.

I originally deposited enough for the ruby card, this was just to dip my toes in and make sure everything was legit. Yea I know that's a lot to ""test the waters"" with but I wasn't that worried.  After depositing enough fiat, I selected card option on the bottom of the menu and then selected the ruby card.  After a few prompts and check boxes I had staked CRO and access to the ruby card.

After seeing how smooth the process was, and thinking on it a few days I decided to take the leap and get the Jade card, not only for the extra perks but also because I think crypto.com is going to be hanging around for a while and will only grow.

So I began the process of depositing more fiat into my crypto.com account.  This is where I began to question if I needed the full amount (4k$ worth) of unstaked CRO, or if my initial stake could be rolled over and fill the difference.  After seeing the reply's about how it will/should allow the original staked CRO to roller over I decided on only depositing what I needed to meet the minimum CRO + what I had staked.

The funds were available this morning. I clicked on:

Accounts

Crypto Wallet

CRO coin (which took me to a page showing the CRO I had staked separate from any extra CRO I had)

Under the CRO Stake option is an upgrade button.

You select which upgrade you want (the jade card in this instance)

It then takes you to a screen where it shows you how much more CRO you will need in order to upgrade.  So this answers one of my question, do I need fiat or CRO to upgrade. The answer is you need the CRO equivalent of the fiat needed to get to the next level card.

So if you have 500$ worth of CRO, you need to buy 3500$ worth of CRO first and then go through the process of upgrading.

After doing check boxes and agreements it said my card was in the process of upgrading and someone would contact me.  Several seconds later I received a message from in the Crypto.com app for confirmation.

That's it. I know this may seem like an easy thing to do but I spent a few hours trying to google the process just to make sure I wasn't screwing anything up, so hopefully this will help someone else who was as confused as I was.

A few notes:

There is a 50$ reissuing fee if you want another card sent to you. This is taken from your fiat account on Crypto.com app.

Shout out to the people who responded to my original post asking these questions!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Adding in some of the info from the comments below.

* ""When you upgrade your staking to next card level **YOU DO NOT** have to order a new card   You still get the higher tier benefits, save yourself the €50, buy more CRO or treat yourself"" u/HokkaidoNights
* ""You have to physically upgrade to Jade in order to get the airport lounge access"" u/SineLinguist
* For each staking level you use the Fiat? Where does the money come from when you use the card. That staked fiat. Or am I wrong and it is the initial fiat amount converted to cro. u/timburgessthis
   * Original fiat comes from you. For your original stake you only need fiat and they will stake it for you. To upgrade you have to buy the CRO and then use that to upgrade
*  When you lock in for the card it shows in your wallet and has the interest rate and terms showing there. When you lock in for the Earn, it shows in the Earn account and only pays 6% regardless of if you have the Visa or not. You only get the 10-12% interest rate on the CRO you staked for the Visa."" u/tanukiparts

CryptoCurrency,Over 60% of investors borrow money to fund highly volatile cryptocurrency purchases,"In a recent [study by KIS Finance](https://www.kisbridgingloans.co.uk/finance-news/cryptocurrency-consumer-research-and-data-autumn-2021/), it was revealed that over two thirds of cryptocurrency investors borrowed money to make their purchase, rather than using income and/or savings.  


Overall, more than two thirds (64%) of those who have invested in cryptos, used one or more credit facilities to do so.  


Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and a risky way to invest large sums of money. Bitcoin, for example, has been in the news in recent weeks as it reached a value of over $64,000 (approx.. £47,800). This would have undoubtedly brought in new investors as they try to take advantage of the price increase. However, in just seven days, the value has dropped by over $7,000 (approx. £5,200) to a value of just over $56,000 (approx. £41,800) per coin.  


Percentage of crypto investors who used one or more credit facilities to fund purchase, by age  


18 - 24: 70%  
25 - 34: 64%  
35 - 44: 68.9%  
45 - 54: 62.5%  
55 - 64: 45%  
65+: 25%  


As the data shows, those aged between 18 and 24 were the age group most likely to use borrowed funds to make their investment, with a significant drop of borrowers in the two highest age groups.  


What type of credit facilities have people used to fund cryptocurrency investments?  


When we break down what kinds of credit facilities people have used to purchase cryptocurrencies, over a third (35.5%) made their investment using a credit card. Almost a fifth (19.3%) funded the purchase out of their overdraft.  


Credit card: 35.5%  
Overdraft: 19.3%  
Personal loan: 14.6%  
Secured loan: 9%  
Payday loan: 7.6%  
Re-mortgage: 3.3%  


Holly Andrews, Managing Director at [KIS Finance](https://www.kisbridgingloans.co.uk/), comments on the findings.  


“In recent years, cryptocurrencies have become far more mainstream with tech giant PayPal now offering a cryptocurrency trading platform.  


Although cryptos, and specifically Bitcoin, have seen people make thousands or even millions in profit; the last week or so has shown that they are incredibly volatile and can see investors losing massive percentages of what they put in very quickly.  


It’s concerning that so many people have turned to borrowed funds to purchase cryptocurrencies as they are extremely unpredictable and offer no guarantees that the money invested will be returned. So, if people are spending money that they don’t have, and losing it, this could cause some serious financial challenges later down the line.  


The biggest concern is whether people will have the ability to pay the money back. With a very strong possibility of losing the money for good, people may be left severely out of pocket and racking up interest on their credit cards and overdrafts. Also, some credit card providers will view this type of transaction as a cash advance, meaning a cash advance fee and higher interest rate will be applied.  


So, if you are thinking of making an investment into cryptocurrencies, you should only invest an amount of money that you can afford to lose and it should be funded through income and/or savings rather than a credit facility.  


Borrowing money to invest in cryptos can become a very vicious cycle that’s difficult to break. Once you start losing money, it can be very tempting to invest more to make the money back; especially if you don’t have other means of repaying the funds.  


Great care should be taken when you invest money anywhere, but especially when it’s something as volatile as cryptocurrencies. If you can, seek some professional financial advice first and never invest more than you can afford. Buying cryptocurrencies should also not be your only form of investment or savings as there is very little stability – spread your investments out and treat cryptocurrencies as a smaller, fun investment.”",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I'm leery of making larger contributions to a Roth IRA; is that a mistake?,"I'm in my early 30s. I recently set up a Roth IRA and have been making small weekly contributions to it, nowhere near the $6,000 annual limit. I have been shifting some savings from a HYSA into I bonds and also rounding up mortgage payments with principal prepayments, reasoning that it's like putting money into a 30-year CD that yields 3% (we bought our first house a few months ago with a 3% interest rate). My understanding is that the stock market is insanely overvalued, fueled by the very unique circumstances of the last 1.5 years, an explosion in retail investing and reckless speculation. I can't get over the feeling that a huge crash is due any day now, and the Federal Reserve is basically out of ammunition to do anything about it. I understand the logic that over a multi-decade time frame, stock market investments are supposed to pay off no matter what given the recoveries from the last two crashes, but it took roughly 25 years to recover from the 1929 crash.

MachineLearning,[D] Deviation analysis between two 3D meshes?,"Hi folks! Looking for some guidance / places to start researching.

I'm playing around with metal additive manufacturing using metal/polymer filament. Basically, you 3D print a model using the filament, debind the part (i.e. slowly burn out the plastic component) then raise the furnace up to sintering temperatures.  The remaining metal particles sinter and bind together, giving you a metal component.

These components suffer fairly severe shrinkage during the debinding and sintering process, anywhere from 10-20%.  Globally pre-scaling the part will get you close to desired dimensions, but individual features on the component can shrink more or less than expected. E.g. long, thin features shrink or warp more than thick features, holes and infill can affect surrounding areas, presence or absence of supports, etc etc.

I'd like to explore some ML techniques to scale the model more intelligently. I'm not sure the best way to turn this into a tractable problem though.

1. Print, debind, sinter part
2. 3D scan the resulting part
3. Convert the original model and 3D scan into something that can be fed to a network... 2D depth maps from multiple angles? Or perhaps do a deviation analysis between the two meshes first and convert that into some kind of 2D representation? Slice the scan and compare each slice against the model?
4. Get result and iterate with the next version
   1. In reality, I'll probably print/sinter multiple models at the same time in a batch format to help speed things up

Does this sound even remotely feasible? My main stumbling block is getting the 3D data into something usable, I'm not sure how this is typically handled. I assumed it would be better to translate into something 2D instead of dealing with meshes or point clouds, but perhaps that's incorrect?

I'm also assuming some kind of deep learning is the right approach here, but happy to investigate something else (including non-NN techniques!)

Happy for any tips, ideas, papers, techniques, etc to start researching. Thanks!",technology

personalfinance,What to do with personal loan funds (and avoid needing another one),"Long story short, I wracked up a lot of credit card debt. I took out a personal loan to pay it all off at a more manageable rate.

I've paid off all of my debt with interest rates (minus student loans), and I have $3000 left. I'm trying to figure out what to do with this money to best set myself up to avoid falling back into debt in the future.

I have a lot of medical expenses that can't be avoided, but they also can't necessarily be predicted beyond the baseline of about $200/month (after insurance).  I'm planning to max out my FSA contributions in 2022 now that I have more breathing room, but I have a few expenses coming  through the end of this year but I can't figure out the amounts.

Here are the remaining debts:- Credit card still in the 0% APR period for 18 months - $1800

\-  Medical debt in payment plan - \~2000, pay $50/month but there's no interest on it

\- Personal loan (that I just took out) $18,000, payments are $391/month, interest rate is \~11% APR, 60 month term. (no penalties for fees for early payoff)

So what I'm trying to decide is what to do with the rest of this money to set myself up best to avoid needing to take out another personal loan (and hopefully pay off the loan a bit early, but not my #1 priority).

**Here are the options I'm seeing:**

1. **Pay off the last credit card, keep the remaining $1200 for medical expenses, use anything that remains as a cushion in case I go over budget to stop relying on credit cards, keep in savings account**
2. **Pay off the last credit card, pay the rest toward the loan, the 0% balance becomes my cushion**
3. **Keep all $3000 for medical expenses , use anything that remains as a cushion. Put what remains into savings, safe investments, pay off the credit card monthly at a rate to not get charged interest**
4. **Pay it all toward the loan, pay off the credit card monthly at a rate to not get charged interest, pay off medical expenses as they come and dip into emergency fund if needed**

**A quick sketch of my monthly budget so you can see what numbers I'm working with:**

Take home pay: $3800

Rent: $1900 (I live in New York City)

Other, non debt bills: $200

Savings: $100 (want to up this)

Medical costs: at least 200

Loan payment: $400

Medical payment plan $50

Food: $600 (approx have certain dietary needs but working on getting it down)

Pet expenses: $50

**Starting next year I'll also have:**

Student loans $200 (in IBR, and doesn't help me to pay more, so not included in debts)

Metro card 127-139 (I've been working from home) - pre tax

Medical costs will be set at 218 pretax (max FSA contribution, hoping I'll break even or stay below)

Also want to increase my 401k contribution if I have the breathing room.

So in addition to what I should do with the remaining loans, wondering if anyone has any insight in what I should be doing with my additional money freed up by the loan to avoid getting back into credit card debt. As a secondary goal, I'd like to rebuild my credit score. It already took a massive hit from the loan.

I also have some savings:

Emergency fund: \~2500 (right now, add 40/month)

Long term savings: 500 (right now, add 30/month)

Fun fund (vacations etc): 217 (right now add 30/month)

solar,Residential system pricing gut check,"I'm working towards getting solar installed at my house.  I got a two referrals from people I work with on companies that these peers of mine worked with.  I cant quite determine if the pricing I'm being quoted is competitive with what others are getting or not.  I see the \~$2.75/Watt pricing (or sometimes lower) mentioned on this sub, and my sense is that this figure is closer to what others are paying before federal/state credits which has me concerned that this pricing is a rip off.  The two quotes i got were &gt;$4.20/Watt before tax credits.  In both cases I said I'd finance the system.  It seems like a pretty simple install.  Its a single story, flat roof.

Is this pricing a bit high or reasonable?  Here's the two quotes:

  

Installer #1 - Local reputable brand, no subcontractors.

System Price $21,054

Federal Tax credit (26%) $5,474

state Tax credit (10%) $2,105

Watts 4840

$/Watt $4.35

Price after credits $13,475

$/Watt after credits $2.78

state Tax credit (10%) $2,342

Watts 4880

$/Watt $4.80

Price after credits $14,993

$/Watt after credits $3.07

retirement,Investment question here because of heavy Retirement influence,"I'm turning 65.  Six months ago, I put my 401(k) money into inflation protected bond funds (BPRIX and CDSIX).  This money has gone up almost 4% in six months while the market has done, well better.  These funds are now under pressure with the increase in interest rates.  My other funds are fully invested in stock funds, mostly CEF's and tech equities.  I have benefited from the run up on about 1/2 my money, but the money in the 401(k) missed the run-up.  

I am old school and conservative politically and I'm convinced the QE, Stimulus, etc. are going to backfire on the country.  My problem is that right now it's all good for the market as badly as that turns my stomach....  My gut looks long term and affects my decisions short term.

My FA likes closed end mutual funds and thinks I should be fully invested in them from the get go.  In retrospect, he was right so far.  My mindset is that as soon as I get back in, I'll get burned.  That's my mindset and my problem.  Had I invested in equity funds at the time I went into bond funds I would have entered at $33,500, $4,097 and $13,829.

CryptoCurrency,Another Experience that Shows Banks are Horrible,"Not exactly crypto related as I’m not sure where else I can rant about this, but this further shows that banks are horrible.

So my parents have a mortgage on their house they bought at a fixed interest rate of about 5% with a big bank in my country which they have been paying off for years.

As interest rates have been really low lately, at the start of the year they tried to refinance the loan, where the current bank will discharge the loan for a fee and another lender take up the loan, to secure a better interest rate.

However the current bank after trying to refinance for about 5 months, still haven’t discharge the loan, which means my parents unfortunately are stuck paying the unnecessary high interest mortgage. Any attempts to contact them are fruitless as they can’t seem to reach the proper person to move the process forward.

This whole process is just infuriating as my parents could’ve saved thousands if the loan was refinanced a few months ago. So apparently it is okay for banks to be slow in their process when it’s beneficial to them, but when we customers are late for anything, we get slapped with ridiculous fees.

cardano,Cardano has a fair distribution of ADA coins,"## Decentralization at team level vs. protocol

Distributed networks and decentralization are concepts much older than Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto proved that it was possible to create decentralized value that people could own, share and transfer without a middleman. In doing so, he laid the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency industry, or if you prefer, blockchain networks. Every public blockchain network needs native coins to enable decentralization itself. Coins may play a different role in each project, but they have one thing in common. It is necessary to ensure their fair distribution.

Imagine you want to start a new decentralized project. What do you need? First of all, someone has to define the goals or mission of the project and its basic parameters. Then, some research and analysis will take place. This is followed by protocol implementation and launch. For many projects, the launch is just the beginning. No protocol in the world can ever be said to be fully complete. On the contrary, each protocol continues to be worked on and developed by a team or community. That said, the most important thing any protocol has is a team. Maintenance, improvements, and new features are never-ending jobs. If the protocol works well, it will find its users. As the number of users grows, the amount and scope of work on the protocol naturally increase.

The team must be paid for their work on the protocol. Some entity or body manages the work on the project and must secure funding. Thus, if a new decentralized project is created, some of the coins usually stay with a foundation or team for protocol development.

Wait a minute. How come we’re talking about decentralization and some team is working on a protocol. Is this similar to, say, Microsoft working on the Windows operating system? There’s no way it should be. Every blockchain project should be open source. The IOG team working on Cardano has all the source code public and also all the scientific studies. Nothing is patented. Everything belongs to the community as much as to the team.

Decentralization at the team level is a difficult, if not impossible, thing. It is difficult to decentralize at this level because only a few people, often programmers, deal with a given protocol on a daily basis. Programming, networking, cryptography, and other things are too complex for ordinary people. There will always be a team behind the protocol. Even Bitcoin has a team. Satoshi Nakamoto abruptly left in silence but handed the project over to another programmer. The source code is on GitHub, people report bugs and the team fixes them and works on improvements. Trying to create governance where people understand the problems from the user side and express their opinion which is then implemented by the team is probably the best that can be achieved.

What is important to us is not control over the source code of the protocol, but control over the network consensus and funding of the development. The team delivers new versions of the protocol and the people are the ones who are motivated to keep the network running. This is where we finally get to the debate about project coins.

Decentralization at the network level is done via native coins. In the case of the Cardano protocol, ADA coins are used for this. This means that everyone who holds ADA coins is a so-called stakeholder. Such a person is actively involved in decentralization and network security. The way it works economically is that if there is demand for the coins, the coins have a market value. If a team or foundation also has coins, it has enough resources to develop the protocol. How does the team get to the coins? Either they keep a portion at the very beginning of the project launch, or they secure some stable income at the protocol level. Or some combination of both.

## How to fairly launch a new project?

How to start a new project to make coin distribution fair? Clearly, at the source code level, each team can set up exactly what they need at the beginning. Of course, changes can occur in the protocol at any later time, but this should only be in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the community. This allows the team to decide at the beginning how many coins to keep for themselves, for their advisors, or to sell to seed investors. A part of the coins will then be sold publicly. Of course, not all of the coins that will always exist will be sold. Most protocols release new coins into circulation for a defined period of time, or forever. It depends on the monetary policy of each project.

What is most important for a fair launch is a ratio between the coins that are sold to the public at launch and the coins that the team keeps. The team should strive to decentralize the protocol as much as possible. Thus, it cannot keep most of the coins for itself or for Venture Capital (VC). The team should only keep as much coin as is strictly necessary for the first years of the project’s development. After that, it should secure funding through the collection of transaction fees and some form of decentralized management. We deliberately do not want to define some precise boundary as to when a launch is fair and when it is not. However, we believe that the team should keep less than half of the coins that will be in circulation. The rest of the coins should be sold publicly. Why? As we said, coin owners have control over the network consensus. If the team keeps most of the coins, it will of course also keep control of the network itself. In that case, it is not a decentralized network.

The network must be trustworthy right from the start. Trust in the network should grow over time. The team must not be able to manipulate either the network or the price of coins on the open market. If the majority of people trust the community and, by extension, the network, they buy the project’s coins. The team must not be able to sell coins in bulk and thereby harm the community. The team should be transparent and publish the address where they keep the coins. This way the community can keep an eye on what is happening with the coins.

The team can keep the coins not only for development but also for other purposes. For example, as airdrops to get the coins out to the public. Also as rewards for those who do something useful for the ecosystem. The team can fund development from volunteers or third parties. However, everything should always be completely transparent and, most importantly, it must not come at the expense of decentralization.

Is Bitcoin the fairest startup project? It’s hard to say. Satoshi created Bitcoin before it launched, so he may have funded it himself. In the beginning, not many people knew about the project and Satoshi mined a high number of BTC coins himself. The problem is that today we don’t know if anyone has access to the coins. The fate of the coins is unclear and shrouded in the belief that Satoshi will not spend his coins.

Unfortunately, neither team probably has access to BTC coins. The funding of the Bitcoin project is not transparent. It would be better for Bitcoin if Satoshi gave the coins to the development team. If funding is not clear, teams may struggle to fund research and development. An organization may come in and subsidize only the development that is useful to them without any guarantee that it will also be useful to users. Bitcoin is said to change only slowly. This narrative can mask the fact that there is no funding for development. Development can only be afforded by developers who themselves own large amounts of BTC coins from the beginning of the era. Decentralization at the source code level is a difficult thing to tackle and the only way out is to strive for maximum transparency.

Bitcoin is fair in the sense that every single coin must be mined. No one could decide at the beginning to keep some of the coins for some use. That’s certainly a nice thing. However, this approach is not possible today unless the project is to be a copy of an existing project. Today, the financing of the team must be taken into account in advance. This is the only way to fund new developments that move the whole industry forward. So the team is essentially doing the best they can. They offer their vision and then implement it.

Digital coins only ever have the market value that people assign to them. The demand for coins reflects the quality of the project. People can judge the team, the partnership, the quality of decentralization, the security, the network capabilities, and many other things. In the beginning, only the vision may be available. In the cryptocurrency world, the quality of projects does not correspond to market capitalization. Some projects are overvalued, others undervalued. That’s okay because people can’t make good estimates of the potential of disruptive technologies.

The demand for coins is what will make it possible to fund development. People buy coins and thus give them value. Thus, the coins that are held by the team themselves also have value. The coin holders can be said to support the development of the project.

As we have already indicated, a rogue team can sell the coins, grab the money and disappear forever. People need to be aware of this risk before they buy coins. The longer a project exists and delivers promised features, the more likely it is to stay relevant. Of course, it’s not just about creating the technology but seeking its adoption. A plan to create a strong community and real adoption must be part of the project. Neither community nor adoption can be bought. Both have to be worked on for the long term.

Cardano has been around since 2015. ADA coins entered the open market in 2017. The team has delivered a working PoS that has been running for over a year at the time of writing. Cardano also has smart contracts. So the team is gradually delivering on everything they promised and doing everything they can to make the development as transparent as possible. Anyone who is interested can follow the development in detail. Cardano definitely has one of the strongest communities in the cryptocurrency space. This is also a guarantee that the project is relevant and not going anywhere.

So how do you fairly launch a new blockchain project? It is fair to keep a reasonable amount of coins for the development of the project. However, most of the coins should be sold to the community on the open market. Subsequently, the team should be as transparent as possible about the disposition of its coins and development. It can be suspicious if the team does not communicate with the argument that they are trying to decentralize the project. The project should be as decentralized as possible at the network level and transparent at the development level.

Note that team members can buy their own coins at the public sale. But that’s very different from keeping them when you launch a project and then selling them. If they buy them like everyone else, they have to invest their own money in them. So they have skin in the game.

## Cardano project coin distribution

The distribution of ADA coin vouchers took place in Asia in four stages between October 2015 and the start of January 2017. The team wanted to avoid potential future problems, so they followed the Know Your Customer guidelines. It was for the first time in the cryptocurrency space. Moreover, an audit was performed on the distribution process.

25,927,070,538 ADA coins were sold to the public. In addition, the Genesis block distributed coins to 3 entities: Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG (IOHK). Cardano Foundation received 648,176,761 ADA, Emurgo received 2,074,165,644 ADA, and IOG received 2,463,071,701 ADA.

The sale made 108,844.5 BTC. Over 8,000 BTC was donated to the Cardano Foundation.

At project start, a total of 31,112,484,646 ADA was distributed. Since the launch of the PoS, new ADA coins have been gradually released into circulation. A further 13,887,515,354 ADA coins will gradually enter circulation until the maximum of 45,000,000,000 ADA coins is reached.

Was the launch of the Cardano project fair? Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG kept 20% of the ADA coins that were in circulation at launch. So 80% of the ADA coins were sold to the public. The network is 80% controlled by the public. Moreover, IOG does not operate its own staking pools. The team has plenty of funding for research and development. 

# What is the distribution of coins in other projects?

An interesting review was recently done by the Messari team. Cardano is one of the champions when it comes to fair coin distribution at launch. Many similar projects have publicly sold a relatively small amount of coins and the teams are still the majority owners of the projects.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jky51ri6od181.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fcbe73c37b0419ecf59314be5b224681bc63f53

 

Each project has its own coin release strategy and its own reasons for retaining control of the network. The reasons can be quite pragmatic. As long as the team has control of the network, it cannot happen that the network is attacked by a 51% attack from the outside. The team can wait to sell the coins until it is sure that the coins will be distributed fairly among the people.

The distribution of coins will be lowest at the beginning and will increase over time. The opposite would be strange. If coins are used to distribute decision-making power, as in PoS networks, it is important that the number of coin holders grows. Ideally, there should not be many influential whales in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, no system can do without entities that hold large numbers of coins. It doesn’t matter if they got the coins cheaply at the beginning or later. Anyone with enough money can become a whale in any ecosystem.

It is in the interest of the projects to spontaneously increase the number of coin holders. This is easier if the coins are in circulation from the start. It is likely that the whales will gradually sell their coins to newcomers. The value of the coins may fluctuate or even decline if the whales sell and there is no demand for the coins. It is always a good idea to look at the rich list to track the distribution of coins over time.

If a team holds, say, 80% of the coins and decides to sell a larger share, it is clear that the value of the remaining 20% of coins in circulation can drop dramatically. It is important to remember that the decision to sell is made by a single entity and one that knows exactly where the project stands.

In Cardano’s case, stakeholders hold the coins for the most part, so they directly determine the value of ADA coins with their next purchase or sale. Importantly, the team, by the number of coins they hold, may not materially affect the value of the coins by their eventual sale. Moreover, if the team did so and moved the coins from their publicly available address, others would notice.

## Coins and decentralization

Satoshi’s plan was that anyone could mine BTC coins. In the beginning, all you had to do was let your computer mine and after a while, you received a reward. This is an important principle. The opportunity to earn coins for doing important work for the network should be open to everyone as much as possible. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case with Bitcoin, as the cost of entry has increased and the environment is too competitive for everyone to succeed. PoW mining favors powerful entities more than domestic miners. As a result, interested parties have to buy BTC coins on the open market. Unfortunately, this does not decentralize the network, it only increases the price of coins. This increases the security budget, which is also important.

Cardano uses PoS in such a way that decentralization grows with the distribution of coins. Everyone likes to get rewards from staking, so you can basically earn coins in a very similar way to PoW mining. By holding and delegating coins to a pool for the network you are doing useful work. The coins in the staking are not available on the market, so this stabilizes their market value, which tends to rise. The growth in value of ADA coins sells 51% of the attack. Importantly, there is almost no entry cost. You just have to buy the coins. Anyone can do this according to their financial capabilities and preferences. No one is disadvantaged based on their location.

Almost no one knew about Bitcoin in the beginning, so maybe no one thought to invest in an attack. The network had little economic or social impact. Now it’s different. Hackers are trying to attack every old and new network and make money from it. So a newly launched project has to be secure and economically hard to attack right from the start. When Cardano switched to PoS consensus, the coin distribution and market value were such that it was a safe move. There was a huge interest in running pools and staking, and that interest continues to this day. So the decentralization and security of the project are growing. This naturally also increases the confidence of newcomers in the project.

PoW networks are not decentralized based on the number of coin holders. The coin distribution is only interesting from the perspective of being able to influence the value through large sales. Furthermore, the meaning of the coins themselves must be taken into account. For some projects, growth in the number of coin holders is more important than for other projects.

The current development of many projects is that coins can serve as a governance tool. This makes sense, as who else but the users themselves should be able to make requests and express their opinion on the team. The team should not be the one doing whatever it wants at a certain stage of the project. On the contrary, it should be an entity that is driven from the outside by the community. Getting to this state is extremely difficult, and fair coin distribution is an essential prerequisite. If the team holds the majority of the coins, it can make decisions on critical issues on its own.

The topic of decentralized project management is still in its infancy and not much is said about it. It is clear that the team needs to deliver some basic protocol functionality at the beginning and there is no point in talking too much about it. However, after some time the will of the community should have more strength. The team or community should propose changes and vote on them. The team will be in the role of executor of the will of the majority. As we said, decentralization at the team level is difficult, but that doesn’t mean that teams won’t pursue it. The use of coins seems logical.

## Conclusion

In the cryptocurrency space, you sometimes hear the opinion that it is impossible to fairly launch a new decentralized project. Many of these arguments don’t make sense, and if you want to be critical, you will find problems with any project, including Bitcoin. Satoshi is not the only one who is a BTC whale. There may be more similar entities and their coins will be slow to enter circulation. Every project launch rewards those at the very beginning the most. Unfortunately, there’s not much we can do about that. In the real world, it’s exactly the same. But let’s not make an idol of one project and say that something can’t be done again.

Cardano has had a fair coin distribution from the very beginning. Staking works on the basis of being able to buy ADA coins on the open market. You can’t earn coins incrementally as you can with PoW networks. First, you have to have coins, then you can earn more as a reward. Buying ADA coins is your skin in the game. The coin distribution is dependent on network consensus, and the IOG team probably did it the best they could at the time.

Cardano’s network is under stakeholder control and the team has minimal influence on the consensus. This cannot be said of other projects in many cases. Always be interested in how much control the team has over the coins. If it is high, consider well what that means for you. Venture Capital won’t like Cardano because the community already owns it. Those who want a stake need to buy ADA coins on the open market. Fair enough.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Credit Building For Buying a House,"I will try to add all of the relevant information here but please feel free to ask if I left something important out.


I am currently in the process of trying to buy a house. After talking with a Lender we ran my credit and determined that it is currently at a score of 603 mostly due to lack of credit history. I am 29 years old and had a car loan in the past that i fully paid off as well as 1 I have had for a year that I am currently paying off. beyond that I never got credit cards really. 

My lender wants me to spend the next few months building my credit so that I can qualify for a first time homebuyer grant to help with the purchase cost. to do this he suggested getting 2 credit cards that I can use and pay off in full monthly. he suggested going to local store cards as they don't have yearly fees, are easy to get accepted for, and the high interest rate won't be a problem with how I plan to use them.

My question for you all is this: Is this good advice? or is there a different kind of card I should be applying for? if it is good advice, is there a few cards I should really be looking at?

Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated",finance
investing,And gold is down again.. what is your outlook?,"Gold price was doing fairly nicely in recent weeks, but apperently the ""news"" that Powell will stay as Fed chair is enough to send gold down again 2% yesterday and another 1,3% today as it stands.

Those who have followed the overall gold price curve will probably have noticed it always reaches a certain top to than fall down again.

What is your outlook on the gold price for the coming months and next year?

Wednesday new **PCE inflation data** will be released and we all know it will be hot, but high inflation seems to just scare gold instead of bolstering it, since most seem to derive from it that the Fed will tighten more rapidly.

I think however Fed will stick to its ""inflation is transitory"" narrative and won't speed up its bond tapering, let alone raise interest rates any time soon to avoid spooking the market.

Final point.. for those who want to bring up **bitcoin**, I just want to say that bitcoin and gold are not correlated in any way. Money is not flowing from gold into bitcoin. As example, in past days BTC was also down together with gold. BTC is more related to risk-on mentality like equities than it is with gold.

So how do you see gold evolve coming months and next year and why? Thanks in advance for all good feedback on this.

**Edit: does anybody know when will be the next time Powell will speak again and will this be before the december 15th FOMC meeting? His comments on the speed of QE tapering could have a big impact on the markets and gold.**",finance

2) Post-COVID growth not strong

3) Interest rate rising

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

* Central Banks are printing more money than we ever thought was possible which is inflating asset prices into ‘pseudo bubbles’
* At the same time, COVID has accelerated the adoption of 10 or so technologies which are all growing at an exponential rate
* When you change the denominator into the FED balance sheet, none of these technologies seem to be in a bubble, but instead the dollar has significantly lost value
* The dollar falling in value and technologies gaining network effects suggests that the price valuations will continue to grow exponentially over the coming decade

personalfinance,Where to keep “emergency funds?”,"So the conventional, yet difficult to attain wisdom is to keep 6mo expenses in a savings account in the event of an emergency. With inflation creeping up and savings accounts still offering I’d-rather-stuff-my-cash-in-my-mattress interest rates this strikes me as incredibly dumb because that savings becomes less valuable at a noticeable clip. So where do you put it? If it’s for emergencies that rules out things like CDs or vehicles that lock up the money for a predetermined period of time and the yield on those isn’t beating our 6% inflation rate either. But putting it in stocks means it can take a couple weeks to see it if you need to sell and withdraw plus theres the possible loss in the event of a market correction. Are there any liquid, low risk (or insured) higher yielding places to put emergency funds?

My personal situation is: While I don’t have 6mo saved in cash I do have a few thousand saved. (Cars, credit cards paid off, good 401ks, fairly stable jobs, we been pretty financially conservative) I just think that RIGHT NOW holding cash may be one of the dumbest things you can do and it may get dumber.",finance

CryptoCurrency,I don’t understand this subs core belief of not talking crypto with close family and friends.,"If you’re making money why wouldn’t you want your friends and family to also?

It literally takes 5 minutes to slap a disclaimer that this is super risky and to realize that any money you put into crypto you can lose.

Once you give them the risks, it’s no longer your fault if they jump in and go against your advice and lose everything on DOGE.

Meanwhile, if you actually teach them how to DCA into blue chip cryptos, you can save your family and friends from a future of inflation eating away at their hard earned money.

You want to know what looks bad? When you secretly get rich, while the people you love around you are struggling. That’s selfish. 

In almost every other form of a investment class, people love to talk about their investments. Stocks, commodities or even private businesses. This is especially the case in real estate. Investors are constantly networking and even go into ventures where they take on loads of debt from high interest loans with friends/family to purchase and renovate properties.

I don’t understand how it’s normal to discuss taking on a high 6 figure value mortgage with a high interest rate for a fix and flip/rental property with family and friends, but we can’t discuss the benefits and risks of buying crypto with only money that they are okay with losing.

We should be preaching about how we can smartly teach people about crypto. We shouldn’t be advocating that we don’t do it altogether.

Edit: Based off of the initial responses, it seems like root of the issue is either poor quality relationships with friends or family. 

Or an inability to actually inform people on crypto without shilling coins to people.",cryptocurrency

A 26% Federal tax credit effectively reduces that by about $8500, and rebates from my electric utility will pay back another $4000 over about five years.

I have enough in savings and investments to pay cash, or I can finance it through the installer at 0.99% (10 years), 1.49% (15 years) or 1.99% (20 or 25 years) ... but financing it adds an outrageous 36% to the up-front cost, bringing the project total to almost $45k.

Normally I'd say no way to a 36% price premium just for financing, but that charge also qualifies for the Federal tax credit so it's effectively more like 27%. That's still outrageous ... except with inflation being what it is and the loan interest rates being below 2%, I'm a big fan of using other people's money now and paying them back over a few decades. 

I ran the numbers and if I'm doing my math correctly, assuming 3.5% inflation in the upcoming decades, NPV for borrowing $44,624 at 0.99% for 10 years is $39,163; NPV for borrowing $44,624 at 1.49% over 15 years is $37,040; NPV for borrowing $44.624 at 1.99% over 20 years is $35,110 and NPV for borrowing $44,624 at 1.99% over 25 years is $33,353.

I bought a home a little over a year ago and it has appreciated at least 30-40k in value (maybe more). Homes selling on my street are selling for over 100k more than I bought my house for, but mine is definitely not as updated as they are. 

I currently rent out 3 rooms in my house and live for basically $50 a month. 

I also have about 20k in CC/student loan debt that have accrued over the last few years. ** edit - I'm already putting between $700-900 towards the debt, which would have been my housing expense**

**The long term goals:**

- Pay off all debt

- Own multiple houses for long term rentals

Would it make sense to go through the process of a HELOC to pay off my debt, and potentially use whatever remaining cash I have to either fix up my house, or purchase another house that I would live in (house hack)? 

In my head, I see that paying off my CC debt specifically with the HELOC would lower my interest rate on that debt. Which is great. Would that still leave me with a high Debt to Income ratio, leaving my credit score not impacted at all? Current credit score is around the high 600's currently.

I see potential for crypto to reverse the trend of power moving from places like Ohio to places like Silicon Valley by creating economic freedom for middle America.,"I’m Morgan Harper, candidate for the United States Senate for Ohio. I am a consumer protection attorney and community organizer from Columbus. My politics is pretty straight forward: I fight corporate power to create economic freedom for everyone. To prove that, I don’t take corporate PAC money. My interest in crypto started back in 2011 as a Senior Advisor at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (founded by Elizabeth Warren) when pioneers in the industry where presenting the technology to us. I didn't take seriously then but I've started to really explore its potential to create economic power for people in places like Ohio.

I recently posted two threads on crypto you can see here:

1. [https://twitter.com/mh4oh/status/1458064822772375565?s=20](https://twitter.com/mh4oh/status/1458064822772375565?s=20)

My full bio is below.

I was born at The Ohio State University Hospital to a teenager who couldn’t raise me. I lived in a foster home just north of Columbus before being adopted and raised by a Columbus Public Schools teacher who had immigrated to Ohio from Trinidad. My mother, a single-mom, raised me and my brother while going through a bitter divorce that always had us on edge emotionally and financially. But my mother had a stable union job and so whatever energy she had left, she poured it into my education. I got scholarships to attend Columbus Academy and graduated from Tufts, Princeton and Stanford Law School. I then went to work in Washington under the Obama Administration and became a Senior Advisor at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While I was there I went after big banks that were ripping off working people. We sued companies like Wells Fargo for opening fake bank accounts in their customers’ names. 

In 2020 I ran for U.S.Congress and although we didn’t win (fuck Covid), we used the grassroots momentum to launch Columbus Stand Up! a community organization that mobilized volunteers across Central Ohio to go door-to-door to distribute 30K masks and drive hundreds of vulnerable people to their vaccine appointments. 

While we did great work there one thing continued to stick with me. We know what it would take to protect communities from falling behind. We don’t have an ideas problem. We don’t have a policy problem. **We have a politician problem**.

Only two democrats have won statewide in Ohio in the last two decades at the federal level, Barack Obama (2x) and Sherrod Brown. Only way to win Ohio is to turn out 15% of the Black vote. That won’t happen running a Terry McAuliffe type Democrat in Ohio. That’s why I’m running - to win and put the power of our people at the center of our government. 

Looking forward to the discussion.",cryptocurrency

# Insight

The futures expiration on Nov 25 still looms over the market, but risk has been noticeably reduced as derivative positions are significantly more balanced than a few days ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nfadfk2bwf181.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae1cd1280ed66ca560a4dde9df09b2800a4034a4

If you compare [Friday’s report](https://medium.com/@TraderGabi/when-can-we-start-buying-again-c3ffc2a1cd3b) with the numbers above, there have been a large increase in PUT (short) positions in options. The recent dip has injected fear into the market and leveraged investors are beginning to balance out their one-sided long positions. Overall leverage is very high in the derivatives space, but that could be due to the large amount of institutional money. MAX PAIN continues to be 57k in Bitcoin, and one would expect price to stay relatively close to this price through Friday’s futures expiration. Opening positions near 56k continues to be efficient in accordance to examined metrics. [Friday’s report goes into depth about these metrics](https://medium.com/@TraderGabi/when-can-we-start-buying-again-c3ffc2a1cd3b). It’s highlighted that the Fear and Greed Index is at 33, which is near optimal for buying pullbacks. 

Signs that the bull market will continue are very strong, as some altcoins (alts) in the space refuse to wait until Friday. SAND +78%, CRO +86%, EGLD 53%. Alts are being led by Play-to-Earn games and Metaverse tokens. Play-to-Earn as an overall category is up 54% today. Games and Metaverse tokens showed a lot of strength during the overall market slide in May and August. They are less affected by recent market conditions. Expect this trend to continue as wider adoptions continue. Owning P2E or Metaverse tokens could aid in diversifying risk in a portfolio. 

**Strong Buys During the Dip**

The following tokens dipped in the recent sell-offs and show strong signs of rebounding quickly. This metric is based off volume, price action, and overall project rating. These projects have a strong case for growth in the long-term.

Take size into consideration when investing in the different levels. Low Risk/Reward can be the largest proportion in a portfolio and High Risk/Reward should be the smallest portion, as these are extremely volatile positions that can lose up to 90-95% if the market has a complete sell-off. Always use stop-losses on any position opened in this later stage of a bull market.

# NOOBIES lessons of day: History of Bitcoin pt.1

Where did Bitcoin originate 

The ideas surrounding Bitcoin have been around since Cypherpunks in the late 1980s discussed creating a cryptograpthic currency that could not be altered or traced. This community advocated using technology as a route to social and political change and improvement. 

Originally, cryptography was practiced only by the military and spy agencies until about the 1970s when the US government published the Data Encryption Standard (DES). A cryptograpth named David Chaum is credited with being the father of the cypherpunk movement with the publication of “Security with Identification: Transaction System to Make Big Brother Obsolete” (1985). Without going too far into cypherpunk history, we move on to Bitcoin. [If you would like to learn more about cypherpunks press here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk). 

Birth of Bitcoin 

On August 18, 2008, the domain name of bitcoin.org was registered, and on October 31st, that year a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” was posted on the website and cryptography mailed to those interested. The publication described a “system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.” This is considered the Bitcoin Whitepaper. [This whitepaper is a recommended read for any person interested in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies in general](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/). Consider this your homework.  

On January 3, 2009, the bitcoin network was activated and the first block of bitcoin worth 50 bitcoins was rewarded. 

Tomorrow, I will introduce you to the father of bitcoin, the mythical figure of Satoshi Nakamoto.

personalfinance,First home loan suggestions,"Hello all, 

A little background information to help with the later questions so you can understand at what point of my life I'm at. I've recently gotten married and my wife and I are looking to purchase a home around next summer. We have decent income that falls within the qualifications of USDA loans, and the only debt we have are student loans at a decent interest rate. As of right now we are able to save roughly 40% of our income for a down payment. Our debt to income ratio will fall within the qualifications for all loans and we are looking to purchase a home that is affordable for us.

My questions now:

We will have roughly enough money for our down payment, however we will have very little left over for our emergency fund. What would be in your opinion the best route to take, and if you have done any of these loans.

1) Use our funds as a down payment and get a conventional 30 year mortgage. This will leave us very little left over and and very little left to make any changes to the property we are purchasing. This is a concern to me because we may find a house that isn't at our maximum spending amount, but needs some TLC to turn it into a place we can call home. If all out money is tied into the down payment that leaves us little to work with to remodel any areas that need immediate attention. 

2) Acquire a USDA loan for the full amount of the house. I understand there is fees and PMI associated with this. We could then use the funds to do any necessary repairs to the household, which ultimately will allow us to look at a wider range of household. The left over funds will be placed into our emergency, and we will most likely be able to drop our LTV below the 80% threshold within 12-24 months.

3) whatever loan suggestions you have with as much information as you are willing provide.

Please save any suggestions that are related to waiting to purchase a home, while ultimately I understand that paying off our student loans and having a 20% down payment would be ideal that is not the situation I am in currently. Please take your Dave Ramsey suggestions somewhere else. Thank you all",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my car and Are there any places you recommend to do so?,"I've been looking into refinancing my car but I am not sure if its a good idea. I currently pay almost 500 a month and have a interest rate of 19.22. My income is around the same still at 43,000 a year. I was a brand new driver and had almost no credit history when I got the original loan. Ive had this car for a year and a half and have never missed a payment, I haven't checked my credit recently but I believe it was around 670- 680 wish last time I looked. 

I dont have anyone around me who knows finances and the internet is full of mix options. My friend said I shouldn't do it since I have only had the car for a year and a half but I wanted to see what the strangers on reddit say. Also if you think I should are there any places you recommend to find a place to do so, there are so many and it's confusing.

personalfinance,How quickly should I pay HELOC?,"We are putting a screened in porch and doing a basement remodel.  For the screened in porch, we currently owe $27K.  The basement remodel will likely cost another $50K.  We have a HELOC from a credit union that charges 3.25% interest. I have a good amount of savings ($175K in a non-retirement vanguard account earning an average of 11% over the past 7 years) and a Blockfi account with $20K in it that is earning 9%.  I’m also well positioned for retirement so that isn’t a concern.  How aggressively should we pay off the HELOC given the stated interest rates?",finance
personalfinance,Where to save for home down payment with this high inflation,"Hey all,

I know this question gets asked a lot but times are weird now. My fiancé and I are saving for a down payment on a larger house. We currently have about $50,000 and are shooting to have about $200,000 within two years. Normally, I would keep this money in a savings account or CDs but with the low interest rates and high inflation, the value of that money is diminishing quicker than usual. 

Do I take the risk of investing in broad spectrum index funds and hope the market doesn’t take a dive in the next two years, or do I keep it in a low interest savings count and just deal with the inflation? 

Are bonds worth it at the moment? I’m told not to buy bonds when you expect interest rates to rise, which seems like it will happen in the next 2 years. 

Any other options I should be looking into?",finance

personalfinance,Am I saving enough at 31 years old to retire,"Background: I am 31 years old, I am a city worker, and I plan to work for them in the next 30 years. I plan to retire at 60 years old, and I make about $100k right now. I have been putting about 15% of my salary into my 401K (5% in tradition and 10% in roth) since 26. I do plan to max out the $18k a year into my 401k sometimes next year. I also pay into my work pension plan that will give me 2% returns of the 30 years times my highest salary at the time of retirement. With an additional 4 years of previous federal working experience, I estimated to have 68% returns of my highest salary as I retired. Lets assume I'll make around $160k at retirement. I also pay an additional $200 a month into additional annuity for my work retirement that has a guarantee of 7% returns a year. 

Currently, I have saved up to the to about $140k in my 401k account. I also I have about $10k of investing in stocks and mutual funds an estimated $250k of home equity.

I just want to ask if you guys think I am saving enough to have a comfortable life at retirement?",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance car loan?,I (21f) bought a prius july of 2020 and had an interest rate of 6.5% which i paid off in 8 months…ended up paying $300 in interest due to the high amounts of payments and frequency i was paying them. After i paid that car off me and P2 bought a camry with my credit since it’s better. we have about 15k left to pay off…payments are $290 a month so easy to make larger principal only payments. the interest rate is 4.8% but i’m trying to add larger payments and more frequently so we pay less in interest. I was wondering if it’s worth refinancing or if just continuing the higher payments and higher frequency if i should be good. my credit score is about 740 right now and not planning to buy a house until after this loan is paid in full and we have a bit more saved for a downpayment. thank you!,finance

Let's go...

Newly covered today:

1. It looks like we’re getting a block size increase and a plutus script memory increase on December 1, 2021. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/22/slow-and-steady-wins-the-race-network-evolution-for-network-growth/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/22/slow-and-steady-wins-the-race-network-evolution-for-network-growth/) [https://twitter.com/cardano\_whale/status/1463097104331468803](https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1463097104331468803)

3. Charles drops a video on the eToro delisting. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse.  It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything.  He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

CryptoCurrency,"Drop-in price, Modi's new bill.","The government has listed ***the cryptocurrency and regulation of official digital currency bill*** among 20 other (non-crypto related) bills to be introduced in the winter session of parliament (29 nov-23 dec). The bill will seek to prohibit all **'private cryptocurrencies'** but will provide certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology and its uses. The proposed bill will also put in place a framework for the Reserve bank of India (Feds) to create an official digital currency.  

Since the Modi government holds the majority of the parliament, the bill will pass with ease. 

Speculations: Recent government comments had raised investors’ hopes that the authorities might go easier on the booming market.  Instead, the bill would give holders of cryptocurrencies up to six months to liquidate, after which penalties will be levied, said the official, who asked not to be named as the contents of the bill are not public. 

The term private cryptocurrencies have also been speculated to be cryptos such as DASH, MONERO etc, and cryptos such as bitcoin and ethereum would not face the ban since these are public-blockchain based cryptocurrency.

personalfinance,Dumb idiot doesn't understand their mortgage works nor opportunity cost... Will you help this person throw away less money each year?,"Background Information:
I have just over 29 years left on my 30 year fixed rate mortgage after I refinanced at the beginning of the year.  My new interest seems fairly low at 2.75%.

Before I refinanced I was making extra payments to the principal every month.  However, with the new lower rate, I decided that I could make more money in the long run deploying that capital elsewhere.  So I have been putting it into my Fidelity account and made ~24% returns over the last year.  I know that % will go down over the next year or so, but would be quite surprised if I ended up doing worse than 5-6% annually.

Even that is at least double my 2.75% interest rate, so in my head, it makes sense to continue contributing the minimum monthly mortgage payment.  This has been my basic plan for a while, but I realized something that has me rethinking...

I checked my mortgage payment schedule over the next 29 years through the lender's site and was shocked how much interest vs principal I am paying for the next 5-10 years.  My current payments are maybe a 80/20 split.  Of course, this ratio will gradually switch and at year 28 I will be paying almost all principal.

Questions:
I don't think I will live in this home for the next 29 years before I sell it.  Because I'm currently paying mostly interest each month the majority of my payment doesn't provide me more equity as the bank gets a big chunk right?  So does my math comparing 2.75% to a minimum return of 5-6% elsewhere still make sense? Should I be paying down principal with that money instead?

Is there a minimum amount of time I should stay here before selling and does any of the above affect that?

Is there anything obvious I missed here?

Disclaimers:
Yes, I am actually investing the money that would go to extra payments (I'm surprised too).  I am already maxing out my 401K/Roth.

I know there is a big emotional component to all this, like chosing when to move.  I'm trying to understand the pure finance side of this right now.  If it helps give any advice, please pretend I am a cold unfeeling robot with no emotions and only logic.

personalfinance,Margin Loan Payback Strategy,"I'm about to take out a margin loan for some home renovations and would like some advice about what the optimal strategy for paying back the loan would be.

Let's say hypothetically I'm borrowing $200k from a $1M portfolio at a current margin rate of 2%. And let's say over the coming months, I'll have some cash flow that I can use to either pay down the loan or reinvest in an index fund. Under what circumstances should I use the cash flow to pay down the loan versus reinvest?

It seems to me it's mostly about the interest rate. If the interest rate rises to a certain level where the potential gains from investing + taxes aren't greater than the interest, then I should use the money to pay down the loan. Are there any other considerations for this? Hypothetically, if margin rates stay low for a long time, is the optimal strategy to never repay it and to just let interest accumulate assuming that the returns to investing are greater than that over the long term?",finance

While some think that Bitcoin is just a highly speculative asset, a group of strong believers termed “maximalists” project that Bitcoin will become a dominant global currency that overthrows the dollar one day. Though initially sceptical, researching this article took me down a rabbit-hole…

What is Bitcoin? Where does its value come from? Does it have the properties needed to make it a viable form of currency? Can it fuel a thriving economy? What are Bitcoin’s weak points? Which are its competitors? How will governments respond to its rise to power? Can Bitcoin become the new Gold Standard?

A brief history of money

Historians agree that humans invented money before they invented written language. Think about that. We were able to agree on how to exchange value before we were able to write down our thoughts. The origins of money are more fundamental to human nature than our desire to communicate, in a way.

Money served three purposes:

* A store of wealth across time. People could store today's effort for using it tomorrow.
* A medium of exchange, to procure things from others.
* A unit of account, to record credit-debit relationships.

Starting with the barter system, humans moved on to using common goods with intrinsic value (such as cows and bags of wheat) and then to units like cowrie shells, glass beads which were more convenient for accounting because of their **divisibility.** There was a problem with this system, though. You guessed it.

People who had access to the means of production of cowrie shells or glass beads could flood the market, *and the more money there was in the market, the less value it had.* This is what happened in Africa when glass beads merchants from Europe imported loads of glass beads and made them worthless as a form of money. (This could be one of the first recorded instances of **inflation**).

**Gold** was a solution to the cheap creation of money. Mining gold is a difficult task. Flooding the supply of money was difficult unless people took the effort to mine gold, for which they were compensated. But the quality of gold could always be debased and there was no way to check its authenticity.

Governments took on the responsibility of **controlling the supply** and **guaranteeing the validity** of money. This has always worked fine until it hasn't. As long as the government acts in a neutral capacity to do the best thing for the economy, there is no problem. But the people who are closest to the means of production of money - Kings, Central Bankers, Cabinet Members - also have the most incentive to confiscate a large share for themselves. Or they could follow a monetary policy that might make them look good in the short term while throwing the system into chaos in the long run. This can be seen in the case of the Fall of Rome and Constantinople, the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, the shift of the US and other countries away from the Gold standard \[1\], and the inflation that is looming over the US right now.

Looking at history, what would the perfect currency look like?

* **Convenient to handle.** It should be divisible, portable, safe to store, and easy to transact with. Units should be interchangeable (fungible).
* **Credible.** The validity of the money should be guaranteed in some way, either by its intrinsic value or by some mechanism such as the backing of a counterparty (like the Government).
* **Liquid.** It should be easy to find people who accept payment with it.
* **Secure.** If the money can be compromised, it cannot store wealth.
* **Inflation resistant.** It should be hard to create and resistant to control by small groups of people with vested interests.
* **Stable.** The value should not have significant volatility.

The most important requirement though is that people **adopt it** en masse. Money is a collective story that people believe in, a story that lets them exchange value with each other. If an ecosystem is built around this story, it gives the money more value, further strengthening people's beliefs.

**How does Bitcoin do on these grounds?** Let us start by understanding what Bitcoin is and why it is so different from existing forms of money.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a **decentralized** digital **cryptocurrency** that can be used for **peer-to-peer transactions** through a **distributed ledger.** Let's unpack that.

* **Bitcoin is decentralized.** There is no government, organization, or single authority that controls the policies of Bitcoin.
* **Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency** \- A form of digitized money whose units cannot be duplicated.
* **Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions** \- There is no reliance on a central banking system.
* **Bitcoin operates through a distributed ledger** \- A copy of every transaction ever made on the Bitcoin network is stored in all the nodes of the network! But because each transaction is anonymized, you can effectively check only your own transactions.

Bitcoin was invented in 2008 (in the throes of the housing crisis market crash) by a figure named Satoshi Nakamoto whose real identity is unknown. Satoshi open-sourced the code to Bitcoin after publishing a white paper about it, and as more people started adopting it, Satoshi vanished mysteriously.

https://preview.redd.it/nnpbdr6h8j181.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41f367db0a2fd213e829b8a37284fd75e8789fc0

To the layman, Bitcoin is currently just like any other stock or asset that you can exchange dollars for. To use Bitcoin, all that is needed is a wallet that gives the user a **public address** that others can transact with, and a **private key** that acts as a password. Bitcoin can be bought at **cryptocurrency exchanges** or mined (will be explained shortly). This is then stored in software or hardware wallets, and exchanged for products or services with other users. There is no central authority over Bitcoin.

Each Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million units called Satoshis for convenience.

Since 2008, Bitcoin has grown in leaps and bounds to become a dominant force in the market and people's imagination. But...

Where does Bitcoin get its value from?

We saw earlier that if it’s easy to make money, anybody can flood the market and destroy its value. This was also the reason for gold's adoption for minting coins because gold is very hard to produce (apart from being nice and shiny).

The government's ability to print massive amounts of money is the chief danger to modern forms of money. Imagine you have a million dollars and it’s worthless tomorrow because a bunch of people in the government thought it's alright to print another quadrillion dollars. That's the fear which drives people to invest in real estate, stocks, gold, and other commodities. **There is no alternative government-backed currency in circulation today that qualifies as ""hard money""**, whose supply is restricted.

That's one of Bitcoin's chief attractions. Bitcoin is *extremely hard to produce* and *has a cap on its supply*. Each block that needs to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain (distributed ledger) needs to be identified by a number that satisfies a mathematical property. \[2\] Bitcoins are produced by ""miners"" who try to find these numbers by running through millions of options in a brute-force manner. When miners hit upon a successful candidate, **they are rewarded in Bitcoins**. This is a highly energy-intensive process and the profit that the miners get is in the thin margin between electricity consumption and the value of the bitcoin.

https://preview.redd.it/1pced6gi8j181.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed333c93c9aff06f29350bd7654fb053ac15d83

The physical exchange of energy for bitcoin is similar to expending effort in mining gold. The second feature is that **there can be only 21 million Bitcoins in existence**, ever. This is a hard feature of its code that cannot be changed. \[3\] 20 million Bitcoin would be mined by 2025 (by current estimates). By 2140, all of the Bitcoin would be mined, and the incentive for miners will be in the form of transaction fees. As the supply of Bitcoin is finite, **it cannot be devalued by increasing the supply** making it inflation resistant by design.

There is no central authority for Bitcoin. The code is open-sourced, and if anybody wants to change it, it has to be with the consensus of all the nodes in the network. For example, when some security vulnerabilities were identified in Bitcoin in 2018, a fork (change in the code) was done to patch it which was accepted by all users as it was for their benefit \[4\]. But when **hard forks** (major changes) were done to create new currencies like Bitcoin Cash, the bulk of users chose to stay on the existing network, causing Bitcoin Cash's value to drop sharply. Hence, **Bitcoin's value is decided by the consensus of the network.**

The above points show that Bitcoin is ***convenient, inflation resistant, secure, and credible*** (its validity is backed by a mathematical function that is impossible to break or fake).

This tells us about the **perceived value** of Bitcoin, but if the aim of Bitcoin is to capture the existing market, it also needs to be:

1. Liquid and exchangeable with existing currencies
2. Fuel for a thriving economy
3. Stable

How does Bitcoin do on these fronts?

Liquidity

Let's be real here. Most people are interested in Bitcoin not because of its fascinating mathematical properties or promise of inflation resistance. It's because of the **“Number go up”** that every influencer is shouting about on Twitter as if it’s their personal achievement. That's the reason Bitcoin tends to get on the nerves of some people too: **How is it that believers of an imaginary concept with no “value” or “business” behind it are rewarded time and again without any effort?**

The misconception here is that Bitcoin is being compared with businesses on the stock market which grow with time because of their value proposition and execution. Bitcoin is better compared with gold whose value is dictated by **scarcity.** The problem is that, unlike gold which has intrinsic value, Bitcoin's value is entirely dependent on the faith that people have in **the story around it.**

The story around Bitcoin is this:

**“Bitcoin is the hardest form of money and will eventually replace all currencies.”**

People who adhere to this vision are called **Bitcoin Maximalists.** And in terms of the stories out there, Bitcoin is one of the fastest proliferating. It makes sense. When personal incentive is tied with a story, the FOMO kicks in of being penniless when Bitcoin takes over. The possibility of gain makes people buy into it in droves. **And as people buy into it, demand rises, and its price goes up further.**

**Bitcoin's strongest point is also its weakest. Decentralization.**

Though Bitcoin claims to be “decentralized”, that's only if Bitcoin becomes money in itself. To convert from dollar to Bitcoin, you still need **the presence of exchanges.** These exchanges are among the most loosely regulated financial entities in the world and the most vulnerable to government regulation. For example, Tether, which debuted as a *Stablecoin* (a cryptocurrency pegged to a commodity or government-backed currency) has repeatedly come under scrutiny for its shady accounting practices. \[5\] Tether also turned out to be owned by the same people who owned Bitfinex, a large cryptocurrency exchange. **It is one of the biggest intermediaries for Bitcoin to Dollar liquidity out there, and a collapse on that front due to regulations might cause a mad rush to exit.**

Of course, Bitcoin maximalists will argue that if one exchange goes down, another will come up, and we will learn from our mistakes. But is there enough incentive to learn from our mistakes? Shouldn't Bitcoin be actually **useful for buying things?**

The Bitcoin economy - and competitors

One of the biggest jokes in the history of Bitcoin was when Laszlo Hanyecz of Florida traded 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. That would be worth $574 million today, maybe the costliest meal ever. \[6\] But that was one of the first recorded instances of **a physical good bought with Bitcoin.**

https://preview.redd.it/zjyphu8l8j181.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b518e681fb09313178c602ee0d06d9a363a803e2

Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of Bitcoin as a mode of payment. From retail needs to domain names, from cars to travel packages to restaurants to cellular service, the scope of Bitcoin has expanded tremendously.\[7\] There's even a house on sale that you can buy **exclusively with Bitcoin.** But there are things that you **cannot** buy with Bitcoin yet. There's no direct provision to buy stocks on the NASDAQ (or any other market) with cryptocurrencies, for example.

A big market for Bitcoin is their programmability - **Smart Contracts will automate the market of trust.** People don't need to believe that someone else will pay them back on time and spend time in legal battles. A clause like “If rains don't arrive, farmers get paid insurance” can be automated to simplify the market of crop insurance. But this is also a space where Bitcoin has tough competition.

Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and a handful of other cryptocurrency blockchains (with tokens called *AltCoins*) sprouted to tackle problems that Bitcoin couldn’t. Bitcoin Maximalists argue that Bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and anything other currencies can do, Bitcoin can absorb into its code - But the facts speak otherwise. When Ether started out, its trading volume was only a fraction of Bitcoin’s, but after Ether started catering to the NFT and DAO space, **it's now a serious threat to Bitcoin’s dominance**. Other cryptos assert that they do different things in a better manner compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin was a mere joke till someone catapulted it to prominence. [I'm looking at you, Elon.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396698902842122244?s=20)

But one thing is for sure - It’s very difficult for a new entrant to the Altcoin space to gain traction and reach ***while standing for the same principles that Bitcoin does.*** There is so much awareness about cryptocurrencies now that the bulk of a new Altcoin offering will be bought out by a single entity. And that makes the cryptocurrency useless because its value is in its reach.

**It's not money unless everyone believes it is.**

A strong warning is in place here: When I say a new cryptocurrency is useless, I’m talking about the long term. Coin Offerings have a very strong possibility of being a Ponzi scheme, so be VERY VERY careful with where you put your money.

There's just one more reason that Bitcoin and other Altcoins are still not widespread in their use.

Volatility

Bitcoin is very volatile compared to the US Dollar. This is something that even maximalists don't argue with. It is not clear whether volatility is increasing or decreasing with time and trading volume, but you can't use something as **money** if you don't know what it will be worth days, hours, even minutes from now. This is the reason Bitcoin is the butt of so many jokes like this:

&gt;A 10 year old boy asks his father for a [#BitCoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitCoin?src=hashtag_click)📷 for his birthday. Dad can I please have just one BitCoin for my birthday as a gift ? Father: What ? Why the hell you need $ 14,433 Do you know $ 15,367 is a lot of money. What would you do with $ 12,456 dollars ?

But the assertion is that on the ***technology adoption curve***, Bitcoin is still in the early majority stage, and the amount of capital that has been injected into Bitcoin is minuscule compared to how much more can be injected (The figures are based on growth in Market Cap, number of users, and number of transactions - Unreliable, because one individual can have any number of Bitcoin Addresses and transactions could be just buying and selling of Bitcoin, not retail transactions).

https://preview.redd.it/mha3u2hm8j181.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfc02d49dc659dd8ffe651f5945974fa046cbf7a

Here we enter the realm of speculation. We must understand that Bitcoin is the first of its kind - A resource that is absolutely scarce, meaning that it is the first deflationary money. Some assert that the inbuilt scarcity will make volatility an inevitable feature of Bitcoin, rather than a bug. \[9\] Supporters of Bitcoin assert that as we cross over from early majority to late majority in the adoption curve, Bitcoin will start seeing massive adoption and this will stabilize the price (How exactly? I’m not sure. I don't have enough know-how to assess this).

All this talk is fine, but everybody gangsta till the big daddy of money steps in.

Will the Government be sleeping?

Bitcoin started out in anonymity and it was then laughed off as a joke. Later, governments started referring to it as a highly speculative asset, and now there are murmurs that Bitcoin is going to overthrow the monopoly that the Government has over money. El Salvador has accepted Bitcoin as legal tender and announced that it would be starting the world's first ""Bitcoin City"". What on earth is going on?

In the standard narrative about Bitcoin, after Bitcoin starts gaining mass adoption there comes a phase where some Central Bank starts getting shifty about the hyperinflation that is rampant in the economy, and starts **buying Bitcoin to hedge against the possibility of economic collapse.** Other banks follow suit, doing the same, and when rumors break out, the citizens start buying up Bitcoin and rapid adoption of Bitcoin follows suit with Bitcoin replacing the dominant currency of the country. This phase is called **hyperbitcoinization.**

That sounds great, except that the government isn't going to take this lying down. Apart from the ominous angle that money is one of the chief ways that the government uses to control its citizens, there is one logical reason that the government will oppose Bitcoin: **The government needs to pay its employees** and it has no means of production to produce or purchase Bitcoin scalably. How will public institutions sustain themselves in the absence of cash flow? There seems to be a dreamlike scenario where the government voluntarily relinquishes power and takes a backseat as all institutions are privatized, but since Satoshi vanished without leaving a manifesto on how legal institutions and the military will be funded, there seems to be a gaping hole in this grand scheme.

There is no doubt that Bitcoin will play an important role in the world economy. Even now, [Bitcoin's market cap ranks it as 14th in the list of world economies](https://coinmarketcap.com/fiat-currencies/) (with Ether at 25th). World countries switched to the gold standard when gold emerged as the hardest form of money and then switched to pegging themselves against the dollar. **It is highly likely that Bitcoin (or other Altcoins) will be a standard/commodity in the future.** But instead of Bitcoin overthrowing governments, or governments banning Bitcoin (which is very resource-intensive and difficult), it is more likely that governments will **assimilate Bitcoin into their legal framework.** Bitcoin might be taxed, its use cases monitored and transactions tracked. \[10\] Though the Indian and Chinese governments banned Bitcoin, India is now taking a softer stance by trying to tax cryptocurrency gains heavily. The lasting change might actually be in terms of **the inability of governments to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.**

And though hyperbitcoinization sounds cool (or ridiculous, depending on how you see it), it is not realistic or even desirable. The real meaning of this scenario sounds like a breakdown of world government (highly unlikely) \[11\]. Hopefully, it doesn't get that far.

A bitcoinized world: Good, bad or ugly?

The advantages of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are touted as follows:

1. Greater freedom of the individual
2. Resistance to inflation
3. Delegation of trust to a mathematical system
4. Reduction in government interference

The notion of decentralization has created this idea that Bitcoin is going to create a symmetric world of equal opportunity. There are some counterpoints to that argument:

1. The initial distribution of Bitcoin is hugely skewed. By some accounts, 85% of the entire Bitcoin supply is in the hands of ""whales"" who constitute just 2% of the user base (But this doesn't give them a higher edge unless the Bitcoin economy develops). \[12\]
2. Though Bitcoin promises economic opportunities for the entire world in theory, only about 60% of the world has access to the Internet.
3. Bitcoiners’ claim that Bitcoin is the only competitive cryptocurrency out there is unproven. There is no clear data on how many people believe in Bitcoin **as an asset, as money, and as a novelty.**
4. It isn't that hard for governments to launch **a coordinated attack on cryptocurrencies** \[13\]. The hope is that the political neutrality of Bitcoin and the personal incentive it holds gives it the edge in the long run.
5. Governments and corporations can give incentives by minting their own cryptocurrencies in certain geographical regions or internet spaces, an advantage that Bitcoin cannot outcompete without violating its neutrality.

So will we see Bitcoin rise to ascendance in this century?

Can Bitcoin replace the dollar?

If we consolidate all the points we have seen so far, we can see that Bitcoin is a convenient, portable form of money that gives a lot of freedom to the individual. It has gone from 0 to $56,000 (as of today), crossing a market cap of $1 Trillion in **a mere 13 years (Apple Computers took 38 years to hit the same milestone - with a solid business and advertising team backing it).** Since Bitcoin is a form of money that is native to the internet, the rate at which its story propagates is also phenomenal.

Bitcoin’s true decentralization and first-mover advantage also give it a great advantage over other cryptocurrencies. Though there is tough competition, some of Bitcoin’s core principles like the lack of a central authority give it a real edge (e.g Meta tried to start its own currency Libra/Diem, and it faced regulatory action instantly. Ethereum isn’t truly decentralized either).

The real challenges for Bitcoin are **price stability,** **exclusive use cases,** and **government regulation.** People will only consider Bitcoin money when they are willing to part with it for *something they cannot get* with conventional money. Till then, it’s an asset at most. Although smart contracts and a few niche use cases like NFTs seem to satisfy this, only time will tell if they have a lasting impact.

Price stability is also more likely when Bitcoin has a strong native economy. There are different assertions about its stability - That high-frequency trading is needed to stabilise it, that creation of value will stabilise price, that in spite of boom and bust the new low is always higher than before, that price will stabilise when the number of users keeps growing, and that its price cannot be stabilised as it is an asset. The truth is that nobody has been right at forecasting either its growth or stability reliably and it’s extremely difficult to do so because **we haven’t seen anything like this before.**

Government regulation is the biggest factor. Without all countries of the world having a uniform stance towards Bitcoin, it might just create arbitrage between different countries, not being the “global currency” that it claims to be. Some milestones to watch out for would be:

* The first Central Bank to store Bitcoin as Reserve currency.
* Clear legislation or regulatory action that is favorable to Bitcoin.
* Stock Exchanges trading Bitcoin as a commodity on par with Gold and Oil.

If any of the above happens, it heralds wider acceptance and greater stability. But with government regulation, there is **a greater probability that Bitcoin will coexist with world currencies rather than overthrow them.**

Conclusion

Though the American dollar is ubiquitous today and the central pillar of the global economy, it wasn't always so. The first American dollars were minted in 1792. But it was only in the aftermath of World War 2 in 1944 that the dollar became the standard for other global currencies - 152 years after its inception!

On the contrary, Bitcoin has already become a force to reckon with in just 13 years. It's questionable whether the “market cap” of Bitcoin represents any “real” economic growth, but as more people believe in it, there is more incentive to build an economy around it.

Bitcoin is unlikely to replace the Dollar anytime soon, but the coexistence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with world currencies is highly likely and something to watch out for. \[14\]

A brief history of money

Historians agree that humans invented money before they invented written language. Think about that. We were able to agree on how to exchange value before we were able to write down our thoughts. The origins of money are more fundamental to human nature than our desire to communicate, in a way.

Money served three purposes:

* A store of wealth across time. People could store today's effort for using it tomorrow.
* A medium of exchange, to procure things from others.
* A unit of account, to record credit-debit relationships.

Starting with the barter system, humans moved on to using common goods with intrinsic value (such as cows and bags of wheat) and then to units like cowrie shells, glass beads which were more convenient for accounting because of their **divisibility.** There was a problem with this system, though. You guessed it.

https://preview.redd.it/8pu2wpgj9j181.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac1cc0fcb67bfdbb88bb05a99b0b9912b5c42dd4

People who had access to the means of production of cowrie shells or glass beads could flood the market, *and the more money there was in the market, the less value it had.* This is what happened in Africa when glass beads merchants from Europe imported loads of glass beads and made them worthless as a form of money. (This could be one of the first recorded instances of **inflation**).

**Gold** was a solution to the cheap creation of money. Mining gold is a difficult task. Flooding the supply of money was difficult unless people took the effort to mine gold, for which they were compensated. But the quality of gold could always be debased and there was no way to check its authenticity.

Governments took on the responsibility of **controlling the supply** and **guaranteeing the validity** of money. This has always worked fine until it hasn't. As long as the government acts in a neutral capacity to do the best thing for the economy, there is no problem. But the people who are closest to the means of production of money - Kings, Central Bankers, Cabinet Members - also have the most incentive to confiscate a large share for themselves. Or they could follow a monetary policy that might make them look good in the short term while throwing the system into chaos in the long run. This can be seen in the case of the Fall of Rome and Constantinople, the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, the shift of the US and other countries away from the Gold standard \[1\], and the inflation that is looming over the US right now.

Looking at history, what would the perfect currency look like?

* **Convenient to handle.** It should be divisible, portable, safe to store, and easy to transact with. Units should be interchangeable (fungible).
* **Credible.** The validity of the money should be guaranteed in some way, either by its intrinsic value or by some mechanism such as the backing of a counterparty (like the Government).
* **Liquid.** It should be easy to find people who accept payment with it.
* **Secure.** If the money can be compromised, it cannot store wealth.
* **Inflation resistant.** It should be hard to create and resistant to control by small groups of people with vested interests.
* **Stable.** The value should not have significant volatility.

Since 2008, Bitcoin has grown in leaps and bounds to become a dominant force in the market and people's imagination. But...

Where does Bitcoin get its value from?

We saw earlier that if it’s easy to make money, anybody can flood the market and destroy its value. This was also the reason for gold's adoption for minting coins because gold is very hard to produce (apart from being nice and shiny).

The government's ability to print massive amounts of money is the chief danger to modern forms of money. Imagine you have a million dollars and it’s worthless tomorrow because a bunch of people in the government thought it's alright to print another quadrillion dollars. That's the fear which drives people to invest in real estate, stocks, gold, and other commodities. **There is no alternative government-backed currency in circulation today that qualifies as ""hard money""**, whose supply is restricted.

That's one of Bitcoin's chief attractions. Bitcoin is *extremely hard to produce* and *has a cap on its supply*. Each block that needs to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain (distributed ledger) needs to be identified by a number that satisfies a mathematical property. \[2\] Bitcoins are produced by ""miners"" who try to find these numbers by running through millions of options in a brute-force manner. When miners hit upon a successful candidate, **they are rewarded in Bitcoins**. This is a highly energy-intensive process and the profit that the miners get is in the thin margin between electricity consumption and the value of the bitcoin.

The physical exchange of energy for bitcoin is similar to expending effort in mining gold. The second feature is that **there can be only 21 million Bitcoins in existence**, ever. This is a hard feature of its code that cannot be changed. \[3\] 20 million Bitcoin would be mined by 2025 (by current estimates). By 2140, all of the Bitcoin would be mined, and the incentive for miners will be in the form of transaction fees. As the supply of Bitcoin is finite, **it cannot be devalued by increasing the supply** making it inflation resistant by design.

There is no central authority for Bitcoin. The code is open-sourced, and if anybody wants to change it, it has to be with the consensus of all the nodes in the network. For example, when some security vulnerabilities were identified in Bitcoin in 2018, a fork (change in the code) was done to patch it which was accepted by all users as it was for their benefit \[4\]. But when **hard forks** (major changes) were done to create new currencies like Bitcoin Cash, the bulk of users chose to stay on the existing network, causing Bitcoin Cash's value to drop sharply. Hence, **Bitcoin's value is decided by the consensus of the network.**

The above points show that Bitcoin is ***convenient, inflation resistant, secure, and credible*** (its validity is backed by a mathematical function that is impossible to break or fake).

This tells us about the **perceived value** of Bitcoin, but if the aim of Bitcoin is to capture the existing market, it also needs to be:

1. Liquid and exchangeable with existing currencies
2. Fuel for a thriving economy
3. Stable

How does Bitcoin do on these fronts?

Liquidity

Let's be real here. Most people are interested in Bitcoin not because of its fascinating mathematical properties or promise of inflation resistance. It's because of the **“Number go up”** that every influencer is shouting about on Twitter as if it’s their personal achievement. That's the reason Bitcoin tends to get on the nerves of some people too: **How is it that believers of an imaginary concept with no “value” or “business” behind it are rewarded time and again without any effort?**

The misconception here is that Bitcoin is being compared with businesses on the stock market which grow with time because of their value proposition and execution. Bitcoin is better compared with gold whose value is dictated by **scarcity.** The problem is that, unlike gold which has intrinsic value, Bitcoin's value is entirely dependent on the faith that people have in **the story around it.**

The story around Bitcoin is this:

**“Bitcoin is the hardest form of money and will eventually replace all currencies.”**

People who adhere to this vision are called **Bitcoin Maximalists.** And in terms of the stories out there, Bitcoin is one of the fastest proliferating. It makes sense. When personal incentive is tied with a story, the FOMO kicks in of being penniless when Bitcoin takes over. The possibility of gain makes people buy into it in droves. **And as people buy into it, demand rises, and its price goes up further.**

**Bitcoin's strongest point is also its weakest. Decentralization.**

Though Bitcoin claims to be “decentralized”, that's only if Bitcoin becomes money in itself. To convert from dollar to Bitcoin, you still need **the presence of exchanges.** These exchanges are among the most loosely regulated financial entities in the world and the most vulnerable to government regulation. For example, Tether, which debuted as a *Stablecoin* (a cryptocurrency pegged to a commodity or government-backed currency) has repeatedly come under scrutiny for its shady accounting practices. \[5\] Tether also turned out to be owned by the same people who owned Bitfinex, a large cryptocurrency exchange. **It is one of the biggest intermediaries for Bitcoin to Dollar liquidity out there, and a collapse on that front due to regulations might cause a mad rush to exit.**

Of course, Bitcoin maximalists will argue that if one exchange goes down, another will come up, and we will learn from our mistakes. But is there enough incentive to learn from our mistakes? Shouldn't Bitcoin be actually **useful for buying things?**

The Bitcoin economy - and competitors

One of the biggest jokes in the history of Bitcoin was when Laszlo Hanyecz of Florida traded 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. That would be worth $574 million today, maybe the costliest meal ever. \[6\] But that was one of the first recorded instances of **a physical good bought with Bitcoin.**

https://preview.redd.it/eermktbp9j181.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5df9448e1eaa7b010addbdc12f498f2485577d7

Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of Bitcoin as a mode of payment. From retail needs to domain names, from cars to travel packages to restaurants to cellular service, the scope of Bitcoin has expanded tremendously.\[7\] There's even a house on sale that you can buy **exclusively with Bitcoin.** But there are things that you **cannot** buy with Bitcoin yet. There's no direct provision to buy stocks on the NASDAQ (or any other market) with cryptocurrencies, for example.

A big market for Bitcoin is their programmability - **Smart Contracts will automate the market of trust.** People don't need to believe that someone else will pay them back on time and spend time in legal battles. A clause like “If rains don't arrive, farmers get paid insurance” can be automated to simplify the market of crop insurance. But this is also a space where Bitcoin has tough competition.

Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and a handful of other cryptocurrency blockchains (with tokens called *AltCoins*) sprouted to tackle problems that Bitcoin couldn’t. Bitcoin Maximalists argue that Bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and anything other currencies can do, Bitcoin can absorb into its code - But the facts speak otherwise. When Ether started out, its trading volume was only a fraction of Bitcoin’s, but after Ether started catering to the NFT and DAO space, **it's now a serious threat to Bitcoin’s dominance**. Other cryptos assert that they do different things in a better manner compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin was a mere joke till someone catapulted it to prominence. [I'm looking at you, Elon.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396698902842122244?s=20)

But one thing is for sure - It’s very difficult for a new entrant to the Altcoin space to gain traction and reach ***while standing for the same principles that Bitcoin does.*** There is so much awareness about cryptocurrencies now that the bulk of a new Altcoin offering will be bought out by a single entity. And that makes the cryptocurrency useless because its value is in its reach.

**It's not money unless everyone believes it is.**

A strong warning is in place here: When I say a new cryptocurrency is useless, I’m talking about the long term. Coin Offerings have a very strong possibility of being a Ponzi scheme, so be VERY VERY careful with where you put your money.

There's just one more reason that Bitcoin and other Altcoins are still not widespread in their use.

Volatility

Bitcoin is very volatile compared to the US Dollar. This is something that even maximalists don't argue with. It is not clear whether volatility is increasing or decreasing with time and trading volume, but you can't use something as **money** if you don't know what it will be worth days, hours, even minutes from now. This is the reason Bitcoin is the butt of so many jokes like this:

&gt;A 10 year old boy asks his father for a [#BitCoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitCoin?src=hashtag_click)📷 for his birthday. Dad can I please have just one BitCoin for my birthday as a gift ? Father: What ? Why the hell you need $ 14,433 Do you know $ 15,367 is a lot of money. What would you do with $ 12,456 dollars ?

But the assertion is that on the ***technology adoption curve***, Bitcoin is still in the early majority stage, and the amount of capital that has been injected into Bitcoin is minuscule compared to how much more can be injected (The figures are based on growth in Market Cap, number of users, and number of transactions - Unreliable, because one individual can have any number of Bitcoin Addresses and transactions could be just buying and selling of Bitcoin, not retail transactions).

https://preview.redd.it/pcejw8hr9j181.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df0cfd7a129561830c11ccdf87082b664067f59e

Here we enter the realm of speculation. We must understand that Bitcoin is the first of its kind - A resource that is absolutely scarce, meaning that it is the first deflationary money. Some assert that the inbuilt scarcity will make volatility an inevitable feature of Bitcoin, rather than a bug. \[9\] Supporters of Bitcoin assert that as we cross over from early majority to late majority in the adoption curve, Bitcoin will start seeing massive adoption and this will stabilize the price (How exactly? I’m not sure. I don't have enough know-how to assess this).

All this talk is fine, but everybody gangsta till the big daddy of money steps in.

Will the Government be sleeping?

Bitcoin started out in anonymity and it was then laughed off as a joke. Later, governments started referring to it as a highly speculative asset, and now there are murmurs that Bitcoin is going to overthrow the monopoly that the Government has over money. El Salvador has accepted Bitcoin as legal tender and announced that it would be starting the world's first ""Bitcoin City"". What on earth is going on?

In the standard narrative about Bitcoin, after Bitcoin starts gaining mass adoption there comes a phase where some Central Bank starts getting shifty about the hyperinflation that is rampant in the economy, and starts **buying Bitcoin to hedge against the possibility of economic collapse.** Other banks follow suit, doing the same, and when rumors break out, the citizens start buying up Bitcoin and rapid adoption of Bitcoin follows suit with Bitcoin replacing the dominant currency of the country. This phase is called **hyperbitcoinization.**

That sounds great, except that the government isn't going to take this lying down. Apart from the ominous angle that money is one of the chief ways that the government uses to control its citizens, there is one logical reason that the government will oppose Bitcoin: **The government needs to pay its employees** and it has no means of production to produce or purchase Bitcoin scalably. How will public institutions sustain themselves in the absence of cash flow? There seems to be a dreamlike scenario where the government voluntarily relinquishes power and takes a backseat as all institutions are privatized, but since Satoshi vanished without leaving a manifesto on how legal institutions and the military will be funded, there seems to be a gaping hole in this grand scheme.

There is no doubt that Bitcoin will play an important role in the world economy. Even now, [Bitcoin's market cap ranks it as 14th in the list of world economies](https://coinmarketcap.com/fiat-currencies/) (with Ether at 25th). World countries switched to the gold standard when gold emerged as the hardest form of money and then switched to pegging themselves against the dollar. **It is highly likely that Bitcoin (or other Altcoins) will be a standard/commodity in the future.** But instead of Bitcoin overthrowing governments, or governments banning Bitcoin (which is very resource-intensive and difficult), it is more likely that governments will **assimilate Bitcoin into their legal framework.** Bitcoin might be taxed, its use cases monitored and transactions tracked. \[10\] Though the Indian and Chinese governments banned Bitcoin, India is now taking a softer stance by trying to tax cryptocurrency gains heavily. The lasting change might actually be in terms of **the inability of governments to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.**

And though hyperbitcoinization sounds cool (or ridiculous, depending on how you see it), it is not realistic or even desirable. The real meaning of this scenario sounds like a breakdown of world government (highly unlikely) \[11\]. Hopefully, it doesn't get that far.

A bitcoinized world: Good, bad or ugly?

The advantages of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are touted as follows:

1. Greater freedom of the individual
2. Resistance to inflation
3. Delegation of trust to a mathematical system
4. Reduction in government interference

The notion of decentralization has created this idea that Bitcoin is going to create a symmetric world of equal opportunity. There are some counterpoints to that argument:

1. The initial distribution of Bitcoin is hugely skewed. By some accounts, 85% of the entire Bitcoin supply is in the hands of ""whales"" who constitute just 2% of the user base (But this doesn't give them a higher edge unless the Bitcoin economy develops). \[12\]
2. Though Bitcoin promises economic opportunities for the entire world in theory, only about 60% of the world has access to the Internet.
3. Bitcoiners’ claim that Bitcoin is the only competitive cryptocurrency out there is unproven. There is no clear data on how many people believe in Bitcoin **as an asset, as money, and as a novelty.**
4. It isn't that hard for governments to launch **a coordinated attack on cryptocurrencies** \[13\]. The hope is that the political neutrality of Bitcoin and the personal incentive it holds gives it the edge in the long run.
5. Governments and corporations can give incentives by minting their own cryptocurrencies in certain geographical regions or internet spaces, an advantage that Bitcoin cannot outcompete without violating its neutrality.

So will we see Bitcoin rise to ascendance in this century?

Can Bitcoin replace the dollar?

If we consolidate all the points we have seen so far, we can see that Bitcoin is a convenient, portable form of money that gives a lot of freedom to the individual. It has gone from 0 to $56,000 (as of today), crossing a market cap of $1 Trillion in **a mere 13 years (Apple Computers took 38 years to hit the same milestone - with a solid business and advertising team backing it).** Since Bitcoin is a form of money that is native to the internet, the rate at which its story propagates is also phenomenal.

Bitcoin’s true decentralization and first-mover advantage also give it a great advantage over other cryptocurrencies. Though there is tough competition, some of Bitcoin’s core principles like the lack of a central authority give it a real edge (e.g Meta tried to start its own currency Libra/Diem, and it faced regulatory action instantly. Ethereum isn’t truly decentralized either).

The real challenges for Bitcoin are **price stability,** **exclusive use cases,** and **government regulation.** People will only consider Bitcoin money when they are willing to part with it for *something they cannot get* with conventional money. Till then, it’s an asset at most. Although smart contracts and a few niche use cases like NFTs seem to satisfy this, only time will tell if they have a lasting impact.

Price stability is also more likely when Bitcoin has a strong native economy. There are different assertions about its stability - That high-frequency trading is needed to stabilise it, that creation of value will stabilise price, that in spite of boom and bust the new low is always higher than before, that price will stabilise when the number of users keeps growing, and that its price cannot be stabilised as it is an asset. The truth is that nobody has been right at forecasting either its growth or stability reliably and it’s extremely difficult to do so because **we haven’t seen anything like this before.**

Government regulation is the biggest factor. Without all countries of the world having a uniform stance towards Bitcoin, it might just create arbitrage between different countries, not being the “global currency” that it claims to be. Some milestones to watch out for would be:

* The first Central Bank to store Bitcoin as Reserve currency.
* Clear legislation or regulatory action that is favorable to Bitcoin.
* Stock Exchanges trading Bitcoin as a commodity on par with Gold and Oil.

If any of the above happens, it heralds wider acceptance and greater stability. But with government regulation, there is **a greater probability that Bitcoin will coexist with world currencies rather than overthrow them.**

Conclusion

Though the American dollar is ubiquitous today and the central pillar of the global economy, it wasn't always so. The first American dollars were minted in 1792. But it was only in the aftermath of World War 2 in 1944 that the dollar became the standard for other global currencies - 152 years after its inception!

On the contrary, Bitcoin has already become a force to reckon with in just 13 years. It's questionable whether the “market cap” of Bitcoin represents any “real” economic growth, but as more people believe in it, there is more incentive to build an economy around it.

Bitcoin is unlikely to replace the Dollar anytime soon, but the coexistence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with world currencies is highly likely and something to watch out for. \[14\]

CryptoCurrency,Detecting and Measuring Financial Market Bubbles,"You probably seen people discussing whether crypto is a bubble right now or not. I don't really want to take a stance, but instead I'll share [this thesis](https://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/bitstream/handle/1993/33351/rad_fariba.pdf) with you. It gives some helpful information on how to spot a bubble by looking at historic bubbles, so you can come to your own conclusions.

Here are some of the main causes for bubbles mentioned:

&amp;#x200B;

**Noise and Noise Traders**

Noise is defined as information that has not arrived in the market, yet according to Black (1986), the concept of noise trading forces prices to deviate from their true value. If there is more noise, markets will be more liquid and allow traders to observe prices precisely (Black, 1986). The attitudes of noise traders are correlated, and their opinions cannot always be justified by any economic fundamentals. To put it simply, noise traders follow trends and overreact to both bad news and good news (Kortian, 1995). As volatility changes over time, the rate at which information arrives influences the volatility and stock price. Simply put, almost anything that affects a characteristic of noise traders could change the volatility of a stock price (Black, 1986). In other words, if there is no noise, there would be little trading in individual assets in the market. According to Delong et al. (1990), the presence of noise traders was ignored and these arguments were made by Friedman and Fama. Irrational investors finally meet in the market through a rational arbitrager and the price can be close to its fundamental value (Delong et al., 1990).

&amp;#x200B;

**Positive Feedback**

Research indicates that when the cycle of positive feedback occurs for too long, it may create a bubble. In this cycle, investors buy securities when prices increase and sell when prices decrease (Sornette &amp; Kaizoji, 2008). Tokic (2010) indicates that due to receiving good news in the market, noise traders assume prices will rise from initial prices, and they buy more today. This cycle continues, and tomorrow investors buy more in response to the reaction of today‘s‎ increasing price (Tokic, 2010).

&amp;#x200B;

**Interest Rate**

Decreasing the interest rate may increase the price of assets and vice versa (Frankel, 2006). For example, the correlation between interest rate and commodity price booms in 1970 and 1980 was negative (Pindyck &amp; Rotemberg, 1998). Zhang et al. (2011) also emphasize that low-interest rates for many years and excessive liquidity were the main factors causing the real estate bubble occurrence (Zhang et al., 2011). Commodity production is capital intensive, and any change in the interest rate has a direct effect on the cost of production and supply, and both storable and non-storable commodities are shown to be sensitive to interest rate changes (Carter et al. 2011).

CryptoCurrency,Where would you be most comfortable taking a crypto-backed loan?,"There seems to be a battle right now for the future of lending. 

DeFi protocols are obviously extremely competitive.

personalfinance,Help understanding loan/interest,"Hi all

I recently got a personal loan to pay off a loan and CC with a high interest rate. The loan rate is 12.03% for $4000. 

I already had a loan with them (that was the one with the higher APR I was paying off) so I know they ask for this “origination fee” as a way of front loading interest (the way it was explained to me) however, something I noticed this time that I didn’t notice with the last loan on the approval disclosure:


It says the APR is 16.65% but this includes the origination fee because on the promissory note is it clearly written as 12.03%. 
Amount paid to you: $3745.56
Prepaid finance charge (origination fee): $254.44
Principal amount: $4000

I just made my first payment and realized my balance was $4000. Just wondering why/how it is that much when I only received $3745.56 and I thought the origination fee paid some of the interest. 

Not looking for any advice about getting a better loan or a lower rate. I am repairing my credit and this is literally the last bit after 3 years of rebuilding and paying off about $13k in debt and $5k in collections. My credit is still not great but I did check for personal loans through some local credit unions and my bank and the rates were much higher than 12%. I’m just trying to understand the math above and why I’m paying back $4000 when I only received $3745.56.

personalfinance,Chase Fraud Dept didn’t resolve our issue during the 60 day period and now they say there’s nothing they can do.,"Without getting too into the weeds, Hertz incorrectly charged us $2,675 at the end of a car rental. Not realizing what it was at the time, we said it was a fraudulent charge. 

This was in July. We’ve been in communication with Chase and Hertz the whole time, getting the run around to different depts including fraud. This past week we spoke to someone who said that the 60 day period has expired and they can’t do anything about it anymore. 

Are we really SOL? We did what we were suppose to do, but now are we stuck with a $2000+ bill right before the holidays because Chase and Hertz couldn’t get their act together? Or is there someone else we can talk to about this?

EDIT:
Thanks for the help so far! Sounds like I boofed up by claiming that last charge was fraudulent, and I should be talking to Hertz once Chase decides it was valid. 

For a little more background—we picked up a rental in Chattanooga to drive to North Carolina for a wedding. We were then going to return it in ATL where we would then fly home. On the way to the wedding, we got a flat. Hertz told they would send a tow truck to take it to Knoxville where we could get a new car. Because that would have taken upwards of 8 hours of a short trip, we decided to just return the car then and catch a with a friend to ATL. Hertz said that was fine and they would cut our agreement one day short. 

Once we got back home, however, we kept getting charged late fees because Hertz in ATL never got the car back. Clearly Knoxville Hertz didn’t tell ATL Hertz they had the car (or something to that effect). I even got a call from an Atlanta PD detective about the missing car. 

After a few weeks of back and forth with Hertz, it seemed that the issue was resolved. Another couple of weeks go by and I get a notification the $2,675 charge. Chase asked me if this was fraudulent and I said yes. Big mistake, because apparently it was another incorrect late fee from Hertz, meaning it was technically valid from Chase’s point of view. By saying it was fraudulent though, I forced Chase to put a stop-pay on that, meaning Hertz could no longer just refund the payment and has to wait for Chase to confirm it’s valid or not. So basically, from what I understand, that $2,675 is in purgatory while it waits for a decision about who should refund.",finance
stocks,Cutting my CRSR losses?,"Just curious to hear some other opinions on my CRSR investment. I originally started a position in 2020 after the IPO and before WSB ever got their hands on it. I’m a gamer, saw a lot of people using their brands and saying they were quality. Did my DD on the fundamentals and everything looked great for a growth company. Huge % YOY increases in most areas. The only negatives I saw was debt but that has even improved since my original investment and the fact that EagleTree held so much of the float. I knew that this growth was exasperated due to covid but I believed the TAM for gaming will grow in the coming years. I DCA after starting my position, Yields spike in March causing growth stocks to plummet. I continued to DCA. WSB pump came and I was up nearly 30% but never sold as I had CC’s on my position that went ITM. Fundamentally nothing has changed about this company but clearly the market has changed. I know short interest is extremely high at the moment as well near 35% so I am hesitant on what to do as I would rather sell after shorts cover but who knows when that would happen in this market environment. I am currently down around 30% (11k) on my position which isn’t a huge amount of money to me but still significant. I’m worried that this could fall possibly below IPO price when the Fed does start to raise rates and growth stocks crash and burn. I still believe the thesis but due to significant market conditions and unforeseen headwinds I’m wondering if I should tax loss harvest the loss and not continue to lose out on opportunity cost and my investment as well.

I thought about blending it into stocks and bonds... but I keep hearing how bonds are looking like short term loser right now (worse than cash), yields are low today and their value will fall if interest rates rise next year.

Any other strategies I should consider? I was even considering a fund like VGSLX to be part of the allocation, so if real estate prices have a big change my savings will try to track it.

I could tolerate some risk, my 1 year house buying timeline isn't set in stone, so I could push it out another year if I need time to recover from a stock market correction. Just feels like a conundrum where real estate in my area keeps rising quickly, but I don't know where to put my savings in the meantime. 

tl;dr: what allocation should I use for ~$100k to be used on a down payment for a home 1 year from today?",finance

economy,Time to learn to save money! NOTICE ME SENPAI!,"Speaking from turkey, as someone who used to had no idea nor interest in economy, considering all the economic turmoils we experienced for the past couple of years and even still, I decided to learn what goes around now. So, our government has been trying to fight against foreign currency and keep lowering interest rates which eventually cause the very high inflation. Since Turkey' has been a developing country our economy should be flexible, right? And we need to get investment in to our market, however their policy is hard to understand. They try to cut off the western currency while opening the doors to eastern aka UAE, QATAR even Japan and China etc. The issue is that they don't do it in order, it seems they reach them at very crucial times, as if they don't plan it, rather what they do is like last minute investments to save the moment. And thats all the reasons that make your policy unreliable. It's unpredictable. Which is why, I decided to learn investment. Turks do not have a long-term investment culture. As a community that constantly struggles with inflation, we prefer short-term investments. It is generally invested in gold, foreign currency or property.However, I think such investments are somewhat outdated. I decided to learn the stock market. But it is difficult to grasp how the stock market works in Turkey. That's why I need channels where I can learn about the general operation of the stock market, research the reliability of companies and teach me how to take risks. Do you have any recommendations?",finance

I don't have any loans. Just started contributing to my 401k and I have been using betterment robot adviser for the past year (**$100/m** just to learn more about portfolio).

I am already **maxing out both 401k-Roth and HSA**, and for now, I have **3 months of emergency fund** in a High-Yield Savings Accounts.

After maxing out these accounts, I still have some money at the end of the month, which I am still not sure what is the best way to take advantage of it.

So, we can have more freedom for buying a house, building wealth, and not losing money through interests.

My options are:

* paying loan interest to NOT BE accrued to the principal
* paying loan interest + little bit more to reduce the principal
* Only Invest it, hoping it has a return greater than interest loans rates of 4.3\~6.28%.

CryptoCurrency,On some popular misunderstandings of monetary policy and inflation,"In crypto there is this popular but naive idea about monetary policy that ""money printing"" linearly increases inflation. Inflation becomes this nebulous idea of the dollar becoming less valuable as a dependent variable of money supply rather than a complex system of relations with money supply as one factor. Inflation is simply prices going up. Most ""money printing"" done by the FED is buying up debt so that companies can de-leverage and have access to easy money to keep themselves afloat during market uncertainty. This money has been going into business expenses - often stock buy-backs, financial speculation, and paying off remaining liabilities. This has mostly led to an inflation of the *stock market*, not commodities. This money mostly exits businesses to financial elites and top earners at these companies, not normal people, and it doesn't really trickle down except through allowing businesses to hold onto employees as liabilities are eased elsewhere. These people aren't buying exaggerated amounts of commodities with this money to increase demand for them, except for speculation in certain typical areas like oil or for raw commodities used as inputs in value-added products. Instead there has been a torrent of money upwards. In effect, the FED isn't ""stealing"" from people through inflation of commodities, it's doing it through targeting financial stimulus at the already rich.

The FED also indirectly ""prints money"" by keeping interest rates low, meaning the main creators of money (commercial banks) can lend very freely. *Money is mostly created through bank lending*, not money printers going brrr. It's mostly businesses that benefit from this as well, although it has also led to inflation in housing and education prices, which are typical expenses normal people use debt for.

Commodity price inflation is overwhelmingly due to increased prices of inputs, labor, and getting products to market. Everyone has heard of backups in supply chains, but for some reason people don't connect that to increased prices. If a business incurs increased expenses to produce something and bring it to market, they have to increase its price to maintain their profit margin and rate of profit. Demand has not increased year-on-year versus pre-pandemic levels nearly enough to explain the prices, so supposing this has to do with easy access to money by purchasers is incorrect. Thinking a stimulus aimed at infrastructure would increase inflation in commodity prices is also a bit backwards. If infrastructure is improved, that would decrease business costs to bring products to market, and therefor *decrease* inflation in commodity prices. Though we all know how these bills typically work, and assuming a bill for improving infrastructure would actually substantially improve infrastructure in the current business and political climate is likely not super valid.

I personally believe this tendency to displace blame for commodity inflation onto financial stimulus, especially those that help normal people that have been stopped due to inflation fears, is more so that businesses and elites can decrease money flow to the lower and middle classes so that they can keep labor costs low. Keep in mind these are the kinds of people that *own* newspapers and purchase influence regularly. To decrease labor costs would require limiting flow of money to the lower and middle classes and increasing unemployment so that employers have an easy time negotiating lower prices.

Those thinking ""money printing"" decreases the value of the dollar might be surprised to learn that the USD has been having a run-up and has been increasing in value as of late. The dollar has increased in value by over 8% since May.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Starter condo or nicer SFH?,"Me and my husband are thinking about purchasing our first home. We make a combined income $230k a year, gross. 

We are struggling with determining what our house budget should be, can we even afford a house, what are our financial goals, etc. We want to live within our means, to increase our wealth, and improve our quality of life by moving out of our 1 bedroom apt. We are major homebodies (not constantly traveling, to give perspective on our lifestyle). Our rent won’t increase by much within the next year, maybe $2000 for a cheap 2 bedroom but I don’t want to keep moving apartments each year so the next place we live at, IDEALLY, we’d be there for the next 5 years. 

Renting for another 5 years seems safe but also suboptimal. It’s mostly just a matter of taste. I want to live in an interesting space with aesthetically please surroundings and most cheap apartments don’t satisfy that criteria. We also acknowledge we have more income than most, even in a MCOL city, so we feel like it would be silly to not enjoy our earnings by moving to a place we will be proud to live in.

Debts:
-110k in student loans, with the highest interest rate being 4%
- 9k car note (car payment 277/mo)
- Child support of $960 per month from husband’s previous marriage

Assets:
- $130k saved up liquid cash
- $33k in my 401k

Are we even in a good position to buy a house? 

Here are our current options: 

1. $450k 2 story townhome, recently renovated, with $280 monthly HOA in gated community. Built in the early 00s. Neighborhood is a bit sleepy and we’re worried it won’t appreciate as nicely but we would be saving about $400-$450 a month in monthly house costs (principle, interest, prop tax, insurance, PMI, HOA, utils). We are also assuming that the rent-to-own ratio in this community leans more towards renters. Owners don’t live here currently but did live here for several years.

2. 550k SFH. Built in the late 70s. Property taxes are at least $1000 more a year :( Feels more “homey” and we could see ourselves living here for more than 5 years. It is obviously a riskier option as we go from having 6.5 months of emergency savings to 4 months of emergency savings due to the higher DP which would be 12%. We are also intimidated by home ownership in general which is why the townhome is slightly more appealing. This townhome has an HOAs and we are aware that HOAS can be unpredictable (poor management, special assessments). But SFH do appreciate more year over year.

Our DTI with the $450k townhome would be 28% versus 31% with the SFH. I don’t know if we should be looking at this purchase as CONSERVATIVELY as possible or splurge on our first home. 

We don’t plan on having children for at least 3-4 years. We plan to maintain the same income and expect our income to grow but that’s obviously what everyone said before the house market crash, I’m sure.

We are also not interested in having a commute that is longer than 30 min with traffic, so our home price options really start at $450k, min, which still are typically going to be townhomes. 

Any advice would be great. We are feeling a bit lost. Interests rates are low. House prices are high. Austin experienced an abnormal growth rate. We expect this to continue due to the job growth in this area. We don’t plan on leaving here anytime soon. We want to plant roots down but maybe we should just be conservative and rent for another 2 years.

CryptoCurrency,How to file your U.S. crypto taxes!,"I wanted to put together an early tax guide for those who have recently joined the cryptosphere, in an effort to help promote responsible crypto trading and investments.  It's actually quite easy, but can be time consuming if you've made a lot of trades throughout the year.

In the U.S., the cryptocurrency tax rate for federal taxes is the same as the capital gains tax rate. In 2021, it ranges from 10-37% for short-term capital gains and 0-20% for long-term capital gains. In the US, crypto-asset gains are calculated using two factors: your income bracket, and how long you have held the cryptocurrency.

**Pay your taxes** \- I cannot express enough how dangerous it is not to.  It could take months or years to get caught, but you could suffer from liens, levies, or seizure of property.  The IRS is not worth messing with, and U.S. exchanges are now cooperating with them.

For volume over $20,000 or if you have over 200 transactions on an exchange, they should send you a Form 1099 at the end of the year.  This means your cumulative income has been reported by the exchange to the IRS and your tax return will need to reflect detailed trading activity.

**Take note:** [The Wash Sale Rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp) still does not apply to cryptocurrencies, but [that may change soon](https://www.thestreet.com/retirement/cryptocurrency-may-soon-be-subject-wash-sale-rule).  This means you can legally sell to claim losses up to $3,000 on December 31 and then buy back in on January 1, as opposed to the 30-day rule in securities.  This strategy is known as Tax-Loss Harvesting.

# The easy way to file: TurboTax + CoinTracker.io

TurboTax has integrated with CoinTracker.io to make this easy-peasy.  If you've made fewer than 25 transactions in 2021, CoinTracker has a free option.  For up to 100 transactions, you'll have to pay $59, or $199 for up to 1000 transactions.

CoinTracker can also [directly connect to your accounts on popular exchanges](https://www.cointracker.io/exchanges), such as Coinbase, Gemini, Binance, KuCoin, HitBTC, Gate.io, Robinhood, Cash App, Uphold and more.  It will download your trade history from each exchange and calculate any capital gains you've made from those trades.  Optionally, you can upload a CSV file to CoinTracker from these exchanges (so you don't have to ""link"" the account using an API key if you are uncomfortable with it.)

Once you have completed syncing your trade history with CT, you will need to connect it to your TurboTax account.  TurboTax will generate a Schedule D and Form 8949 with your gains and losses.

**If you decide to do your own taxes** and not use a service like TurboTax, you will need to download [Schedule D](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sd.pdf) and [Form 8949](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8949.pdf) and complete these yourself.

CryptoCurrency,Living off BTC Loans + Yield (example analysis and projections),"Curious about what it would take to live off Bitcoin in retirement, I did an extrapolation of how one would structure this over the long term.  My findings are below.  This required a lot of assumptions, but I think they are pretty conservative.

**Assumptions**

* BTC will eventually hit a market cap of 20T (assuming 19M supply with 2M lost)
* There will continue to be 4-year cycles with decreasing volatility
* You will be able to earn an average 2% yield on your Bitcoin (see: Gemini, Ledn, Celsius, etc.)
* You retire in 2022
* Your average US income tax rate is 25%
* Your loan's interest rate is 8% using a max 40% collateral position each year
* You need $60,000 a year to retire comfortably
* Early on, you take loans (and refinance them each year with the additional income needed)
* You want to eventually live off yield alone
* Excess yield in the future will be applied towards loan repayment

How much Bitcoin would you need to utilize for earning yield and also used as loan collateral?

**Answer for this example:** 8.5 Bitcoin.  I wanted to find an amount that would, over time, allow me to generate enough yield to repay the loan and eventually end up with the same amount of Bitcoin that I started with.

This amount can be drastically lowered if you retired at a later year if Bitcoin's price is much higher.  Retiring in 2025, for example, would require that you have 2 less bitcoin at 6.5 Bitcoin total.

**The Breakdown**

|Year|BTCUSD|Market Cap (T)|Return||Loan Balance|BTC Earning Yield|BTC Collateralized|Yield (BTC)|Yield (USD)|Income Taxes|Net Yield|

Inspired by a previous post here, I thought it would be wise to invest 10K in Series I bonds (7.12% interest) this year, and 10K in 2022 (before the interest rates go down in April).

Save 20K for emergency fund, hold 7K for 2022 IRA, hold 2K for 2022 HSA, and put 20K vs mortgage (just because I'm very inspired to pay off the mortgage).

I'm already contributing 25% to my company's 401K (5% match).

personalfinance,Better to use current funds to pay for home reno/ADU or take out a HELOC?,"We're selling our house and after buying a new one we will have ~$250k cash remaining. In our new house we want to do some hefty renovations as well as adding an ADU (accessory dwelling unit) - we're in SoCal, so costs getting to $250k or above is entirely possible).

Investing gives me terrible anxiety and I can hardly bring myself to get anywhere near it beyond putting money in my 401k/Roth IRA each year. However...my understanding is that sticking money ""in the stock market"" will yield an average of 8% return. In talking to a lender, (one that lends based on a home's future/post renovation value - Renofi is the name), I was told the interest rate would be 3-4%.

It seems like a no brainer but I want to make sure I'm not crazy...I'm better off keeping/investing the cash and borrowing the full amount, right?

In case it's relevant, with the renovation loan I'm only obligated to make interest-only payments. I assume I'd be better off paying down the principal as well?",finance

Bitcoin,Volcano 🌋 Bonds,"Bitcoin City is the proposed micro Dubai of El Salvador. As a citizen of this place, you will enjoy:

 - Zero payroll taxes
 - Zero capital gains taxes
 - Zero real estate taxes
 - Zero electric or heating bills as the volcano's geothermal will make the city a zero carbon metropolis
 - 10% VAT (value added tax, like sales taxes)

The bonds will be issued on Liquid Network (a bitcoin sidechain) for $1B. The smallest increment you can buy is $100, and requires you stake (tie-up) your bitcoin for 5 years.

El Salvador will use $500M of that to buy bitcoin, and to buy mining equipment. The other $500M will be for city and volcano [geothermal] energy infrastructure.

The bond coupon (interest rate) is 6.5% APY

After 5 years, a special dividend will be awarded as they slowly begin liquidating their BTC.

They plan on servicing the bond coupon (paying the interest rate to bond holders) with:

 - 50% of the VAT
 - Profits made from mining
 - An appreciation of bitcoin's price

The risk/reward here for them is enormous. Will the shanty town of corrugated metal huts and its people move willingly? Will enough private capital pour in to build the homes, bring the businesses? Can President Bukele (pronounced Bū-kā-lee) be trusted to deliver? This is an incredible undertaking. 

If bitcoin were to say double from where it is today, they will have made the best move in their small country's history. They'll have more or less financed a city from a swamp, improved tens of thousands of lives in the area, attracted foreign investment and citizenship (which they plan on lowering requirements to ownership of 1 BTC), and proven the longterm belief that bitcoin by its nature incentives green energy along the way to reducing its own liability.  

Even if the bond sale itself (they do plan on 10 of them so $10B total) sells out quickly, it will be enough to capture the attention of many other Latin American countries and countries around the world. It's hard to explain what effect large lockups of BTC and subsequent buys-investment-adoption of this could have. Already we're getting late in the distribution phase and over a decade of longterm accumulation will give us a major supply shock sometime in early 2023 (most claims heretofore have been dubious, but we're getting close). 

For investors sitting on a surplus, I see no downside, especially ones like myself that are longterm hodlers anyway. I can't say I'm a big fan of sidechains like Liquid Network or some of Bukele's political maneuvering, but El Salvador has thought outside the hyper-imperialism that the US dollar has boxed so many desperate countries into. So I see it as a duty, then, to support El Salvador's endeavor with a small allocation of BTC to volcano🌋 bonds. Maxi's, dear reader, are like the thorns that grow when a rose is young to protect it until it flowers. Because you have to understand that **ADOPTION** is the most important part of bitcoin's success now. Not price, not regulation, nothing but adoption. So I implore those that bought their first hard wallet or stacked their first SATS to educate those around you and be patient with them, but relentless:

CryptoCurrency,"'Crypto Chinese Whispers', and how I became the fictional owner of a whole Bitcoin","A funny little story for you all, to lift the mood in this mini market dip.

So, I've been investing in cryptocurrencies for about a year now, and for quite a lot of my early-stage investing, I told nobody other than a few close friends and co-investors about what I was doing. Not even because I was ashamed of it – I wasn't – but because I knew that by telling people that I was a cryptocurrency investor, I'd then have to respond to a multitude of questions about cryptocurrency that, frankly, I didn't even have all the answers to at the time (and still don't).

Only in the past few months have I started to be more open about it, not to the point where I disclose anything relating to how much I have invested, but just to the point where I'll comfortably explain to people *why* I invest, what projects I value the use-cases of, what ways I believe cryptocurrency will gradually penetrate the mainstream glass ceiling and so on.

Well, a few weeks ago, I was on a work conference trip with a few colleagues, and after a few drinks, one of them said ""oh, you're into your cryptocurrencies aren't you? You must have some Bitcoin then mustn't you?"". I explained that although I was able to see how much my portfolio is worth in Bitcoin, I don't actually *own* any Bitcoin, as I was invested into other projects. I thought I'd given a sufficient explanation. 

Apparently not.

The fast forward to recently, when Bitcoin hit its all-time high price, and I was sat there at my desk when a colleague rings me up... ""hey, is it true you own a Bitcoin?! I just saw on the news that it's just reached 50 grand!""... I then realised what had happened: one of the colleagues that I was on my work conference with must have told this colleague that I owned a Bitcoin, despite me making it very clear that I didn't, and now this colleague thought that I was sat on an investment worth more than either of our salaries. 

Fast forward to the next day, and we have a Zoom meeting involving the entire department, and as soon as I join the call, I'm met with ""you must be chuffed, Mr Bitcoin!""... I just had to laugh at that point, and of course make it clear to all 11 of the colleagues on the call that there'd clearly been a bit of Chinese Whispers going on, and that I sadly didn't own a whole Bitcoin.

It's funny really, because it actually shows how early we are in the grand scheme of things. Quite a large portion of society do not know of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin, and little stories like this are a classic case of it! Does anybody else have any similar stories?",cryptocurrency

Here are my thoughts, not sure if all  are viable options:
1) get 0% APR CC to pay off loan balance
2) call lender and ask for reduction in interest with a refinance
3) call lender and see if I can negotiate a lower loan balance if I do a payoff. So maybe suggest an 8k loan payoff to clear the loan vs the full 13k
4) shop for another personal loan to pay off existing

Credit is not the best but better since the beginning of the year.

74. Looks like Cardano is seeing a huge amount of on-chain activity. The crazy part is this is all pre-PAB. Just wait until dApps can actually launch! Unsurprisingly, some supporters of other chains were shocked to realize they didn’t understand the difference between exchange trading volume and actual blockchain use volume.

87. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs.

97. Charles drops a video on the eToro delisting. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse.  It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything.  He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

gaming,Can we please stop buying into the AAA gaming meme?,"For at least the past two years we've been getting royally screwed. AAA game companies are banking on ""early access"" and ""open beta"" to sell their pre-order stuff. Just this last year we've had:

* An extremely scuffed Battlefield 2042 that appears to not have been internally tested at all
* A Call of Duty Vanguard that is so poorly guided that its apparent the PR team didnt pay attention to Battlefield 5 at all
* A Halo Infinite that has more bugs than it should, but is thankfully free to play... for now
* A World of Warcraft content schedule that legitimately planned for Shadowlands to have less content than other expansions
* Another Amazon game that somehow fails to cover bugs and gameplay issues that other games have covered and shown how to resolve

I hate to rehash the same topic of ""stop preordering"" but AAA companies seem to be banking preorders harder than ever at this point. Indie game devs are delivering content that were better QA'd than what we've seen delivered this year by million dollar companies. Im crying out knowing that most people aren't going to listen but stop buying into this bullshit. If you hate what this year has shown in terms of game quality, then show them in the only way they will listen.

personalfinance,Low interest rate loan math,"I'm getting solar panels and the name of the game for installers is to offer low rates to entice people but to hide the financing fees. I'm aware of this so it's not surprising, but it makes it a bit harder to compare loans and rates. 

On every offer I'm getting I'm getting a cash price, so would an effective way to compare loan offers be to use the cash offer as the P (Principle), use the loan total as P+I (Principle+Interest) and solve for the rate? For example:

Cash:  $**14,245.00**

Loan: 20 year @ **$21,109.50**

Solve for rate: \~2.4%

Is this an effective means of comparison against both loans and against investing the sum, or am I making some dumb math mistake?",finance

stocks,Investing for parents,"Hi Guys,

Over the last few years I've been investing relatively successfully and getting some good returns.

During the same time period my dad has inherited some money and has not done a lot with it. He's maxed out his premium bonds (we're UK based) and the rest of the money is in various bank accounts but it's not returning anything due to low interest rates etc. I've mentioned to him on several occasions that he needs to speak to a FA but he's been resistant. Mainly because he's quite risk adverse and doesn't trust people he doesn't know with his money.

My wife mentioned to him the other day that some of my recent investments have done quite well. When he found out he got quite excited at the idea of investing some money with me telling him what to invest in. I guess he trusts me more than an external financial advisor.

My investment style is very much buy in to things I'm confident about and don't check the value very often. The reason being that if it's gone down I'll worry and be tempted to sell and if it's gone up then I'll also be tempted to sell.  This works pretty well for me and ultimately if I lose money, it's my money. I never take money from anything that could affect anything shared between my wife and I.

The problem now is that I feel really pressured by investing someone else's money. It's something I never wanted to do.

Has anyone else done something like this? How do you deal with it?

My strategy is going to be to invest in ""safer"" investments. Things like V, MSFT, SPY, QQQ. Any suggestions for me to investigate and potentially invest in are always welcome as well.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Did you know why Satoshi Nakomoto chose to be anonymous? Its supposedly because of the way US government treated Liberty dollar creator Bernard von NotHaus.,"TLDR: Bernard von NotHaus created a private currency that is backed by gold and US government bought criminal charges against him.


The Liberty Dollar was a private currency system started in 1998 by Bernard von NotHaus, also co-founder of the Royal Hawaiian Mint Company and creator of the Free Marijuana Church of Honolulu. The name of the Indiana based company that produced Liberty Dollars was originally “National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Code” (NORFED), but it was later changed to the less inflammatory name, Liberty Services, to reduce negative attention.


The premise of the Liberty Dollar was that unlike U.S. dollars and many world currencies, each Liberty Dollar was backed by a specific weight in precious metal. $20 Liberty Dollars were set to be one ounce of silver. Unlike most other forms of alternative currencies, each Liberty Dollar carried a U.S. face value, was exchanged for U.S. Dollars, and included not just paper currency but also minted coins. 


By 2007 Liberty Dollar’s attracted the attention of federal government officials. The exact legality of the currency was under debate by many government officials. At first, it was unclear if Liberty Dollars were being passed as counterfeit dollars because their likeness was too similar to the U.S. money, especially in light of the company’s original name. However, Claudia Dickens of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing was quoted as stating that it was not illegal provided that the bills did not say “legal tender”.


This did not last long though since government officials soon found Liberty Dollars in violation of 18 U.S.C § 486 which forbids private citizens or companies from producing coins made of metal that are used for current money. In late 2007 the FBI launched a raid against the company, seizing the Liberty Dollars, the precious metal stores and computers used to store information. Soon after, the Liberty Dollar bank accounts were frozen and the company’s website was shut down. Legal troubles followed with creator Bernard Von NotHaus being convicted of several crimes related to creating his own coins along with one count of conspiracy. These convictions carry potentially steep penalties, that may also include forfeiture of the Liberty Dollars produced in precious metals. This last issue is still being ironed out in court, with the Liberty Dollars being worth $7 million in precious metal.


The legal troubles faces by Bernard Von Nothaus is thought to be the reason why Satoshi Nakamoto chose to remain anonymous rather than expose himself to the mercy of the US government given the political situation at that time.",cryptocurrency

Some facts about Crypto currency.
Worth reading.

1. China did this in Sept 21 suddenly. (Not sure what this means)
2. India will debate a ban on private crypto currency in the Winter session of Parliament 21.
3. El Salvador is using Bitcoin as national currency.
4. Millions of people are 'invested' in various cryptos.
5. Who is right?
6. What should you do?
7. Look at some facts:

a.)  No viable country will hand over currency, monetary policy and stability to a privately held, volatile digital token. We will see national crypto currencies issued by governments and possibly a global one that has oversight of G20 or some such. 

b.)  There is no underlying asset to a digital token. Shares have firms that make products and services. Bonds have borrowers and lenders. Gold and commodities have intrinsic use. Metals are valuable because we give them that value.

It would need a giant global consensus on ONE private crypto for it to become the global currency that some people think will happen. It will NOT happen. Limited circle currencies will be there and may have value in those circles. Meme coins will not replace the dollar. 

c.)  There is a price rise today because there is demand. Cryptocurrency has been called a 'limited supply of nothing'. The minute the demand goes away, the price crashes since there is NO underlying asset. Please get this basic fact clear. 

d.) Crypto today is a gamble. It is like the tulip mania, the emu egg and teak plantation bubbles. Please do not think that you will get super rich by 'investing' in this. Gamble is a better word. 

e. )  And for those who are climate change activists, specially the young, please count the environmental cost of crypto before you decide to get rich on its back. You have huge double standards if you pretend to be environmentally emotional but crypto traders. 

3.  My advice. Stay away. If the itch is too great, treat this like a punt, a gamble and use small amounts of your OWN money. Do not get your parents to break their FDs, SIPs or whatever to enter this tamasha(Theatrical play).
And think why a push back argument gets crypto believers so riled that they get abusive, personal and angry.
Cults prevent your discerning mind to take rational decisions.
Evolution got us from amoeba to having this mind. (Now they suddenly believe in evolution)

Let's use it!

btc,What to Do When Cryptocurrency Is Crashing,"Cryptocurrencies were all the rage this year, with the prices of several coins surging to record highs. But after the spot price of bitcoin, the most popular coin approached $69,000 recently, values have entered a turbulent stage. Though this doesn't mean the rally is over, many would like to know what to do next.

So, what do you do when your digital assets like bitcoin crash? 

**Accept it**

For those who have been investing in cryptocurrencies for years, dramatic gains and losses are nothing new. For seasoned bitcoin investors, lower prices are welcome. See the drop of value in bitcoin as an opportunity to purchase.

**Understand your risk appetite**

Before deciding to invest in bitcoin or other cryptos, consider whether an 80% to 90% down move in your crypto holdings would cause you to lose sleep at night. If the answer is yes, don’t invest.

**Avoid buying large amounts of cryptocurrency all in one shot**

Buy a small amount every month and then just keep doing it, as the price goes up or the price goes down, as opposed to buying it all in this one single crystalized cost which you’re going to have to deal with psychologically for the foreseeable future.

**Hodl and earn**

Fortunately, today many platforms allow you to earn cryptocurrency passively. If you'll see the interest rate in the bank -  you'll probably laugh in the face of the manager, then in the cryptocurrency market, you can earn up to a solid 17% per annum. This approach will only help you to increase your capital in the future.

Let's hope this rally is not over yet. However, always keep your eyes open. Feel free to share your thoughts about your strategy in the comments down below, or enter a couple of discussions in this up-to-date Crypto/DeFi discord [channel](https://discord.com/invite/midas).",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin scam by VALUETRADE.LTD, registered UK Company","Hello good people.

I am 31 years old, and not very stupid, even though it might seem so when you finish this post.

I wish this **doesn't happen** to anyone else, and for that reason I write this here.

I will make it as short as possible. Excluding personal information

I was searching for opportunities to **invest Bitcoin**.

Found a company registered in the UK, number **08307335. Valuetrade LTD. In the past AAYAAN LTD. owned by Ali and Natasha Usman since 2012, seemed completely legitimate.**

**\*\*\*They target people that invest in Bitcoin, through Telegram\*\*\***

**Diving in:**

**First**, these are the facts:

They offer investment plans with earnings, in bitcoin, on a web-based system. Every investment plan has a price range, marked by fixed dollar margins:

**Plans:** **(1)** 0 - 499 **(2)** 500 - 2,999 **(3)** 3,000 - 14999 **(VIP)** 15,000+

**Earning &amp; Timelapse: (1)** 10% in 1day **(2)** 30% in 2d **(3)** 50% in 7d **(VIP)** 100% in 21d

**Rules:** There are no deposit limits, no withdrawal fees, no delays.

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:** Sign On in the website [www.valuetrade.ltd](http://www.valuetrade.ltd/) , choose a deposit amount and plan, and make a transfer of chosen amount to a fixed wallet 

Their wallet for me is **1HEyxoXoA3Wqwex6WmZhdm2YcoFq1uhg2q** 

The site uses a system that marks the bitcoin decimals in any transaction by a fixed dollar price, but transactions are tied to bitcoin decimals. This makes it so when transferring to a certain plan, whatever arrives is what counts, not your intention.

Service is done through a telegram group. I followed the group for a while before investing. 1,800 members with usually 100 online, and a constant hype of successful deposits and withdrawals. The client service is done on private messages in Telegram too.

**Second**, this is what happened:

(Decimals are Bitcoin. Timestamps are -3 GMT)

**Deposits**:

**(1) Oct-29-2021 06:24:08 AM - Deposit - .00833 btc (504$)**

**(1) Oct-31-2021 01:26:00 PM - Deposit Return and withdrawal - .01089 (668$)**

**(2) Oct-31-2021 01:36:00 PM - Deposit - .01454 btc (880$)**

I requested withdrawal as shown above, and received the full sum with this information:

**Wallet** bc1q58z7gwl3g2mfx83j0gc5w0e7l9lr0ux2lzggh5kyjuf05cfe27fsgyzlwx

**Hash** 4fbf7e56c65ea713a4c49dab29f41e179106c9fed8c57e0dbb20d0dee47f759e

The second deposit was frozen because I wasn't eligible to invest in the level 2 plan again, only once is allowed **(NEW RULE).** I was then offered the option to invest a larger sum that will be added to the frozen sum **(2)**, and reflected in the website. So I deposited:

**(2) Nov-12-2021 01:16:21 PM - Deposit - .048585 btc (3,125$)**

A total of **3,990$** did reflect on the website, in the level 3 plan, 7 day time lapse.

This brought trust, and I deposited a sum to be reflected in the level 2 plan:

**(3) Nov-13-2021 2:46:39 AM - Deposit - .047 btc (at moment of transfer it was 2,990$)**

This sum was frozen too because it arrived over the price margin. (3,003$)

A solution was offered, another deposit will solve the issue:

**(4)** **Nov-13-2021 2:47:51 AM - Deposit - .03761 btc (2,395$)**

2 days elapsed, and this last deposit made its profit:**(4) Nov-15-2021 01:29:04 AM - Deposit Return and Withdrawal - .04746 (3,122$).**

**Wallet** 3PWnRCpmRV6ijCnWKo9xrgV9HeUkywBTpb

**Hash** 82aceb16c9d94fb7b479e07ddbcbe3afc7b109703189c87be6f7f01ea3b53f3c

I deposited once more with what I withdrew as follows:

**(5) Nov-15-2021 03:36:36 AM - Deposit - .04486 (2,952$)**

Total **Deposit** so far: ±9,945$

Total **Profit** so far: ±890$

**And here it starts for real:**

On the 16th, I get an e-mail saying I am eligible for a bonus reward. A sum 97,650$

But, there is a massive **Rule change**. I am told by the admin that I cannot withdraw my past investments until I complete the requirements.

Requirements\*\*:\*\*

Buy VIP membership and invest in a plan. (1) a non-refundable **payment** of 1,500$, and (2) an **investment** of above 15,000$. This will reinstate my withdrawal capabilities.

I paid for the VIP membership, through a direct wallet to wallet transfer, **without the web interface:**

**(6) Nov-18 1:59 AM- Payment - .0251 (1,500$)**

**Wallet:** 17XLrLmeUon47b4RtP3YiweaXH18rWsNBW

**Hash:** 5636ee939815569f507bc3b79376f1b443525420d08d3c58a1a3e2ee5bf4413c

6 hours later I took care of the second step, I sent **15,050$**, which delayed 4 hours in arriving and reflected as **14,840$** on their system after a big bitcoin price dip.

**(7) Nov-18 8:04 AM- Deposit - .25128 (14,840$)**

**Wallet:** 1HEyxoXoA3Wqwex6WmZhdm2YcoFq1uhg2q

**Hash:** 4991d314815ae7e827a20d5251a83f206cfd9a445dd2b6e4a5f97836f671ef73

I am told by the admin that he is **unable to manipulate the system.**

the solution is to **deposit again**. Until then, this amount and **all else** is frozen.

At this point I ran out of bitcoin, and so, asking for help in the same telegram group Valuetrade has, a member that doesn't know me offers to complete the amount I am missing, since he trusts the company. This person from Telegram sends the missing amount:

**(Loan) Nov-21 04:22 PM - Receive - .07549 (4,450$)**

**Wallet:** 3McUqozvq4Fo4G6hLPi9JfoWjEHdiVURCM

**Hash:** 2c80aa5bb58c99f47ddfecf2936d33518b149fe4e5da95965b3743959f0e7129

As this completed the requirement, I immediately make my last deposit on this ride:

**(8)** **Nov-21-2021 6:18:00 PM - Deposit - .26431 (15,700$)**

According to agreement, all is now available for withdrawal.

By the time the admin responds hours later, he insists I have delayed too long and for that reason, the **rules change again**. Now there is a **FEE of 10%** on withdrawals, paid up front.

This is where I realised **FINALLY** that it is a scam. This is my current position. I am just delaying right now.

The person who loaned me money is probably a part of it, or the same person.

**Total invested so far:** 0.67 bitcoin worth about **±39,250$,** not all of which was mine to start with.

(Not including 1,500$ VIP payment, and the loan of .07549).

**Supposed account balance to withdraw:** 111,979.10$

No negotiation has proved fruitful. He insists he has no power to manipulate the system and only a 0.1 deposit will allow me to withdraw 1 bitcoin. **A new 5,000$ deposit for 50,000$ withdrawal**. This deposit is done in the same way the VIP payment was made, sort of off the books, wallet to wallet.

I ask for information, proof, time, my investment back, anything. To no avail.

All I get is threats to act fast and deposit, or else rules change again.

I do not know why I didn't stop before, apparently there is something for me to learn here.

A wise man once told me, ""Bitcoin came to teach something, to all of us""

I am lucky to have the family I have.

**Done**

Questions to this awesome community:

1. Does anyone think this is legit? Am I wrongly accusing?
2. Do you think it is possible for me to recover my losses?
3. Do you think it advisable to take legal actions against this company?
4. Does anyone know someone that might help me and my family with this situation?

I filed a report on [ic3.gov](https://ic3.gov/).

I added all information and proof I could gather from the website and telegram, added what I could to this post. I have further information available.

I can't believe they scam like this and leave so much information available.

Please help warn people.

personalfinance,Pay student loans or back door Roth,"Hey all! I have about $120k saved up from the pandemic pausing student loan payments.

My question is,should I do a back door Roth for myself (and my wife?) for $12k this year, or just hold off on it and pay that extra towards my loans to try and get rid of that payment asap?

Thanks!

*EDIT*
I should comment that I am leaning towards forgoing the 12k Roth conversion this year and paying down the loans. I know time in the market is an important thing and these back door conversions may not be around all that long, but the freedom of being debt free (besides car/mortgage) would be very nice!",finance

cardano,Help Me Understand What I'm Investing In,"TL;DR  Cardano allows me to become my own micro lending institution.

I saw an interview Charles did in which he described the lending rates in African countries, the interest rates seem very high even when compared to my own native payday loan style lending businesses.

(I live in the US).

Link to that interview here: [https://youtu.be/5-vsuU-OIhI](https://youtu.be/5-vsuU-OIhI)

So as I understand it, crypto currencies allow the transfer of value across vast distances more efficiently than traditional lending institutions. Due to this technological advantage, their business model allows them to provide a service to a demographic of people who are seen as non-viable clients to traditional banks, the un-banked. However, these emerging markets have access to cell phones and global telecommunication systems which puts them in the same realm as me, a rando in the US with some dollars that I don't immediately need for anything. So, rather than leave this money in a savings account, which gives me back little to nothing. I've used some of my liquidity to buy some ADA in the hopes that eventually, Cardano will become a major player in the world of micro-finance for the ""developing world."" News about their deals in Africa give me much encouragement as these are the places that would greatly benefit from stable currencies.

 Essentially, I think of it like Uber, which connects people that need rides with people that have cars. Cardano connects people who have liquidity with people that need money. Yes, the blockchain will take its cut, but it will loan money to the un-banked at a less predatory rate than they currently have access to and will give me a higher return on my money than a savings account. Am I wrong in thinking this way? Help me understand.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,JPMorgan Lists Ethereum As A Better Investment Than Bitcoin,"Ethereum has proved itself be to a force to be reckoned with and big bank JPMorgan agrees. When it comes to performance, Ethereum has outperformed rival Bitcoin, although the latter remains the most valuable cryptocurrency in the space. However, if history is any indication to go by, then Bitcoin may not be in the lead for much longer.

Analysts at JPMorgan recently released a report on cryptocurrencies and their potential. Although the note acknowledged the ability of Bitcoin, it also puts Ethereum ahead of the leading cryptocurrency in coming years. The report based its argument on the utility of both assets. While Bitcoin is good for its monetary policy, Ethereum has proven to be even better.

#Invest In Ethereum
The JPMorgan note outlined how Etheruem could prove to be the better bet compared to Bitcoin in the long wrong. Bitcoin may still be the most valuable cryptocurrency, but with climbing interest rates, Ethereum could end up faring better.

“The rise in bond yields and the eventual normalization of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on bitcoin as a form of digital gold, the same way higher real yields have been putting downward pressure on traditional gold,” said the analysts.

This is because as interest and inflation rates rise, more investors will flock towards decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which offer more attractive interest rates than traditional finance. Given that majority of these DeFi protocols are built on the Ethereum blockchain, it will only drive more adoption in the digital asset, providing it more room to grow than Bitcoin.

In the note, JPMorgan also points to the budding NFT, gaming, and stable coins portion of the market. This makes it a “safer” bet than Bitcoin when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies, which are infamous for their volatility. As interest rates rise, its underlying utility should be able to help it maintain its value, the note reads.

“With Ethereum deriving its value from its applications, ranging from DeFi to gaming to NFTs and stablecoins, it appears less susceptible than bitcoin to higher real yields.”
Outperformance For The Future
Analysts at world-leading bank JPMorgan also put forward other reasons that Ethereum could end up being a better investment option than Bitcoin. One of these was the fact that the altcoin has consistently outperformed Bitcoin year-over-year. The numbers for 2021 alone show a wide margin when both digital assets are compared side by side in terms of performance.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Tranquil Finance for Harmony is the future,"Let me start off by saying that I am not trying to Shill Tranquil Finance but its hard not to after experiencing it first hand.

I realize that Defi already exists with AAVE &amp; Compound, however my experience hasn't been great. Maybe its different for other coins but when I used AAVE, I put my ETH down as Collateral to borrow a loan. The problem is those damn gas fees. I borrowed like 2k but had to pay over 200 dollars worth of Gas Fees which I thought was ridiculous. I realize this isnt AAVE's fault and im sure that other coins within their ecosystem dont have these high fees but its what I experienced with ETH.

I then realized that I have Harmony One. Im heavily invested in this coin and its been doing amazing so far and I believe in this project immensely. My profits have been great and I could cash out on my profits but I didnt want to deal with taking those Harmony out at the risk of Harmony skyrocketing one day. After all, its only 3 billion market cap right now and the space is destined to grow.

This is where Tranquil Finance comes in and im allowed to borrow against my Harmony and actually get payed for borrowing money.  Ive provided examples of rewards being offered right now along with the interest rate being given to me for borrowing Harmony One.

CryptoCurrency,"The current front page post about the European Union's ""Proposal for EU Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets"" does not mention the text banning stablecoin interest.","As the title says, [the current EU proposal on crypto](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593) includes some troubling language about stablecoin interest:

*""Article 36*

*Prohibition of interest*

*Issuers of asset-referenced tokens or crypto-asset service providers shall not provide for interest or any other benefit related to the length of time during which a holder of asset-referenced tokens holds asset-referenced assets.""*

*""Article 45*

*Prohibition of interests*

*By derogation to Article 12 of Directive 2009/110/EC, no issuer of e-money tokens or crypto-asset service providers shall grant interest or any other benefit related to the length of time during which a holder of e-money tokens holds such e-money tokens.""*

This means Celsius, YouHodler, BlockFi, and any other crypto lending platform, AKA ""crypto-asset service provider"", would no longer be able to provide interest on stablecoins. As far as I understand, this was added to protect banks and their tiny or even negative interest rates, as this legislation was drafted with the help of bankers and banking associations. Not great.

&amp;#x200B;

DeFi stablecoin farming may not be safe either, but that would likely depend on whether or not the DeFi platform is fully decentralized and if it falls under the definition of a ""crypto-asset service provider"". The definition of a crypto-asset service provider is as such:

*""(8) ‘crypto-asset service provider’ means any person whose occupation or business is the provision of one or more crypto-asset services to third parties on a professional basis;*

*(9) ‘crypto-asset service’ means any of the services and activities listed below relating to any crypto-asset:*

*(a) the custody and administration of crypto-assets on behalf of third parties;*

*(b) the operation of a trading platform for crypto-assets;*

*(c) the exchange of crypto-assets for fiat currency that is legal tender;*

*(d) the exchange of crypto-assets for other crypto-assets;*

*(e) the execution of orders for crypto-assets on behalf of third parties;*

*(f) placing of crypto-assets;*

*(g) the reception and transmission of orders for crypto-assets on behalf of third parties*

*(h) providing advice on crypto-assets;""*

&amp;#x200B;

The reception to the proposal so far has been fairly positive, but this piece of information may sour some people's opinions - it definitely did mine. Also, this post is not meant to deride the other post about this proposal, as from what I can tell the rest of the information in it is accurate and these couple of paragraphs are fairly easy to miss.

CryptoCurrency,A rigorous comparison between ADA vs. ALGO,"This is a very controversial subject, given how: (1) Everyone on this sub loves and shills ALGO, and; (2) People either love ADA or hate it on this sub depending on market conditions. Therefore, it makes sense to start with a disclaimer about me and my goals in making this post.

**Disclaimer:** I don't care about price or market cap whatsoever, b/c I'm more interested in the technical future of this field than short-term moonshots; the only thing I care about are the technical claims made by formal research driven by the blockchains' respective foundations and the tradeoffs therein. I'm gonna be using my background knowledge in theoretical computer science and abstract math (which, of course, does not even *begin* to compare to that of Charles or Silvio) to make these comparisons, so I'll probably have to do a Satoshi and claim that ""if you're not gonna get it, then I don't have time to explain it to you"" (he allegedly said this on the forums in the early days of BTC.) My goal is to determine the most sound way of doing things in this field from a technical and formal mathematical perspective, so stick with me on this if and only if you're doing it for the tech.

I'm gonna be comparing the following attributes of each cryptocurrency:

1. Decentralization
2. Scalability (both current and future outlook)
3. Security guarantees
4. Programmability of smart contracts and other on-chain user-programs
5. Monetary policy
6. Long-term goals and ecosystem culture
7. Current and future use-cases

Let's get started!

**Decentralization (winner: tie)**

First, we have to qualify how exactly we're measuring this; pretty much every competitor in this space is using this word in their marketing, but there's no objective way to compare the respective decentralization of two general blockchains. In the absence of a standard, I'm gonna go with the ones that are most important to me as a long-term investor:

- Hardware requirements for a full-node (your own copy of the chainstate) and for a stake-pool (handling staking on your own computers without having to go through any third-party)
- [Balaji Srinivasan's Nakamoto Coefficient](https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e)

Starting with ALGO, we first observe that there are multiple different kinds of nodes; you can either have a non-relay/non-archival node (the bare minimum you need to have your own independent copy of the chainstate), or you can provide features incl. relay and archiving optionally for rewards directly from the Foundation (there's no ""staking"" per se, all coins are pre-mined). The requirements to run a participation node (no special services and no rewards) are trivial -- it can be done on a Raspberry Pi -- but the requirements for archival and staking are two vCPU cores and 4GB RAM (roughly $20/mo. in the cloud).

ADA, on the other hand, requires roughly 8GB (16GB is recommended) of RAM to run a full-node (e.g., with Daedalus). For staking, you need 2 vCPU cores, 8GB of RAM, along with 1GB bandwidth per hour, and about 30GB of disk space to run the database -- all on a public/static IPv4 address. This will probably run you $20-40/mo. on a cloud provider.

The requirements for the two aren't all that different -- ADA's is slightly higher -- but I do want to note that Cardano is focused on lessening the barrier to adoption by relaxing the requirements to be part of the network, e.g., through [Mithril](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/29/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency/), whereas ALGO qualifies that the requirements might increase over time. With that said, there isn't enough here to sweat it, as I'm sure ALGO will manage to keep the requirements low over time as well.

Re. Nakamoto coefficient, you can refer to [the latest blockchain stats](https://adapools.org/groups) to see that we have roughly N=25 (higher is better). I'm not sure how to compute the same thing for ALGO from the metrics, but I'll hazard a guess that it's around the same. There's also the caveat that Nakamoto coefficient is expected to double for ADA when the K-parameter is relaxed in due time.

I'm calling this a tie b/c ALGO seems _slightly_ more decentralized now, but ADA has a formal mathematical plan to become more decentralized as more stake is introduced.

**Scalability (winner: ALGO, although it's close)**

It's really no competition here if you're considering TPS on the main-chain today; ALGO has TPS in the thousands, whereas ADA is upper-bounded at 4-6 TPS until the block size increases.

With that said, ADA does have an entire Basho era dedicated to securely offloading work onto sidechains, and Hydra is in the testing phase, so it's arguably apples to oranges; as Charles often argues, TPS is an oversimplification of the scalability problem b/c there's a difference between settlement on sidechains as opposed to on the main-chain (also discounting highly-complex transactions that can happen ""for free"" per block or even _between_ blocks).

I think it suffices to say that ALGO is what is scalable **today**, whereas ADA has an entirely different approach to the whole scalability problem that we haven't even seen the beginning of yet. I'm calling this one in favor of ALGO gang, but it's really close, b/c we haven't seen anything from Basho yet.

**Security guarantees (winner: tie)**

TBH, both of these chains have pretty much the same cryptographic guarantees; in either case, you need a supermajority of the stake-holders to be honest in order for the chain to work.

The comparison is really between ALGO's cryptographic sortition for block production and ADA's Ouroboros protocol. I'm calling this a tie, b/c this is an _incredibly_ hard choice; while ALGO uses all kinds of fancy cryptographic primitives like VRFs, ADA has the Ouroboros protocol family, which gets more and more impressive to me with each new release.

Don't get me wrong: Ouroboros is impressive to me b/c each generation builds on and strengthens the assumptions of the last to offer guarantees against different attack vectors; this is a DEEP rabbit hole to go down, but a sufficient TL;DR is that the latest generations -- Praos and Chronos -- are the first to formalize a notion of ""time"" on the blockchain so that attackers can't use real-time conditions induced by an evolving stakeholder population to exploit the system. With that said, this is all some silicon voodoo that 99% of you don't actually care about, so I'm not gonna give it to ADA b/c of this.

**Programmability (winner: ADA)**

The background info here is that ALGO supports smart-contracts using Python or a JavaScript-like language called Reach, whereas ADA has its own Turing-complete programming language for smart contracts through Plutus (built on Haskell). Personally, I'm a huge fan of Haskell, along with other advancements in formal methods of programming language theory that ADA takes advantage of, but I'll try not to let that bias get to me.

I'm giving it to ADA b/c, when you write a smart contract, you want as many formal guarantees provided by the system as possible (there's money on the line, and nobody wants to lose it). ALGO does better in this space than many other chains, having formal verification against things like memory leaks and integer/buffer overflows, but the formal methods supported by Haskell/Plutus in ADA are on a whole other league; you can mathematically _prove_ that the outcome of a smart contract is going to be one that is explicitly defined by the developer on Plutus, and you can similarly prove complex mathematical theorems using the underlying Haskell-based infrastructure. From the rigorous perspective of a computer scientist and a theoretical mathematician, ALGO provides the basics for you to avoid shooting yourself in the foot, whereas ADA changes the whole smart-contracts game.

**Monetary Policy (winner: ADA)**

In this respect, ADA is a spiritual successor to Bitcoin, following the fixed-supply and halving cycles, whereas all ALGO is pre-mined and distributed to network participants by the Foundation.

Personally, I think monetary policy was one of the only things that Bitcoin did right; the point of this whole blockchain space, as it is, evolved from the idea of digital _scarcity_ in a _decentralized_ setting; ADA moves that foundation forward, whereas ALGO's monetary policy is effectively a centralization on the Foundation. I'm not saying this takes away from the decentralization of the chain itself -- otherwise, I'd have brought it up in the **Decentralization** section -- but I am qualifying that ALGO's decentralization depends on that of the Algorand Foundation (a legal entity operating as non-profit in either Switzerland or Singapore, I forget which) itself.

**Long-term goals and ecosystem culture (winner: tie)**

It wouldn't really be fair of me to give this to one chain or another, as both communities have done great things for the advancement of the space, but I will say that I really appreciate the Cardano/Africa movement for bringing decentralization and security in the economic and legal systems to the people in the world who need it most. Algorand is probably doing something equally impressive on the nation-state side, but it sounds like Algorand is doing some [equally-impressive things](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/colombian-government-selects-vitalpass-as-nations-official-digital-vaccination-passport) to advance blockchain-driven solutions in developing nations.

Both Foundations are clearly very active and involved in the process of bringing blockchain to the third-world, so I can't ask for much more (at least not when the rest of the market has its money in meme coins).

**Current and future use-cases (winner: ADA, but really close)**

It's a very close comparison b/c they have largely the same goals and a lot of similar technical foundations, but I'm giving it to ADA on the basis of Plutus being built specifically for high-assurance and high-complexity smart-contracts, whereas ALGO seems to be more geared for the average Joe developer. Again, I'm somewhat biased here as a Haskell-enthusiast, but as far as correctness-critical blockchain applications go (e.g., controlling the flight conditions of a plane in real-time on the blockchain,) you don't care how hard the programming language is to learn as long as you're sure the output is code that people can trust with pretty much theirs and their loved ones' whole lives.

Hopefully, it's clear why I'm claiming that Cardano is a better technical foundation for some things than Algorand is, but the approachability of Algorand development more than makes up for this in the short-term.

**Conclusion (winner: tie)**

They're both brilliant projects brought to creation by the most gifted and technically-capable scientists and engineers of our generation; you can't really go wrong investing in either community and initiative. Personally, I'm a lot more bullish on ADA than this sub is when the price drops, but that's b/c I see it as a technical foundation of the likes of Algorand that is going to be the backbone of human interaction based on value, identity, and governance, for years to come.

TL;DR: Any newcomer in this space should take a look at projects like these that expand the sphere of what is possible with the technological primitives rather than defaulting to BTC+ETH for long-term investments and memecoins for short-term speculation.",cryptocurrency

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds. Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.",cryptocurrency
defi,"In the murky waters of Defi, we are finally starting to see greater stability and profit from bonding and the OlympusDAO forks","[https://twitter.com/bsc\_daily/status/1463847437605519364?s=20](https://twitter.com/bsc_daily/status/1463847437605519364?s=20)

I'm on the lookout for new and exciting innovations to the Ohm fork on BSC and I think I found an early entry with Atlantis protocol.  We see many exploits and pump and dumps surrounding our investments, and after a long time in Defi, there's little light at the end of the tunnel as you constantly see great protocols get trashed by bots and whales.

The Ohm forks are becoming popular and bonding is now part of the key to security and longevity. This gives the investors the chance to receive collateral for donating their coins to a protocol. While locking the coins, you are able to take ""sell"" pressure out of the float. The bonded coins cannot be sold, which increases the price floor.

The collateral given is a reserve currency, similar to the current banking system with the federal reserve. The main differences/takeaway is that these reserve currencies are capped and decentralized with governance voting, allowing the investors to control the treasury.

CryptoCurrency,"Am I the only one hesitant to stake because ""not your keys, not your coins""?","As I read the conversations around taxes and exit strategies, I notice a lot of people suggesting staking crypto rather than exchanging to fiat. I'll admit there are some very attractive rates available, even for those of us who plan on hodling long term... But what about ""not your keys, not your coins?"" 

For as long as I can remember, this has been a cornerstone of advice in the crypto community - but it seems the possibility of making profit makes that go out the window entirely. I'll admit there are times I worry and think ""What if I lose my keys? What if I type the wrong address somewhere? Wouldn't it be easier to have a team of (hopefully) professionals handle that for me?""

Am I allowed to consider it “additional income” or just included in my gross income? For example like on credit applications that ask for gross income or other income verifications? I tried to figure it out myself but tax codes are incredibly complicated.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Any interest sites with reoccurring trades besides BlockFi,"Hey all

Until yesterday I was using BlockFi for weekly reoccurring buys of ETH. And on top of that i also collected interest. Now since all the changes lately BlockFi is not an option anymore so does anybody know any alternatives. Now the closest i am to that is I have some funds on nexo and on celsius from yesterday. Celsius has superior interest rates but nexo offer swap. So theoretically i could dca each week by manual swaps, but i really like that automatic trades. So even I have an emotional pinch it buys.

TLDR: I am searching for a site that has reoccurring trades like BlockFI if anyone knows one",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Issues on Terra : Need Quick Actions,"Dear Terra

I have faith in your project. I am optimistic about the future of decentralized money. Do not give up on your L1 future; instead, work even harder to become a blockchain where people will spend their time and money in the future. There are many issues with your project ( outlined below) . I don't think it's too late, but these things are like a tumor: they only become worse with time, and cancer spread in Terra's body

1. **Teams:** The teams that TFL (Do) is assembling are not organically formed teams full of A players. Instead, they are quickly assembled batches of young people who are told to go off on their own and be entrepreneurs and lead these protocols to greatness.. It, unfortunately, does not work like that. Firstly only a tiny microcosm of the population is suited to be entrepreneurs, and worse yet gathering a team together who have not formed organically diminishes the likelihood of success by a significant magnitude.
2. **Decentralized Command:** Do seems to be failing to decentralize his command. He assembles the teams around him (grabs people for Pylon and Valkyrie and tells them to start working on those projects), but he has no time to actually micro manage the projects. I think Do is stuck between a rock and a hard place here.. However, he should be hiring VPs underneath him who can actually help micro manage projects until they are confident they have the right people on the teams, and they are in a position to spin off and become independent. Pylon for example was supposed to spin off and become its own project, but it failed at this and Do &amp; company had to pull them back under the wing of TFL. On the community AMA that Do did about how to improve Pylon, the Pylon team said “we need more resources”, a true entrepreneur has no such outlet to go to someone and say “in order to be successful we need more resources from you”.
3. **Compensation:** I have heard restlessly about the poor level of compensation that TFL gives employees. This is beyond confusing to me.. Do is one of the richest people in Korea, strikes me that he would want to compensate his people extremely well. Instead I hear stories of people getting robbed of their tokens (never receiving what they were promised). And it is all held under the shadows as if these individuals spoke out against the almighty Do Kwon they would be publicly shamed in the community they have come to love. I can speak their truths for them through this channel.. It’s complete bullshit, and I wonder how much of this contributes to point number 1.
4. **Culture:** I’m not sure if it’s the nature of remote work for the TFL organization, but almost top to bottom we have issues communicating with these people. It seems that for every issue the entire TFL team leans back to “we can’t support in that way because thats up to the projects” they seem to wash their hands entirely of getting involved in supporting projects. It’s amazing that a nascent ecosystem like Terra has convinced themselves that they don’t need to do anything to support projects. What I actually think it is is pure laziness. People just not wanting to do much and receive that so-so pay check from old TFL. (I know these are harsh words, but it’s the harsh reality from my POV). Go back to points 2 &amp; 3 for datapoints on why this may be happening.

**Solutions:**

Now that I have called out some of the major issues from my POV let me explain some of my thoughts on what to do / what the solutions might be.

1. **Wake up call:** There is a lott of slack it seems in TFL right now. People are more than comfortable doing nothing to support projects, and generally these people at TFL seem to have no fear that a project will go above them directly to Do and complain (I think this is because they threaten the weight of TFL, and feel if a project does that they will simply blacklist that project from their support — which keep in mind there is no support). I believe part of this also is that people do not view their jobs as being setup to support projects — this is another area of rationalization. I believe a lot of TFLs job at this point should be to support projects in small ways where they can. Instead there is a “not my job, and if you go to my boss directly you’ll never get an ounce of support from us” culture.. Well guess what.. Fuck that, I’ll write this article instead.
2. **Get the right people:** Hiring at all levels right now seems to be a lot for TFL.. Maybe try getting some more diversity? Bring in some people from different backgrounds. Pay them really well to get them in the door. Don’t shove General Managers in front of the community before you are 110% sure they are the right leader for the project.
3. **Support the fucking projects building:** Your current culture is “not my job, there are 1000 projects building you are nothing but one of those! Why should I waste my time?” Wrong answer.. You need to help people, if it is not clear to your employees that this is part of their jobs, make it clear and publicly state to the community of builders that if there is an issue, they should reach out to you directly (Do I am talking to you). If you are not staffed appropriately to support, guess what — hire some more people. We are far from Terra being a totally independent L1, so better scale up to support on this journey.
4. **Reset expectations for investors in the eco-fund: It is not enough to just write seed checks to projects to later dump on Retail, we need Investors to use the products people build. You have a role in setting the stage for that, do not wash your hands of this.**

personalfinance,Home Equity Loan or Line of Credit?,"Good morning!

We are beginning the process of some renovations in a rather old house. The house is fully paid off, so we don't currently have a mortgage to worry about.

Our budget for renovations is $300k. We applied for a HELOC and got approved with a variable rate of prime -. 75%. 10 year interest only draw period, then 15 years interest/principle payments.

Our worry is the variable rate. Rates are super low right now, but I keep hearing that they are going to increase, and the thought of not knowing what the payments could be in 10 years stresses me out.

The alternative wound be securing a 15-year home equity loan for the full amount now, with a slightly higher but fixed interest rate (3.75%). I guess that means we'd be paying full payments almost immediately, when the actual work probably won't be completed for at least another year.

So what makes more sense?",finance

personalfinance,Ways to minimize the massive taxation rate on my bonus?,"Hi Everyone, 

I recently accepted a position where I will be making a substantial amount of income from an annual bonus. In summary, my base will be 150k and my target annual bonus is 125k.

My understanding is that bonuses are taxed as supplemental income, and the current federal supplemental income tax rate is 22%. However, both New York State and City have their own supplemental tax rates of 13.78% and 4.25%. 

So basically, I’ll be paying a total tax rate of 40.03% on my bonus, which obviously sucks.

My question is, are there ways to minimize the amount I owe on this amount. For instance, is it allowed and possible to pull all of my 401k and IRA contributions from my bonus? Can I pay my medical, dental, and vision taxes from my bonus for the previous years out of my bonus?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",finance
stocks,Retail Stocks Sink Amid Strong Black Friday Sales. Blame Covid Variant Fears,"Retail stocks, along with the broader market, were down Friday morning as fears of a new Covid-19 variant hammered the market amid potentially strong Black Friday sales. Shares of Dollar Tree (DLTR), which sells the majority of its products—including toys, home decor, kitchenware, and seasonal goods—was down nearly 4% to $140.81. Nordstrom (JWN) was down 7% at $21.04. Macy’s (M) was off 7.2%. Retailers that struggled to keep up with supply-chain crunches—as noted in their third-quarter earnings—including Kohls (KSS) and Gap (GPS) were down 2.1% to $54.09, and 3.4% to $17.25, respectively. Shares of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) were down 3.3% to $37.98.

For the most part though, retail stocks have been gaining amid high demand this year. The SPDR S&amp;P Retail exchange-traded fund (XRT) is up 50.05% this year as of Friday morning, still on pace for its best year since 2009, when it rose 74.8%. The ETF is down 2.8% in Friday trading. The Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary ETF (RCD) is up nearly 25% this year, a sign that despite the previous Delta variant, shoppers are ready to spend their cash and investors recognize the demand.

Data from Friday morning showed U.S. consumers are expected to spend $12.9 billion in online sales and have already spent $6.9 billion online during Thanksgiving Day, up 1.1% from last year, according to data from Salesforce. The National Retail Federation estimates 58.1 million people will shop on Small Business Saturday, and 62.8 million will shop online on Cyber Monday. The trade organization projects consumers will spend an average of $997.73, with total spending up as much as 10.5% to $859 billion this season.

U.S. online sales for the first three weeks of November are up 10% year-over-year, $74 billion already spent, as consumers continue to fit in holiday shopping as early as possible over concerns regarding shipping delays and supply chain issues, according to Salesforce.

The Dow was on track for its worst Black Friday on record, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on pace for their worst Black Friday since 2009.

CryptoCurrency,This Bitcoin Metric Suggest More Blood As BTC Drops 6% (Take with a grain of salt),"Bitcoin wrapped up this past Thanksgiving night with a bloody trading session. The first crypto by market cap was rejected as it made its way to $60,000 and has dropped over 6% in the 24-hour chart. As of press time, BTC trades at $54,084 but seems at risk of further downside.

Besides Bitcoin, the traditional finance market took a hefty dive on news of a recently discovered COVID-19 variant in Africa. This wrack havoc across many sectors with the S&amp;P 500 and DOW Jones recording an almost 3% loss in the past 24 hours.

As 2020 and 2021 have shown, Bitcoin shows a high correlation with traditional markets during periods of macroeconomic development. Thus, one of the reasons the benchmark crypto has been trending to the downside as investors could fear a new phase of lockdown across the world to prevent the alleged new variant from spreading.

The U.S. Dollar as measured by the DXY Index has also taken a dive with a 0.71% loss in the 24-hour chart. The currency was showing significant strength since November 10th, when the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted at the beginning of tapering but was rejected at the 97-price mark.

The U.S. dollar rally has been attributed as one of the reasons Bitcoin display weaknesses in the past week. A rejection at these levels could provide BTC’s price with some relief allowing it to make a more convincing rally into $60,000 and uncharted territory if it’s able to prevent more downside in the short term.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Back in intensive master's program: what do I do with CC debt I can't pay off?,"**TL;DR** Took on another master's degree so I can earn more, but have $25k CC debt that I can't make payments on. What do?

Hey, lovely people, as you can imagine I feel like I'm drowning and would so appreciate some advice about my CC debt.

My relevant story:  

* Irish-American dual-citizen 36F
* Lost job as office manager to COVID in April 2020
* Had medical issues between July 2020-January 2021 and couldn't work (medical issues all resolved now thankfully)
* $18K CC debt at that point
* Stayed on top of CC interest payments using state (Massachusetts) and Fed unemployment income
* Got engaged to my fiance in February 2021 and we planned to move to France together
* So, I started learning French and did a program to become an English teacher rather than work 
* I sold my car in July 2021 and reduced CC debt to $10K 
* My partner was going to help me pay the rest of my CC debt by taking care of our rent in France while I taught English
* Everything seemed to be going great at that point ... 
* But really soon after we moved to France in July, we broke up (I feel mostly because relationship difficulties due to his combat PTSD, but that's for another subreddit)
* So, in the turmoil of the breakup I move back to my native Ireland and gratefully my Mom has put me up
* I had the choice in August to go back to work in Ireland and, granted, I could've taken the opportunity then to clear off my remaining CC debt 
* But education is really cheap in Ireland compared to the US and the programs are generally shorter/more intense, I had had my sights set on an exciting new life in France (rather than working a boring office job in Ireland), and my line of work, while paid OK, is super deadend 
* So, rather than be super sensible, I gambled on doing a (second) master's degree, hopefully getting onto a better-paid career track, and aiming to pay off my debt at a later point
* The program is fully paid for, I have enough in my Irish bank account to get through the rest of the degree, and I can live at my Mom's through the end of the program
* But I'm now $25k in CC debt, and because the program is so intensive I don't have a spare second to work and can't make payments until I'm finished classes and back working in May 2022

There are no repercussions of the debt at present seen as I'm not even in the US, but I would love to move back to the States at some point after the master's program and I'm not sure what is the best strategy I should take.

Can anyone recommend any options for me? 

\[And yes, I feel like a bit of a goon and like I may have made a mistake making this gamble seen as I really don't want to live in Ireland long-term, but c'est la vie\]

Bitcoin,Macroeconomics checkin,"**Assertion 1: The federal reserve can't raise rates above around 5%.** The government would be paying 50% of tax revenue to interest payments if  bonds had the same yield they did in the year 2000. In 2000, the 10-year treasury bond yielded 6.7% ([https://www.multpl.com/10-year-treasury-rate/table/by-year](https://www.multpl.com/10-year-treasury-rate/table/by-year)). Today, the federal government has $29T in debt and $4T in yearly tax revenue ([https://www.usdebtclock.org/](https://www.usdebtclock.org/)). 6.7% \* $29T = $2T. This creates a sort of natural cap on how high the federal reserve can raise interest rates (they went up to 15% to fight inflation in the 1970s and 80s.) Thus, they'll have no choice but to stay between 2% and 5% until inflation eats up the debt (which you'll see by a increase in GDP and thus an increase in taxes, both in dollar-terms but not in real value). So either inflation stays down all on it's own, or it goes up on it's own. But if the fed needs to raise interest rates above 5%-ish to stop it, they just can't without bankrupting the federal government.

**Assertion 2: The federal reserve bonds can't pay real returns.** If inflation is already above 5%, and the federal reserve can't raise interest rates above 5%, then it can't pay real returns on bonds. It simply cannot issue a bond with a positive real return rate. I don't know what that means yet, but it probably means something.",cryptocurrency

People who have been tracking the industry know however it's been attempted many times, and each time regulators came with an immediate ban hammer.

I remember selling a monk item, on the legal marketplace linked to paypal in early Diablo 3 release for $120. Back then it wasn't nothing to scoff at, but shortly after there was an announcement that ""due to player's outrage"" the feature has been disabled. I now realize that the real reason was probably regulatory complications but some posts handpicked from the forums helped justify it.

*****
&gt; Uncertainty about a new emerging coronavirus strain could continue to spook markets, just as Friday’s employment report and other data in the week ahead show the economy has been getting stronger.
*****
&gt; Stocks and other risk assets were slammed in the post-Thanksgiving session Friday on reports of a new variant in South Africa, and investors sought safety in Treasurys. Initial reports on the variant show it could be more transmissible than the Delta variant, and scientists are studying how effective vaccines are against it.
*****
&gt; The Dow was down 905 points, or 2.5% Friday in its worse day since October, 2020. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 2.3% Friday to 4,594, giving it a 2.2% decline for the week.
*****
&gt; “I think that’s going to override what else we’re going to see,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “It’s a heavy data week with the ISMs and certainly payrolls, but I think this new variant is going to freeze behavior until there’s more clarity.”
*****
&gt; According to Dow Jones, economists expect a strong payroll report Friday, with 581,000 jobs added, after October’s 531,000 payrolls. They expect the economy has shaken off the effects of the slowdown linked to the Covid delta variant, and growth in the current quarter could be far stronger than the third quarter.
*****
&gt; The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing survey is released Wednesday, and that should also be strong.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said many traders were caught off sides in the shortened session Friday, usually a positive one for the market, and there are key levels the market must hold in the week ahead in order to stage a yearend Santa rally.
*****
&gt; “Right now, the market lost some momentum, but it’s not broken. It could be just fine and refuel if the 50-day moving average on the S&amp;P 500 holds next week. It’s all very fluid,” he said.
*****
&gt; The 50-day, at 4,527, is a widely-watched momentum indicator, and it is basically the average close of the last 50 sessions.
*****
&gt; The market had already been losing momentum this past Monday with a bearish reversal, he said.
*****
&gt; “On Wednesday, the market absorbed the weakness and gave traders a false sense of security which is normally a nice easy holiday-shortened session Friday,” Redler said.
*****
&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the S&amp;P 500 typically gains 7% between its October low and year-end close, but this year it had already gained more than 9%.
*****
&gt; “We’re ahead of the game and due for some sort of digestion,” Stovall said on CNBC.
*****
&gt; The Dow dipped more than 1,000 points during Friday trading. Riskier assets were down even more, with the Russell 2000 closing off 3.7% Friday. West Texas Intermediate oil futures plunged more than 12%. Some investors began to reverse bets in the futures market that a strong economic rebound and inflationary pressures would pull the Fed off the sidelines sooner-than-expected.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves opposite price, fell to 1.48% from Wednesday’s high of 1.69%.
*****
&gt; Investors will be looking for guidance from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who appears before Congress in the week ahead with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to discuss the coronavirus and the CARES Act stimulus package. On Tuesday, there is a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.
*****
&gt; “I think you have to assume the base case is the virus remains endemic, not back to being a pandemic,” said Barry Knapp, founder of Ironsides Macroeconomics. The worry is that the variant spreads and slows activity, hitting supply chains even more. That could boost inflation while slowing growth.
*****
&gt; Knapp said there are risks for stocks, and investors need to be cautious buying the market on the decline.
*****
&gt; Knapp said the Fed could end up accelerating the taper of its bond purchases, which would move forward the time frame for potential interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “The problem with trying to buy the market overall and buying tech stocks in particular is if you buy now because it is down a couple of percent, it rallies into the end of the year and then the market sells off,” he said. For that reason, he favors dipping into cheaper sectors like energy and financials, the worst performing sectors Friday.
*****
&gt; Oil and energy will be in the spotlight in the coming week, as OPEC+ meets Thursday. The U.S. and other governments agreed to release oil from their strategic petroleum reserves in an attempt to drive prices lower. The U.S. plans to release 50 million barrels.
*****
&gt; OPEC+ has said it would continue to increase production by 400,000 barrels monthly, despite calls from the White House to speed up the release.
*****
&gt; Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC, said on CNBC there is a chance OPEC could decide to pause its own production increase because of the SPR releases.
*****
&gt; “I think as we head into the OPEC meeting Thursday, the question is not only do they do a pause but potentially will they actually pull back some barrels because of concerns about this new variant alongside the very large SPR release,” she said.
*****
&gt; She said the U.S. is releasing a record amount of oil. “We are going to have a lot of barrels hitting this market, as we have these concerns about new Covid lockdown restrictions,” she said. “Again, too soon to say whether governments will pull the trigger on such measures, but the market will be concerned.”

&gt; # When Stocks Are Up Big YTD Before Thanksgiving

&gt; As the S&amp;P 500 is up rather impressively, 24.9% year-to-date this year through today’s close on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we ran the numbers on the 33 previous years with double digit year-to-date gains at this juncture since 1950. There are a few blemishes, but in general market gains continued into yearend.

&gt; Most importantly, there are no major selloffs on this list. The big December decline of -9.2% in 2018 came after the S&amp;P 500 was down -1.2% at this point in the year. After double-digit YTD gains the S&amp;P 500 was up 70% of the time from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to yearend for an average gain of 2.3%.

&gt; Also of note is that the Santa Claus Rally suffered only four losses in these years. But these four down SCRs in 1955, 1968, 1999 and 2014 were followed by flat years in 1956 and 2015 and down years in 1969 and 2000. As Yale’s famous line states (2021 Almanac page 116 and 2022 Almanac page 118): “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; # How Have Stocks Done Under Jerome Powell?

&gt; The big news this week was Jerome Powell will remain in charge of the Federal Reserve (Fed) for four more years, so we wanted to do a quick blog that looked at how stocks have done while he has been the Fed Chairman.

&gt; “There are many reasons for Jerome Powell to lead the Fed for another four years,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But one of the best could very well be that stocks have done quite well under his leadership. Do you really think he’d still be in charge if stocks did poorly under him? Probably not is the answer there.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has gained 40% under his leadership, ranking him 8th (near the middle of the pack) when compared with all 16 Fed Chairpersons. Interestingly, he ranks just beneath both of his predecessors in Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen. With four more years to go, you’d have to like his chances there, but Alan Greenspan’s record of 312% is likely safe for the time being.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.24.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Here are some more Fed Chair fun facts (using the chart below).

&gt; * On an annualized basis, the Dow has gained 9.3% per annum under Powell, the 7th best out of 16.
&gt; * Interestingly, stocks have dropped under only one Fed Chairperson and that was Eugene Meyer during the Great Depression.
&gt; * Taking another look at Greenspan’s 312% return and we realize he was in charge of the Fed for 18.5 years. So his annual return of 8.0% puts things in perspective.
&gt; * The shortest tenure ever was less than a year and a half back in the late 1970s under William Miller. Meanwhile, the longest ever was William Martin at nearly 19 years.
&gt; * Paul Volker had the best annualized return at 15.2% over his 8 years. Not to mention he handed things over to Greenspan right before the 1987 crash, one of the best handoffs we’ve ever seen in history.
&gt; * Lastly, the Fed has been led by a woman only once and that was Janet Yellen, now in charge of the Treasury. It is worth noting that her four-year run at the Fed produced a very impressive 12.9% annualized return for stocks.

&gt; # Finally Some Clarity on Fed Leadership

&gt; President Biden officially nominated Chairman Jerome Powell to a second four-year term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and elevated current Fed Governor Lael Brainard to Vice Chair of the Committee. Before the announcement, there was speculation that Brainard could replace Powell as Fed Chair.

&gt; We view these nominations as very market friendly. Powell has done a commendable job supporting markets during the COVID-19 shutdowns and we aren’t quite through with the pandemic. We believe stability and leadership continuity is important as we continue to make our way toward the finish line of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Brainard is well qualified to run the Fed, elevating her to Vice Chair recognizes her contributions and potentially puts her in a position to take over the Chair role in four years. Both positions require Congressional approval, and we think both should be confirmed when Congressional hearings conclude sometime over the next few months.

&gt; “As we expected, President Biden chose continuity and familiarity with these Fed appointments,” noted LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. “Going with Powell over Brainard is what markets were expecting, so we think markets are relieved that Fed leadership uncertainty is now out of the way.”

&gt; The knee-jerk reaction in the bond market was interesting in that markets seemingly continue to shift the prospects for interest rate hikes forward. As seen on the LPL Research Chart of the Day, Treasury securities across all maturities sold off with two-year tenors among the most (negatively) impacted. Now, two-year Treasury yields are at the highest level since the pandemic began. Short maturity securities are the most impacted by changes in monetary policy. Moreover, markets are pricing in nearly three rate hikes next year with the first rate hike expected in June, which is much more aggressive than the Fed has indicated.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; President Biden still has three open Fed Board of Governor positions to fill, so we’re a long way from knowing for sure how Fed policy may change over the next few years. However, we would expect Biden to select governors on the dovish side of the spectrum. That said, the 2022 voting rotation with regional Fed Presidents may impart a hawkish lean to the FOMC overall, offsetting some of the dovish bias from Biden’s appointments. The rotation replaces three solidly dovish and one strongly hawkish voting members with two strongly hawkish and two solidly hawkish officials. Monetary policy is managed at the national level, so while the regional presidents will no doubt have influence, we continue to think the Fed will be more accommodative than markets are currently expecting. In addition, with the announcements today, leadership at the top of the Fed should be seen as being supportive to the economy and thus supportive for markets.

&gt; # Pandemic and Multi-Decade Low for Claims

&gt; Out of the massive slug of economic data this morning, one major bright spot was jobless claims. It has now been 88 weeks since the March 13, 2020 release; the last one before claims began to print in the millions. In that time, claims have fallen to not only take out pre-pandemic levels and the low prior to that of 203K set in April 2019 but today saw the first sub-200K reading since November 20, 1969. That compares to estimates of a reading of 260K and last week's 2K upward revised number of 270K. On a side note, in 2019 there were three weeks where the initial release of initial claims came in below 200K (1/24, 4/11, and 4/18), but they have been since revised higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; While that is a significant low in claims, the drop appears to a large degree to be thanks to seasonal adjustment. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose to 258.6K which was the highest level in six weeks. It is seasonally normal for claims to head higher during the current week of the year with it having happened over 80% of the time historically. Additionally, that is a bit of catch-up considering claims have been bucking seasonal trends in recent weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-Seasonal.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims were also lower this week falling from 2.109 million to 2.049 million. As with initial jobless claims, that sets a new low for the pandemic that is 265K above the level from March 13, 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Con-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; Factoring in all other programs creates an additional week of lag to the data meaning the most recent print is through the first week of November. The final week of October's unusual uptick on account of peculiar growth in claims for expired programs has unwound in the most recent week's data. PUA claims were more than cut in half as PEUC claims also fell by 121K. Combined that resulted in a new low of 2.44 million claims.

stocks,Tesla decides against state aid for German battery plant as Musk opposes subsidies,"* Tesla withdraws application for state funding
* All subsidies should be eliminated, Musk tweets
* Car plant construction progressing well - economy ministry
* Regional funding application still underway

BERLIN, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) said on Friday it has withdrawn its application for state aid for its planned battery factory near Berlin as CEO Elon Musk declared the electric vehicle maker opposed all subsidies.

The European Union in January approved a plan that included giving state aid to Tesla, BMW (BMWG.DE) and others to support production of electric vehicle batteries and help the bloc to reduce imports from industry leader China.

Tesla was expected to receive 1.14 billion euros ($1.28 billion) in EU funding for its battery plant in Gruenheide, Brandenburg under the plan, with a final decision likely by the end of the year.

""Tesla has informed the Federal Ministry of Economics and the Brandenburg Ministry of Economics... it is withdrawing its IPCEI application for state funding for the battery factory in Grünheide,"" a Tesla spokesperson said, referring to European subsidies allocated to so-called 'Important Projects of Common European Interest'.

Construction plans for the plant would not be affected by the decision, the spokesperson said.

""It has always been Tesla’s view that all subsidies should be eliminated,"" Musk posted on Twitter in response to a tweet by another user after Tesla said it had withdrawn its funding application.

""But that must include the massive subsidies for oil &amp; gas. For some reason, governments don’t want to do that...,"" Musk added, deviating from the subject of the factory grant.

Tesla itself is investing 5 billion euros in the battery plant, according to German economy ministry estimates.

Meanwhile, construction of a car production site alongside the battery plant, which Tesla has begun building under pre-approval permits while it awaits final approval from the regional government, has made good progress in the last few weeks, a spokesperson for the federal economy ministry said.

The electric vehicle maker also applied in November 2020 for regional funding from Brandenburg, according to the regional government's website.

A Brandenburg economy ministry spokesperson said this application had not been withdrawn.

The amount Tesla applied for is undisclosed, but investments worth over 100 million euros are generally given 6.8% of their value, the website says.

The latest round of online consultations for the public to express environmental and other concerns about the car factory and battery plant closed last week and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he hopes to formally begin production by the end of the year and then ramp up as quickly as possible.

Musk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change.

CryptoCurrency,How to explain DLT to your wife/gf,"With Crypto rapidly getting more exposure in media (and even in everyday life), it’s important to help educate the people in your life about it. Remember it’s always going to be a more arduous process if they’ve already been fed misconceptions, so why not get a leg up on the fud.

Distributed Ledger Technology operates in the same way gossip does. Someone might miss out on the newest tea because they haven’t connected with their friends for a bit, but when they see each other again all of the gossip/tea is spilt and everyone is on the same page again

stocks,Opinion: I don't think the fall will be finished until we know that this new Covid variant is protected by vaccines,"Let me make this clear before I begin, I'm just as tired as the next guy of the constant in and out of lockdown that has been going on for 1 and a half years. The claim as to why this is only a reason for the markets to correct is that tech heavy companies proved themselves last year, however the Fed doesn't have the same level of leniency it had last year. Rates are already at 0, and countries have already indebted themselves to help citizens and companies get back on their feet.
I don't like to be doom and gloom, which is why I want to make my point clear, I'm not saying this is the end of the world, or that the market is about to crash. What I'm saying is that the news we recieve over the next week will lead to potentially quite a lot of volatility. 
If it is found that the new variant can be contracted by the vaccinated, then I think we may see another run of lockdowns, which will definitely cause travel stocks to decline, but may pull the markets down with it, as there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding how countries might be able to help it's citizens.
If the variant can't be contracted by the vaccinated, all will be fine, and the correction should end.
One case has already appeared in the EU, which means it could be spreading currently. We may get an answer as to whether this variant can reach those who have been vaccinated, but keep on top of news over the next week.",finance
investing,Thoughts on Northwest Natural? NWN?,"Hey Everyone, 
I wanted to get folks opinions on NWN. NWN is a natural gas and water utility provider based primarily in OR and WA. P/E at today’s close is around 15, and revenue has been increasing low-single digits in recent years. 

Things I like about them include:

- I lived in OR for several years and was both a residential and business customer of theirs. I know their CS is top notch / mailed statements professional /emergency response *fast* (less than 30 mins on a Friday)
- They should be pretty COVID proof, and they have a regulated monopoly. Folks need heat and they’ve been supplying since the late 1800’s.
- They advertise in their annual reports that they have one of the best maintained systems in the country.

Things I don’t like about them include:
- Being a mature utility, I’m told these trade like bonds at times, and a shift in interest rates can shift their price up (on interest decrease) or down (on interest increase). 
- The NW seems to be having more weather related issues than say the midwest or northeast. For instance, wildfires in OR have been bad in recent years. I actually evacuated my house in 2020 because of them. There’s also been droughts making wildfires more likely. Buying into NWN exposes you somewhat to these regional issues, and if it gets bad enough people move thats less customers. 
- The stock likely will never be the next apple, and I’m young/looking to grow wealth quickly and safely.

personalfinance,Mortgage refinance (pls help),"Hello everyone, after hours of research and phone calls i'm still really confused about a cash out refinance, any help you all can offer would be greatly appreciated. So here's the situation....

&amp;#x200B;

\-160k left on current mortgage

\-current property value 280k

\-first refinance on this mortgage

\-currently at a 4.1% interest rate

&amp;#x200B;

Right off the bat i know i can get a substantially lower interest rate by refinancing, i'm wanting a cash out refinance so i can renovate the current property and use the rest as down payment on another. My question is how much would i be able to take out and in your experience which mortgage lenders do you guys like for refinancing? Any recommendations and help would be appreciated, please feel free to throw your wisdom at me as this is my first refinance ever and i'm actually really nervous cause this would be a big move for me. Anything i should look out for while dealing with lenders, any tips/tricks you have would be amazing, Thank you!",finance

economy,"Does the fed's mandate allow them to consider the supply chain in their interest rate decisions?

Unemployment claims are at the lowest point since 1969 and inflation is more than triple their mandate and rising.  

Does their mandate even allow them to consider other factors like the supply chain?

CryptoCurrency,I am certain I'm not the only one out there who is always on the lookout for ways to earn crypto. This post is for those of you who are also looking for ways to earn extra coins.,"TL;DR at bottom with link to a helpful resource.

A little background here first. 

I've somewhat recently gotten into investing in crypto. It's pretty much become one of the top priorities in my life (following the wife and kids of course) very very quickly. 

I don't come from a family with money. Quite the opposite really. 

I don't have any post high school education. 

I wasn't lucky enough to have a golden job opportunity fall out of the sky and land in my hands. 

I work hard, for a modest salary, to support my family. 

I have 2 goals for my life. First and foremost, I want to have the financial means to put my kids through college, should they decide to go. Secondly, I want to retire at some point, instead of working until the day I die like those in my family before me.

All this to say, I don't have much disposable income to invest in something that has rapidly become a point of focus in my life. So I've spent months researching ways to safely earn extra coins with little or no extra investment required. 

My primary approach has been to hold my coins in interest-bearing accounts offered by exchanges, lenders, and some wallets. This and staking are the easiest, most passive way to earn free coins. You'll most often have the chance to earn compound interest on your coins, so this can end up being a huge amount over a long period of time. 

Additionally, I try and take advantage of promotions offered by exchanges. Some of them rotate bonuses for staking, for purchasing X amount of Y coin, limited time interest rates increase, etc. Usually, you'll still have to spend money to take advantage of these promotions, however, you're receiving additional coins on top of your purchase. A nice little bonus to your ROI. 

Lastly, I try and take advantage of referral codes when/where I can. Most of the time these have some easy to meet criteria and require some purchase. But once again, it results in free coins for little extra work. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR + resource

I've created this [Interest Rates Comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/edit?usp=sharing) that compares interest rates paid on nearly 150 different coins by some of the highest yielding and most reputable exchanges, wallets, and lenders. I am working to add/maintain current promos that will provide additional ways to earn some free coins. There is also a section that describes a handful of platforms who offer easy to earn signup bonuses.

This information has been extremely valuable to me. I've created this resource because I'm hoping it will add some value to like-minded investors, their strategies, and the crypto community as a whole.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Saifedean is unsound,"Probably an unpopular opinion, but let me explain.

I don’t mean just saifedean author of bitcoin standard and now Fiat standard, but all the extreme libertarians.

However, when he goes on his rants about art, antivaxing, climate change, meat eating, sociopath political leaders - he just alienates me as I can see, most of the time he hasn’t a clue what he is talking about.

CryptoCurrency,We hear Fiat is bad here all the time. Do you really understand what Fiat is? If not this article is for you.,"# What Is Fiat Money?  

**Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a  physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government  that issued it**. The value of fiat money is derived from the  relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing  government, rather than the worth of a commodity backing it. Most modern  paper currencies are fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the euro, and other major global currencies. 

&amp;#x200B;

The term ""**fiat**"" is a Latin word that is often translated as ""it shall  be"" or ""let it be done."" Thus **fiat currencies only have value because  the government maintains that value; there is no utility to fiat money  in itself**.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fiat currency came about when governments would mint  coins out of a valuable physical commodity, such as gold or silver, or  print paper money that could be redeemed for a set amount of a physical  commodity. **Fiat, however, is inconvertible and cannot be redeemed simply  because there is no underlying commodity backing it.**  

&amp;#x200B;

Because **fiat money** is **not** linked to **physical reserves**, such as a  national stockpile of gold or silver, it **risks losing value due to  inflation** or even becoming worthless in the event of [hyperinflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp). In some of the [worst cases of hyperinflation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/122915/worst-hyperinflations-history.asp), such as in Hungary immediately after WWII, the rate of inflation can double in a single day.  Furthermore, if people lose faith in a nation's currency, the money will  no longer hold value. This is much different from a currency backed by  gold.

The **U.S. dollar** is considered to be **both fiat money and** **legal tender**,  accepted for private and public debts. **Legal tender is basically any  currency that a government declares to be legal**. Many governments issue a  fiat currency, then make it legal tender by setting it as the standard  for debt repayment. 

**Earlier** in U.S. history, **US dollar was backed by gold** (and in some cases, silver).  The federal government stopped allowing citizens to exchange currency  for government gold with the passage of the Emergency Banking Act of  1933. **The** **gold standard**,  which backed U.S. currency with federal gold, **ended completely in 1971**  when the U.S. also stopped issuing gold to foreign governments in  exchange for U.S. currency.

Since that time, **U.S. dollars are known to be backed** by the ""**full faith  and credit"" of the U.S. government**, ""legal tender for all debts, public  and private"" but not ""redeemable in lawful money at the United States  Treasury or at any Federal Reserve Bank,"" as printing on U.S. dollar  bills used to claim. In this sense, **U.S. dollars are now ""legal tender,""  rather than ""lawful money,**"" which can be exchanged for gold, silver, or  any other commodity.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Fiat Money  

***Advantages***

Fiat money serves as a good currency if it can handle the roles that a  nation's economy needs of its monetary unit—storing value, providing a  numerical account, and facilitating exchange. It also has excellent [seigniorage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seigniorage.asp), meaning it is more cost-efficient to produce than a currency directly tied to a commodity.  Since fiat money is not a scarce or fixed resource like gold, central  banks have much greater control over its supply, which gives them the  power to manage economic variables such as credit supply, liquidity,  interest rates, and money velocity 

***Disadvantages*** 

The [mortgage crisis of 2007](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime-meltdown.asp)  and subsequent financial meltdown, however, tempered the belief that  central banks could necessarily prevent depressions or serious recessions  by regulating the money supply. A currency tied to gold, for example,  is generally more stable than fiat money because of the limited supply  of gold.

Fiat money gives governments greater flexibility to manage their own  currency, set monetary policy, and stabilize global markets. It also  allows for [fractional reserve banking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp), which lets commercial banks multiply the amount of money on hand to meet demand from borrowers. 

Having experienced first hand what the unbridled greed of the financial elite will lead to if given the ultimate control over your money in 2008, its no surprise that people wants to move away from the centralized fiat system and to more decentralized and community driven currencies like bitcoin.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Trying to lower the interest rate (12.99%) on a card that has $23k of my $26k in credit card debt. How should I do that?,"I have $26k in credit card debt split across three cards. The debt comes from a combination of some adverse life events and some emotional spending over the past few years. I am financial literate enough to know that interest is killing me right now, but financially illiterate enough to have allowed cathartic spending, in response to life events, to get the best of me at some points.


Each card’s balance, limit, utilization, and interest rate are below:

Card | Balance | Limit	 | Utilization | Interest Rate
---|---|----|----|----
A | $23,081 | $24,000 | 96.17% | 12.99%
B | $1,852 | $2,000 | 92.6% | 22.99%

**TOTALS** | **$26,371** | **$33,200** | **79.43%** | **—**


**Relevant Information**

* Monthly income right now (a conservative estimation because it fluctuates) is $4,200. After bills, I expect that I will have approximately $3,000/mo leftover.
* Credit Karma has my credit score at ~641. My bank has my FICO score at 698 (as of 11/3/2021).

I plan on immediately snowballing Cards B &amp; C as their balances are small compared to Card A. This brings me to my main question: **What is the most effective way to lower the interest I pay on Card A?**

I have considered some of the following plans:

1. **Talk to the Bank.** I plan on asking the credit union of Card A to decrease or suspend the interest rate. I’ve read success stories (and failures, too) on PF of people who had their interest rate lowered or suspended (i.e., went 0% for a short amount of time). The credit union I’m with is highly regarded and has a reputation of working well with their customers, so I figured I have nothing to lose by asking. (Right?)
2. **Credit Card Balance Transfer.** I am conscious that there is a risk with these for people who tend to rack up debt. I plan on keeping my old cards out of my wallet so that I cannot use them when their balance has been decreased/depleted.
3. **Personal/Consolidation Loan.** I’ve been weighing the pros and cons of this against Plan 2 (credit card balance transfers).
4. **Combination of Plans 2 &amp; 3.** I’ve been looking into recommendations from Credit Karma and Nerd Wallet for both options. This has made me consider getting both to decrease the interest I am paying on Card A’s large balance.
5. **Ask Family for Help.** Pride and insecurities are really getting in the way of this, but I'm considering it.

**Side note:** My income will drop significantly next summer because of school, so I am trying to pay off as much of this as possible by next summer (June-August 2022). Before anyone suggests it, not going to school is not an option for me. I greatly enjoy my field of study and have worked incredibly hard to get where I am. The degree I am pursuing opens a lot of doors for me. While I would obviously like to have no debt while completing my degree, I recognize that I will have some (i.e., I doubt I’m paying off $26k by next summer) and have justified it by the amount of money I can make post-degree and happiness I will have working in that field.

Thank you in advance for the help, PF. I appreciate it.

Submission Statement: Fast off the heels of ''The Winter of our Discontent: Act II'',  is the coming mayhem being setup for the World Stage. As the world suffered in 2020 with its struggle to save lives at a 97-98% clip (2-3% hospitalized death rate), THESE NUEVO VARIANTS, emerging will force the ELITES/LIZARDS to RESPECT the INDIVIDUALISM of MAN.

 '' While officials are warning us that hospitals and hospital staff are  overburdened, these same officials in many states and in the Federal  government have decided now is the time enhance this critical medical  shortage by forcibly firing all medical personnel who refuse to get one  of the various COVID vaccines.''

'' Not long ago, those who are now being jettisoned from their  livelihoods were the heroes and heroins who risked life and limb to save  the unvaccinated because everyone was unvaccinated. Now, many of those  who got COVID for their efforts are choosing not to vaccinate because  they (as medical professionals) believe their enhanced natural immunity  is better and don’t see the need to take more risk with a vaccine that  has had no long-term testing. Now their governments are insisting they  all be fired for refusing the vaccine that they do not need (because  natural immunity, once enhanced by getting a disease, is almost always  as good or better than a vaccine). ''

'' Whether you agree with those medically trained individuals and their  personal choice or not and whether or not you believe medical  confidentiality and civil liberties must be protected in the face of  public fear or must also be jettisoned, you *have to agree* that  fewer nurses and PA’s and surgical techs and administrative staff will  leave hospitals more overburdened than they are now.

personalfinance,Optimal approach to achieve my financial goals...?,"Hey there, I'm seeking input on how best to handle my finances.

I've read through the Prime Directive and flowchart countless times. I'm at the point where I'm working on building up my full emergency fund &amp; paying off my student loans.

However, I have some other goals too. 

I'd like to DCA into crypto (BTC &amp; ETH), start contributing to a Roth IRA, and start converting my emergency fund into Series I Bonds.

Some numbers worth mentioning:

* 31 years old, self-employed, based in the US (NJ, HCOL area)
* Gross revenue of \~$30k/yr
* Monthly expenses of \~$2k/mo 
   * $875/mo rent &amp; utilities
   * $250/mo 0% APR CCs used for car repairs
   * Groceries, car insurance, gas, business software, phone, etc. for the rest
* Federal student loan balance of \~$25k
   * IBR /w minimum payments of $0/mo
   * Two loans at 6.8%, one at 5.6%, one at 4.5%, and two at 3.4%
   * All loans in COVID-19 gov't forbearance until 1/31/22
* Portfolio of \~$16k:
   * \~$7k in cash (checking &amp; savings accounts)
   * \~$8k in crypto
   * \~$1k in stocks (taxable brokerage account)

Based on \~$2k/mo expenses and me being self-employed, I'm shooting for $12k as my minimum emergency fund goal. I'd also like to maintain a checking account balance of $4k for routine expenses and investments.

My issue is that I don't know whether I should focus 100% of my extra income toward one goal at a time, or if I should spread out my money. 

For example, should I take the conservative approach and hoard cash in my emergency fund savings account until achieving my $12k target *before* doing anything else? 

I've read that it's wise to store your emergency fund in a Roth IRA (uninvested, eliminating risk) so as not to miss out on the opportunity to contribute each year. This sounds like a good idea, especially as I've not yet contributed any money to an IRA before.

Or instead, should I take the risk of allocating more of my cash into crypto given the potential for huge returns? My BTC &amp; ETH holdings have respective ROIs of 85% &amp; 230%, and can be cashed out relatively quickly in the event of emergency. 

Finally -- I realize that my income is quite low. My biggest priority is increasing my income, as that will enable me to do all of these things with less stress. But until then, what is my best move?

economy,How Crypto Takes Root In Financial World,"Cryptocurrency is changing the current state of affairs in the financial markets. As you can see, more and more institutional investors are pouring into cryptocurrency and making plans for its implementation. This process is quite natural in the digital space and the information environment that has formed today. Many experts predicted this transition decades ago.

The point is that the financial system is extremely limited and vulnerable. This affects all aspects of its activities, from fees and interest to storage and global transactions. You ask how it is changing the market. Here is how:

1. Reducing the risk of fraud.

Fraud is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to almost anything relating to money. Whether it be transferring funds or simply using a credit card on an insecure site, the possibility of fraud is there and a big concern for everyone. This is especially true for those who’ve been the victim of fraud in the past.

Because it is not associated with your bank account or cash funds and is transferred electronically and securely with the blockchain recording all transactions, cryptocurrency will play a big part in reducing fraud which will also offer peace of mind.

2. Makes e-commerce stronger.

It seems like everyone makes most of their purchases online nowadays, especially during The Holidays. Although it’s much more convenient than driving from store to store to find a specific item and makes window shopping a lot easier and more comfortable, concerns of fraud deter shoppers from making certain or as many purchases as they otherwise would.

Not only does the use of cryptocurrency reduce the risk of fraud for shoppers, but it does the same for vendors and sellers. Cryptocurrency transactions are permanent. In addition to the mitigation of risk, using cryptocurrency creates more opportunities for worldwide business.

3. Gives people control of their own money.

Many people are wary of banks and financial institutions, but due to numerous factors, keeping all of their cash in their homes isn’t the best option. Any sign of economic crisis, though, can cause serious stress and concern about the funds they have saved up.

Cryptocurrency allows the control of money to be transferred from the banks and back into the hands of the people. It is not subject to the rules and regulations imposed by banks and other financial institutions. Anytime that more people can get control over their own money, it’s a good thing. And, that’s just another reason why cryptocurrency will make the world a better place.

4. Increases people's income

When you go to the bank for deposits you are faced with the fact that the interest rate is so low that there is no point. In the cryptocurrency environment, the situation is much better! When taking a long-term investment approach to cryptocurrency, you’re creating passive income in the short term while waiting for your crypto to appreciate over the long term.

A good example is the highest profitable platform [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/). The annual percentage yield is up to 17%!

5. Making foreign money transfers and transactions safer

In addition to reducing fraud when transferring money internationally, cryptocurrency can help make in-country transactions safer. When traveling to other countries carrying cash and money cards can be downright dangerous.

Not only does the use of cryptocurrency reduce the danger of carrying cash, but it also eliminates any exchange fees or transaction fees. This would keep more money in consumer and vendor pockets. Plus, it would reduce the risk of robberies.",finance

I'm a recent graduate from a residency program and therefore am navigating the new world of my student loan repayment and higher income. I've read through the wiki on where to place my money which has been fantastic to get me started but I wanted to discuss my current plan with you all as it is veering slightly from your recommendations to help meet our future goals. I like to think I'm fairly aware of our finances but if you think our situation would benefit from a professional financial advisor, let me know. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Background: Married, 30 years old, no kids. Combined income \~340k. Currently maxing out both 401k plans and I have an additional work pension as well. Have not started an additional IRA. Take home pay monthly \~18k. Student loan debt 375k (1.8% interest rate), monthly payment at 5k on 7 year plan. We own a home with mortgage of 2k per month. Additional monthly spending around 5-7k. This leaves an additional \~4-5k per month, planning to place 2k towards loans and rest towards additional savings. We keep 1 month worth of expenses in our checking (15k) and have saved up another 4 months in a savings account (65k).

This is where my questions begin.

1. 65k in savings seems a bit expensive as I can't imagine needing this much liquid cash available at all times. Am I crazy to place 35k into an index fund and keep 30k in the savings (and 15k in checkings). This would still leave me with 3 months expenses in cash with a potential to tap into more if needed but accepting some risk if the market is down. Or should I keep the extra in a CD/bond given we may take it out in a relatively short time (7 years) for a down payment?
2. Is there tax benefit to maxing out an IRA for the 2 of us as well? I'm already maxing out our 401k plans and have additional pension that my work puts in to. Or should I place this into my brokerage account for greater liquidity if needed?
3. I have a super low interest rate on my loans but my current goal is to pay this off as fast as possible to be debt free and open us up to being able to move closer to where we want to end up long term. Is this a dumb plan given the low interest rate and opportunity cost with that extra money? Or is my savings we currently have sufficient to use the extra towards the loans?

solarenergy,Trying to make heads or tails from solar,"Hi folks,

I am hoping someone can help me make heads or tails of the proposals I am receiving for solar. I'm reasonably certain that I am talking to people who have integrity (this is not a diss, but I know there are many shady solar shops out there), but I'm still getting confused by all of the solar speak. I apologize for the wordy post, but I like to throw all the details out there so that the info is available for people to comment on and provide advice.

We are located in Texas, and our primary motivator for going solar is energy independence - our grid proved to be unreliable last year. We started down this path by looking at whole home generators, but then determined that our gas lines are a single point of failure, too, since they nearly failed during the winter storm as well. We are of the mind that the sun is not going anywhere.

**Money is no object as long as the system does what we want it to do,** which is to completely avoid consuming energy from the grid unless absolutely necessary (prolonged periods of no sun/no generation). This is not about neutralizing a power bill, but more about just cutting ourselves off from Oncor, and being self-sustaining from solar power.

I've gotten a few different proposals that I'm confused about:

1. From a small company that seems to be a husband and wife duo who contract out most of the installation work. They initially got me to 95% offset, and eventually 97% offset, but they have not visited the house. Their numbers are based purely off of seeing the house on Google Earth (I had to convince them that certain trees were no longer there) and our current kwh usage as recorded by Smart Meters Texas. They originally designed a system that would sell excess power back to the grid, giving us credits for when we need to consume power during low-generation days. However, my understanding is that if the grid fails, our system will still fail, because with nowhere to backfeed excess generation, legally, the system cannot stay online. This means we're still at the mercy of the grid being operational. They did, however, build in a gas generator, but since Atmos doesn't care to winterize their infrastructure either, this could still lead us to a bad situation. When I asked to replace the generator with a storage system, the rep was a bit ambivalent. It sounded like they had little experience with doing this, but they reluctantly created a new proposal with an Enphase IQ7+ system. Total system cost at 97% was about $72k, including their recommendation to replace our 21 SEER HVAC system from 2008 for $9.5k because it's likely to fail soon, and is allegedly less energy efficient than it could be...even though I've been told by HVAC folks that 21 SEER is good, and ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""
2. From a medium-sized company that ostensibly has a whole team of master electricians and engineers on-staff. They can only get me to 65% offset using a ""conservative"" model, and 74% with a ""liberal"" model - I'm not sure what this means if the number of panels is still the same. This company allegedly specializes in storage, and has been able to explain the battery stuff better to me than company #1, but they also have said that the batteries need to be replaced every 10 years, which sounds like a $30k cost each decade (assuming today's prices hold, which they won't). They've pitched both a Tesla and Enphase storage system, but have stated that Enphase is better because it's wired in either series or parallel - whichever one means it can selectively keep certain panels on during a grid outage, so that I'm still generating enough to power the house without backfeeding to the grid. This company also came out to the house to see the appliances I've got first-hand, and flew over the roof with a drone to take measurements, however, they did not ask for my Smart Meters Texas information, so I'm not sure what their offset numbers are based on. With me pushing for 100% offset, they reluctantly said they could add panels to the north side of my roof, even though they will be woefully cost-inefficient...but they also said something about how I could cycle the batteries in such a way that the 74% becomes 100% without adding panels. I've tried asking clarifying questions but I'm still not understanding how this is possible. Total system cost at 74% is about $85k. At 100%, it's $110k (adds 16 panels).

A further wrinkle that I'm finding is that all of the financing options expect you to pay back your federal tax credit as a balloon payment on month 18. While that's annoying, what's extra annoying is that company #2 is the only one to disclose to me that if I don't typically owe tax (we work W-2 jobs, so our withholding usually checks out and we are only due a very modest refund), the tax credit actually won't pay out to us, so we'd have to come up with that balloon payment on our own, which we could not do. This makes the monthly figures of $350/month go up dramatically to more like $500/month.

Overall, what I'm hoping to glean from this sub is:

* Which one is giving it to me more accurately: Company 1 or Company 2
* How to make heads or tails of the ""offset"" percentages and what this means for our desire to stay completely removed from the grid
* Do the batteries actually need to be replaced every 10 years at such a significant cost, and if so, is storage a bad thing to do if we're not wealthy
* Do these price quotes make any sense, or is either company under/overcharging
* Is my understanding that the average W-2 person can't take advantage of the tax credit correct

Thanks for any and all advice/feedback. We want to do this, but it's a huge financial decision to make and I just don't want to spend close to six figures and not get what we want.",energy

We are located in Texas, and our primary motivator for going solar is energy independence - our grid proved to be unreliable last year. We started down this path by looking at whole home generators, but then determined that our gas lines are a single point of failure, too, since they nearly failed during the winter storm as well. We are of the mind that the sun is not going anywhere.

**Money is no object as long as the system does what we want it to do,** which is to completely avoid consuming energy from the grid unless absolutely necessary (prolonged periods of no sun/no generation). This is not about neutralizing a power bill, but more about just cutting ourselves off from Oncor, and being self-sustaining from solar power.

I've gotten a few different proposals that I'm confused about:

1. From a small company that seems to be a husband and wife duo who contract out most of the installation work. They initially got me to 95% offset, and eventually 97% offset, but they have not visited the house. Their numbers are based purely off of seeing the house on Google Earth (I had to convince them that certain trees were no longer there) and our current kwh usage as recorded by Smart Meters Texas. They originally designed a system that would sell excess power back to the grid, giving us credits for when we need to consume power during low-generation days. However, my understanding is that if the grid fails, our system will still fail, because with nowhere to backfeed excess generation, legally, the system cannot stay online. This means we're still at the mercy of the grid being operational. They did, however, build in a gas generator, but since Atmos doesn't care to winterize their infrastructure either, this could still lead us to a bad situation. When I asked to replace the generator with a storage system, the rep was a bit ambivalent. It sounded like they had little experience with doing this, but they reluctantly created a new proposal with an Enphase IQ7+ system. Total system cost at 97% was about $72k, including their recommendation to replace our 21 SEER HVAC system from 2008 for $9.5k because it's likely to fail soon, and is allegedly less energy efficient than it could be...even though I've been told by HVAC folks that 21 SEER is good, and ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""
2. From a medium-sized company that ostensibly has a whole team of master electricians and engineers on-staff. They can only get me to 65% offset using a ""conservative"" model, and 74% with a ""liberal"" model - I'm not sure what this means if the number of panels is still the same. This company allegedly specializes in storage, and has been able to explain the battery stuff better to me than company #1, but they also have said that the batteries need to be replaced every 10 years, which sounds like a $30k cost each decade (assuming today's prices hold, which they won't). They've pitched both a Tesla and Enphase storage system, but have stated that Enphase is better because it's wired in either series or parallel - whichever one means it can selectively keep certain panels on during a grid outage, so that I'm still generating enough to power the house without backfeeding to the grid. This company also came out to the house to see the appliances I've got first-hand, and flew over the roof with a drone to take measurements, however, they did not ask for my Smart Meters Texas information, so I'm not sure what their offset numbers are based on. With me pushing for 100% offset, they reluctantly said they could add panels to the north side of my roof, even though they will be woefully cost-inefficient...but they also said something about how I could cycle the batteries in such a way that the 74% becomes 100% without adding panels. I've tried asking clarifying questions but I'm still not understanding how this is possible. Total system cost at 74% is about $85k. At 100%, it's $110k (adds 16 panels).

A further wrinkle that I'm finding is that all of the financing options expect you to pay back your federal tax credit as a balloon payment on month 18. While that's annoying, what's extra annoying is that company #2 is the only one to disclose to me that if I don't typically owe tax (we work W-2 jobs, so our withholding usually checks out and we are only due a very modest refund), the tax credit actually won't pay out to us, so we'd have to come up with that balloon payment on our own, which we could not do. This makes the monthly figures of $350/month go up dramatically to more like $500/month.

Overall, what I'm hoping to glean from this sub is:

* Which one is giving it to me more accurately: Company 1 or Company 2
* How to make heads or tails of the ""offset"" percentages and what this means for our desire to stay completely removed from the grid
* Do the batteries actually need to be replaced every 10 years at such a significant cost, and if so, is storage a bad thing to do if we're not wealthy
* Do these price quotes make any sense, or is either company under/overcharging
* Is my understanding that the average W-2 person can't take advantage of the tax credit correct

Thanks for any and all advice/feedback. We want to do this, but it's a huge financial decision to make and I just don't want to spend close to six figures and not get what we want.",energy

**TLDR**:

In conclusion, risk analysis of DeFi protocols is a very complex process as the areas of risk exposure are very different and often interfere with each other. For example, a protocol that allows more freedom in governance will attract investors who want to make the most out of being able to cast their votes on a wide variety of factors, but it will also be subject to more volatility in changes and be undesirable to another group of investors who want to hold the tokens for stability in asset value. Thus, we have to be clear of our purpose first, and then make the relevant analysis and comparison across protocols.

# General Conclusion

Risk is one of the most prominent issues in traditional financial markets. In particular, risk helps investors to quantify a specific number representing an asset value, in order to assess whether that level of risk is acceptable.

In DeFi, however, risk is often undervalued as the majority of participants do not fully appreciate it. Several lending/borrowing protocols are at the forefront of this field when it comes to assessing the risk of an asset. In other protocols we rarely see full consideration of risk.

In this article, we will introduce the concept of systematic risk (generalised) from traditional markets to DeFi.

# What Is Systematic Risk?

Assuming you invest in a single asset, what is the source of risk for this ""portfolio""?

We can say that there are two common sources of uncertainty:

1. Risks arise from overall economic conditions, such as business cycles, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. These economic factors are difficult to predict with certainty and all affect the return on assets.
2. Risk comes from the asset itself (specificity). For example, is the government controlling the asset or is their direct demand for it, etc. These factors affect one asset but do not affect other assets.

Now we look at the ""portfolio"" of even more assets (a diversification strategy), asking the same question, what about portfolio risk?

Diversifying multiple asset classes spreads the risk of the entire portfolio. The ability to decrease the value of one asset provides the ability to increase the value of another asset. These effects will offset and stabilise the return on the entire portfolio and portfolio volatility will continue to decrease.

However, even if we hold a certain amount of assets (e.g. &gt;1000 assets), we still cannot avoid risk completely, because almost all assets are affected by factors such as general macro factors. For example, if all assets held are affected by the business cycle, then we cannot avoid business cycle risk no matter how many assets we hold.

&gt;This risk that persists even after diversification is called market risk, which is associated with sources of market-wide risk. Such risk is also known as systematic risk, or non-diversifiable risk.

*Note: Risk that can be eliminated by diversification is called unique risk, nonsystematic risk, or diversifiable risk.*",cryptocurrency

Only downside that I can think of is that if it ends up dipping lower than I missed out on a chance to DCA but I feel like it's a little greedy to want lower prices than what they currently are.

CryptoCurrency,Lessons learned from the May crash proving to be super useful now.,"January, February, and March were on a roll. People were transitioning from stocks into crypto. The overall market went from just over $1 trillion to $2 trillion. The kids were using the Robinhood to buy the crypto. Square started to allow purchases on their platform. 

Life was good and our bags were swollen. 

And then it all turned to shit. China banned crypto for the first, second, and third time. Yellen made a snarky comment at a Fed mtg. Some old banking dinosaurs decided they had “important things” to say about crypto — all pigheaded and dumb. But still, Markets crashed, everything gave back their gains, and then some. 

And me, being new to crypto, did a damn fool thing. I sold. The sin of all sins. 

So now that we have Omicron fears and governments all nervous and markets tanking, it’s time to think hard about how NOT to screw up this opportunity. 

Things might go sideways for another week, month, or four. 

1. Love your coins? Add to those bags. 
2. Hate your coins? Trade into coins you love. 
3. Watching coins? Don’t try and wait for the absolute bottom—dive in and love the fact that you’re getting great deals. 

Point being, fear shouldn’t be anywhere near your thinking. Instead make this about courage. Balls. Steel in that spine.

I rent a house and have a roommate, so monthly expenses are roughly $1100 a month
Male between 30-40
Two young kids sole and full custody, mom is out of picture entirely
$1,000 credit card with a $400 balance on it. I usually pay it off every month. 
2015 Sedan with 12.5k owed still
Less than $1000 in collections from past things I haven’t settled yet. 
No school debt or medical debt. 

With all that said, I left my retail job of almost 15 years and decided to cash out my 401k. After federal taxes were withheld as well as my penalty, the final check I received was for approximately $91,000. I am not sure how to move forward with it now. My questions;

I need to buy a new/different vehicle for my business I started up. I need a truck, but not a full size. Should I pay my car off then go trade it in, or should I see what the dealer wants to give me first for it? Like I said, the truck is a mandatory item I need for my business. Just not sure what would benefit me more, letting a dealer pay my vehicle off buying it back, or myself paying it off. 

I currently bank with Chase, but do not want to put this money there. Should I focus more on a credit union for better returns in a savings account for the bit I am going to save? I want to turn my chase account into my business account and use a smaller bank for my everyday life. 

I have plans to put about 40-50k back into an investment portfolio, but I want to be able to control the purchase and sales. Who has the best trading platform for this currently?

business,"We Keep Hearing People Don't Want to Work, But How Are People Supporting Themselves?","Was at dinner last night with friends and the whole ""nobody wants to work"" topic came up. Now many people say nobody wants to work for low pay, bad benefits, or a job they don't like, but how can people stay out of the workforce and hold their ground when they have bills to pay?

During covid we had the federal enhanced unemployment but that's done. How can someone decide they aren't going to work under current conditions, don't they have rent to pay, how do they buy food, etc?

This is anecdotal, my friend said his brother in law who has never made 50k a year in his life previously got used to making 50k on unemployment and says he won't take a job for under 50k. I asked what's he gonna do though, my buddy says his bro in law is kind of an idiot so the chances of him landing a 50k job may not be great, he said he'll rely on his sister, so basically in their scenario he'll wind up staying home until he can find a 50k a year job, which may never happen, and his sister will just pay the bills. 

Is this what most people are doing ie they moved back in family to cut expenses or a two worker household goes to one worker and they can afford to be a little picker about what they take?

stocks,Why will stock markets fall drastically in 2021?,"Below are a few characteristics of big bubbles…

-Insanely high equity valuations.
Everyone is long risky/speculative assets.
The average retail investor who doesn’t do any research can buy any stock and make money.

-General price acceleration, along with insane price acceleration in different areas (Tesla, GameStop, Bitcoin, and etc.).

-Buy-in on central banks’ ability and willingness to bail everyone out.
While I could be wrong, I don’t think the trigger is really there for the bubble to pop. According to a research report by Bank of America:

“The global economy has maintained momentum into the new year, with expectations of 5.3% expansion this year, the strongest since 1973, up from 3.4% contraction in 2020.”

Under normal circumstances, there’d be a trigger for the bubble to pop, but we are NOT in a standard market regime.

The world has gone autopilot on quantitative easing (QE), which means creation of new money in order to help the economy.

This surplus-free liquidity, which is currently growing at 55% year-over-year in the U.S., is a lot higher than the 32% growth in liquidity after the 2008 crash.

Unlike in 2008, this time, monetary policy will team up with the fiscal side and really drive inflation to an extreme.

Just look at how the Fed’s balance sheet is at 42% of GDP.
The more central banks expand their balance sheet, the higher the stock market goes.

Remember the CARES Act, and now Biden calling for another $1.9T fiscal stimulus (more to come, I guarantee it)?

This is all NEW MONEY created that will flow into the real economy.

And so, as long as the Fed (and the world) keeps printing new money out of thin air, the stock market will continue to be inflated in value.

Which also means that it’s unlikely for anyone to really experience significant crashes.

While these forces are pushing the stock market higher, the amount of currency debasement (inflation) that will occur from all this new money creation will be massive.

I know of someone who used to live in Poland when the country went through hyperinflation.

He said that back then, his mom had more than enough money saved up to buy a house.

However, after imprudent money printing from the government, hyperinflation happened, and she was only able to buy a washing machine with the same money.

The key takeaway here is, don’t let hyperinflation eat you alive.

I don’t know if inflation will get extreme to the point where it goes into overdrive, but from what I know today, we are heading towards that direction.

Know that just because the chart of the broad-market index looks like it’s trending upwards, it doesn’t actually mean you’re making money.

And so, over the coming decade(s), whatever job you have now will certainly not raise your salary at the same rate as the rate of inflation, and so year-over-year, the amount you’re making will be able to buy fewer and fewer things.

This is called stagflation—stagnant wages, increasing cost of living.

And so, it’s important to buy assets that will still be a good store of value in 5, 10, or 30 years. Buy a house, buy hard assets, buy commodities.

Commodities is a cyclical asset class trading at 100-year lows and perfectly set up for a mean reversion towards the upside.

They are a good hedge against inflation.
They’re a cyclical asset class and have been trading at historical lows when compared with broad market indices.
They’re critical to political security.
They’re needed for society (especially with all the fiscal policies that will be implemented!).

It’s a matter of when, not if, commodity prices rise.

In fact, this is why my entire portfolio is filled with energy and commodities-related stocks.

I have been browsing this subreddit for the past week while I try to get a better handle on my finances and take control over my debt.

I am starting a new job with a pay increase and I want to start getting a handle on my debt ASAP. I have already followed some of the steps laid out in different parts of the wiki for budgeting and planning debt payments, but wondering if I should seek out a fiduciary or debt counseling for further assistance on my credit card debt. Or if there is any advice this subreddit has for me in that regard. I’ll outline my situation in detail below:

Not sure if it is relevant, but my previous job had 401k matching and I have a very small start (\~6 months and I’m 28) for retirement planning with that. However, the new job is contract-to-hire and for the next 6 months I will be putting that on hold until I roll over to full-time and get on the company’s benefits. I was also thinking of adjusting the amount I save to be 5% ($200/month) instead of 15%. Then I’d use that other 10% ($400/month) to further pay off debts in addition to the monthly payments. I was planning to focus those extra payments on my private student loan and Credit Card 1.  I would also love to start saving to eventually buy a house, but have no clue where to begin with that. Especially with so many loans hanging over my head already. Please let me know if you have any feedback for me on my budget/plan and thanks in advance for any advice!",finance

ethereum,DeFi101: What is Interest Rate Swaps?,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: When it comes to fixed interest rates, it is the interest rate swap and the variable interest rate. Because of this, you can see that projects will often do the fixed interest rate and interest rate swap/market.

**Get smart:** DeFi's current situation is yet to meet that demand, but this could be the starting point for DeFi's fixed-rate and swap-rate segment.

 

# General Conclusion

The coupon is paid upfront or at maturity and divided equally per month.

Another method to get a fixed interest rate is via Interest Rate Swap. That is what we will focus in this article today.

# What's Interest Rate Swap?

&gt;Swap is a financial derivative product consisting of 2 transacting parties making a series of payments to the other in a certain period.

As you can imagine, it is to swap the interest rate. We exchange the interest rates.

E.g. I have an asset that has a changing interest rate. It pays me 3%, 2%, 3.5%, 0.17%, 4.2%. Instead, I want it to give me a consistent 2% instead.

How do we do this? Via interest rate swaps.

Why do we want this? Because we prefer something stable and consistent. It helps with financial management.

## Types of Swaps

&gt;There are 4 kinds of swaps based on underlying asset properties: **Currency swap, Interest rate swap, Equity swap and commodity swap.**

The interest rate swap has 2 transacting parties performing a series of interest payments to the other. Both payments are in the same currency. One party pays floating interest, the other can pay at a floating or fixed rate.

***Note: you only swap the interest rate. Not the asset itself.***

In this analysis, we focus on the interest rate swap, which has one side paid by paying the float interest rate. The other side is paid by the fixed interest rate. This also is called a **Plain Vanilla Swap.**

## Swap Details

Swaps have a

1. begin date
2. end date
3. interest payment period

As a future contract, swaps do not have any party prepayment. So swaps have an initial value = 0. That means present value (PV) is the same. The date which payment occurs called settlement date and the time interval between two payments is called a payment cycle.

Payments will usually occur for a short period of time, usually 1 day. This is because floating rates often change continuously, so payments will have to be made within the specified time.

Each Swap is materialised by a transaction amount called **estimated capital.** Because Interest Rate Swaps include the payment of interest, the settlement of which is calculated by multiplying the period of the interest by the initial capital which is never paid out. Therefore, it is not called the initial capital but rather the estimated capital.",cryptocurrency

As a future contract, swaps do not have any party prepayment. So swaps have an initial value = 0. That means present value (PV) is the same. The date which payment occurs called settlement date and the time interval between two payments is called a payment cycle.

Payments will usually occur for a short period of time, usually 1 day. This is because floating rates often change continuously, so payments will have to be made within the specified time.

Each Swap is materialised by a transaction amount called **estimated capital.** Because Interest Rate Swaps include the payment of interest, the settlement of which is calculated by multiplying the period of the interest by the initial capital which is never paid out. Therefore, it is not called the initial capital but rather the estimated capital.",cryptocurrency
CryptoMarkets,DeFi101: What is Interest Rate Swaps?,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: When it comes to fixed interest rates, it is the interest rate swap and the variable interest rate. Because of this, you can see that projects will often do the fixed interest rate and interest rate swap/market.

**Get smart:** DeFi's current situation is yet to meet that demand, but this could be the starting point for DeFi's fixed-rate and swap-rate segment.

 

# General Conclusion

The coupon is paid upfront or at maturity and divided equally per month.

Another method to get a fixed interest rate is via Interest Rate Swap. That is what we will focus in this article today.

# What's Interest Rate Swap?

&gt;Swap is a financial derivative product consisting of 2 transacting parties making a series of payments to the other in a certain period.

As you can imagine, it is to swap the interest rate. We exchange the interest rates.

E.g. I have an asset that has a changing interest rate. It pays me 3%, 2%, 3.5%, 0.17%, 4.2%. Instead, I want it to give me a consistent 2% instead.

How do we do this? Via interest rate swaps.

Why do we want this? Because we prefer something stable and consistent. It helps with financial management.

## Types of Swaps

&gt;There are 4 kinds of swaps based on underlying asset properties: **Currency swap, Interest rate swap, Equity swap and commodity swap.**

The interest rate swap has 2 transacting parties performing a series of interest payments to the other. Both payments are in the same currency. One party pays floating interest, the other can pay at a floating or fixed rate.

***Note: you only swap the interest rate. Not the asset itself.***

In this analysis, we focus on the interest rate swap, which has one side paid by paying the float interest rate. The other side is paid by the fixed interest rate. This also is called a **Plain Vanilla Swap.**

## Swap Details

personalfinance,Taking out a HELOC to invest in the market?,"Real estate prices in my area recently skyrocketed and I now have about $1mm in equity in my home (I owe about $400k). 

I have no other debt, and enough cash flow to where I've already maxed out the traditional investments (IRA, 401k, college funds, etc) and have enough in conservative investments to where I feel emboldened to take some risks. 

One avenue I've been exploring is somehow tapping into the equity in my home to leverage investments in some sort of stable index fund. I have between $5k to $7k each month that is currently being put towards more conservative investments and could be tapped into to make the payments on a HELOC if need be. 

Basically my thought here is, the rate of return on the market far outstrips the interest rate on a HELOC, and I just hate the idea of having so much theoretical wealth that's doing absolutely nothing for me. 

Is this a really dumb move that could/will probably blow up in my face and ruin me? Or is this something that is fairly reasonable?

personalfinance,Vacation and Comp'd time payout advice/question,"Hi all,

I'm resigning from my job to start a new one. I have quite a lot of vacation and comp'd OT accrued (13.5 weeks total), since I expected to be at this job for my first child and was saving all my time for  FML time. Life happens, and we need to move.

My question is...how does this 13.5 weeks payout work. It will be lumped into my normal paycheck - so  my worry was that payroll withholds taxes based on my earring that much in that period. This would blow, as I'd have to wait until 2023 to get back that extra taxes withheld for the abnormally large paycheck.

I've read it is seen as supplemental wages and taxed at a flat 25%? So is my normal paycheck taxed at the regular rates and these supplemental wage payouts are taxed at 25% federal rate, plus medicare/SS withdrawals.

Not even sure how the state of CA determines the state tax withheld...but any tips are appreciated.

Thought about maxing out IRA withholding but then I miss out on employer match in my new job (current job doesn't match).

Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Should I get a student loan if I don’t need one?,"I live in the UK and am a first year medical student. The student loan interest rate is 4.1%, but is subject to change. I have a loan which covers my university fees but do not have a maintenance loan as my parents cover my accommodation costs and transfer me £600 a month for living expenses.

This amount is more than enough, but I was wondering if I should get a maintenance loan anyway. I would receive £4000 over the year and could save this money. I’m aware I wouldn’t get the interest I pay back from saving it, however I would have to pay this money back over such a long period of time, would it be worth getting one anyway? I’m thinking it could be handy for emergencies or potentially to start savings for a house deposit. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Edit: I would only have to start paying this loan back once I’ve started working.",finance

Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

personalfinance,Staffed to Employee--Wage Change?,"I've been an employee at recruiting/staffing company C for a few months, working through them for company S. Happily, company S is creating a full-time employee role whose responsibilities would be similar to my current ones--basically, the role I'm doing as a staffed person will become a true company S employee, and hopefully I'll get the job!

However, I have little idea how to navigate the salary/benefits process. Currently I'm being paid $25/hr by the staffing agency, but have no benefits. Staffing company C is paying the business portion of taxes, while I pay the normal employee portion (W2 style). If I am hired at company S, I'll still be paying employee taxes, while company S will pay for business tax and new benefits. Should I be asking for more than my current hourly wage as well? What's normal for pay or benefit negotiations in this transition?

I've tried googling, but most of the articles I find are written for business owners convincing them that staffing agencies don't price greedily. I can't find anything for regular working people going from staffed worker to employee, or how that will affect pay rates/benefits. Can anyone advise if I should be looking for a pay bump, particular benefits, etc., or just nothing at all? I'd hate to blow my chance to negotiate for lack of knowledge.

personalfinance,House ownership,"Hi, I live in Scotland. 

Can anyone advise me on the correct time to buy a home? 

I’ve been saving money for a long time and have been investing in stocks/shares/SIPPs etc and so far I’ve been able to save just over £250,000 and I’m not looking to buy a house. 

I’ve heard that just now isn’t the best time because of interest rates being too low. When is a good time to buy? I am thinking of just buying a home outright or, if I find a place I really like, putting down a significant deposit and then getting a small mortgage (I have a good job so that shouldn’t be a problem). 

Are conditions likely to improve soon to enable a good market? What are the signs that buying a home is appropriate? 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks",finance
personalfinance,26 yo - increase retirement contributions or balance with taxable account?,"26 yo with ~8k in 401k, ~3k in Roth IRA, ~5k savings. ~24k student loans (at an avg around 3.5% interest)

Roth IRA - 250/mo.
Savings 400/mo.
Taxable Investment Account - $100/mo

1. I feel very behind as I only started saving more aggressively about a year ago. Am I going to be alright on this path? I plan to continue to increase my savings as my salary increases. Currently expenses are pretty high as I live in a HCOL area.

2. Should I cease monthly contributions to the taxable account and allocate that money to the Roth IRA or 401k instead? If so, which one or both? Is the benefit of a taxable account only tangible once retirement contributions have been maxed?

3. Student loans have been paused with COVID. When they begin again in January, should I pay them off aggressively or more conservatively given the low interest rate?

stocks,Market made a mistake on Tilray; at least 30% upside,"Those who've been following the cannabis industry, knows that Tilray's recent trading performance has been underwhelming. In my opinion, the biggest hurdle to the company's trading performance is due to the Canadian adult recreational industry wide challenge along with covid-related retail headwinds. There's been struggles for the Canadian cannabis LPs to generate growth organically within the adult recreational segment. For example, while Tilray, market leader in Canadian adult recreational, generated 26% topline growth from $405 million in 2020 to $513 million in 2021, much of that topline growth is derived from acquisitions. In other words, Tilray's recent revenue growth were ""bought"" instead of generated organically as the market expands. Low growth within the segment along with some structural challenges and covid-related shut-downs further negatively impacted the industry's outlook and profitability, resulting in depressing trading performances.

As cannabis companies remain illegal in the United States at a federal level and debt capital raising are off the table as a result, Canadian cannabis LPs relies on equity issuance to fund acquisition opportunities to ""grow"" their toplines. Result of both stagnant growth and share dilution, Tilray traded down from $40 in February 2021 to $10 last close. Tilray's TTM EV/Sales declined from 40x to 10x. For a growth company within a quickly expanding market that's only 3 years old, 10x TTM sales EV is a good price in my opinion. What makes it even more attractive is that there's a catalyst that the market has dismissed and forgotten that will completely derail the stagnant market growth narrative for Tilray.

Germany's new coalition government has recently reached a deal that's set to legalize recreational cannabis use. As a result, German pot stocks popped last week on Frankfurt exchange. For example, German cannabis company Synbiotic rose by 33% to $29 Euro, which implies a $100mm market cap.

What the market has forgotten however is that Canadian cannabis LP Tilray is actually the market leader in the Germany's cannabis market. But the stock didn't move last week.

How do I know the market made a mistake instead of ""everything has been priced in"" narrative?

Easy. First, almost every German pot companies moved up last week. The fact that Tilray didn't change at all suggests that whoever was making market genuinely forgot that Tilray is a market leader in the German cannabis market.

Second, if we assume status quo on Tilray's 10x EV/Sales multiple, which is a very conservative assumption because we're completely dismissing the potential of a new, 3-days old, 83 million population addressable market. And if we proxy $90 million of additional revenue, which is another very conservative assumption as Tilray generated $90 million in revenue after Canada legalized their adult recreational cannabis market in 2018; Conservative because German population doubles of Canadian. With the conservative multiple assumption while holding other variables constant, just by adding the additional $90 million in revenue, we should expect Tilray trade up by at least 30%. The fact that it didn't trade up at the slightest suggests whoever was making market was sleeping in his office after he had his turkey.

Third, Tilray is production and distribution ready. Tilray operates two state-of-art facilities in Portugal and Germany with over 3 million square feet of production capacity. Tilray also owns and operates one of the largest market cap pharmaceutical company, CC Pharma, in Germany. Because of the company's production and distribution capacity, institutional support, larger balance sheet, domestic moms &amp; pops cannabis producers in Germany aren't like to able to compete against Tilray in the immediate 24 months of legalization, allowing Tilray to secure market leadership. Again, this echoes with why assume only $90 million of revenue and 10x EV/Sales is a very conservative estimate.

Forth, there has been consistencies showing that the cannabis MTM is very inefficient. Most of you are aware that there were a squeeze with the Canadian cannabis LPs that took place in February. It was driven by Democrats winning the election, investors bet in favour that recreational cannabis use will be legalized in the U.S. It was similar to what's happening today; similar but different. What's similar is that both are political driven catalyst and market has gotten it completely wrong. Different was that last time Tilray were traded up for the wrong reason, Tilray has minimal operations in the United States, while they're already a market leader in the German cannabis market with operations and infrastructures that are unmatched by their competitors.

Are you sick of the censorship that exists in the world and you want the freedom to express yourself in a way can't be removed or altered?

Do you want to take control of your assets in a way that we haven't been able to for hundreds of years since banks took away the notion of having cash stuffed in your mattress?

Are you a Dev/coder that is watching in anticipation as every day the limits of blockchain technology are tested an taken to another level?

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin Tops $58K With Focus on Omicron and Fed’s Powell Speech,"Bitcoin has regained some poise, tracking signs of risk reset in traditional markets. The cryptocurrency’s immediate prospects remain tied to the newly detected coronavirus variant named Omicron’s potential impact on the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy.

The top cryptocurrency by market value was trading near $57,300 at press time, representing a 7.3% gain compared to the low of $53,359 on late Sunday. Prices hit a high of $58,270 during the Asian hours.

The futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 were trading 0.9% higher alongside gains in the pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 index and other risk assets like the Australian dollar and crude oil.

Buyers made a comeback on early Monday as reports from South Africa stated that Omicron patients seen so far have had “extremely mild symptoms”. On Friday, bitcoin and risk assets, in general, tanked after the news of a supposedly vaccine-resistant COVID variant coming out of South Africa raised the specter of economically painful lockdowns. The World Health Organization (WHO) deemed the Omicron variant, as a variant of concern.

“Bitcoin is largely being grouped with other risk assets at the moment,” Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, said. “After Friday’s collapse in equities, we have seen some buying in major coins, but it’s too early to say whether it will continue.”

There is a consensus in the market that central banks and governments would quickly step in with more stimulus if asset prices slide on potential lockdowns in major economies.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Invest and save or pay off student loans?,"Throwaway account as to not divulge any identifiable info. 

I'm having a difficult time determining if I should invest my money while saving for a house or continue to pay down student loans. Apologies if this seems like an obvious question, my family didn't have much money growing up so this sort of situation is new to me. I would appreciate any insight and advice. 

Breakdown below: 

* Income of $200k per year ($50k of which paid out as a bonus quarterly, so \~$8k or so after taxes every 3 months) 
* Living expenses covered with a single paycheck (rent, utilities, car, insurance, etc.) 
* Have around $4,500 or so as ""disposable""
* Look to save or invest around $3k - $3500 / month, rest is for going out, dog care, events, etc.

I have around $50k remaining in student loans, which I refinanced at the height of the pandemic when interest rates were low and received a 2.3% rate and 10 years to pay off (currently 1 year in) @ $540 / month. 

Current financial situation: 

* Late 20's
* No credit card debt
* $70k in retirement funds (401k &amp; IRA)
* $45k in investment (mutual funds) 
* $30k in cash (emergency fund, 6 months living expensive + some)

I'm hoping to buy a home in the next 3ish years, and wondering if I should: 

* Continue to save and invest as is, paying the minimum on the student loans 
* Scale back saving and investment a bit, paying double the minimum + minimum on loans, reducing the payoff time by 75% (so 1500 or so / month) 
* Stop saving and investing and focus completely on student loan (paying off in \~1.2 years) 
* Some combination of the above

personalfinance,"Recast mortgage to remove PMI, or leave alone?","Recently sold my old house and bought a new house.

Bought my new house for ~$500k with a 15% down payment ($75k) and PMI because I actually got a lower interest rate this way compared to 20% down and no PMI. Interest rate is 2.75%. PMI is $38.95/mo.

After I sold my other house, I received an additional ~$115k after subtracting the $75k down payment on my new house. To reach 20% and remove PMI I would need a ~$25k deposit.

Ideally I'd like to remove the PMI. I'd prefer to not make a lump 5% principal-only payment because I'm not really interested shortening my loan duration by a few years. I'd rather have a lower monthly payment and same loan term, just because the interest rate is so low and I think the cash could potentially return better than 2.75%.

So another option is to recast. My lender charges a $150 fee to recast. I would pay ~$25k to get to 20% loan-to-value, plus a one time $150 fee, to remove the $39 per month PMI. This would also lower my monthly principal and interest payment by ~$100. So my monthly payment would drop ~$139.

My question is, should I even bother with this? I would pay $25k _now_ to save ~$139 per month... or I can just pay my normal payment and wait until I hit 20% LTV naturally which will take about 2.5 years according to my current amortization schedule.

Some quick math: ($139 * 12 * 2.5) - ($150) = $4020 extra cash over those 2.5 years due to recasting.

So I think the real question is - could I turn that $25k into $29020 in 2.5 years? If so, it doesn't seem like it makes sense to do this recast. I believe the answer is _maybe_. That's about an 8% APY. Not a sure thing, but also not _super_ aggressive either.

But I'd like some opinions here, and please point out anywhere I may be miscalculating. Thanks.",finance

CryptoCurrency,It is incredibly important that we encourage people to not hold Tether.,"We have all heard the FUD. Buttcoiners and crypto skeptics alike are quick to show graphs of Tether printing and BTC price to supposedly prove that this whole thing we have going here is a scam.

Anyone with a basic understanding of the technology behind successful projects, especially Bitcoin, knows that is not true. Bitcoin and crypto is here to stay, and the battle has begun as to which ones will survive and how governments will adapt and respond.

However, even though Tether is not the end of the crypto universe, it is a serious risk which should not be taken lightly. It currently sits at over 74B in market cap, which would make it one of the biggest bankruptcies of all time if it fails, and would certainly have a huge impact on the overall market.

Tether, to my knowledge, has only around 20 employees. This is the highest employee to value ratio of any entity, ever, even the biggest ponzis like Bernie Madoff. They have not been transparent on their holdings. They have largely had no accountability for minting of coins, which makes the likelihood of fraud incredibly high. They can basically counterfeit USD with no backing to keep up with demand if they require.

Tether is not much worse then what traditional banks have done in the past. The problem becomes that eventually the government will crack down, and these 'Tether dollars' will not be accepted and will not have value. And unlike banks of the past, there is little chance of Tether being bailed out by US taxpayers.

We don't need to bankrun Tether. Regulators will do their work eventually and the bandaid will be ripped off. Some might be compensated.

We need to do two things.

1. Actively discourage holding Tether for new users. Never recommend people continue to buy in or sell into it. The more we can reduce the damage in the future, the better it will be. And even if there is a slim chance there actually isn't anything sinister going on, there are tons of other stablecoins which serve the same purpose and have much better transparency.
2. Make sure people understand that even if Tether is shown to be a scam, BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM are not scams. Banks will try to use the fear from a crash due to an UnTethering to prove that we need central control, insurance, and their currencies. This is NOT the case. Even if the value of BTC, ETH, or other actual projects goes down temporarily due to fear, they still work exactly as they are designed. It will be a great buying opportunity and the more we adopt actually valuable money like BTC, the safer we will be.

Best wishes to all, and fuck sketchy stable coins. Mostly though, fuck the federal reserve, the sketchiest stable coin issuer out there.",cryptocurrency

Or does it make sense to split up the 20k in some fashion to do both simultaneously since it seems I have the liquid cash to do so?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Nov 29, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 29, 2021**

Following an extremely volatile, holiday-shortened week, stocks rebounded on Monday, driven higher by a huge bounce in technology, as market participants grapple with the potential implications of the newly discovered “Omicron” coronavirus variant. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed higher after its worst day since October 2020, as the price of oil, which suffered its worst day all year, somewhat rebounded. While it is way too early to make any conclusions, I am personally looking at this dip as a potential buying opportunity in equities that were overstretched before.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients, “Ultimately this is not the first or last variant scare and our tech playbook over the last 18 months has been to use these macro/risk-off events as buying opportunities to own the tech sector specifically cloud, cyber-security, and 5G winners. While we are seeing a return to normalcy, a semi-remote workforce environment we believe is here to stay which underscores our tech cloud thesis into 2022 that the digital transformation build-out will be accelerated and is not a one time COVID pull forward event""

The US and EU have banned a host of destinations to ban flights from several African countries after the new variant was discovered. But cases of the variant, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has so far designated as a ""[variant of concern](https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern),"" have also detected in regions including the U.K., Hong Kong, Australia, Germany and Italy, among others.

While there is still much that needs to be studies regarding the Omicron variant, Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), the two largest producers the current COVID vaccine, asid they are already working to adapt current inoculations for the new variant and that, if a tailor made vaccine is necessary, would be completed relatively quickly. [Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said a new vaccine to address the Omnicron variant ](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/moderna-says-an-omicron-variant-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-early-2022.html)would be widely available in early 2022 and [Pfizer said it could take about 100 days to have a tailor made vaccine ready to be widely available.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omicron-covid-19-variant-pfizer-184458407.html)

President Biden said of the new variant, “his variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic. We have the best vaccines in the world, the best medicine, the best scientists, and we’re learning more every single day. We have more tools today to fight the variant than we ever have before.”

Despite concerns present in the market, consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, continues accelerating. While supply-chain disruptions could lead shoppers toward in-stock items at physical stores this year, I think overall spending will see a healthy increase. The National Retail Federation (NRF) is forecasting an 8.5%-10.5% increase in holiday sales this year, compared with 2020. 

The latest reading shows the personal savings rate is 7.5% (savings as a % of disposable income), the third-highest rate coming into Thanksgiving in the last quarter century. While this is down dramatically from the spike during the pandemic lockdowns (when consumers were unable to consume), the savings rate remains notably above the long-term average of 6.5% (6.1% excluding 2020). We think elevated savings will be drawn down, representing additional dry powder that will power consumer-spending growth for an extended period. At 4.2%, wage growth is now the highest it's been since Thanksgiving of 2007, providing additional fuel for consumers. Looking back over the last 25 years, when wage growth was above 4% and accelerating, GDP growth averaged 3.2%, compared with an average of 2.5% over the entire period, according to a report by Edward Jones.

CryptoCurrency,I did some math looking into Crypto.com's debit card staking rewards to guage how long it takes for them to break even,"First off let me say I personally hold CRO in my portfolio as my biggest bag so I am in a position where CRO's growth and success will bring me personal gain (my personal goal is to upgrade to Icy White) so I am biased yada yada and all that. I am not a financial advisor but if you must know, I did graduate high school which means I am able to do math using a calculator. Math is not as biased as I am, but you are welcome to check my work, I appreciate correcting any mistakes.

For this I am using $1100 as the average monthly spending because that's what a quick internet search said was the average for rent USA in 2020, this is $13,200 per year. Reality is more expensive than this but for the sake of keeping reasonable expectations I will just use that for the math as a baseline. I am also not accounting for any CRO price fluctuations because the rebates and cashback spending are scaled based on spending USD amounts using the card.

**Ruby:** $400 in CRO

- 0% card stake interest
- 2% cashback: $22 per month or $264/year
- Spotify: $12.99 per month or $155.88/year
- Yearly Total: $419.88 (or $155.88 without cashback)
- Breakeven: 348 days (or 2.57 years without cashback)
- Return of investment: 105% per year (or 39% without cashback)

**Jade/Indigo:** $4,000 in CRO

- 10% card stake interest: $33.33 per month or $400/year
- 3% cashback: $33 per month or $396/year
- Spotify: $12.99 per month or $155.88/year 
- Netflix: $13.99 per month or $167.88/year
- Yearly Total: $1,119.76 (or $723.76 without cashback)
- Breakeven: 3.57 years (or 5.53 years without cashback)
- Return of investment: 28% per year (or 18.1% without cashback)

**Icy White/Rose Gold:** $40,000 in CRO

- 12% card stake interest: $400 per month or $4,800/year
- 5% cashback: $55 per month or $660/year
- Spotify: $12.99 per month or $155.88/year
- Netflix: $13.99 per month or $167.88/year
- Amazon Prime: $12.99 per month or $155.88/year
- Yearly Total: $5,939.64 (or $5,279.64 without cashback)
- Breakeven: 6.73 years (or 7.58 years without cashback)
- Return of investment: 14.8% per year (or 13.2% without cashback)

**Obsidian:** $400,000 in CRO

- 12% card stake interest: $4,000 per month or $48,000/year
- 8% cashback: $88 per month or $1056/year

**Not Included in the math:**

- CRO price changing over time
- 10% back on CRO pay rewards up to $5 per month
- Increased crypto earn interest rates for Jade/Indigo, Icy/Rose and Obsidian
- +2% additional crypto earn interest paid in CRO for Icy/Rose and Obsidian
- Airport lounge access for Jade/Indigo, Icy/Rose and Obsidian
- 10% rebate for Expedia for Icy/Rose and Obsidian
- 10% rebate for Airbnb for Obsidian

**Conclusion:**

With so many marketing partnerships involving multi-year contracts that extend across a range up to 20 years I can imagine this company continuing to existing for a very long time. Staking to get a CRO card isn't like normal investing where you don't get any returns until you eventually cash out either, instead you are getting interest paid out every week and monthly rebates on a consistant basis while using a cool stainless steel debit card. 180 days after staking if the value of CRO has gone up you can re-stake to pull out the extra CRO if you want to and if the value has gone down you can just keep it staked without losing the card tier benefits. If you use the card long enough in theory it should always pay for itself after a certain amount of time assuming that Crypto.com doesn't start removing incentives. 

Only stake what you can afford to lock down for atleast a long enough time frame that you eventually reach the breakeven point, or consider the return of investment percentage and compare that to the staking yields that you get with other cryptocurrencies.

My father contacted a funds manager he has been working with for years and he said that “you need to be a professional in order to buy“ VTSAX in Portugal, but i dont’t quite believe it. He also gave us an alternative of S&amp;P500 ETF’s with 0,3% interest rates.

CryptoCurrency,I'm in highschool and crypto has helped me in lots of ways,"First of all, I don't think people realise how beneficial crypto is to someone who doesn't have access to a credit or debit card...
 Let's say I want to buy a service online, I don't own a credit card since I'm not old enough to own one etc etc etc... Well crypto changes this, lots of small businesses online already take crypto currencies as paymemt method, so I can just send them money directly from my wallet. This is called being your own banked, and it's amazing in my opinion.

So, let's see another scenario... I play a Player vs Player game in which items are sold around between the playerbase. We use a known and trusted player, or just a friend as Middle Man when doing trades (money for items), well... when some people quit the game, they used to chargeback all of their payments through paypal which f***ed the system because people would be scared to be used as Middle Men... Well, with crypto that changes... there is no chargeback option.

I also do stuff like playing crypto royale for fun and end up getting a few extra bucks... which is pretty awesome too, don't get me wrong, but I think it's not the most important one of them.

business,How to make passive income as a working class citizen.,"The working class is defined as a the social-economic middle class with a working income, that is, an income earned via full or part time employment.

Now, the working class being known as busy and hard working is not a false stereotype. I know this as I am a working man myself, and I find that with all of my shifts and my job and looking after my family I have no time for starting a business or finding any other way to improve my income (which is especially needed now that I have a third child on the way :D).

So how do you earn passive income as a working class citizen with a family to feed? Well it’s much easier then you thought.

Step 1: Now we should assume you already have a job, if not, best advice is to get one. Try retail, but don’t look for a small retail outlet, go big, somewhere that has over 15 people working at a time. It would be best to go for a full time postion as well.

Step 2: Make it through your orientation and first day, and as you keep working there, make sure to leave every 30 minutes to go to the bathroom, stay on the toilet for 10 minutes, then go back out. Eventually, people won’t be able to recognise you because you are always on the toilet, so after your first two weeks, clock on at your shift and stay on the toilet for the entirety of your shift. Now you have the basic start to your passive income.

Step 3: After approximately 5 weeks your manager is going to want a word with you about why you are spending company time on the toilet, so you must find something to use as leverage so that your manager doesn’t fire you. Find something either borderline illegal, or entirely illegal. Something like marijuana useage, then use that against them, haters are going to call this blackmail, but it really is just simple capitalist strategy.

Step 5: Work with your manager, not against them! Use the marijuana useage and bribe them with so they can cover up why you sit on the toilet all the time instead of working. Find their dealer, maybe even buy in bulk, or just rob them. In most countries marijuana is still illegal so it’s not necessarily illegal to commit armed robbery on an illegal business. You could even interrogate their dealer to find where they grow the cannibis. Then steal the plant, learn horticulture, and grow more plants. Cultivate, harvest, sell, simple business plan. Sell to your mangers, they now have no other dealer, you dealt with that problem. Bring them in on the business too, be the boss of your bosses and get them to sell to your co-workers. Get your managers to get your coworkers to sell to their friends, and make your managers ask for 60% and then you ask your mangers for 60% of that.

Step 6: Protect your passive income. Buy guns, hire muscle and cut deals with outlaw motorcycle gangs for advanced distribution networks and protection. Now that you have your protection go on the offensive. Be ruthless, feared and respected all at the same time. Why stick with marijuana? Sell heroin, cocaine, crystal methamphetamine. Why stick with drugs? Sell assault rifles as well! Don’t just sell products, sell sevices as well! Run prostitutes, sell protection, sell loans, sell the services of your own personal hit squad, it’s the rule 34 of business, “if it exists, you can sell it.”

Step 7: Lose the moral compass, morals are subjective anyway. They are also a poor mans philosophy and makes you look weak. Not good for business.

Step 8: Deal with the pigs. No one is incorruptible. Bribe cops, politcians, federal agents, buy anyone and everyone. Loyalty is the most valuable commodity and only the most powerful can afford it.

And now you are a 3-bit drug lord with your own steady stream of passive income.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Inflation rate jumps to more than 5% in Germany and the ECB does absolutely nothing about it. FIAT money is inflationary, Crypto is not. I'll take that bet any day.","Germany's consumer price inflation rate is expected to climb to 5.2 percent year-on-year in November 2021, the highest rate since June 1992 and above market expectations of 5 percent, a preliminary estimate showed. The reading came in also well above the ECB's target of 2 percent, adding to concerns about growing inflationary pressure in Europe's largest economy due to ongoing supply issues and base effects, especially the temporary VAT reduction and the sharp decline in mineral oil product prices last year. 

The ECB claims: ""inflation peaked in November, meaning it would be premature to raise interest rates as price increases look likely to slow gradually next year, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel said."" So they opt to do nothing to counteract the inflation, believing it will settle itself in the next few months. 

(Source: [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/inflation-reached-its-peak-november-ecbs-schnabel-2021-11-29/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/inflation-reached-its-peak-november-ecbs-schnabel-2021-11-29/))

Main upward pressure should come from energy products (22.1 percent vs 18.6 percent in October), food (4.5 percent vs 4.4 percent), and services (2.8 percent vs 2.4 percent). On a monthly basis, consumer prices are expected to fall 0.2 percent in November. The CPI, harmonized to compare with other European countries, was up 6.0 percent on the year and rose 0.3 percent month-on-month.

&amp;#x200B;

But not only Germany is experiencing a higher inflation rate. Most Western European nations are faced with a higher inflation rate due to higher gas and electricity prices.

There is a lot of financial pressure on the markets and quite a few bubbles that are oozing to burst. I'll take my bet with crypto this time around, as ""traditional"" financial markets are hardly promising what they promote. 

If you live in Europe a 5% pay raise hasn't actually given you more money, you still have some power to buy than before. **Only way out** for a young person in Europe with little money **is crypto**, as most staking rewards are higher than the inflation rate without considering the increase in value. I am willing to take that bet.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans and planning for the future - Sanity check?,"Hi all! Hoping to get a little help with a sanity check on what to do from here with my student loans and savings. I have a mix of federal and private loans, and considering rolling it all into one (with a lower interest rate) so not going to do anything with them until at least mid-late January when the freeze on the federal loans is coming off (and I get a small raise, which may get me even better rates).

[Here's where I currently stand with my student loans](https://imgur.com/a/qkYHfOl). Obviously all but the large one are federal. I've been looking at refinance options and found that I can roll them all into one loan for:

* 7 years, 2.76%, $843.99 min payment
* 10 years, 2.84%, $617.11 min payment

As much as I'd love to have them gone in 7 years, the minimum payment is a little higher than I'm comfortable with. The 10-year offer is more what I was hoping to pay, and the difference in interest is small enough that it doesn't feel like a huge loss to me for the sake of not risking a month where I can't make the full payment.

My thought is that I can always pay above the minimum when I have the funds to do so but with the interest rates so low... does it make sense to?

I'd be planning on $500/month ($6k/year max contribution) to my Roth IRA, getting my emergency fund back up to $5k (recently had to tap into it to pay for my Invisalign), and starting to fund savings for a down payment on a home (which is likely to be at least a few years down the road).

So my questions are...

1. Should I refinance all into one loan at 2.84%?
2. Once I have my emergency fund at a healthy amount and I'm putting $6k/year into my Roth IRA, would I be making a mistake putting money into saving for a down payment rather than paying extra into my student loans since the interest rate is so low?

Other relevant info:

* I do have 5.5 years working at a non-profit going towards PSLF credit, but it's extremely unlikely I'll finish that up to 10, so I don't expect to ever get PSLF
* I currently make $65k, so income-based plans on my federal loans seem to do very little for me.
* I'll be eligible to join my employer's 401k in July (I'm eligible in the July following 1 year of service), but rather than a match, they do a straight up contribution, so I planned to just continue contributing $6k/year to my Roth IRA and let my employer fund my 401k.",finance

So I'm buying my first home and I've been debating on the size of down payment to put down. This is my first home so I believe I will qualify for an FHA loan at roughly 3.4% interest rate right now according to google. I believe I also then tack on the mortage insurance which has an additional interest rate of 1.5% according to another google search. This means my mortgage's effective interest rate is 4.9%


Now I have fairly sizable portfolio, not enough to buy a house in cash but a respectable size. I also know that the market grows at an average rate of 10% if you wait long enough and invest in index funds.


Other somewhat relevant financial: No debt, close to a six-figure annual salary. Single person household, no dependents 


My question is does it make sense to take as much of this ""low interest"" money as possible and leave as much of my portfolio in the market as I can? Even if the market only grew at 6% which is significantly below the average, it would still be outpacing my mortgage's interest rate by a whole percent. Is there something wrong with my reasoning? I don't even see a reason to put down enough to get rid of the mortgage insurance since, again, the market should more than out pace it.


Thanks for the clarification on this!

I am 24 and currently make a 55k base salary and make around an additional $800/week in commission. My wife is a teacher who makes 40k. We got married in August and moved into a new apartment right after. Low and behold we find out that she is pregnant about a month into marriage. Our baby is due in June.

We are looking at houses around 200k and I’m wondering if it’s worth buying a house now while interest rates are low and taking the hit on the lease until they find a new tenant, or if I should just suck it up and wait until after the baby is born.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto small business as exit strategy in the US,"Right now, the elephant in the room in US for crypto traders and HODLers alike is: (1) Dealing with regulatory bullshit like when a transaction is and isn't reportable, and; (2) Not getting taxed on the way out. As I mentioned in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qz2o4u/were_all_looking_at_the_price_when_we_should_be/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), the only way out of the taxes is for people is to use credit against their crypto.

One thing I should stress further is that individuals do not have the same access to credit as businesses do b/c individuals' assets (like the car and the house) aren't sufficiently liquid in the market for low interest rates; securities, on the other hand, e.g., stocks and bonds, are perfect for this, despite not necessarily generating high-yield.

Considering this, I'm wondering if anyone, like myself, has thought of creating a legal entity (as in, their own company, e.g., an LLC) for all financial and crypto-related ventures. My personal goal is to be able to get an ultra-stable stream of supplemental income from the business, continuing to fund it until I can pretty much retire off of it.

The business would also potentially open up access to many other yield-generation schemes, such as a self-managed stake pool and so forth; you could also do this as an individual, but then you'd be answerable to Big Brother if they start tracking IP addresses from AWS and questioning the owner/payer of the pertinent accounts or something (I'm VERY bearish on an overreaching sovereign state).

On the Fiat side, it would be really nice to operate as a legal entity and have access to the same credit markets that companies have (I hear small business loans are becoming increasingly popular these days); this way, you would be able to get debt positions against your crypto and diversify into, e.g., real estate, metals, and debt securities (government and corporate bonds). Real estate would be especially convenient as, with an LLC, you're not personally liable if a renter falls off the balcony and sues you or something (frivolous lawsuits are themselves a huge industry in this country, unfortunately); in fact, I'm pretty sure there's not even a rule against living in a house owned by your LLC, as long as you can prove that you own the company. Again, you could get into these markets as an individual too, but as is the meta in this sub, regulators are incompetent swine looking to make a quick buck by harassing the middle class until they get their cut; you're generally much better protected as a legal entity with an accountant and lawyer on retainer.

How to pay yourself: Once your company starts making profits, you could structure payments to your personal bank account through a regular salary or other general disbursements (this is the kind of thing a small business accountant does, so YMMV). If you're able to start cutting down on debt and getting profits from your company, all you have to do is scale up until you can achieve whatever lifestyle you want in your personal life.

My long-term dream: I'm a simple guy, pretty much all I want is a nice house, a reliable car, and a sufficiently-large rainy day fund; beyond that, I'm trying to cut personal expenses as much as possible.  However, I'm also obsessed with cats and dogs (I'm neither a cat person nor a dog person, I just love them both), so it'd be huge for me to be able to securely set aside all the money my future pet(s) would need in his/her/their lifetime(s) and also be able to either fund a local animal shelter or even start my own as a nonprofit.

Curious to see if anyone else's been thinking along these lines, excited to hear the feedback!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Why is it so difficult to get my bank to provide a written statement of account closure (NEVER banking with PNC again)?,"I've never had an issue with PNC until now. I'm really struggling to understand the mess that this has become.

While I don't *think* there will be any issues, the fact that I have already spoken with two bank tellers and 4 customer service representatives and now escalated the customer ""retail"" relations (the rudest person to ever work in customer service), and none of them can give me the same answer on account closure policies makes me want this letter more now than ever. 

All reps advised no written statement was sent or emailed and just assured me my accounts were closed. I could still log in to my account after a few days and then eventually I couldn't. Then received a bank statement in the mail 3 weeks later. The last person I spoke with said I should receive something in the mail and used the good ol ""The pandemic is making the mail slow"" excuse, until I had to remind her my account was closed weeks ago and it's been much longer than 10 business days my dear. This is the one who escalated the issue to dear James in the retail(?) Department. She also told me it would take 24-48 business hours for someone to contact me on a Wednesday afternoon.

((Side note: All of these calls have been nothing but me being inquisitive and confused, no yelling and expressing my frustration with the situation. All the reps were nice to me as well but NONE of them could give me straight forward answers and seemed as puzzled as me.))
 
 I expected a call on Friday but was generous enough to wait until Monday....I moved to a new state a month ago and have other things to do, so I took a rest on the PNC fiasco...until the following Friday rolled around and I got a voicemail from James. James sounded miserable AF. I chalked it up to him having a bad day. I called back about 15min later around 430PM *and* in his VM he stated his hours were until 8pm. 

I never heard back from James. 

So a few hours later, I replied to the email he sent along with his first call. I plainly restated his hours and asked if he had a busy day, as well as expressed my frustration by stating I've been having a busy month doing a dance with PNC. Soft blow, but WTH Dude?! You suck at your job. (I've been a server for 10 years and now work in client/patient advocacy--former anthropologist by degree so I think I'm qualifiied to say this). 

I politely asked for a written statement of account closure and hoped he would just reply with an attached document but he never replied. The weekend goes by and today he called back.


I have had time to calm down by then and I repeat that I just want a written statement. I briefly go over what has happened. He dodges my request and basically says the last statement I received is essentially proof of closure because of the zero balance. Uhhh. What?

I ask why I can't receive a written letter or statement, like the ones PNC sends for account disputes or modifications. And  added, sarcastically, they send emails and promotional offers so why not a written statement.

When you end a subscription or close accounts you get confirmations. What's the big deal? What are y'all trying to be sneaky about?

He was just silent and continued to say that its not something they can do, period. No explanation. No empathy for my concerns. He flatly states he will send my feedback...somewhere. Literally, the most unenthusiastic and *please stop talking to me* tone ever.

All I wanted was a clean and friendly break, no issues at all other than I wanted to move my money to a more profitable account. I no longer make cash tips and my other bank is local and has great interest rates/service so I can go there. 

Regardless of if I'm closing an account, I expect the same level of customer service. I never made a lot of money (maybe thats why, small fish for them) but I banked with them for 7 years. 

Could be an issue of the whole merging w that other bank, but don't think that causes incompetent staff on account closures.

Seems like when you want written confirmations from people when it comes to your own damn money, they throw fits. Like my precious landlord who let me break my lease early due to her violating her own lease terms. Literally huffed at me and stomped away, a 60 year old woman. She also tried increasing my rent during the pandemic 😆 so..

I DON'T do verbal agreements and the moment you act like that, I'm GLAD I pushed for the writing. 

I'm not stopping PNC. 



TLDR;

WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR MY BANK TO GIVE ME A WRITTEN NOTICE OF ACCOUNT CLOSURE? Am I being a karen?

PNC is shady and aside from their shitty products, this will be the reason I will never bank with them again.",finance
Bitcoin,How does your bank and the IRS react if you sell a bunch of bitcoin and cash it out?,"For instance, imagine you're a guy making $40k/year and your bank suddenly gets a deposit for $50k from an exchange.

Does the bank flag it and contact you and/or the IRS, and do the feds investigate?

Do things like this happen so often now with crypto that the feds don't have time to investigate them all?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Rent vs. Buy. Help me decide.,"I am trying to see the benefit in renting vs. buying. I live in an expensive real estate market and my federal tax rate is 24% and state is 9%.

I’ve been cringing at what it takes to buy a condo, but I think it’s worth it. Or is it? It would cost about $10,800 a year more out of pocket to buy, but that’s building equity and likely to return money on the backend. Or would that $250k growing at 4% yoy outweigh the equity?

74. Looks like Cardano is seeing a huge amount of on-chain activity. The crazy part is this is all pre-PAB. Just wait until dApps can actually launch! Unsurprisingly, some supporters of other chains were shocked to realize they didn’t understand the difference between exchange trading volume and actual blockchain use volume.

87. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs.

97. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

stocks,"Giant U.S. Pension Bought AMC, Snowflake, and Tilray Stock","The second-largest public pension by assets in the U.S. increased its stake in one of the year’s most-volatile stocks, initiated a position in a marijuana grower, and trimmed its exposure to Warren Buffett.

The California State Teachers’ Retirement System bought more shares of movie-theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (ticker: AMC) and analytics-software firm Snowflake ( SNOW ), acquired shares of the cannabis producer Tilray (TLRY), and reduced its holdings in Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKb ), Buffett’s investment juggernaut. Calstrs, as the pension is known, disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Calstrs said it doesn’t comment on its holdings or on individual investment managers. The pension managed $321.9 billion in assets as of Oct. 31​.

Calstrs bought 133,512 more shares of AMC to end the third quarter with 689,917 shares. AMC’s stock price rocketed nearly 19-fold in the first nine months of the year, and so far in the fourth quarter shares are down 1%. For comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index rose 15% in the first nine months, and has gained 6.7% so far in the fourth quarter.

AMC stock caught fire during the meme-stock frenzy early in the year, when small investors communicating via social media bought shares of beaten-down companies in hopes of triggering gains that would force people who had bet against those stocks to buy in order to close their bets. The trend led to a surge in volatility that prompted the Federal Reserve to warn this month that meme-stock related market swings could be a risk to the financial system. AMC’s third-quarter results were better than expected, and the chain is now accepting cryptocurrencies for online payments.

The pension bought 347,900 Tilray shares in the third quarter; at the end of the second, it hadn’t owned any. Tilray stock rose 37% in the first nine months of the year, and so far in the fourth quarter shares are down 6.4%. In early October, Tilray reported a wider-than-expected loss for the fiscal first quarter. Recent legislative proposals, including one that would decriminalize pot at the federal level have lifted Tilray and its peers. The legal-pot sector, however, saw layoffs during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Snowflake stock rose 7.5% in the first nine months of the year, and so far in the fourth quarter shares have gained 20%. The gain could have been bigger, but Snowflake and other cloud-software peers slipped after President Joe Biden nominated Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell to another four-year term. Interest rates rose in the wake of the nomination, tempering enthusiasm for richly valued, high-growth stocks. The company reported a mixed second quarter in August, and Snowflake will report its third quarter after the market close on Dec. 1. Calstrs bought 119,934 additional Snowflake shares to end the third quarter with 328,801 shares.

The pension sold 511,630 class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway to end the third quarter with 2.9 million shares of Buffett’s firm. Shares rose 18% in the first nine months of the year, and so far in the fourth quarter they have gained 3.7%. Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had a record $149 billion in cash at the end of September. Buffett and John Malone—two billionaires skilled in tax-efficient transactions—recently did a stock swap. During the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway itself sold Big Pharma stock.

personalfinance,"Credit score's crazy algorithm, as I was told, ""debt-to-credit ratio""? I have never found an explanation for it yet, as it seems mighty backwards.","First, thank you for any constructive replies.

I have been dinged horribly on my credit score for paying off two large loans, my student loans and my car.  I had a total of $42K in student loans and I started a great job.  My loans got down to $2K and even though I was getting a great interest rate, I decided to just double down and pay it all off.  My credit score went down 56 points!  I was (and still am) crushed!  Five years later, I'm still not to the point of where I was before I paid off that loan.

A couple of years ago, I paid off my car loan.  I bought a beautiful car, putting down $10K, with a balance left over for $12K.  I got a low-interest loan from my credit union.  I paid on it for a couple of years and decided to pay off the balance.  I just don't like being in debt.  That dinged my credit score 18 points!

People have told me that they would rather be fiscally responsible than have a good credit score.  But, it doesn't explain how being fiscally responsible should wreck your credit score.  I spoke to someone at Experian and he told me that there is a ""credit-to-debt ratio"" algorithm and that you should have so much debt before you go and pay off balances.  I don't think he quite knew what he was talking about because he told me that I should build up my debt again by ""going out and buying a new TV"".  No kidding.

I just received my unemployment funds in a nice lump sum, after waiting 16 months.  I have two credit cards that have a balance on them, $1,600 and $800.  Both have APR's around 6%.  I want to pay them both off, but if my credit score gets dinged again, I may just run amok.  I tried looking at a lot of the FICO score information that was linked and some of the other information, but I just can't ever seem to find anything about this.  For some odd reason, I had thought being responsible with your debt would help you... go figure.

stocks,(11/30) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of November! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 30th, 2021-

# [Dow futures are down more than 350 points as investors try to gauge the economic impact of omicron](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures tumbled in early Tuesday trading, reversing a Monday rebound on Wall Street as investors reassessed risks associated with the new omicron Covid variant.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 390 points, or 1.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures tumbled 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The reversal came after Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant. The CEO told the paper there could be a “material drop” in the current vaccines’ effectiveness against this variant. Bancel told CNBC on Monday that it could take months to develop and ship an omicron-specific vaccine.
*****
&gt; Separately, Regeneron said its antibody treatment may have reduced effectiveness against omicron. Regeneron shares lost 3% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield fell further below 1.45% as investors worried about the economy slowing because of the new variant. The 10-year rate lost 9 basis points to 1.44% (1 basis point equals 0.01%). The yield on the 10-year Treasury was as high as 1.69% last week before Friday’s drop below 1.5%.
*****
&gt; The futures move lower follows a volatile last few sessions as investors evaluate the omicron impact. The Dow lost 905 points on Friday, then rebounded by 237 points on Monday.
*****
&gt; Travel shares, which led Friday’s drop and then gained on Monday, were taking hits once again in premarket trading Tuesday. Expedia Group fell 2.3%, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings tumbled 3.8% and American Airlines shares were off 3.3%.
*****
&gt; “We have to expect...that the scenarios, all scenarios, include discoveries of people in this country with omicron and talk that the vaccines don’t work or if they did those who have had Covid have no immunity,” wrote CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Twitter Tuesday. “These all cause selling.”
*****
&gt; Some leading pharma stocks also took a hit, with Moderna getting the worst of it as the stock decreased 4.2%. Pfizer, however, was one of the few companies to post gains on the S&amp;P 500, rising 1.2%. Stay-at-home stock Netflix also rose, up 0.7% and videoconference leader Zoom saw shares climb 2.3%.
*****
&gt; Major averages rose to session highs on Monday after President Joe Biden said economic lockdowns are currently off the table and there will be no new travel restrictions.
*****
&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been found in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. The World Health Organization labeled the omicron strain a “variant of concern” on Friday when the Dow slid 900 points to suffer its worst day since October 2020.
*****
&gt; Covid symptoms linked to the omicron variant have been described as “extremely mild” by the South African doctor who first raised the alarm over the new strain. Still, the WHO said it will take weeks to understand how the variant may affect diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will tell the Senate Tuesday as part of his quarterly testimony on the pandemic that he believes that the omicron variant poses “downside risks to employment and economic activity.” It also further complicates the inflation outlook, the Fed chief said in his prepared markets released Monday evening.
*****
&gt; “Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people’s willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions,” Powell will say.
*****
&gt; The CBOE volatility index, also known as the VIX or Wall Street’s fear gauge, declined during Monday’s rally but still remained above 22. The gauge spiked 10 points above 28 at one point on Friday. The VIX was higher again on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “This week will be instructive to see if the buy-the-dip approach by investors is still in play, or if markets are vulnerable to a more significant pullback,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.

Bitcoin,Use the US Tax Code For YOUR Benefit – Capital Gains Taxes,"I wanted to share with this sub some information regarding how you may be able to raise your taxable base in some of your bitcoin holdings. This dawned on me a week ago when I saw a comment on a post discussing the difference between short term and long term capital gains tax rates, and after discussing with my tax accountant, I wanted to share with the sub for broader knowledge sharing.

***Disclaimer: Please contact your tax preparer/accountant before you proceed with anything in real life. Make sure you understand the capital gains rules for yourself and confirm with your tax preparer/accountant.***

Some here may know and understand that when you sell your bitcoin it creates a taxable transaction. As the US Government recognizes bitcoin (and other cryptos) as property, and not a currency, you need to pay taxes on the difference between what you paid for your BTC and what you sold your BTC – if it has gone up in value. These taxes are referred to as “Capital Gains” taxes – similar to gains on the sale of stocks or other assets. There are two types of capital gain taxes depending upon how long you have held the underlying asset (i.e., bitcoin) – these include Short Term and Long Term. If you have held the bitcoin for less than one year (365 days) then you will pay Short Term Capital Gains taxes – which are taxed at your marginal rate (like additional normal income). If you held your bitcoin for greater than 1 year, then you will pay Long Term Capital Gains taxes – which are taxed at varying levels depending upon your level of income.

Tax Rates for Long-Term Capital Gains in 2021

|Filing Status|0%|15%|20%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Single|&lt;$40,400|$40,401-$445,850|\&gt;$445,850|
|Head Of Household|&lt;$54,100|$54,101-$473,750|\&gt;$473,750|
|Married Filing Jointly|&lt;$80,800|$80,801-$501,600|\&gt;$501,600|
|Married Filing Separately|&lt;$40,400|$40,401-$250,800|\&gt;$250,800|

*Source:* [*https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)

**How to use Capital Gains to your advantage**

You will notice that for Long-Term Capital Gains there is a 0% tax rate – meaning that you will pay **ZERO** income tax on any gains on the sale of your bitcoin/assets as long as you are under the taxable income thresholds noted above (and in the link provided). As long as you have held your bitcoin for more than 1 year – you could sell your position, buy it back immediately afterward and you’d pay no income tax on the sale, but you would have increased your taxable base in your BTC – meaning that in the future you would pay less income tax on the sale of your bitcoin.

**Other important items to note**

\- Taxable Income – you need to understand taxable income vs. your salary/total hourly wages. The difference between these two includes: (a) medical insurance premiums, (b) 401(k)/403(b) retirement contributions, (c) Health Savings Accounts (H.S.A.) contributions, (d) your standard or itemized deduction, (e) etc.

\- You will only be able to avoid long term capital gains taxes on the amount of bitcoin sold valued between your taxable income and your respective income threshold. (see example below)

\- The standard deduction for 2021 is $12,550 for Single/Married Filing Separately, $19,400 for Head of Household, and $25,900 for Married Filing Jointly. (source: [*https://www.investopedia.com/irs-announces-tax-brackets-and-other-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2022-5209190*](https://www.investopedia.com/irs-announces-tax-brackets-and-other-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2022-5209190))

\- If you are able to itemize your deductions, then even more power to you because you’ll be able to drop your taxable income levels even lower than those who use the standard deduction – but MOST people qualifying for the income levels above will not be able to itemize – it would be a unicorn of a situation most likely.

**Illustrative Example**

Jim is married to Millie. They both have jobs. Jim makes $50,000 and Millie makes $15,000. Jim pays for medical insurance and contributes to his 401(k), where Millie does not. Their paystubs (not including federal/state income taxes or FICA) total to the following:

&amp;#x200B;

||**Jim**|**Millie**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Salary|$50,000|$15,000|
|Medical Insurance Premiums|($2,000)|$0|
|401(k) Contributions|($4,000)|$0|
|Taxable Income|$44,000 ***(A)***|$15,000 ***(B)***|
||||
|Projected Total Income|$59,000 ***(A+B)***||
|Less: Standard Deduction|($24,000)||
|Projected Taxable Income on Tax Return|$35,000 ***(C)***||
||||
|LT Capital Gains Threshold|$80,800 ***(D)***||
|Potential Income For 0% Capital Gains|$45,800 ***(C-D***||

Let’s assume that Jim and Millie were early adopters to Bitcoin and they purchased 3 bitcoins back in July 2015 at $300/coin (total tax basis of $900 - $300 x 3 coins). Today, those 3 bitcoins are worth $174,000 ($58,000 spot x 3 coins). Based on their current income levels (noted in the table above), Jim/Millie could sell 0.789 bitcoin for a profit of $45,800 and pay 0% taxes on it. If they were to sell, and then instantly rebuy their bitcoin, they could eliminate $45,800 of income that they’d ever have to pay taxes on in the future, as the taxable base on that .789 bitcoin would now be $45,800, rather than $300.

This also raises their taxable base for their entire bitcoin holdings from $900 ($300 x 3 BTC) to $46,425 ($300 x 2.211 BTC + $58,000 x 0.789 BTC). It raises the average taxable base for each of their 3 BTC to $15,475 ($26,425/3) from their original $300 purchase price.

The end result of all of this was that they kept the same amount of BTC, but were able to increase their taxable base without ever having to pay any income tax on the sale – and allows them to pay less income tax on any eventual sale they decide to do. The benefit also works in the favor for if the price of BTC falls dramatically in the future as it will allow for a capital loss opportunity since you have a higher tax base. An example for that is below:

\- Jim/Mollie bought 3 BTC at $300/each.

\- Jim/Mollie sell 0.789 BTC at $58,000 (taxable basis $45,800) and then rebuy immediately, raising their overall tax basis from $900 to $46,425 for their entire BTC portfolio (for which they pay no income tax).

\- BTC then falls to $15,000 366 days after their purchase (must be over 1 year)

\- Jim/Mollie can sell their 0.789 BTC and recognize a $30,375 capital loss, which can be recognized $3,000 at a time in each subsequent income tax filing until the full loss is realized – which reduces your ordinary income (i.e., salary/wages) and reduces your taxes – that’s 10+ years of reduced income tax in this example.

edit: I originally thought BTC was a ""security"" and not ""property"". Thanks to u/explosiveplacard for correcting me on this and as such the Wash Sale rules do not apply - which is even better for BTC investors as you can sell your BTC at a loss, harvest those capital losses (to offset capital gains or up to $3,000 in ordinary income) and immediately repurchase your BTC again essentially not losing any real time position.  

~~- Jim/Mollie would have to wait 31 days to repurchase their 0.789 BTC to avoid any Wash-Sale rule impacts (i.e., essentially you can’t sell to recognize a loss and immediately repurchase it – you must allow for 30 days to provide a buffer for tax purposes, otherwise people would be selling and repurchasing their assets immediately to avoid paying taxes).~~

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

You should take a good look at the capital gains rules, contact your tax preparer/accountant (which I have and he has agreed with my understanding of the rules), and assess if your income levels allow you the opportunity to take advantage of the 0% capital gains tax rate. It really is a solid win all around if your income levels allow you to take advantage of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps some people avoid paying income taxes on their BTC/cypto holdings - ***LEGALLY!***",cryptocurrency

stocks,Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warns Congress that inflation may keep rising next year,"[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-covid-omicron-variant-covid-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-congress/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-covid-omicron-variant-covid-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-congress/)

""

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Congress that while the Federal Reserve continues to expect inflation will move down ""significantly"" over the next year, it ""now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year.""

The new COVID-19 variant Omicron could have a negative impact on employment and inflation, Powell told Congress Tuesday in his prepared remarks.

""The recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation. Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people's willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions,"" Powell said. He was appearing at a hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to testify about the economic recovery from the pandemic. 

The World Health Organization flagged Omicron as a COVID variant of concern on Friday: it appears to spread quickly, and it's not yet known how effective existing vaccines are against it. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, it'll be about two weeks before more is known about its transmissibility, severity and other characteristics.

The Biden administration acted quickly to try and slow the spread of the new variant in the U.S., imposing travel restrictions on eight countries in Southern Africa. Officials are also urging Americans to get vaccinated or booster shots. On Monday, President Biden sought to calm Americans, characterizing the variant as cause for concern, but not panic.

While Powell acknowledged that the economy is continuing to strengthen and conditions in the labor market are still improving, he also reminded senators that over the summer, the rapidly spreading Delta variant slowed the economic recovery and intensified supply chain disruptions.

At the same time, Americans have been slammed by higher than anticipated prices as the U.S. struggles to reopen. Last month's Consumer Price Index showed inflation had risen at its fastest annual rate in more than 30 years at 6.2%.

""Pandemic-related supply and demand imbalances have contributed to notable price increases in some areas. Supply chain problems have made it difficult for producers to meet strong demand, particularly for goods. Increases in energy prices and rents are also pushing inflation upward,"" Powell said during his remarks.

The remarks about inflation echo past statements by Powell that it could persist into the third quarter of 2022.

""We understand that high inflation imposes significant burdens, especially on those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation,"" Powell said. ""We are committed to our price-stability goal. We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.""

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also testified before senators on the state of the economic recovery from the pandemic Tuesday. Yellen has said if the U.S. wants to bring inflation down, it needs to make progress with the pandemic and when it succeeds, she anticipates prices will go return to normal some time in the second half of next year.

Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to make progress in bringing down unemployment. On Friday, the Labor Department will release the jobs report for November. Last month, the economy added a higher than anticipated 531,000 jobs and revised the two prior reports upwards, after disappointing September and August numbers. The unemployment rate last month fell to 4.6%.""",finance

personalfinance,Questions Regarding a Streamline Loan Refi. AND Who Owns My Mortgage Now?,"I could really use some help and advise here please. The last 2 years I have been pretty out of touch with things as I struggled with a newly diagnosed genetic neuropathies that result in horrendous nerve damage, and then a botched back surgery that resolved the back problem but took the use of my lower legs and generated new, far worse neurotic pain then I have ever had.

I am 67, if you read the above, you know I am disabled and in chronic pain, for which I take a LOT of high dosage pain meds, which, well, interfere with thought process, short-term memory and other problems.

My mortgage interest rate is 4.75%. I started the refi process again in September of 19. It was never completed because that is when my problems began to take a hard hit. I had completely forgotten out the refi app from '19 until the loan person at my credit union mentioned it. 

I also discovered at that time, my mortgage is no longer with the company the C.U. used in '19. They do not know who owns the mortgage and can not help me.

Apparently, the original mortgage company is now just servicing the loan.

I am totally unfamiliar with the streamline refi process. The current company the c.u. works with said given the numbers, my high credit score, he would do it in a second.

If the new company refuses to change my loan to a streamline refi, other than spending another $5,000 or so for a new refi loan, do I have any options or chance of talking the new company into providing a streamline loan?

Besides the cost of a new refi loan, I am unsure if I can stay in this 2 story house as I continue to decline. I have already fallen down the stairs once, which resulted in passing out for 4 hours, and then crawling up the stairs at 3 a.m. to get to the shower, (a lot of blood) and then finally to bed.

I am considering moving to N. Florida where I have family, but, it all depends on the ridiculous rising cost of housing. I may have to stay in Delaware in this house that is simply too dangerous for me.

Before someone suggest it, Thank you, but no. I am not going into any kind of assisted living environment either here in Delaware or in Florida.

Any assistance with navigating this process would be greatly appreciated,

Thank you

EDIT: Regarding Flair, I was unsure if this should be flaired Housing or Other. Please adjust as you see fit. Thank you",finance
CryptoCurrency,Fed's Powell: Good time to retire 'transitory' description for inflation,,cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Currency &amp; Money,"I have been researching historic global currencies and monetary systems in general, and have a theory that I would be curious to hear thoughts on.  


* In the beginning of commerce, people were limited to either barter or measure precious metals to estimate worth. This was extremely slow and limited economic expansion.  

* Money &amp; Currency need to coexist. Money is hard assets of stored value, currency is often pegged to money, but it needs to be less volatile. When governments got involved throughout history they have created a currency (typically backed by money) to standardize exchange.  

* Though the Federal Reserve is bullshit, they do 1 thing I appreciate which is to try to stabilize the currency to make the economic transactions less volatile.

&amp;#x200B;

In the event that all fiat currencies die and let's say only Bitcoin exists, that means that the whole world value would be measured against Bitcoin. As the world continues to innovate and produce more at say X rate, that means that the purchasing power of Bitcoin would continue to grow at X rate. Merchants would be constantly lowering the prices by X - this is problematic. Not that Bitcoin and the free market couldn't technically function, I just think it would slow economic expansion down.

So I had been thinking, how do we create a currency that is universal to the world that can be exchanged so that Bitcoin can be the money that it is pegged to? My thought went further to the concept of a heavily automated world where less and less human labor is needed.

My answer: **Wattage**. If Bitcoin was $10,000,000 a coin, the mining industry would explode as it would be so profitable to mine. As the mining industry grows to match such a high value, eventually the network would become so difficult that it would level off again around the price of electricity. Same thing would happen in reverse, a $1,000 coin would shut most of the mining rigs down until things stabilize once more.

Wattage is the same in every country, and is universally used. It has an unlimited supply allowing it to expand with the rate of economic expansion, and the mining industry as previously written essentially does the 1 good thing from the Federal Reserve automatically.

In conclusion, I think the human race needs to adopt Wattage as our exchange unit of currency; and Bitcoin would be the medium in which it is exchanged. If my theory here is remotely accurate, the day any country begins to sell Bitcoin for any form of energy (could be Oil) I think we will see the incredible parabolic rise of crypto. My estimate is that this can only take place once BTC surpasses Gold's Market Cap as it will need to have the liquidity to support massive exchanges.  


TLDR: ""Bitcoin is worth Bitcoin"" will have limitations to economic expansion. Bitcoin is the king of money, but we will need to have a universal value to always measure Bitcoin against. I believe that Wattage is the best currency to do so. I believe that we will exchange and pay for things in Bitcoin, but the prices should be in Watts.",cryptocurrency

I've been spinning around in circles trying to figure out what to do with my money that is sitting in my savings/checking accounts. I'm 21 years old, in my fourth year of college (5yr college, have another year left), currently on a co-op making $27/hr (after deductions, in tech) until March. Once co-op ends, I'll have to come up with money for school but that will probably end up being paid with loans unless someone has other advice.

One of my main goals is to purchase a ""cheaper"" house and I expect that to happen optimistically in about 5 years give or take a few years depending on if I can secure a job after graduation and other factors.

I feel like I can take risk especially since my goal doesn't have a deadline. I have also been looking into robo-advisors like Betterment. A pleasing UI is something that intrigues me unfortunately and would make me more likely to invest.

How? Well, they just play with language and try to make things look like normal and part of the economy nature. 

We had many people on the crypto community calling out inflation, and saying that the numbers where just a nicely painted picture for people, but we all know that things are looking way worst than they are trying to show to all of us. 

I don't get it, why people are selling out their position on crypto, if it is a refuge for inflation, this seems to me, once again a way to shake out people from their coins.

Credit Score: 620 with 0 open accounts. Last account was closed in October after I disputed with the agency about its age.
Income: approx. 3,000/month after taxes/withholding/IRA/insurance

I currently drive a 2007 Caliber that I bought outright for 1800 in 2018 and have pumped about 2-4k in repairs into it every year since. Right now the thermostat won't work (no heat) and there's a headlight out that replacing the bulb hasn't fixed. I'm done with it.

I'm hoping to sell the caliber for 1500ish (KBB value is about 2300 but given repairs) and will be using this as a down payment so as not to touch my savings account.

The plan is to go to a buy here/pay here dealership because I am not able to ""go to my bank"" for a loan. 

Vehicle price out the door $12,000 max (looking online it seems I'll be able to get something like a Corolla or Altima from 2013-15 around this price which I'm more than happy with)

$1500 down payment brings it to $10,500 to be financed.

I assume I basically have to take whatever interest rate they give me, I anticipate it being in the 10-15% range based on research?

48 month term, it looks like 60 is standard for most of the used car deals nowadays, can this be adjusted to my preference?

Am I being unreasonable? Can I negotiate any of the above things with a BHPH dealer? Am I just being stupid in general to finance this in my current situation?

I'll also be shopping right before Xmas as I have heard that end of year/end of month means that they are more willing to make a deal.

CryptoCurrency,Opinion: Tether possess a systemic risk to the crypto market,"Today the total stablecoin token market cap sits at about approximately $150 billion. At $73 billion Tether accounts for almost half the stablecoin market cap. Most exchanges have pairings with USDT which effectively means the majority of crypto investors have some exposure to USDT in their portfolio. 

Tether has not been audited since 2018.  Their claim of $1 in reserve to back every token is wildly misleading, as it's primarily backed by US commercial papers. This means it holds a lot of short-term unsecured debts from US companies with no guarantee of recovery except for goodwill. Banks are also unwilling to take Tether's cash as deposits due to reputational concerns. Which is no surprise for a company whose executives are facing potential criminal bank fraud charges. 

If you hold a small portion of your portfolio in stablecoins you might think whether Tether is solvent or not is not a big concern. However being in a high-risk asset category, the crypto markets shake out at even the slightest negative news. With increased regulatory scrutiny, I can't imagine the chaos it would cause in the market if USDT is found to be insolvent. The repercussions of the third-largest market cap token failing would definitely end the bull market but will likely affect markets outside the crypto space. 

For an average retail investor, we don't know how much of USDT is actually backed by collateral such as the US dollar or secured debt. With a booming DEFI ecosystem more investors are taking up the opportunity to earn yields on their stable coin. 

Personally, for me, I prefer USDC and BUSD. As USDC is backed by a publicly traded corporation seems to be a safe option. Binance is regularly audited and BUSD is backed by US dollar held in FDIC insured US banks. This is my individual preference so not a recommendation. However, if you are keeping a significant chunk of your portfolio in stablecoins, consider spreading out your position to be not too reliant on any single one. 

p.s Please don't make comments such as US $ is backed by faith in the Federal Reserve/US government. This discussion is not about a post-fiat paradigm where BTC is the standard.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"It’s shocking to me how you all ignore Bitcoins origins... a brief history lesson, and the coin that’s replacing it.","Bitcoins rise from a single digit USD value cryptocurrency, all the way up to, I would argue, $20,000. The majority of Bitcoins gains, where real wealth was made. From about 2011 to 2016; Bitcoins main use was as an anonymous payment mechanism. Mainly for the dark web markets, we have all heard of Silk Road. 

Well as it turns out, using a currency that utilises a completely transparent ledger which anyone can track, view account balances, track where coins are being spent - is not a good idea for people who don’t want THE POWERS THAT BE tracking them. 

In comes Monero. Completely open source, cpu mined to ensure decentralisation (you can mine XMR with a fucking PS2 slim), 21 million soft cap which changes to 0.3% tail emmision per year (perfect monetary policy according to prominent economists such as Milton Friedman, Hayek and the like). This allows a slow yet steady and expected rate of inflation in the currency, without runaway volatility causing later instability in markets. 

It’s why Monero’s future is certain too. Miners won’t only have to rely on TX fees, unlike Bitcoin, which makes the future of the BTC network uncertain, as it will one day pay a pittance relatively. 

Wait wait. I haven’t spoken about the main point. ITS WHAT THE DARKNET USES. it’s encryption protocols are tried and tested, anonymous by default, idiot proof. The IRS has a $1.25 million bounty for you if you can crack Monero’s privacy. It’s the only one companies like chainalysis have had to spew bullshit for, claiming to have developed tracing tools which turn out to be bullshit. There is zero competition for XMR as a privacy coin. 

/r/xmrtrader /r/Monero

As it is the only viable privacy coin, it is the only coin with true FUNGIBILITY - the ability to change each unit of a currency for another one without discrimination or differentiation. As every Bitcoin has its TX history connected to it, it cannot be fungible. If you bought coins from someone who withdrew from a known dark web address, or coins from a hack, u own dirty Bitcoin. Good luck selling that on Coinbase. 


MONERO Deserves to be a top 2 coin, it is superior to 99% of the nonsense that is spewed on here. Realise that your transactions can be tracked by anyone. Anyone can see ur account balance. Same for ETH, same for nano, same for XHV or HIV and all the stuff spoke of here!

New company offering Fidelity 401K - should I create another Roth 401K or go Traditional?

Hi r/personalfinance community. Long time lurker, first time poster.

I am a 24-year old man working in SaaS/tech. I graduated from university in 2020 during the pandemic with a BA, double major in Economics and International Relations. I was originally going to travel abroad to China through a fellowship program I got accepted to, but the program was canceled in March along with the rest of the world (thanks, COVID). So I had to scramble to find a job when most firms were undergoing a hiring freeze because of the initial economic tank.

Networked and hustled my way into a tiny &lt; 10 person fintech startup in NC and moved at the end of summer 2020 to begin working there as an analyst. I received a $2500 1-year claw-back starting bonus and a $55,000 salary with no set bonus or raise schedule, no stock options, and a high deductible health plan (HSA investment vehicle, yay!).

**Family background for context:**

I am a first generation college student and first generation American from a single-parent household. I entered college in 2015 with a household income for 4 of $18,000, which definitely helped out with financial aid and scholarships, in addition to my academic record, but the $55,000 salary was more money than my family had ever had access to. I don't currently have any direct financial obligations for my family. My mother recently graduated from nursing school and is a nurse earning around $55,000. She supports my disabled sister full time. I help out where I can, like paying their phone bill, giving monetary gifts when I get a bonus, and I have an M1 Finance auto-invest account that I contribute $30 monthly to as a sort of nest egg for them, should they ever need it. That being said, when my mother retires or passes away, someone will need to care for my sister.

**Financial + Professional Situation:**

The startup was a toxic and wretched work environment, working for anti-vaxxer republicans, all white-males who regularly said racist and misogynistic things. My boss would belittle me and gaslight me. It put me into a pretty bad depression and filled me with self doubt and imposter syndrome. This summer I put my butt in gear, realized I could change my circumstances and that a first job is just a first job, and started planning my next move. Fast forward to November and I used LinkedIn like a demon to have dozens of networking calls, recruiter calls, informational interviews, panel interviews, and mock presentations/situational interviews/assignments - secured 5 job offers (4 tech, one giant retail corporation).

I weighed my options, leveraged offers against one another, and ended up choosing the following revised tech company offer:

**Base Salary:** $110,000

**Sign on bonus:** $3000

**Bonus:** 15% ($16,500) paid quarterly

**Healthcare:** $1500 high deductible plan is what I will choose for $1264.68 out of pocket annually so that I have access to an HSA, which they contribute $750 to annually. I am very fit and healthy, but go to therapy which sometimes is not covered by insurance, so I use my HSA funds for that. This new job has better therapy coverage, though.

**401k match:** $500 annually (no, I didn't forget a zero. It's bad.)

**WFH Stipend:** $450 reimbursable on 1st or 2nd paycheck.

**Learning &amp; Development:** Roughly $2000 annually.

There are a few other perks I'm missing, but they're relatively irrelevant to this post.

**My current finances:**

**Fidelity Investment Brokerage Account:** $12,500

**Fidelity Roth IRA:** $2100 (all 2021 contributions)

**Fidelity HSA:** $500, some of which is invested.

**Roth 401k:** $3000, which will be matched to $6000 by my former employer in March, 2022, after which I would like to roll this over into my Roth IRA ---&gt; any advice or pushback on this is welcome.

**Crypto:** roughly $3000.

**Savings:** $1500

**0% interest credit card debt:** $4000 (starts interest in April, 2022)

**Federal Student Loan Debt:** $28,000, not actively paying this, $0 of interest thus far, $310 minimum payments to resume in March, 2022 with an average of 4.25% interest rate across all the loans, subsidized and unsubsidized.

My financial goals are to potentially retire early from private sector so that I can focus on nonprofit work, or start my own business (I have a few ideas, but one would be a boutique hotel/b&amp;b). My partner is also a high earner ($200K+) as she is an attorney, so our new combined household AGI is $300K+, excluding bonuses.

I opted for a Roth 401k initially because of my $55,000 income, and the idea that paying taxes on that lower salary now would be worth it for when I retire and don't need to pay taxes on it then.

Now that I've doubled my income and jumped tax brackets, I am considering opening a traditional 401K with my new employer. My thought process is that it would be most advantageous for me to reduce my overall taxable income now that I am a high earner, and then when I am over 65 I will have an LLC or trust and will be able to keep myself in the lowest income bracket and withdraw as needed for expenses, thus it would be better to pay taxes on smaller withdrawals then. I've read [various articles](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/roth-sucks/) in favor of each, but am unsure what I should do.

I intend on maxing out my Roth IRA contributions every year, and hopefully getting to $10,000 per year contributing to whichever 401K option I choose for this new job. Also hoping to save aggressively in cash in case there is a market downturn or crypto drop that I can pounce on.

Can anyone with more experience weigh in and offer me some advice?

Thanks in advance for your time, and I'm sorry for such a long post!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warns Congress that inflation may keep rising next year. How will this effect crypto markets?,"[Article: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warns Congress that inflation may keep rising next year](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-covid-omicron-variant-covid-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-congress/#app)

“Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Congress that while the Federal Reserve continues to expect inflation will move down ""significantly"" over the next year, it ""now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year.""

The new COVID-19 variant Omicron could have a negative impact on employment and inflation, Powell told Congress Tuesday in his prepared remarks.”

In a shock to no one, it seems inflation will continue to rise. 

But the real question is how this continually rising inflation effect the crypto market. There’s been articles like [this](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/some-hedge-funds-are-seeing-ether-as-an-inflation-hedge-a-crypto-brokerages-ceo-explains-why-11636658772) that state hedges funds and investors are moving to the crypto market as an inflation hedge. 

Given the rather grim outlook of inflation in the next year, do ya’ll believe we’ll see more people getting into the crypto market soon (within a year or two)?",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Bitcoin and electricity,"How many times have you read something like this, “Bitcoin uses as much electricity as Malaysia or Sweden or Denmark or Chile….”. What a bore. Have you ever wondered, however, why the comparison is to countries? Why don’t they ever tell you what would seem to be a more natural comparison which is how much “Bitcoin” spends on electricity?


The reason is that electricity is incredibly cheap so Bitcoin electricity expenditures priced in dollars don’t look very large. Bitcoin uses something like 100 terawatt hours (TWH) of electricity annually (depending on the price of Bitcoin) but a TWH costs less than $100 million (10 cents per KWH times 1000000000). Thus, Bitcoin spends say $10 billion on electricity annually. (In fact, it’s less than this since bitcoin miners can be located in places where electricity prices are especially cheap.)

$10 billion in spending isn’t a lot. It’s less than the world spends on toothpaste ($30b), much less than the US spends on cigarettes ($80b), and considerably less than the US Federal government spends in one day ($18.65 billion).

 
If we think of the $10 billion spent by Bitcoin as a security budget (as the spending secures the blockchain) it also compares reasonably to US bank spending on cybersecurity. Bank of America alone spent more than $1 billion on its cybersecurity budget and the total financial security budget is much larger.

So the next time you read that Bitcoin consumes as much electricity as Sweden substitute Bitcoin spends as much on electricity as Americans spend on Halloween costumes.

personalfinance,"Is refinancing my home 1 year in worth it? PMI, appraisal and other factors at play.","Hi PF, 

My Fiancee and I bought our first home last year right before the market started to get crazy.  We locked in at 3.125% APR on a fixed rate 30 year mortgage.  We wound up putting 5% down, so we were stuck paying PMI, but at least we were home owners. The PMI is around $100 per month. 

In a very unlikely scenario, our home has increased in value tremendously in the year we've lived here. It's now worth about 1.5x what we bought it for. I'm sure this valuation is inflated in the current market, but I've been thinking I could use it to my advantage and remove the PMI from my loan with an early refi.  

I was poking around on credit Karma, and wound up being able to lock in 2.5% on a 30 year fixed with $4643 in points and around $2k in third party fees. I'd be rolling the closing costs into the loan and it would put my principle at a hair higher than I started on the house last year, but without PMI and with 0.625% better of an interest rate. My monthly payment would drop by about $150 at the end of the day. 

We plan to stay in this house around 10 years. 

Is this a wise decision? Why or why not?",finance

personalfinance,Best Strategy For Buying New Car to Save/Make Money?,"I am planning to purchase a new BMW for 51k later this year. I have enough money in the bank to purchase w/out financing it. However, I am thinking it is smarter to put down x amount of money (say 30k) and finance the rest of it (say 21k) over x amount of years (say 5 years).

My mindset in doing this is although I am financing 21k w/ monthly payments, that equivalent 21k in my account can be invested in some index funds. Ideally, within 5 years, the money made would not only pay off the interest but net me a few thousand dollar gain. \*To clarify my credit score is around 750 and will likely qualify for a good interest rate.

Is this a working strategy? If so, does anyone recommend a better ratio of a down payment to financing amount &amp; time of financing to help maximize the amount of money saved (or made if you think of it that way)?",finance

stocks,"Banks, Interest Rates, and other Cashflow streams?","I don't understand why Powell's news today caused bank share prices to drop across the board. Wouldn't interest rates having a nearer horizon cause banks to expect nearer and greater returns?

I understand that some of these banks might be heavily positioned in low interest loans to corporations, but what happens when the interest rates go up? The terms on the loans don't change, do they?

Now this curiosity might be really general and hard to address, but what are banks alternative cash flow streams? If they can't change the interest rates that they've already given, they'll be screwed. In this case I don't imagine the banking industry to really see those returns anytime soon, and things will continue on as normal. They're probably already planning for this and have their cash allocated accordingly. If they can, then why would their shares drop on the recent news?

Anyway, if somebody would kindly just give me some information on how banks operate during this type of transition, before and after, that would be wonderful.

stocks,About the FED increasing rates...,"So this seems to be the topic for today and I'm rather uneducated about it I decided to do some basic research.

One of the things I found was this: https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart

I was looking for a co-relation between the stock market and rates, but basically even when rates were not 0 and increasing (2016-2019) the market rallied anyways... well, not exactly, trade wars with China in 2018 caused quite a dip but that recovered in like 6 months and then kept on rallying.

My question is: why is everyone going crazy about how if they increase rates now everything is gonna crash? Historically speaking rates have never been increased in a ridiculous manner, as in they increase in either a slow and steady manner or in a ""ladder"" graph manner (see 2004 and 2015 onwards). The dotcom bubble happened while rates were over 5%, same with the 2008 one.

Based on the last 20~ years we can expect rates to take at least 2 years to go back up to a ""decent"" point (2~3%). What this means is that unless a first-time-ever event happens the FED is probably gonna increase their rates next year starting in either spring or summer and at the end of 2022 they're probably still gonna be sub 1%... which means we're talking about a 2~4 year progress until rates stop climbing and stabilize.

This makes me wonder: why is everyone talking as if the FED starting to increase rates is the apocalypse for the market? What am I missing? Is everyone just absolutely ignorant or am I the one who's missing some other factors? 

I understand there's the whole debt to pay your debts, rollovers, whatever you want to call these things, as in highest interest rates = more expensive to finance growth, but I don't see how very slight increases are that much of a problem, it's still very cheap money and even though it might slow growth I don't see how it will stop it and make everything crash. Sure, the market will slow down a bit, growth stocks might stop skyrocketing 40~100% every year, but I don't see how they would stop growing.",finance
personalfinance,Tight budget due to taxes on savings,"I work/live in a VHCOL area, and so my budget already doesn't have much wiggle room. My salary is about $60k and after taxes, insurance, and a 5% (matched) 401(k) contribution, I'm taking home about $3k/mo. About $1900 then goes to mandatory bills and groceries, $500 to paying myself back for my IRA contribution in January, and then discretionary and incidental stuff, ranging from clothes to entertainment to buying lunch, takes up most of the rest of it.

My ""problem"" is that I'm making income from my investment account which has bumped up my tax liability a bit. This is stuff like dividends that get reinvested and capital gains realized by rebalancing, so it's not actually money I'm seeing in my hands or in my cash balances, but the state and feds still get their cut. Big picture it's not enormous sums of money, but with the way my portfolio has done this year, I've needed to set aside about $250/mo in additional taxes. Essentially I'm paying taxes like I earn $75k but only actually taking home $60k. 

I'm in the safe harbor for underpayment penalties this year so I actually don't have to write checks to the government until April, but I won't be next year, so starting in January I'll either have to make quarterly payments or (more likely) crank up my withholding at my job. I also expect this problem to go away in a couple of years when my salary goes way up, but I do have to deal with this for probably the next 2 years.

I know this ""problem"" arises from how I'm thinking about my budget more so than an actual shortage of money, and I'm wondering if anyone has thoughts or ideas for how to rearrange things or adjust my accounting so that I don't feel like I'm operating at a net loss just living my generally pretty modest lifestyle?",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Nov 30, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 30, 2021**

Unfortunately, after a brief bounce in the market yesterday, volatility resumed as market participants continue to contemplate the potential impact of the new coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant and new comments by newly re-elected Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Since the new variant was discovered last week, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) erased all its November gains and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed its worst month since April 2020, down more than 4%. 

**Some Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.87%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.44%
* Dow Jones (DIA) -1.77%
* SPY Bank ETF: -2.24%
* VIX: +15.51%
* AAPL: +3.24%

J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, ““We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”

Originally, Central Bank officials hoped inflation would begin moderating in the second-half of 2021, something that has not happened. Instead, prices rose 6.2% in October, the fastest annual rise in the Consumer Price Index since 1990. The Personal Consumption Expenditures, which serve as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation came in 5% higher. Powell said the “risk of higher inflation has increased,” but reiterated that his baseline expectation is for inflation to fall closer to the central bank’s 2% target over the course of 2022.

Adding salt to the wound, vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. 

He said, “There is no world, I think, where \[the effectiveness\] is the same level we had with \[the\] Delta \[variant\]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”

Both Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.

Vivek Paul, BlackRock Investment Institution Chief Investment Strategist said, “Information is coming rapidly, it's evolving in real-time. You can understand why investors \[last week\] were taking a little bit of a pause, particularly given the liquidity situation we had going into the U.S. holiday season. We think on balance, it would make sense to be invested in the markets at this moment in time. It's all about understanding whether or not this is a delay, or a derailment, of the restart that we've seen. And it seems most likely at this moment — notwithstanding more information to come— that it looks like a delay.” I agree, it’s important to acknowledge risks present in the markets but it is not time to panic yet, we simply do not have enough information yet.
