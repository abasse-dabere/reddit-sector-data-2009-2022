personalfinance,The Social Security on my next paycheck will be reduced by more than $800. Is it correct? My salary was increased on October paycheck. How much Social Security should one pay in 2019?,"Just checked my payroll,and the paycheck that will be disbursed on Dec. 2 has less Social Security tax (Fed OASDI/EE), $800 less than previous months. Is it correct? This paycheck pays my work done in November, and will be my last paycheck received in 2019.

My salary was increased on October paycheck. That was the paycheck I received in October 1, to pay my work done in September. How much Social Security tax should one pay in 2019? What is the percentage of pre-tax salary for Social Security tax in 2019? Thank you.

Update: Just saw this info:  FICA **OASDI** (Social Security) up to the **maximum** wage of $132,900 will be taxed at the rate of 6.2%. The **maximum** withholding on FICA **EE OASDI** for 2019 is $8,239.80 ([https://finance.columbia.edu/content/tax-withholding-information](https://finance.columbia.edu/content/tax-withholding-information)). That is why the employer took less SS tax in the last month. My finance knowledge is so limit. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Expecting a windfall—invest now or hold into recession?,"We’re moving and will “make”  (around $80k appreciation, the rest the return of our down payment and loan amortization) a couple hundred thousand on the sale of our house this coming summer. No tax due as we’ve lived here for longer than two years. We are lucky and grateful.

I intend to max out Roth IRAs and invest the remainder into the (Vanguard) index funds we currently hold but the last windfall I invested was in late 2007; a few months’ delay would have made a significant difference in purchasing power. So it leads to this:

personalfinance,Want to buy my moms home so she doesn’t lose it.,"Backstory, my mom inherited this home from my late grandmother. House has a mortgage and she owns more than 20% equity in the home(there is more I just don’t know the exact amount). I also own a home and about to refinance to remove PMI. My income has gone up significantly since my we first purchased my home. Is there any way I can either assume my mothers mortgage and rent her the house or can she sell it to me with an equity gift equal to what she owns to lower the financed amount? In short: but from mom with equity gift to lower loan amount, rent home to her at less than current mortgage and retain home from family over 100 years. Make sense? Possible?


EDIT: Thanks for all the replies. Here is a little bit of context. Grandmother was behind on mortgage and somehow she kept us from figuring it out. She passed, we find out. We catch things up. Current mortgage that my
Mom assumed when she inherited the home has an Interest rate that is too high and the current payments are entirely too high for her as a single income teacher. I’m simply trying to find a way to buy the house with an equity gift based on the appraised value in the current market to avoid a down payment based on what the loan to value could be(assuming this could workout in my favor) and pay nothing but closing. Let’s say house appraised at 150k, she owes 100k, gifts me the 50k difference and I take a new loan for the 100k remainder. New loan based on that 100k lowers payments, not the current payments based on a 150k loan. This is just an example for the sake of the post. Then I just rent her the home and keep it in the family, creating a place for her to live or an asset to sell in the off chance she ends up needing some sort of long term care when she gets older or needs assisted living. Im assuming this would be considered a second home, as I live in WA and she is NC. I hope this provides a little more clarity. I also realize this may not be this cut and dry or realistic.

personalfinance,Those who had an opinion on my last car question thread,"I was bored today and was looking at it again 

My real main concern is what am I doing next year. Going to school to be a teacher would be another 4-6 years. I would also need like an 85% average. So really comes down to what I want to do the work for an 85%. Like I’m smart enough but I’m currently not willing to do the work. 

Anyways back to the civic. So a 2020 4 year finance deal is 600$ a month with $192 insurance. Totalling $792 a month. 

The max hours I know for sure I can work at 24 a week. This could do up to 30 a week in feb (pretty sure I only have my class 4 times next semester). 

I get paid $20.48 an hour (before tax). That’s $491.5 a week with biweekly pay weeks (2 checks a month). I certainly can afford it. My only real holdback is what the hell am I doing come September. 

Assuming I go to school. It will actually be back to full time. Not this “full time” shit where I have 1 class and an internship

If I decide to enter the workforce I can certainly afford the civic. 


I will need to email my program advisor to see about getting my advanced diploma into a degree. I’ve been told it’s 2 years (in Canada) so I would need to see about this and what the course load is like. 

The other option for 2020 is leasing for 4 years.  With 20,000km per year. Since I live at home and don’t drive much the leasing deal isn’t terrible. The lease would be $350 for the car and $192 for insurance (monthly). While leasing is cheaper. If I want to own it after which would be my goal. I would need $11,265. That’d be saving about $400 a month 

Finance interest rate 2.99%

Lease interest is 3.99%

 Toyota Carolla. According to the website is $493 a month at a 0.49% rate

A 2020 Elantra is $520 at a 0% rate 

Now I was a fan of the civic far more than the Elantra. In terms of driving, I felt no different but in terms of me liking the interior of the vehicle, there was a big difference. I have yet to test a 2020 Corolla 

All of the costs are 48-month loans/lease shown in the monthly cost. I have not quoted the Carolla and Hyundai on insurance",finance

personalfinance,Which loan to put extra money toward,"Hi all,

I am a recent college grad with a steady full time job. I have found myself in the position to start paying extra on my loans. Currently I have 3 loans, first is a government student loan (interest rate around 4.5% with a 10 year plan to pay off $20,000ish), second is a private student loan ( interest rate at 4.58% with a 10 year plan to pay off $40,000ish), third is a car loan (interest rate at 1.9% with a 6 year plan to pay off 20,000ish). I have been reading it is best to pay off loans with the highest interest rate first. Given that my student loans are about the  same interest rate I am wondering if it would be more beneficial to start paying extra on one rather than the other. Or is there there a reason why I should consider the car loan even though the interest rate is much lower?

Thanks for your time and advice!",finance

So both my subsidized and unsubsidized loans from the government are payment deferred until I graduate.

I'm just really careful about my finances right now and I don't want to set myself back.

personalfinance,Should I buy US Treasury Bills or just keep my money in my Savings account?,"I'm just starting to get my feet wet with investing my money. I purchased a CD through my bank a few months ago and have a high interest savings account (an online bank).

My question is, if my APR for my savings account is currently 1.7% and the most recent rates for [Bills](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/annceresult.htm) are 1.52-1.62%, should I even bother purchasing them?

personalfinance,Paying off two credit cards,"As much as I’ve read about it I’m still slightly confused by interest charges. I have two credit cards. 

First one: $6159 balance, interest rate 18%, cash advance interest rate 18%, most recent interest charge was $64.39 for purchases and $38.10 for cash advance. 

Second one: $7406 balance, 12.74% interest rate, 14.74% cash advance interest rate, most recent interest charge was $77.35 for purchases and $1.67 for cash advance. 

My plan was to continue paying off the first one until it reached a balance of $0, and then pay the second one until at least the balance was down to $4650, which is 30% of my credit being used. Making minimum payments for the second one along the way as needed. Does this plan make sense? Or will I pay more interest by leaving the balance on the second one higher for so long? 

Would it make sense to look into getting a lower interest loan to pay the cards off immediately? I’d looked into this before but I was unemployed so I got denied, I now have steady income, my credit score is 694.

I’m making great progress already! I’ve paid off $1000 in the last month, my goal is to be down to around 30% after 12 months or so.",finance

personalfinance,Paying student loan debt with more student loans,"First time posting on here but I've watched from afar!

I'm in grad school, have an assistant position so my tuition is paid for at the moment. I receive a monthly stipend which basically covers my living expenses, but I'm trying to build in some savings. Anywho ... I have the option to accept loans at 6.08% for the coming semester in an amount just over $10,000. I don't need the loans because, again, my living expenses and tuition are covered. I am currently saddled with just over $55,000 in student loan debt and some of those loans have interest rates of 6.6% and 6.5% respectively. 

Would I be wise to accept the full loan for the coming semester and pay off that amount's worth of debt at the higher interest rates? Alternatively, would it make sense to take the loan and hang onto that money until I finish the program (2021) as a source of emergency funds? I currently have roughly $3,000 in savings.

energy,"Development with 130,000 entry level homes (&lt;175,000$) powered by wind turbine farm.","Hi

A project ran across my desk.



An older gentleman with a ton of cash and access to cheap capital wants to build a wind turbine farm in Western NC.  Not on Federal land of course. 

https://rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/maps/chap3/3-30m.html

Then run his own transmission and power line from the wind farm to the housing development (no more than 350 miles) with no interference from established electrical utilities. He is aware he has to maintain lines, get easements, and avoid substations (regulations).
 
Wants the community to be in the west Cary area of the Research Triangle.

As far as the homes go, he wants build a high tech factory that can output homes in a fully automated manner, extremely cheaply, costing 90,000 to 100,000 but selling at &lt;175,000$ while maintaining quality control. He will require batteries be put in each home that can help balance the load from the wind, allow residents to sell power to one another, and maintain power for at least 5 days for major appliances in the event of a natural disaster. 

His goal is free electricity for the residents, bc batteries can feed back to the grid what they have stored during peak hours. Money will be made selling power to energy intensive businesses with in the community at a cheaper rate than a standard utility could. Example businesses include data centers, office parks, breweries,  and and any other commercial business that use a lot of juice. 


He wants to utilize machine learning of some sort to make decisions in the battery systems.  When to sell, store, utilize battery or grid, etc. Include automated systems/vehicles for elderly or those that simply dislike driving, cameras everywhere for parents and residents to monitor their children in schools, at parks, etc.


I'm not sure how it will come out financially. But I have come to adore this man's vision. 

He will make money in doses from land development and selling each home. Continuous revenue will come from the wind farm.

Can anyone provide tips on getting land easements? For such a project. Other tips, criticisms, comments are appreciated",energy
personalfinance,Including Bonds in portfolio: absolute must?,"I have a small $4500 Vanguard Roth IRA. Was originally in a 2065 retirement fund, but I recently put it all in the VSMAX small cap fund. I have a very high risk tolerance and really I want this money to be “set it and forget it” until after I get out of school.

My question is: are bonds really all that necessary? I know they recommend 15 to 20 percent bonds in your portfolio, but what exactly am I missing out on if I stick to stock funds only? To be clear, I’m not touching this money for about 40 years. My thought is, if the market tanked and I lost half of it, I’d just wait it out until the market rebounds. Plus, half of it is not much money.

The other thing is, I think this fund had a $4k starting balance requirement. I’d like to diversify more to other stock funds to lower my risk, but I don’t quite have enough to do that yet with the minimum opening balances.

For context, I’m currently a med student. Trying to put what I can into this fund, but priorities are the wife’s 401k and making small payments on my loans to keep the interest low. I always struggle with whether I’m better off putting the $50 a month into loan payment, short term savings, or investing to get more time for interest to compound. My loans are very manageable, and after residency I’ll be able to pay them off in 1 year.

I suppose I could see bonds being more attractive in theory when interest rates are very low. But the returns on bonds just don’t seem to be all that great these days.",finance

personalfinance,Budget for paying off debt,"Hi there. Just to preface this post, this is a response to my earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/e4kyxr/20_years_old_with_6k_in_debt_needing_advice/) where I was advised to make a budget to help pay off my 6k in debt. Thanks to everyone who shared their two cents with me! I've been working on a budget and I feel I have made one that allows me to put a considerable amount of my income back to paying my debts. (I owe 3000 on one Apple CC that is maxed out, 600 on a Chase CC and 2200 on a loan for previous debt).

I am putting this budget out into the open in hopes of getting some feedback on where somethings could be changed. FYI, I know the phone bill is pretty high but I am weighing out some options at the moment to see about it going lower. Any other advice is appreciated, thanks!

Income: $1200

Auto &amp; Health insurance: $130 ($65 per paycheck that I pay in cash to my parents)

Gas: $70 (This is $35 a paycheck, enough to get me a gallon that usually last for two weeks)

Loan: $200 (The minimum payment is $130 and the loan has a 30.25% interest rate that is already factored into my payments. So this is where I'm trying to send the most of my income to get this paid off ASAP. This loan is from previous CC debt.)

Mobile Phone: $220. (If you read the previous post then you will know this is so high due to an iPhone XS Max and an iPad Pro installment plans, and like I said above I'm working on trying to lower it)

Music: $11 (I cut out all of my subscriptions with the exception of Spotify since I use it so frequently. I am not a student so I cannot get the discount)

Eating out: $60 (This comes down to $30 a paycheck and $15 a week. Enough for a Taco Bell trip or two if I've had a long day at work and don't feel like cooking/have anything prepared.)

Groceries: $150 ($75 a paycheck, so two weeks. I haven't bought groceries that much in the past, so I'm not sure if this is over kill or under kill. Advice on this one is really appreciated)

Gym: $10 (Planet Fitness and I try to go twice a week)

Pharmacy: $14 (For my anti depressant and anxiety RX)

Hospital Bill: $20 (This was from an MRI that I've gradually been paying on- not too worried about this part of the budget)

Former Employer Repayment: $50 (Long story short is that a previous employer overpaid me and when they caught this mistake I had already left the company so I'm having to pay them back at the $50 a month we agreed on. I owed them a total of $210 and have already made a $50 payment)

Credit Card Payments $200. (This is split 50/50. $100 goes to my Apple CC and the other $100 to my Chase CC. Should I shift the balance so that my Apple CC is getting more since I owe more and it is maxed out?)

And that leaves me with about $65 left a month for misc things like toiletries and clothes.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks again!",finance

personalfinance,What's the penalty for removing money from a Roth IRA?,"State of Georgia and planning to remain living here for life. I know, I know. Some people are going to start the, ""What are you doing? Don't do that! Leave it in!""  Hear me out.

Short version: I haven't saved anything for retirement officially in the way that most people know and think of it. Just turned 37 years old. I've worked lower-paying jobs since my late teens. High school was a disaster, I wasn't very academic and I graduated by the skin of my teeth. Didn't go to college (and didn't want to) after high school. I went right into working. I'm the son of a widow. My father shot himself when I was 9 years old and left my mother with an old house that needs a ton of repairs. It was built in 1950. I did my best to help her, but it's a no-go. I make about 33K to 36K a year now. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea - my problem over the years. I have some scary symptoms, feeling odd in my chest, etc. I've had bloodwork and such done before and nothing was found. My in-lab sleep study had an EKG done all night. Nobody said anything was wrong with my heart so far. Starting to suspect possible Narcolepsy on top of sleep apnea or maybe some kind of stealth issue with my thyroid. So I can't drive a vehicle out of concern for my own safety. I'm not alert enough on the road and things don't ""occur"" to me like they should. So moving into management someday is probably not going to happen. I'm a $14/hr order picker in a warehouse right now.

My mother is 62 years old now. Drawing her late husband's social security (a little under $1,200 a month) until she's 67 and then will draw her own. A couple of years ago, I convinced her to open a Roth IRA. She had about $20K in a 401K through her employer and that's all that she had saved except for about 10 grand in stocks with her employer.

A while ago, I thoroughly researched a certain company that I just knew in my heart after months of research would have crazy future growth. Marijuana was getting big and the CBD craze was starting up. I gave her money to throw at her Roth IRA and I contributed towards my own. I did not ask her to move any of her own savings (I knew that would have been stupid). When the price hit the floor, I bought even more when others were disappointed.  I gave her money and helped her buy more. So here we are now.

From roughly $18K each that each of us put into our Roth IRAs:  roughly $500,000 in each Roth IRA, going up and down with the tide of the market. I want her to move hers over into a stable account ASAP with potential for yearly growth, but I don't want her to lose it. I'm thinking a target retirement fund with a lot of bonds or something? At the same time, Iwish like 100K of that could go into something like a total stock market index spread over 3,000 companies with lots of room for growth until she retires. I think it would be stupid to move all $500K into that, even with it being that diversified. Do you agree?

As for myself, here's my thoughts and I need some **positive and yet constructive** criticism:

This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I have pondered moving $250K into a target retirement fund to grow where that part of it is reasonably safe. I have $7K in credit card debt. I need to figure out what's wrong with my health still. I'm on CPAP treatments, but something is wrong in my body and my sleep is not restorative even though my treatments are working. I need money for near-future doc bills (probably won't be that much). I want to put a down payment on a house for my mother. I don't want her pulling any of her money out. I've got 30 years before I retire.

I have considered withdrawing about $80K or so from my Roth IRA, finding out what the tax penalties ahead of time for Federal/State would be and paying them ahead of time to the point where my tax filing for that year would be reasonably normal as if I didn't withdraw the money. I under that there is a 10% penalty or something like that for early withdrawal. I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't another 10% something else plus income tax rates increasing from the withdrawal itself making my yearly income go up for that year. The rest of the $20K or whatever money is left over money, I put into a savings account or whatever, for emergencies.

I want to put down maybe $20K to $30K on a NEWER house for my mother and get her out of her POS house. I understand that per IRS rules, I can give her as a parent up to $10K without penalty to buy a house. Not sure what all of the stipulations are for that yet. The following year, I may do a smaller withdrawal to purchase my own house. I eventually want to get married and start a family with my now-girlfriend. She's a teacher and makes about $15 an hour. She is contributing to her teacher retirement plan. She's only in her upper 20's, so I have time for kids and such. I have no concern about her trying to grab for money. She's a simple country soul who knows how to live frugally and loves life. The remainder of my own Roth IRA, which at that point would be about $300K+...should I go all-in for something like total stock market index or put half in a target date retirement fund and the other half into the total stock market fund to get some good growth for a while before scaling back and moving some over into the target fund again? I would keep doing that until I retired, basically.

Thoughts on this plan? Keep in mind that I am extremely frugal. I can live on 30K like most people live on 80K. When I get healthier and drive again, used car only. I buy a new cell phone like every 5 years. I save money everywhere that I can.  Don't need the latest and greatest. I want a house in the country away from the madness and crazy neighbors. I haven't had the best life and my mother's life was pretty poor growing up. I want her to have a nice place to retire in and I want a nice place to raise my future kid or two in with the lady that I love; and I'm convinced that we could easily work together to make that happen. The wedding, if we eventually get married? She wants low-key. Nothing fancy or crazy expensive. She's very frugal, as well. My mother is likewise quite frugal and used to living with less.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on Changing Vehicles With an Outstanding Loan,"This is a somewhat odd situation because my circumstances are not dire at all, but I have no clue how to proceed. I purchased a car about 14 months ago. I can comfortably afford the payments (about $500/mo), have a decent interest rate (&lt;&lt;4%), and have been paying extra each month. However, I have realized that the vehicle (late model luxury sedan) does not suit my lifestyle at all. I want to “downgrade” to a slightly older commuter car (an Accord or Camry). While I can afford the payments, I don’t have enough cash to pay off the loan in full and don’t foresee myself saving up that kind of cash anytime soon. I also doubt that the trade-in value of the vehicle is anywhere close to the balance at this point either. I was just wondering what my options were in the short-term and long-term. I’m definitely willing to be patient but want to transition out of this vehicle sometime in the next year. Thank you in advance for any input!",finance

Have an $8k windfall. 
Options:

1. Pay off car and put the newly freed up $500 to make a new monthly payment towards CC of ~$750/month. 
2. Pay down CC by $8k, making same $250 payments on new balance. 
3. Buy a hot tub.

I can get a personal loan with low interest rate on my bank. Let's say U$ 50k. I have to pay fees monthly and I can do that easily with my monthly wage (and not from the short term profits in the stock markets).

personalfinance,FSA Question (Specifically FSAFEDS),"Consider the following [FAQ](https://www.fsafeds.com/support/faq/all/421) on FSAFEDS.com's website. (FYI FSAFEDS is the group/website that handles FSA accounts for government employees):

&gt; **What happens if I separate or retire before the end of the plan year?**
&gt; The balances in your Health Care FSA (HCFSA), Limited Expense Health Care FSA (LEX HCFSA) and Dependent Care FSA (DCFSA) are treated differently if you separate or retire before the end of the calendar year.

&gt; Your HCFSA or LEX HCFSA will terminate as of the date of your separation or retirement. There are no extensions. Any eligible health care expenses incurred prior to the date of separation will still be reimbursed but those incurred after the separation date are not reimbursable, even if you accelerated your allotments. **If you used your entire elected amount before FSAFEDS has deducted it from your pay, you will not be responsible for the remaining allotments.**

Am I misinterpreting this as basically free money?

Consider the following example:

I elect for $2750. $2750 / 26 is taken from each of my biweekly paychecks. I use $2700 on the first day of the year. We pay that out of pocket. The FSA then immediately pays me $2700 back into our banking account. I then take a job elsewhere two paychecks later, resulting in only having paid 2* $2750/26 worth of the $2700 I technically should pay back if I were to not take a job elsewhere.",finance

Bitcoin,Financial Uncertainties and The Eurasia Debt May Welcome A Bulls for Bitcoin,"The financial industry is currently seeking to integrate the new financial technology with the traditional financial tech. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that serve as a digital asset globally. Speculators believe that a bull market trend for BTC will necessitate a universally neutral reserve asset.  


Rona Foroohar, an associate editor and columnist at Financial Times, recently published an opinion article on the “gold bugs,” which attracted comments from central bankers and investors. Foroohar wrote that for investors to hoard physical bars in the new digital financial world, they have to strongly believe that that the sky is falling.  


The columnist attributes the “gold bug” to the urgencies welcomed by mild geopolitical fears, and the post-2008 horizon, which she believes was systematically fragile.  


The Dutch Central Bank issues a warning in October that if the system fails or witnesses a monetary reset, gold would be the go-to solution to rebuild the system. There is a sense of security in gold due to the stability of the DCB’s balance, which gold bolsters have high confidence in.  


According to Ray Dalio, speaking at a conference at the Institute for International Finance, there is a likelihood that gold would save the situation if America’s creditors betrayed the signs of edginess.  


Jamie Dimon, the Chief at JPMorgan, and Stanley Druckenmiller, fund manager, had warned back in 2016 that there was an unsustainable financial situation due to unfunded healthcare and pension entitlements in the U.S.  


The U.S Dollar is at the risk of depreciating due to fiscal imbalances, which have led to inflated balance sheets and low-interest rates. Such a situation would scare off investors from holding the USD nor federal debts.  


She points out that there is a need to develop an asset that is no one’s liability. These words from Foroohar meant gold or any other independent asset.  


Recently, China edged away from petrodollar when it Issued its pioneer Eurobond in fifteen years. Eurasia is gradually de-dollarizing, and this is so critical that it would force the U.S to sell USD in an effort to settle the balance of payments in the country.  


However, the co-founder of Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, Cameron Winklevoss, has an opinion contrary to Dalio’s. Winklevoss believes that Bitcoin holds a solution that is not confined to being a “digital gold” or a safe-haven digital asset. Winklevoss had also forecast that Bitcoin will break gold’s market cap of $7 trillion.

I have been looking into debt consolidation options and haven't had much luck - doesn't help that my credit score isn't great (mid 600s). My husband is also dealing with some CC debt, but is in a better position to pay his off and also has phenomenal credit. Could he apply for a CC consolidation loan on both of our behalves given his better credit? I sent a few pre-qual forms with him added as a cosigner and all were declined. Would transferring the balance to one credit card be a better option? Any advice would be so appreciated.

Update: to answer/address some of the comments below - the CC debt we have both accumulated is from our wedding/honeymoon. Prior to this year, we had none. Putting the majority of the wedding on CCs may not have been the right choice, but I can't change it now and would appreciate nonjudgemental solutions :) Suffice to say, we won't be planning another wedding any time soon and will learn from the mistake moving forward.",finance

personalfinance,Ally checking account vs Discover checking account,"So I currently have a checking account with Chase that I am not too happy about and I have a savings account with Discover. Ally used to edge out Discover in regards to online savings account APR, but now both are at the same rate (1.70% APR) so it seems to be a tie in terms of savings.

I eventually want to switch my checking account to either Ally or Discover, but which is better? For Ally, if you have less than $15k in your checking account then you have an interest rate of 0.10% (which is barely anything). On the other hand, Discover does not offer interest with their checking account, but they do 1% cashback on purchases made with your Discover debit card, up to $3000 per month. Like Ally, Discover doesn't really have any fees and generally, they have better overdraft protection fees.

With all things considered which would be the ideal combo? If I end up getting a checking account with Ally, I also open a savings account with them (and close my Discover savings), but if I stay with Discover, I will keep my savings account, but also open a checking account.",finance
personalfinance,Roth distribution (basis) vs. Traditional IRA distribution,"Hi,

I could use some help with a decision.

Wife and I are 33 - 4 children.  Income is around $60,000 (wife stays at home).

Own both vehicles (no loans, worth about 4K and 10K)

No debts other than mortgage payment - our budget situation is currently a little more than breakeven (around +$700/month after factoring bonuses and large tax return due to child tax credit refund).

$31,000 in Roth IRA's  ($19,000 basis)

$125,000 between Traditional IRA and 401k

$15,000 spread in some 529 accounts

$12,000 in the bank (about 3, maybe 4 months expenses)

We sold and bought a house this year, put 15% down, repairs/renovations, etc.

About $60,000 in home equity (owe $170K, worth about $230K)

As a result, we are a little light now in the emergency fund (if you don't count the $19K roth basis).

We also knew with the home purchase that a roof is needed, which will be around $8,000.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering taking a disbursement of around $8-10,000 to replenish the emergency fund and have on hand to pay in full for the roof when needed, and we still have a little work to do in the kitchen.

&amp;#x200B;

With a family income of around $60,000 and 4 kids, I usually end up getting a refund of around $5,000, but that will be lessened this year due to a few thousand remaining on our first time home-buyer credit that requires repayment.  I already have 0 federal wihheld from my paycheck, so the large refund is just the way it is with the current child credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it make more sense to pull from the roth basis or take a hit on the traditional IRA since I'm in such a low tax bracket at this point.  I may wait until the need actually arrives, but was just considering getting this done in 2019 tax year so it is fresh when I'm doing taxes in a few months.

personalfinance,"GF has 90k in student loans from art degree, lives below poverty line","My girlfriend (33F) and I (31M) have been together on and off for five years. Over that time, we've resolved many of our personal issues. This year, however, we happened to dig into the topic of debts. I learned she has 90K in federal student loans. Having graduated ten years ago with an Art degree, she's worked part-time jobs as a babysitter, care home worker, and yoga instructor to make ends meet.

Her annual income has never gone above the poverty line, and as a result, she has spent the last decade on an income based repayment plan with monthly payments at $0. With 10 or 15 years left before the loan is forgiven, she has a massive tax bomb waiting for her without any means to save for it. While she lives extremely frugally and has maintained her independence despite her situation (owning a $1000 car and paying only $400 in rent), raising her income significantly would bring her above the poverty line and cut her off from Medicaid, putting her at great risk.

Lacking the capacity to go back to school without going further into debt and already spending 7 days a week working just to stay above water, the only feasible plan I see is for us to move in together and have me pay for everything while she saves her income over the next decade in preparation for the tax bomb. I have no debts and while I currently live at home making $31k as an administrative assistant, I just finished a degree in computer science and will soon be entering that field at, hopefully, a much higher income.

The thing is, I don't know what this kind of situation means for us if we get married. When I told her about my plan, she balked at the idea of dedicating all of her income towards paying off her debt. I can respect not wanting to feel like an indentured servant in a marriage, so I didn't push it. I just don't see how we get to the end of this scenario without the bulk of the financial burden falling on me to keep us afloat. Thoughts?",finance

stocks,Concern on a proposed US wealth tax.,"I’m generally all for proposals to make billionaires pay a great deal higher taxes. I’m socially far left and fiscally more centre left. Wealth inequality in the United States is absolutely appalling. I don’t want anyone to live in a country where people gain hundreds of millions in cash every year whilst median income households and generally common folk have to face the highest dues in student debt in the world and with a lot of these folk not being able to pay for or have the general right to basic health care either. 

I do think that taxing higher income folk via raising the top federal capital gains/dividends (how the vast majority of billionaires and entrepreneurs get cash) tax rates to much, much higher than it is today is great first step into moving towards a sustainable direction into funding fundamental health care and aiding a great deal to students. And I’m very open to many other solutions to make these extremely extravagant folk pay their fair share and to fund many other proposed beneficial programs for the lower and middle class.

But something does concern me about the wealth taxes proposed by senators like Bernie and Elizabeth who both I admire. The wealth tax taxes an entrepreneur or a billionaire based on the individual’s net worth. It sounds absolutely brilliant on paper until I thought about it a little more vividly. So the tech industry is the king industry in America right? And an overwhelming majority of tech companies generally don’t distribute dividends (in other words profit) to their shareholders. So the pioneers and founders of these companies result into very slowly and incrementally selling some of their shares in their companies or sell some worth a small percentage once in a while, so that they don’t or never lose ownership in the companies they founded. 

But from my understanding of the wealth tax, this would mean tech entrepreneurs or successful entrepreneurs in general who have companies who don’t distribute dividends, or whose dividends collectively don’t add up to enough to pay those annually due taxes, will have no choice but to eventually at one point sell the entirety of the ownership they have in the successful company they founded. And that does concern me because I think a lot of people like me dream to start a very successful business in the future, and I’d hate having to know that if I ever did all the right things to make my company grow or put my heart and soul into it so it could really thrive. That it ever got really big I’d inevitably lose my ownership in it in about anywhere from 5, to 10, to 15 years. And not to mention the effects of over saturation and massive inflation of many of America’s staple companies on the public markets or the general massive exit of capital investment in the country, and all the economically catastrophic effects it would entail.

Okay, I really hate to sound like I’m pandering to the snobby Bezos’s and Zucks of the world. I really do despise a lot of really rich folk because of a lot of the things they generally can get away with. But it’s not those individuals my concern is with. My concern lies with people whose ambitions will ultimately be capped by something like this. Or the ceiling it would ultimately put over anyone whose continually ambitious dreams have anything to do with business, entrepreneurship or capitalism in general.

1. How would I go about making this right? Where do I start?
2. Would it be better for my credit to pay off the balance (if possible) at once, or make payments on it?

personalfinance,"Big debt, small plans?","*WALL OF TEXT*

Hello,

I've found myself in a debt situation where the ""solutions"" (consolidation/balance transfer) seem to imply more risks than reward. I've checked the wiki and not totally found the questions answered. I'm curious about people's thoughts as we try to manage past bad decisions. Backstory is that my wife brought about 35k in high interest credit card debt into our relationship (this isn't a huge sore spot, I was made aware and she knows it was a mistake. We're working together to solve the problem.) I was too lackadaisical about this for the first several years, even allowing another 4k or so in credit to be opened in my name to address emergencies (2.5k in vet bills, another 1.75k in groceries and other daily expenses) when we were inevitably short month to month, so I'm not entirely innocent. But, I had $500 on a 17% interest card when we were married. Because we wanted to get moved into a family home and start our family and we make decent money (combined 120k or so in a low cost Midwestern metro) we never really took it seriously. Shortcut to now, 6 years later and with no significant progress made, the debt expanded a couple thousand, and 2 kids we want to give a good life, I've asked for (and mostly been granted) authority over the finances. Previously we'd led financially separated lives and ""split the bills"" with separate bank accounts. But both spent like fools, one of us largely on credit.

My solution was multi-stepped but part one was uniting our finances and budgeting. With the ideology that all money goes into a joint account and we have personal spending budgets that come out of that account, making the family unit the financial center instead of a neglected afterthought. But also allowing some limited independence. I set a strict but not punishing budget that allows for some luxuries (one monthly night out for us or the kids, her audible, my Xbox game pass/live, our shared Disney+, netflix, and some money to buy the kids stuff or ourselves about $20 for self indulgence) Embarrassingly, it took us 6 years to do even this. We're most of the way thru this process. First paychecks rerouted to a joint account will be the ones after the current cycle, we've each compiled our needs/wants/eliminate lists, and I've stopped all non matched automatic withdrawals. 

Step Two, the emergency account, ran concurrently. I've worked up about 1k by reducing my spending while we were negotiating/planning our budget and path and putting it into (fairly risky) investments, over the past month and a half. My wife has continued to pay as much as she can on debts, but I don't think she's really cut down spending. The continued spending is addressed by part one, but she won't really observe a budget until it's imposed upon her. This is a personality quirk born out of poor coping with mental health issues that I've accepted but resolved to help limit.

Step three, our payment plan, is primarily the Avalanche Method with one modification. One of the credit cards, though lower interest rate, has a minimum payment that is too unwieldy due to it's high balance and will be payed down substantially first. But I am still looking at options on how to make this most effective. I'm currently looking at Consolidating as much debt under lower interest rates as possible.  I can take a 5.7% interest loan of up to 16.5k against my retirement (a non-matched deferred-comp plan that's on top of a decent pension which I've paid fairly well into for 15 years) this frees up about $80 per month in payments when applied to our high balance card. I'm pretty much committed to using this vehicle. The rest of the debt we plan to do a typical avalanche approach to. 

However; I'm also looking at two other options. One is a home refinance, due to lack of equity (we've only owned it 2 years) we're limited to reducing our interest rate by about 3/4 of a percent, but that's more we can put on bills. But that allows us another $75 a month to tackle debt with. The other is a balance transfer. I have ""good"" credit at 667, my primary ding is limited credit history (3.5 years, my older card was canceled due to not using it, I guess?) and high credit utilization. My payment history is ""99%"" with 3 &lt;30 day late payments from 2012-2015 on my record. The only active credit I have is the two previously mentioned, and the utilization is at 85%. Because of these factors I'm somewhat considering opening a balance transfer card for the debt in my name and paying it down first so as not to trigger the higher interest delayed rate. They're not our highest debt or payments, but eliminating interest on them might be in our interest and it would expand my credit pool and improve utilization in case extremely low interest cash out home refinance becomes an option in the next year or two. It *may* become possible due to a large scale gentrification effort (I've been here my whole life, so let's avoid the politics of that.) by a local land magnate, but I'm not counting on externalities. We expect to pay the debt off in about 4 years without factoring in the full effect of budgeting, which we're still working on.

I'll enclose a summary of the debt in the first comment since this is running on so long. I have a big ol spreadsheet of amortizations, budgets and other related parts of the plan if anyone is *REALLY* interested.


Anyway TL;DR is a transfer card worth the risk if it stands to improve my overall credit and *maybe* allow a more agile/effective approach to our debt in a few years time?",finance

personalfinance,Question About Car Lease Payoff,"I have a car lease (first time I've leased and will be the last time) that is ending in February.  The vehicle is good and I'd like to keep it.

I have $19K in cash that I can use to pay it down. I'm hoping to get the other $4K by February, but with Christmas and school expenses for my kids it is not very likely.  What are my options for a loan?  The dealer is telling me that I would need to do a lease buyout loan, but the interest rates are astronomical.  Is that specific type of a loan my only option?

personalfinance,Self-Directed Roth IRA or SIMPLE IRA?,"Hello Reddit,

I am currently 23 years old, a full-time student with a full-time job; but i still live at home and only have one monthly expense (car payment). I've recently been looking into how I should begin investing my money for retirement (I want to take advantage of my current living situation as much as possible) and have come across two options: I can start to invest more money into my SIMPLE IRA through work (3% match on any contributions; portfolio is currently set up to 80/20 stocks/bonds) or I can open a self directed Roth IRA and manage a portfolio of assets myself (or use a robo-advisor such as M1 Finance). I prefer the second option for 3 reasons: 1) there are certain single company stocks I want to invest in and I would also like to have some stake in the marijuana sector, 2) I have read that management fees for the funds similar to the one set up through my SIMPLE IRA are a lot higher, and 3) I have also read that a lot of funds of this type attempt to beat the market; I prefer to have a portfolio that mirrors that market aside from a small percentage of stocks that I have researched and feel good about. However, considering the 3% match, should I just continue to put my money into the SIMPLE IRA?

Any advice on what I should do/retirement investing in general would be helpful!! I have only been researching this for a couple of weeks now, and plan to do much more before I put money into a Roth IRA (if i choose to go that route). Thank you in advance Reddit!

edit: My car payment is currently $270/ month. $13k remaining balance, interest rate is 7.5%. Would it be wiser to begin making larger payments for this than in a retirement account?",finance
personalfinance,Higher Rate Cash-Out Refinance Loan,"This is my first post here, so feel free to let me know if this is the wrong place to post these questions.

My wife and I are currently in the process of working through a re-finance cash-out with our current mortgage.  Our plan is to refinance and cash-out, and then use that money for home improvements.  The piece I would like some advice on is that we are going to be taking out &gt;80% of the value of our home with the cash-out.  I don't think this is unheard of, but most mortgage companies won't let you do this (unless it's a VA loan or similar).  Since we already have an account with this lender, they offered us the following:

* We refinance now and take out cash of up to 95% of our Home's appraised value (less what we owe and re-finance fees)
* We would then use that money to improve the house (although via the loan documents we could use it however we would like)
* After 6 months of payments on this new loan, we could refinance again and they waive all closing costs for refinancing.

The idea here is to add value to our home with capital from our equity on a cash-out loan that has a higher interest rate and then refinance sometime 6-9 months later and lock in at a lower fixed interest rate and gain back the equity (likely at an 80% ROI).  It's possible that we may be close to the 20% equity mark and could also drop off PMI when we refinance the second time as well (we may have to bring a little money to the table to get that to happen, which we would have more of in 6-9 months).

The definite downside to this is we roll closing costs into the price of the new loan (where it compounds interest).

The risk is that fixed rates go up past where we lock in at now and we are stuck with that rate until we sell the house.  I think the overall risk is rather low that interest rates spike up past where they would put us at, and to be honest it's not even that bad if we had to stick with it through a recession if rates all of sudden sky-rocketed.  Typically this doesn't happen on an election year, but anything is possible.

Let's assume we are willing to trade the above risks for a nicer home.  Are we missing anything here?

Is it odd that we are able to borrow up to \~95% of the value of the home in this program? I did have a hard time finding such a good deal elsewhere online, however, my mortgage company doesn't seem to advertise this option much, I had to talk to a rep on the phone to get details about it. We did have to meet some more stringent requirements for credit, income to debt ratio and we have made all of our payments with them on time for several years.  Also, they are hitting us with a higher fixed interest rate.

personalfinance,Best way to pay off and consolidate student loans,"Beat way to consolidate and pay off student loans

I went to a division 1 college on a partial scholarship to play football and I, as any high school senior athlete would be, was astonished to say I had finally made something of myself. However, just after my freshman year, I got injured. That injury led me to have to quit the sport and just focus on school. It was devastating. What was even more devastating was losing that scholarship and the amount that school was going to cost me. With not much guidance, I went and finished school and pulled out a loan each semester. I now owe $50k in debt to Sallie Mae. However, the biggest problem is that they want me to pay anywhere from $90 to $300 each month on every loan I have out. They all add up to a sum of about $800 a month with around an 11% interest rate which is totally not feasible for me to pay at this point in my life and honestly the interest rate makes me want to throw up. 

My question for this sub is what is the best way to consolidate these 6 or 7  loans I have out right now and also what would be the best way to go about lowering my interest rate and paying these loans of ASAP?",finance
personalfinance,Is it better to pay of graduate school or take out loans to save money for a down payment on a house?,"I have one year left of graduate school (approx 12-16k left in that year for the classes). I am living with my mom right now, so my living expenses are very low, and I can manage to save around 2k a month. Assuming I live with my mom for 10 months (she’s fine with me living with her as long as I need, but I would like to be as prepared as I can to move out when the time is right) I could save approximately 20k in that time. 

My options are to use that money to put as a down payment on a townhouse, or I could pay for the final year of school and pay that off instead and save far less cash. My interest rate on my student loans would be 6% and I have 2k currently in loans to get me through this semester while I was switching jobs and moving states.

Which is the better option?  Pay off school as it comes and save less for a down payment, or take out loans and save all of my money for a down payment?

personalfinance,Decided to get serious about finances. What do focus on first?,"I realized recently I have been pretty bad with money. I made a budget and sticking to it. I am saving about 800-900 bucks a month. My take home pay is 3,300. One of my strengths is not spending money, now that I have a budget I will stick to it. I was just not even realizing how much money I was burning on food, video games, etc.. 

I am teaching an extra class this year and will make an extra 8k or so, I really want to use this money wisely. This money will be in addition to the 800 im saving a month. I will also get a job this summer, should net me at least 2k.

The bad news: I have 43k in student loans. Interest rates vary from 3%-6.8%. 23k of them are 6.8%. I put them on the income payment plan and hoping to get them forgiven after 10 years, public school teacher. I am now wondering if it would even save me much money. No credit card debt but a 0% interest loan on my car 10k left.

personalfinance,I have royally screwed up with a car loan and I feel utterly trapped/need advice.,"I'll try and keep this short and sweet, but I'm gonna go full vent mode so I'll just TL;DR at the end. Also let me preface this with the fact that hindsight is 20/20 and I know I'm kinda dumb for getting myself into this mess. Current me is dumbfounded past me got myself in this mess. So here's my situation:

August 2018. Freshly graduated college and my mom essentially says since I'm an ""adult"" she wants the car back that she's ""allowed me to drive"" since high school and I need to get my own car. Okay bet.

I know next to nothing about cars other than I've been driving an 03 BMW around and every time something broke it costs an arm and a leg to fix. So none of that for me.

I know I want something reliable, so I settle on looking for a Honda Civic. When I say I know next to nothing about cars, I didn't realize I knew even less about how car loans work. I knew I could budget around... 250 a month for a car payment? Insurance shouldn't be crazy too so that's doable. **FIRST MISTAKE**

I found a 2013 Civic listed for about 9k. Now my credit score is literally just ""fair"". Not bad, not good. They might as well call it ASS still because since I'm so young, the best rate I could get approved for is like 20% loan. The payments came out to about what I wanted, so I was like ""Okay let's do this, I'm an adult and adults pay a car note"". Before I signed though, I sought the council of my parents. **SECOND MISTAKE**

So my mom didn't want me to ""settle"" for this car. She thought the 2015 Certified Pre-Owned whatever BS model would be better. I inform her that based on my credit score it's looking like the payment is DOUBLE what I think I can afford. (Also side note. Her credit score is probably more BUNS than me, so no co-signing there)

She implores me to get it. She even says ""I'll help you pay for half."" Now I'm skeptical, because my mom isn't the most trustworthy with my money. But she explained how she would help and I forget what she said now, but sounded legit. I'm like ""Bet. I get a newer and nicer car for the same price I'd pay because moms gonna help me!"" **THIRD MISTAKE**

We go back to get the 2015 one. I'll skip the filler BS on this story, but basically it costs around 17k at a 22% interest and it costs 23 year old me 480 bucks a month to pay for it. And that's without insurance, gas, maintenance, etc. (YIKES). 

I'm positive the salesmen knew this was not a good idea. But he finessed and managed to get me approved and smiled in my face as he sent me off to my financial doom. (I'm thinking about it, and I remember he assured me that even if it was a bad loan now, if I pay on time for like 6 months my credit score will shoot up and I can refinance! ....take a guess as to what DIDN'T happen)

Anyways. First payment comes up and mom helps. Second one comes up and she send less than half. Third and subsequent ones she doesn't pay a thing because she has no money. I forgot what her plan was to help, but it didn't come to fruition.

So for the past year I've been grinding working two jobs to pay my litany of bills. It's honestly not bad. But a car loan isn't bad until you can't pay it.

So next my mom convinces me to leave where I'm living to come live at home, or house because they moved to ""Atlanta"" (it was actually 30 miles south of the city) and I'll have more opportunities there and I can save money! After like 2 months of debating, I pack up my life and quit my two jobs where I've been working away at the ""idea"" of more opportunities. **Lost count of the mistakes**

That was a poor choice. I didn't even secure a job before I left and it took me forever just to find a shitty serving job again. (I worked as a server and in TV/film as a Media PA before I moved). I spent the next month more broke and miserable than I ever was when I was living on my own. The hour long commute to town to work a terrible job I hated and wasn't making anything for money. No friends. That was a tough time and taking a toll on me mentally.

Luckily, I didn't burn my bridges back where I moved from and got my jobs back. I took what little money I had left and took a loan from my gf to get my apartment back and literally move back after a month.

Everything seemed fine and dandy, but then I was still kinda broke getting back into the swing of my life and was struggling to make ends meet compared to before. I did some research on my situation, and here's what I learned.

SO yeah how car interest works isnt that I pay 22% of 17k and then pay off the car... NO IT COMPOUNDS THE LIFE OF THE LOAN. (I told you, I'm dumb and a sucker) so feasibly I'm looking at paying like 33k over the course of six years for a 17k car? I feel like if someone told me that straight up I would have left the dealership immediately.

Also found out my credit score is probably stagnant because I have two very minor hospital bills in collections right now from college (thought my insurance covered them, but nope). And I know the solution would be to ""just pay the bills"" but between the car loan, higher insurance, maintenance; I can't even afford to set aside money for those overdue bills.

I used to save 20% of everything I made. I used to grocery shop. I used to have a furnished apartment. But now I can't pay for any of that because my car literally costs me more than my place to live.

I should also mention here that my insurance premium went up because someone swiped in front of me to make a turn, and then the car in front of them hard braked and I clipped the back of their car. My car was only slightly damaged cosmetically... but now I can't afford the $500 deductible to fix it because that's how much my monthly note is... which I haven't paid yet because if I do I won't have rent

It feels like a cyclical never-ending financial shit loop I'll be stuck in till I'm damn near 30. I have nightmares about what can go wrong. I stress about this everyday. I fantasize about winning the lottery just for enough money to pay my bills. I literally am gonna have to start thinking about how to pay back student loans and I'll owe the IRS money for taxes. There's a lot of stuff coming for me in the future and I'm starting to feel the weight of it all.

The last part of this though is that today I got offered a 15 day side gig that will pay me around 3k after I suffer for two weeks straight. Should I just say to hell with this car and take that money and buy something in straight cash since I need a car for work and what not.

I have literally nowhere else to turn. Google isn't helping. My family isn't helping. The financial institutions are telling me the same shit ""sorry can't help, just keep trying to pay lol"". So I'm turning to reddit for some sound advice.

(TL;DR: Got a car loan for a 17,000 car at a 22% interest rate that cost me $480/month thinking if I paid on time, I would get a higher score to refinance. That has not happened and I and overwhelmed trying to pay for a car. Took a month to move home thinking it would help, actually mad it worse. Feels like repo is in the future, but need a car to live and work. Also have looming bills/expenses to pay in the near future. I got offered a side gig that will pay somewhere around 3k if I work two weeks straight. Should I take that and buy a car outright [like I should have done/will do until the end of my life] or try to do something about my current situation?)

personalfinance,Car Loan through GM Financial,"UPDATE: changed the loan amount to 17500.  

2nd UPDATE:  I was told that GMF wasn’t running the 1.9% APR and that they didn’t remove it from their site which is crap.  Regardless, the dealer claimed gmf doesn’t have prepayment penalty.

3rd UPDATE:  I bought the car and took a 60mo BofA Loan with a 3.13% APR.  I’ll double-up on my payments because I’ll easily get this car to 100k in 3.5years.






I wanted to bounce this off the inter webs  to make sure I'm seeing this right.  I'm looking to buy a used car right now.  The Loan amount will be roughly $17500. 

GM Financial has a promotion right now - 1.9% APR for 36 or 60 months.

I want to have a car payment that is below $400 though my income allows for to pay much more than that.  My previous car I was paying $520/month which was $100 more than my actual payment.

Normally, you would salivate over a low APR like the one that GMF is offering but they also have a prepayment penalty.  With that in mind, I could take the 36 month term but I'd be paying a hefty monthly payment (around $500) or go very long 60 month (around $310/month).  

It seems like to me that even though a higher interest rate on the surface is not good, I could potentially get a 3.39% rate for a 48 month term which would keep me slightly under $400 but If I chose to, could tack on additional to pay off the car well before the 48 month term.  To me that flexibility seems like a much more desirable thing than what I'm seeing through GM.  

So, is my rationale making sense?  Also, does anyone know what the prepayment penalty is for a GMF Loan?

personalfinance,Closing a credit card account,"I opened up two credit card accounts in 2017 and one in 2018, which were all maxed out until yesterday when I finally finished paying off their entire balances. My plan was originally to use the 2018 one to balance transfer for one of the others (as the balance transfer interest rate was 0% for 12 months), but I ended up (surprise, surprise) using that new card and maxing it out too. Now that I think I've gotten rid of my bad spending habits, I'm focusing on repairing my credit score. Should I close the 2018 card as this will increase the average age of my credit? I've also got student loans that started in 2013 so my oldest account is 6 years old, and the average age of my credit would be 4 years vs 3.25 years. I also have less of an interest in the card rewards (it is a Discover It card) in comparison to raising my credit.",finance
politics,Megathread: Appeals court refuses to block House subpoena for Trump’s financial records,"The House of Representatives can access President Trump’s private financial records from two banks, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday, finding a ""public interest"" in refusing to block congressional subpoenas.

The ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit came in the ongoing legal battle Trump has waged to shield his private business records from disclosure — including in two cases that have already reached the Supreme Court.

The New York-based appeals court upheld Congress’s broad investigative authority and ordered Deutsche Bank and Capital One to comply with the House subpoenas for the president’s financial information. The court gave the president seven days to seek review by the Supreme Court in the case pre-dates the public impeachment proceedings in the House.

In a 106-page ruling, the court said the House committees’ ""interests in pursuing their constitutional legislative function is a far more significant public interest than whatever public interest inheres in avoiding the risk of a Chief Executive’s distraction arising from disclosure of documents reflecting his private financial transactions.""

The ruling is not stayed yet, but like the subpoenas to Trump's accountants the president is likely to move for a stay pending higher court review.

personalfinance,Buying a house - When is it possible?,"I am really trying to get a sense of what a reasonable time frame would be as regards buying a house.  I know in my situation it won’t be a year, it may not be three years.  I am trying to determine if it will ever be possible.

Backstory for my question is I work full-time and make about $40,000 gross, my wife works part-time and her gross is somewhere around $25-$27,000.

And now the mitigating factors.  My wife filed bankruptcy maybe a little over two years ago.  Wiped away her credit card debt.  She had worked full-time but after the birth of our first child, and the death of her father, she had to switch to part-time in order to be with the baby.  That’s another factor, we have two children.  One is 2 and a half, the other is about two months.

We have car debt, about $27,000 total.  I have Credit card debt, about $10,000.  We have student loan debt, I am about $55,000 and she is probably around $63,000.  And finally, medical debt from the two births.  I don’t even know what that is at currently.  

I try to budget out to the dollar what I spend per month, and after all minimum payments I am left with about $127 per month as extra to put towards debts.  My wife basically has nothing left after paying what she needs to per month.

I have concocted various plans: working extra Sundays at my job to aid in paying down debts, using tax refund to pay off debts, or saving tax refund for a few years to help as a down payment on a house.  I always go back and forth because of how little progress I make on my debts.

I may not have provided enough information, but does anyone have advice, similar circumstances, and what it took/how long it took to finally realize the dream of buying a home?  Any suggestions on a reasonable time frame to put in mind for when it may ultimately be time to buy?

Thank you!

edit to show budget:

My monthly take home is about $2,062, my wife's is $1,450 for a total of $3,512.

Rent in our apartment is -$1,100, -$670 for cars, -$149 for my private student loan, -$52 for my federal student loan, credit cards, only minimum payments is -$241 across five cards.  I subtract from myself $560 per month for food.  -$75 for internet access. -$160 for my portion of our gas, phone, and electricity bills.  I also -$11 for Apple Music.

When I look at just what I pay myself, per month, I am actually at negative $66 per month.  When I combine what we make, and subtract everything I have listed so far, it leaves $494, but my wife still pays her school bill, her portion of gas, phone, and electric, and our renter's insurance.  So it is definitely lower than $494 that we have left over to handle debts.",finance

My questions:
-Is that fee a reasonable amount? 
-How likely is it that my creditors will not agree to the interest rates proposed in the dmp? (around 1-2%)

personalfinance,mortgage payment to rid pmi &amp; credit card transfer vs pay off credit card for score bump first - LONG - Navy Federal?,"Hello Redditors,

I lurk a bit on this sub- feel like it's helped me a bit with becoming a frugal financially responsible adult and enjoy sharing the info I find here so thank you in advance.

Signed up to pose a question I have not been able to figure out the answer to.  Sorry it's a bit scatterbrained/ multifaceted and lengthy.

Basically, should I pay off credit card that the 0% interest has run out on and paying 20something% or pay off chunk of mortgage to get out of paying PMI every month (prob ~$120/mo) first?

If I pay off the $6k on the card, my credit score should jump to 800 according to simulators.  Currently depending on which score checker it's around 750 plus/minus 30. 



What I can't figure out is how much/ if score would go up if I pay $12k plus off of $125k left on mortgage.  
I would want/need to do a 0% balance transfer on the high interest $6k card and concerned about credit score dip.

If I pay the card first, and excellent credit score is there a different mortgage/refinance option worth it and get me out of paying pmi?

My current FHA loan is 3.875%

Another thought is whether I could get mortgage without PMI with Navy Federal (and if their home/auto insurance is competitive/ would save me money as well?).  I myself am not military so I believe limited on mortgage type I can get but was approved to open a checking account.

stocks,"Weak U.S. Industrial Data Leads Array of Worrying Economic Indicators, Gold Remains Steady","There are several reasons experts presently warn of potential economic downturn. China’s growth has been slowing, despite recent positive reports, as the trade war wages on and geopolitical tensions increase. Among others, countries like Singapore and South Korea, who export manufactured goods to China, are slowing.

Positive economic signs do persist, with consumption remaining steady at 2%, and private residential investment increasing in the third quarter of 2019. (though this has steadily declined since the end of 2017). Despite this, business investment has begun to fall.

Large companies have cut back capital expenditures, citing policy uncertainty and the trade war as harbingers. With declining investment in business, wages will likely decline, leading to weaker demand and slower hiring.

Certain financial markets have shown signs of slowing. The collateralized loan obligation market has seen falling standards in the value of the products. This market is comprised of risky loans that have increasingly been substituted for junk bonds in the U.S.

The Federal Reserve has intervened in the repo market, suggesting liquidity issues, as reported by Bloomberg. Beyond that, government policy won’t provide much economic support, as interest rates have already been low (below 2%) and the Fed likely won’t implement quantitative easing unless an economic crisis breaks out.

The signs of economic downturn don’t stop there. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released data supporting more evidence that U.S. industry has slowed in the last six months.

U.S. industrial companies are not placing new orders for equipment, leading to lower production. Lower productions leads to fewer jobs. ISM®’s New Orders Index were 47.2 percent in November,

a 1.9 percentage point decrease against 49.1 percent reported in October. New orders contracted for a fourth straight month, leading to a decline in stocks of approximately 350 points.

The U.S. could benefit from global weakness, as capital flows could be sent to the U.S. amid political unrest elsewhere. China weakness and slow downs in Germany and South Korea, as well as protests in Hong Kong, Spain, Latin America, the Middle East, and elsewhere, could see a flight to the calmer shores of the U.S.

The weak overarching economic data, including the poor manufacturing data, kept gold prices steady.

As reported by CNBC, gold remained “little changed at $1,464.20 per ounce. U.S. gold futures settled down 0.3% at $1469.2.” The manufacturing data will likely support gold throughout trading today.

“Market started the day on a risk-on tone, but got caught off guard when the ISM data was a bit weaker-than-expected. We saw equities, yields and the dollar all correct, which has helped gold a bit,” said Ryan McKay, a commodity strategist at TD Securities.

Though some experts remain pessimistic that further rate cuts will five the economy a shot in the arm, others say further rate cutting remains on the table.

“The notion is that the U.S. Federal Reserve is done cutting (interest rates) for now and we’ll need to see a trend in weaker data through early 2020 to convince the market that we’re going to get more cuts. Until then, there’s no real impetus to see gold rally,” McKay added.

personalfinance,Graduating College Student Need Finance Advice,"Some background information about me. I will be graduating in August with an MechE degree. I have worked multiple co-ops at different companies as well as part of the program so finding a job should not be too difficult. I live 45min from the nearest large city with engineering companies from my home which I plan to live at for at max 2 years. My hope is that I can come out making at least 60k for the entry level first year and to feel it out the first year and get a true full load of engineering work. My college debt I believe will come out to around 40k max which is a shot in the dark but the worst outcome. I have used my co-op money to pay for a few semesters already. 

What I need advice on is how to go about investing and begin growing financially. I have done a lot of research on the stock market, EFTs, Bonds, Dividend Stocks, 401k, Roth IRA, and how to consolidate loans all into one. Firstly, my goal would be to essentially live at home for a year or two and use 40k of my income for loans that first year and essentially live off of 10k per  year. I live very frugally and rarely ever buy myself anything nice. I am saver so any amount of money I don't use I save and only spend on food and necessities. How would I go about consolidating my federal and bank loans into one loan. I've asked my mother how I could access these loans. I still don't fully know how to get full control of my loans when I come out of college. Ideally, I have one load condensed and am able to begin paying it off immediately after I get a job. Secondly, what is the benefit of Roth IRA vs 401k? Is it okay to get both? My plan was to essentially take money from my income and begin pouring into my retirement fund 401k and use the Roth IRA as another source of growing my money over time that will be untouched. I will also have a savings account to put emergency funds into as well as my general checking account used for everyday needs. As for EFTs and stocks, I want to begin investing in stocks that allow me to grow income yearly. I do not know where to begin in terms of true investing into stocks. I have researched plenty of companies and have gained knowledge on what the S&amp;P500 and DJ really are but am still in foreign waters with how I begin to invest. My plan was to sign up for a brokerage account either Schwab or on my phone Robinhood and put in 50$ just to play with and get familiar with how stocks work more. I understand how dividend principle work but am unsure on how to begin investing in proper stocks that have them. I see many stocks have say a 1-4% dividend but how does that eventually turn into income over a year if I only invest in say 10 stocks worth 100$? Any advice on how to begin investing and to become more financially adept would be great. Any thing that can help get me ahead on life financially, I  want to know.",finance

personalfinance,Desperately need help. Creditors wont work with me! Long Post.,"Long post! I am GRATEFUL for any help you guys/gals can offer! Sorry for any typos.

My situation:
First off, this debt is legit. I have done my homework on it. Because believe me, I am not about to pay any debt I do not legally owe. Unfortunately, this is a legal legitimate debt.

I have a collections agency/creditor trying to collect $8,700+ dollars on a subrogation claim from a wreck I was involved in back in May 2019. I did not receive notice of the debt until October 2019. Driver’s license was suspended less than a month later in Nov. 2019. Debt is within the statute of limitations (I checked TN law).

The collections agency absolutely REFUSES to set up a payment plan that I can afford. They will not budge! I have tried. And although I have asked multiple times, I have never gotten a straight answer as to why they won’t even try to work with me on monthly payment amounts. The amount is not drawing interest or late fee’s. They also do not report to the credit agencies (they told me that themselves). However, my driver’s license has been suspended over non-payment on that debt. (I’m a single mother and I have a job, so not having a license for an extended period of time will be detrimental to my life and my child’s). If and when I can work out a payment plan with the collection agency (and get it notarized by both parties), the state has told me IN WRITING that I will be eligible to get my license back, as long as I continue timely payments. 

I CAN afford to make monthly payments. But what I CANNOT afford is $1500 down+$645 a month, which is the minimum the collections agency will accept as it stands. It would take me about 4-6 months to come up with the down payment alone. Also, my monthly budget will not allow for their minimum monthly payment, or even anything close to it. I would be able to regularly and comfortably offer them $150-200 a month. The collections agency is willing to settle the account in full if I can hand them $6900 at once. That, obviously, is not in the cards for me either. That’s even more unobtainable than their monthly payment options for me.

I have no assets. I do not own a vehicle (not since the wreck in May). I do not own any land/property/real estate. I do not own any CD accounts, no stocks/bonds, no 401k, no IRA… nothing. No savings either, due to the fact I have had to pay Uber/coworkers/friends to drive me around for my necessities. There was only just over $100 in savings anyways. I also have no relatives or family that has that kind of money for me to borrow.

I have no other debt to my name, besides a medical bill that I am making $5 monthly payments on with a $700 balance left. I do not own a credit card (never have). I have no student loans. Nothing in collections.

Options I have tried:
-I have contacted the nationally accredited credit counseling agency in my town to discuss a debt management plan. They are unwilling to help, because they do not deal with ANY type of insurance collections, except medical. 

-I have met with a local bankruptcy attorney. I meet the qualifications to file Chp. 13. They are willing and able to help. They charge $3,035 for Chp. 13 ($35 upfront).  Filing for bankruptcy will allow me to get my license back almost immediately. They are also willing to set up a payment plan I could afford to pay them back responsibly. (On a side note: Are these attorney fees normal/reasonable? Or should I shop around for a better price, if necessary?)

My major concerns: 
-Obtaining approval from the state to have my license back/getting my license back

-Being able to COMFORTABLY make monthly payments to the collection agency, if we can come to an agreement.

-Bankruptcy: I realize what a major hit it will take on my credit (just spent the last 2 years building my credit up to 650), and that sickens me... I realize I won’t be able to qualify for any decent interest rate for a long time on any type of loan, if I can even get qualified for a loan. I have no savings/emergency fund now, so being able to take a $500-$1000 loan with my current credit score is a nice cushion to have at the moment. After bankruptcy, even that won’t be an option for me.

My budget (monthly):

Income: $1200

Expenses:
*Rent: $420

*Utilities/Internet: $80

*Childcare: $200

Groceries: $200

Misc./Household: $50

(*denotes fixed expenses)

Income-expenses= $250.

Like mentioned above, I could comfortably make a monthly payment $150-$200 a month to the collections agency, and still have a small cushion monthly for what I like to call “OH SHIT! Expenses”. Meaning: doctor’s visits, prescriptions, gas money for car rides, etc. 

Getting a second job is not possible for me right now (due to the cost of child care), although I am currently looking into side gigs/ways of making supplemental income. I cannot get a raise at work right now either, as I just received one. It will be 4-6 months before I am eligible for another.

Although my credit score is 650, I do not qualify for an unsecured loan to pay off the amount in full, because I do not have enough established credit/my credit age is too young. I could however tentatively qualify for a secured loan, but alas…. I have no assets/collateral. I do not have a single family member or friend who would be willing/able to co-sign for me either. I have tried.

Here’s the bottom line:
-I do not want to file for bankruptcy!!!!! (tbh, who does???) I want to pay this debt off, but I am struggling to find a way where I can do so responsibly.

-I am just trying to find someone/some organization who has experience speaking to and working out payment plans with creditors, so that I might be able to actually pay this debt off instead of filing for bankruptcy. (I’m in my early 20’s, I am a single mother, and I know filing for bankruptcy will SERIOUSLY hurt me/my credit/my life plans moving forward.)

-Are there any tips/tricks you can share with me that could help me when trying to negotiate with the collections agency?

-Is it legal to “threaten” the creditor with me filing for bankruptcy, in the hopes it will make them work with me? If it is legal, how often does doing that work in the consumer’s favor? 

-Will a bankruptcy attorney reach out to the creditor for me? Telling them that this is their last chance to work with me, and if they don’t, I will be filing for bankruptcy? Of course, I realize I would have to compensate that lawyer for doing so. I’m just not sure if that’s something an attorney would even be willing to do??

-Are there any options for me out there that I could be overlooking, besides credit counseling services, debt management plans, taking out a loan, or bankruptcy??

-Are collections agencies legally allowed to force you to pay what they want, regardless of what you can actually afford? The creditor knows my license has been suspended, and they seem to be dangling that over my head to try to make me pay what they are comfortable with, instead of what we could both be comfortable with.

Lastly, It just seems ABSOLUTELY BONKERS to me that I would take the money that I could be paying the collections agency with, and use it to pay a bankruptcy attorney monthly payments instead.... just because the collection agency won’t work with me on arranging an affordable payment plan. In my opinion, Bankruptcy would be a lose-lose situation. It would absolutely destroy my credit that I’ve worked to build, bar me from opening any credit cards or loans for 3-5 years, make it harder for me to get approved for a new place (so that I could move out of the shithole I am currently living in), and overall make my life harder than it needs to be. All while, the creditor either won’t see a penny, or they will receive a very small portion of what they could’ve received had they worked with me in the first place. NO ONE WINS, yet this is the only thing on the table for me right now (seemingly). This whole damn situation sucks. Bad.

I realize this is a long post. Thankful to all who read it through. I have tried to include all pertinent information. Any advice/opinions are GREATLY appreciated. I don’t know where else to turn to for advice.",finance

Note: I was forced to change superannuation (retirement) accounts when I started my RA job, which means I don't have any of the statements from original account anymore. I can only estimate based off the amount that was rolled over to the new super account in late 2017.

**Background**

My family is lower-middle class. I'm from Canada and my family moved to Australia when I was 12 years old. My parents separated when I was 15. My mom moved back to Canada with my younger brother while my dad stayed in Australia with me and my sister. My dad now makes an average income (for Sydney), whereas my mom in Canada is most likely below the poverty line (works 3-4 shifts a week at Walmart as she was unable to resume her job as a pastor when she returned).

My biggest reason for staying in Australia was the group of friends I had at school, and the second biggest reason was education. I wanted to study psychology and Australia has very high rankings in this area, plus they have the HECS-HELP scheme, which essentially means that citizens (which I am) can study with no upfront costs with the help of an interest-free loan to be paid off at a specified taxable income threshold (this was recently lowered to about $50k/year).

Choosing this degree at UNSW meant that I was able to enroll in the general education course that has quite literally changed my life. The course was called personal finance, which I took because I knew I didn't know as much as I wanted to about it. Wow. I learned a huge amount in 3 months. One of the assignments involved tracking spending over a minimum of 30 days, though I ended up using that app for over 2 years. I gained a lot of insight into my financial situation, learned about ETFs and investing, learned about the benefits and risks of buying housing, and learned for the first time the meaning of financial independence. That was in 2014.

**Financial Progress**

**2014**

When I moved out of home to start my degree, I was 17 years old (a month before my 18th birthday). I had no savings (I spent it all visiting my mom in Canada a couple months prior) and no job. Once I turned 18, I knew I would receive a back payment from centrelink (student welfare) of about $2,000 so I just had to wait until then to buy a phone, laptop, pay my sister back (who I was living with) for rent/food, etc. Then I started to get regular payments of about $960/month. My rent was $775 month living in a 3 bedroom apartment in a cheaper area with my sister and a roommate so this was not enough. After applying for a few jobs but not hearing back soon enough, I started putting up ads for high school tutoring since I had received decent grades in math, biology, and English. I soon had two families who wanted tutoring from me, one who wanted 3 hours a week, and the other after 5 hours a week. Since I was new to tutoring I charged $20/hour (low income for Sydney, but was a lot for me). One family offered to pay higher: $100 for 3 hours. This made up most of my non-centrelink income, though I did occasionally have additional hours/students.

Below is a table of my income and expenses from 2014:

**Income 2014**

|**Income Source**|**Monthly**|
|:-|:-|
|Centrelink|$960|
|Tutoring|$960|
|Gifts (parents)|$40|
|**Total**|**$1,960**|

Note: The 'gift' is referring to my dad paying my super cheap phone bill for the first year after I moved out, and health insurance (helped out with dentist a lot).

**Expenses 2014**

|**Expense**|**Monthly**|
|:-|:-|
|Food|$215|
|Transport|$97|
|Rent|$775|
|Electricity|$33|
|Electronics (averaged over lifespan)|$55|
|Leisure (Spotify + no hobbies!)|$29|
|Clothes|$75|
|Medical|$60|
|Internet &amp; Phone|$53|
|Misc|$60|
|**Total**|**$1,452**|

So I was saving, on average, about $500 a month. Through some extra hours and penny pinching I had $6,820 in savings in November 2014.

Around that time I started applying for casual jobs since I knew I wouldn't get income from tutoring over the summer (meaning Dec-Feb). I lucked out and got a job sooner than expected, so I was able to start work before the end of the month. I had been expecting about 20 hours a week but actually ended up working 37.5 hours a week for most of the summer which had a huge positive impact on my savings. I was not used to having so much money (I felt incredibly rich for someone earning $16/hour). At the end of December I spent $3,400 on flights to Canada to see my mom (pretty sure I paid for my boyfriend too which is why it was so expensive) and was still left with $5,900.

**2015**

I made huge leaps over the summer, hitting $11,000 by the end of March 2015, meaning I saved just over $5,000 in 3 months.

When classes returned in March 2015 I kept my casual job while also tutoring, though I don't have a good record of how much I earned. I started charging a bit more for my tutoring and got small raises for my casual job as in Australia, the minimum wage increases based on your age until you're 21. In June 2015 I had $15,350 in savings.

My trip to Canada was shortly after that in July 2015, so my income was essentially $0 for the 3.5 weeks I was overseas (Centrelink gets cancelled when you're outside the country). While I was in Canada, the store I'd been working at closed temporarily for renovations, but they had no date for reopening. I never went back and instead found myself a retail job that had a higher hourly rate, sales bonuses, was more enjoyable, but had fewer hours than my previous job (bit of a pro, bit of a con).

Oh, also I got engaged while in Canada (ripe old age of 19!) and moved in with my boyfriend upon our return, so my rent was higher and I needed to pay a bond. (Pro tip: don't get engaged at 19!)

By the end of the 2015 after a month of no income, and booking some wedding services and buying a dress, I was almost on par with 6 months prior with $15,570 in the bank.

**2016**

Man, this was a rough year.

In December 2015 my fiancé was 'made redundant' at his job (despite him seeing a job ad for his exact position a couple weeks later) which was very stressful until he found another one in February. He also signed up for an amateur play and was out at rehearsals multiple nights a week which took a toll on our relationship. My obsession with saving money definitely didn't help as we spent an incredibly small amount of money on going out together. But hey, savings, right?

I volunteered in January as a research assistant at my university and was incredibly lucky to be hired in another lab based on that position a couple months later. This meant I was studying 4 subjects, working in 2-3 shifts a week, tutoring a few hours a week, and was doing research assistant work 1 day a week. With all this working I was able to save up to $20,000 at the end of June 2016. Which is right around the time shit hit the fan.

My fiancé, being enlightened by his cool theatre friends, decided he no longer believed in God, was starting to think that marriage was some bizarre societal construct, and was seriously fed up with me never doing anything fun because it cost money. I rarely drank alcohol but he was getting drunk multiple nights a week, also leading to significant tensions between us. My university grades took a serious plunge during that period. When our lease ended August, we did not renew, and we called off all wedding plans (with $5,000 down the drain on non-refundable deposits + a wedding dress).

Although it was rough, I managed to quickly find a flatmate close to the uni for $215/week. More than I was paying before but still affordable, especially with my safety net. Having space seriously improved my life. I started working out, lost a few kilos, my grades picked up again, and I stopped being so stingy with my spending because I no longer had a wedding to pay for. My partner and I kept seeing each other while he sorted out his shit. He was diagnosed with ADD and general anxiety which helped explain some of the problems we had.

With my saving so (relatively) high, and no more large, planned expenses on the horizon, I finally took the plunge into ETFs, putting $9,000 into the market. Because I was sort of 'over it' with finances at the time (seeing how much my savings habits negatively impacted my relationship) I didn't save a whole lot in the second half of 2016, and ended the year with $11,400 in the bank and about $8,800 in shares (decrease in value).

**2017**

Things significantly picked up this year. As this was my final year, and the year that would determine my eligibility for a PhD scholarship, I reduced my work hours significantly. I quit my retail job so I could get more from my higher paying jobs (was now charging $60/hour for tutoring university students, and earned $40/hr as a research assistant). My grades were up and my research project was going well. In the first 6 months my savings were up to $15,500.

I was still in a relationship with my boyfriend/finacé, though I seriously considered breaking up with him more than once. A few months after his diagnosis he really started doing better mentally and by that time he was starting to regret our separation. We ended up moving back in together 9 months after our separation, about halfway through 2017. Because our previous apartment had probably contributed to our horrible year together (it was very dark and depressing inside and we didn't have a lot of space) we increased our budget and got a place for $520/week with LOTS of windows. Because he was in a much better paying job by 2017, we agreed that he would pay more of it - so I paid $220 and he paid $300.

I think we made the right decision as we're still going steady now (but do not plan on getting married any time soon). I did really well in my degree, landed the scholarship I wanted to enter the PhD program, had my supervisor lined up, and a really solid savings account of $18,000. However, I needed it for something.

It turns out I am quite an unlucky individual who somehow ended up with a congenital breast deformity called tuberous breasts. This comes in degrees (some people get a more mild version where it is not that noticeable, or only in one breast) but I had a very severe form in both breasts. When I told my Dr (because I needed a referral) she was very skeptical of me until I took off my top. She awkwardly had to backtrack on what she said about me probably being normal, etc. She wrote my referral and I went to a highly regarded plastic surgeon. He said he'd never seen anyone with such a severe form of it, and a different surgeon I did a consult with said surgery to fix it wasn't even possible (for him). I did not take the decision lightly as I am not the kind of person to throw $18,000 down the drain, but that is what it cost, even after I waited a year for my insurance to pass the waiting period for pre-existing conditions. My surgery was booked for May 2018.

**2018**

I started my PhD late in January 2018 - I didn't earn any income between graduating in November 2017 and starting the PhD because my RA contract was over, I was no longer eligible for student payments, and I didn't want to get a casual job over Christmas (I had already worked enough Christmases!) The standard PhD scholarship in Australia covers all tuition in addition to $27,000 per year for living expenses, indexed to inflation. My specific institution pays an extra $5,000 per year to all students with the government scholarship. With this, my base income is $32,000 p.a. net because neither of the scholarships are taxable. I still tutor for $60 an hour in first semester which typically earns me an extra $5,000-$6,000. This extra income is taxable but Australia has a tax-free threshold of $18,200, so I do not owe any tax unless I exceed that *in addition* to my scholarship income. I had a lot of students in 2017 which really helped me cover the surgery costs while keeping a safety net, without having to sell any ETFs. My lowest bank balance was $3,900 after paying all surgery related expenses.

I spent the second half of the year recovering from surgery both physically and financially. I started tutoring second year psychology for the university to boost my income and get my savings up again. I was up to $13,000 in September when I decided to invest another $5,000 in ETFs, and ended the year on $8,350 cash after splurging $2,000 on a quality laptop.

**2019**

This year, with my surgery out of the way, with no upcoming wedding plans I was able to really focus on FI again. I started being a lot more detailed with my records again mid-February 2019. I've been regularly buying shares and revising my spending to make sure I am not over-spending. I also took the chance to visit Canada for the first time since 2016 (and got paid while away this time - yay). I'm pretty happy being able to make this much progress in one year.

**Savings since Feb 2019:**

|**Account**|**Feb 2019**|**Dec 2019**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Savings|$10,395|$8,250|
|ETFs|$14,800|$32,120|
|Retirement|$7,680|$10,500|
|**Total**|**$32,875**|**$50,865**|

My current budget is not all that different from what it was in 2014, though a little bit more generous. Below are some tables to summarise:

**Income 2019**

|**Income Source**|**Monthly amount**|
|:-|:-|
|Scholarships|$2,716|
|Private Tutoring (averaged)|$520|
|University Tutoring (averaged)|$220|
|**Total**|**$3,456**|

**Expenses 2019**

|**Expense**|**Monthly**|
|:-|:-|
|Rent|$954|
|Electricity|$50|
|Groceries|$180|
|Eating Out|$100|
|Transport|$50|
|Phone &amp; Internet|$52|
|Clothing|$50|
|Travel/Holidays|$250|
|Medical|$40|
|Leisure|$150|
|Gym|$60|
|Misc|$100|
|**Total**|**$1,986**|

While the above numbers fluctuate from month to month, since May 2019 (when I started tracking it) my savings rate has been 35.9%.

**What about debt?**

While I do have student debt (to the tune of $26,800) it does not accrue interest and instead is only indexed to inflation, so I usually just ignore it as I don't think my true net worth is as good an indicator of my financial position as my assets are. I will not have to pay it off until I finish my degree and start working full time, and as long as my investments are growing above inflation, the relative amount that I owe decreases over time. I do also have a credit card that I pay off in full every month and have never paid any fees or interest. I currently owe a couple thousand because I recently went to Canada and most of the expenses we had while there went on the credit card with no international fees. That is due in a week which will put my assets slightly below $50k, but hey, it's still a cool milestone to hit!

**Moving Forward**

I feel like my lifestyle has enough variety and leisure in it to be sustainable, however I plan to increase my budget to $2,500 a month once I'm working full time - which is another 2 years away, most likely. My PhD is on track and I expect to finish by around September 2021 but anything can happen. The typical starting salary for a post-doc in Australia is $96,000 p.a. but if I don't get a post-doc I plan to go into a government position (hopefully either policy or a research position) and will take anything as low as $75,000. The main downside to academia is the lack of job security as most positions are on 2-3 year contracts or based entirely on your ability to get grant funding which currently has very low success rates (about 15% success rate on average for some grants). While I have no idea what the future holds, I am hoping that having some FU money means I can withstand the poor security. Alternatively, there's always industry and government jobs to go for instead.

For now my FI goal is $1MM, but I have mixed feelings about early retirement. Ideally I'd like to hit around $500k then reduce my workload to part time, maybe 3 days a week until I actually want to retire.

personalfinance,"1.) Should I move my 401(k) money, and 2.) Which retirement investment system should I choose?","*EDIT: First, thanks to those who read and responded. I’m a writer, not a mather, so thanks for bearing with me.

Spoke to husband after posting and he informed that his current salary is $150k, which is more aligned with what I was thinking when I cited the tax bracket. His expected bonus is also more than I estimated, so I don’t think that I’m too far off from calculating our combined income, but I didn’t factor in the standard deduction. 

——————

Throwaway account.

*Some background/for reference:*

I'm 34 years old. My husband and I have been filing taxes ""Married filing jointly"" for four years and we plan to file as such for 2019.

2019 has been a year of change: first home purchase in spring 2019 and in early fall 2019, I changed jobs (now making $60k/year) and my husband received a raise in his salary (now $100k/year). The last two developments will bump us into a new tax bracket, with an estimated 24% tax rate for the 2019 tax year. .. likely 32% if we receive bonuses.

*Current situation:* I have an employer-sponsored Fidelity 401(k) investment account, but since terminating employment with my former employer, I'm no longer eligible to contribute to that 401(k). At the time of this post, the vested balance in the 401(k) is $28,800. When I resigned from my previous job, I confirmed with Fidelity that the only fee for keeping the 401(k) account active (do nothing with the vested balance) would be the $2.50 quarterly account maintenance fee, a fee charged whether or not I was an active employee. My husband and I decided that doing nothing with the 401(k) and continuing to pay the fee was tolerable, that is, until we figure out how to transfer the money into a different account with little to no tax implications.

Earlier this week, I received a notification from Fidelity that my 401(k) plan will change for 2020 and, instead of $10 annually, I will have to pay $52 annually (or $13/quarterly) beginning 1/1/20. This has complicated my ""do nothing"" option and now I'd like advice/opinions on what option is the most ideal and less expensive (now and in the long run).

*Here are my investment options, along with what I know so far:*

**1. Leave 401(k) funds with Fidelity.** Pay the $52 annual (or $13/quarterly) account maintenance fee and funds will continue to grow without my contributions. I can begin making penalty-free withdrawals from the 401(k) account after age 59½; withdrawals are required after age 70½ (Required Minimum Distributions \[RMDs\]).

In my 401(k), I'm 100% invested in the JPMCB SmartRetirement Passive Blend 2050 Fund CF, which has yielded the following average annual returns since initial purchase:

* YTD: +19.70%
* 1 yr: +12.60%
* 3 yrs: +10.45%
* 5 yrs: +7.29%

**2. Alternative retirement plans (ARPs).** My new employer offers ARPs, or annuity plans: 403(b), 457, and Roth 403(b). I can directly transfer the 401(k) funds to a 403(b) and the transfer won't be a taxable event because it's occurring between two pre-tax accounts. My employer only offers the choice of vendors (I've narrowed down to [TIAA](https://www.tiaa.org/public/index.html) and [AXA](https://us.axa.com/home.html)) and I have to initiate enrollment and account set-up at any time with the vendor of my choice. If I choose to enroll in an ARP, however, I become ineligible to contribute to the pension (see #4).

It's my understanding that a 403(b) is an attractive option for a few reasons:

1. I don't have to report the transfer of 401(k) funds 
2. The transferred 401(k) funds balance will grow more when I can make contributions again
3. Contributions come out of my gross salary and go directly into the 403(b) plan, untaxed

I don't know \[yet\] how much my new employer can/will contribute, but if it's at least 10%, the 403(b) would be a competitive option versus #4. My open enrollment materials state that I can enroll and/or make changes to my contributions at any time, so I've held off talking to benefit administrators until I've decided if I'm seriously considering enrolling. Here's what I know about TIAA's 403(b) plan:

* Contributions to this account will be 100% vested immediately
* Current interest rate earned on new contributions: 2.75%
* Guaranteed minimum interest rate: 1.00%
* Annual record-keeping fee (calculated as % of assets in the plan): 0.095%
* Penalty-free withdrawals can be taken from the 401(k) account after age 59½

**3. Direct transfer to IRA.** I have a Roth IRA with Charles Schwab, but have not made my 2019 annual contribution to it yet. My husband has already maxed out his 2019 Roth IRA contribution ($6,000). The way that I see it, I can directly transfer my 401(k) money into my existing Roth IRA, but I would owe taxes on the amount, which I calculated to be approximately $7,000. Or, I could establish either a new Rollover IRA or Traditional IRA and make a direct transfer of the 401(k) funds to my Roth IRA custodian, Charles Schwab, tax-free, for a $0 minimum deposit, no monthly/quarterly/annual fee. I would only have to worry about paying taxes later when I consolidate accounts or receive distributions.

**4. Direct transfer to new employer's pension plan.** This is not a viable option for my 401(k) funds because I was told that a direct transfer was not allowed - but the pension needs to be considered when looking at #2. My new employer offers a public retirement system, or pension. My new employer will contribute 14% to the pension and I contribute 10% of my salary. I'm considering the Traditional Pension Plan option, a defined benefit plan where the investment of member and employer contributions is managed by the pension custodian. Retirement income is based on a formula that includes years of service credit and final average salary. Retire at age 55 with full benefit with 32 years of service or age 67 with 5 years of service. Retire at age 57 with reduced benefit with 25 years of service or age 62 with 5 years of service.

I have until February 2020 to decide whether or not I'm enrolling in my new employer's ARP options or pension. My questions to r/personalfinance:

1. **Should I move my 401(k) money and, if so, where to and when?**
2. **Which retirement system should I pursue: the 403(b) or pension plan?**

personalfinance,Advice to Keep Ahead of Debt Once Payments Begin,"Hello all!

I am a senior in undergrad, about to graduate. I attended a pretty expensive private school and although I received over half-tuition scholarships, I am still roughly $110,000 in debt (all through federal government, through Parent PLUS loans, personal subsidized and unsubsidized loans). My fiancée is about to begin medical school. Although she is a WONDERFUL student, I would like to approach this understanding she could have around $300,000 in loans after completion. I am applying to graduate school (fully funded programs only), but based on our situations I will most likely be getting some kind of job (low salary, perhaps $30-40,000 per year) until she begins residency. We will most likely end up in a metropolitan area in Texas, if that helps understand cost of living. 

I would like to know all the best tips and tricks for keeping up with payments while we both receive low salaries. I have several thousand dollars saved after working 15+ hours a week and saving around 60% of my paycheck, so I would like to think I have the very basic understandings of savings, but I would like to really understand percentages we should save/spend, unexpected costs, ins and outs of married adult life regarding finances.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation Questions,"I am currently receiving offers for debt consolidation and the offers for lower interest rates vs what my credit cards are at is very tempting.  I wanted to see if there were suggestions on how to go about pursuing this, recommendations on specific companies to work with, etc.

I currently have about $28,000 in personal debt between a car and several credit cards I would like to consolidate.  Or the credit cards (about $18k) at the very least.  The two companies I have heard from so far that have caught my eye are:

Simple Path Financial - Up to $80k rates as low as 4.99%
White Mountain Partners - $35k with an average interest rate of 3.85%

Current Debt to consolidate would be:
CC1 - $1500 @ 25.24%
CC2 - $9500 @ 24.49%
CC3 - $2100 @ 26.65%
CC4 - $5000 @ No interest till April then 29%
CC5 - $1000 @ 2.9%
CC6 - $1000 @ 25.5%
Loan1 - $6,700 @ 24.36%
Car1 - $10,000 @ 6.5%

Now I'm aware that the ""as low as"" verbiage is a best case scenario and typically the equivalent to junk mail click-bait, but these offers did get me thinking that maybe this would not be a bad idea.  One of my CC payments alone each month is almost $300 just to break even.

personalfinance,What to do with extra money (invest vs pay debt),"Hi Reddit, I'm looking for some financial advice:

I am making $102k (single) but have not been very good with saving money. I've basically been spending all of it. However I'd like to turn that around. Here's my debt:

Mortgage: $331k, 3.5%, 30 year fixed (VA Loan)

Car Loan: $53k, 3.54%, 70 months left

Student Loans: $8600, 4.5%

Credit card debt: $12000, 9%

I have about $7000 in a 401k, and contribute 5% of my income which is matched 100%. 

First off I've been going back and forth on whether to sell the car (I am a car enthusiast and love it). It has around 3k miles but I am upside down around $15,000 in it (if it sells for the blue book average of $38,000). 

I have about $800-1200 leftover each month after the minimum payments and all of my other expenses. Should I focus on paying the debt, or increase / decrease my 401k contributions, or otherwise invest? I've been given conflicting advice on whether it is better to get rid of all debt and then invest, or to make minimum payments on low interest rate debt and invest the rest.

I have a pretty unique repayment scenario I wanted to present to the great minds of PF.  Currently, I am employed (145k/yr) and my wife does not work.  I am anticipating a promotion to go up to 160k/yr in the next 6 months.  We have just purchased a home (423k, $2400/mo) and we have one car payment ($300/mo) but otherwise have no debt.  We are saving between 1800 - 2000 per month.  Dealing with this student loan tax hurdle is going to be the next major financial event in our marriage, so I wanted to gain YOUR perspective.  

My wife currently has about 95k of student loans that are structured into an IBR plan, but she is not currently making payments since she has no income.  **After 25 years of payments IBR loans are forgiven/cancelled.**  We file separately so the IBR doesn't hit my income (Federal requirement), but since we live in a community property state, she absorbs half of my income and assets (this is OK with all parties per my accountant and my 36 months of experience).  Additionally, it's no problem to the lender--they make us file an addendum annually and have me file some paperwork stating that we live in a community property state and I am married to my wife.  

Since she has no income, she has made no payment, but we're concerned about the upcoming (21 years out) student loan tax bomb that everyone talks about. At her interest rates, it looks like she'll be forgiven 488k of loans **(assuming they compound daily and I am not screwing up the math).**  Just doing some napkin math, that's around 180k in Federal taxes, double the total loan amount today--or approximately a 2.78% interest rate compounding daily over 25 years.  

Would the optimal (albiet riskier) way to handle this tax event be to wait for student loan reform and just put 9k/year into CDs to cover the future cost of paying my tax bill?  Looking at some loan calculators, we could also pay about ~13k/yr for 10 years to pay them off based on the repayment terms.  Should I just treat this like paying taxes on a windfall?  Just at a loss for the best strategy for tackling this problem.  Thanks for any help you're able to give.

tl;dr: Wife has 95k of IBR loans, will be a forgiveness of 488k in 21 years.  How do we plan for 180k in taxes?",finance

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/I0nPBil.png)    Link to credit karma scores

Good afternoon everyone

I am debating refinancing my ~32k in private student loans. They are currently at Wells Fargo with a 7.99% rate for 15 years that I was told by family was an ""amazing deal"". 

Total cost is about ~57k overall, which is double my original principal before accrued interest.
My current credit score is around 650, with no ill marks other than a lack of history.
I've recently gotten a car loan ~12k, and have ~33k in federal loans with fairly decent (~5%, 10 year) rates, and got a credit card to help build credit as well (used smartly and will always be paid off on time).
Checking nerdwallet and a few other refinancing lenders doing loan estimates I seem to be hitting around 5.5% fixed interest on a 7 or 10 year loan.

Would it be expected for my credit to jump up soon now that I've started making payments (I've only made 1 months worth) enough that I could get a significantly better rate and would be better off waiting 3 to 6 months and refinancing then? Or any other ways that would be good to tackle this loan?

personalfinance,Optimal Way To Divide A Principal Payment On Two Separate Car Loans?,"Hello, I have two traditional 60-month car loans through USAA, for which the payments are set at a specific amount for the duration of the loan. These two loans are understandably for different loan amounts, different interest rates, different months remaining on each loan, etc.
 
I would like to make a principal payment on both/either loan as to negate some interest that I would otherwise have to pay over the course of paying the cars off with these monthly payments. I’d like to pay the optimal amount that reduces my interest-to-be-paid as much as possible.
 
One variable to consider is whether or not a principal payment affects how much interest I pay each month. I don’t know what happens traditionally. If I owe significantly less on a loan due to a principal payment, will my interest payments each month go down? Or do they remain the same?
 
**Obviously I may be misunderstanding the way that these loans work, so bear with me:**

* Loan 1 is for $13,650, with $12,200 remaining and 53/60 months remaining. The interest rate is 3.74%. The monthly payments are $250/mo.

* Loan 2 is for $9,175, with $8,765 remaining and 57/60 months remaining. The interest rate is 3.24%. The monthly payments are $165/mo.

Hypothetical A: I have $10,000 to divvy up between these loans. I use the “avalanche method” and pay $10,000 off of Loan 1. I end up at $2,200 remaining on Loan 1 and $8,765 remaining on Loan 2.

Hypothetical B: I have $10,000 to divvy up between these loans. I put $6,800 on Loan 1 and $3,200 on Loan 2. I end up at $5,400 remaining on Loan 1 and $5,565 remaining on Loan 2.
 
With Hypothetical A, I’m spending that 3.74% interest on a lower amount for Loan 1, but still have a lot of Loan 2 to pay off. With Hypothetical B, I have less interest to pay off on both loans, however Loan 1 has more than it would for Hypothetical A, so do I end up spending more on interest over time?
 
I hope my point is coming across here, **I’m simply trying to find out the perfect ratio of amount owed for both loans, where when both debts are settled, I will have payed the least amount of total interest.** Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,What saves more interest in the long run? Paying curtailments loan near the end of its term vs earlier in the loan schedule,"I’ve been looking into paying down debts, and looking at the amortization tables for a few loans has me scratching my head. 

I’ve always taken the approach of paying down/off loans with the highest interest rate first, but the way interest compounds over a long-term loan like a mortgage has me second-guessing that thought process.

My question is: what would save the most interest over time? Putting curtailment payments toward:

Loan with 6% interest rate, but only 18 months left on 72 month term so the payments are mostly principle compared to early in the payment schedule

OR

Mortgage with 4% interest rate, with 28 years left so the payments at this point are mostly interest instead of principle per the amortization schedule

Is there something to the compounding interest that’d make it better to put those funds toward the mortgage while it’s still early in the loan? Or am I totally overthinking this?",finance
personalfinance,I see the benefits of Roth IRA. What are the benefits of Traditional IRA vs Brokerage?,"I'm confused, can you all sanity check me?

Context:

1. I made 125k in NYC this year.
2. My effective tax rate is 34.5% if the online calculator I used is accurate.
3. I didn't have a retirement account through work for the entirety of 2019, so I am eligible to invest 6k into a traditional IRA.
4. This is a one time thing - My 401k begins in January for 2020.

Assumptions (please correct me if I'm wrong):

1. My effective tax rate is what matters. I assume that I am saving Federal, State, and City tax with a traditional IRA.
2. I anticipate being in the 22% income bracket upon retirement (40k-85k)
3. I am making the assumption no tax rates are being changed.

\---------------------------------------------------

* Scenario 1: 6k into taxable brokerage (total cost in pre-tax money = $9090, none returned in april)
   * Upon retirement my capital gains are taxed at 15% (for income of 40k-435k)
* Scenario 2: 6k into a Traditional IRA (total cost in pre-tax money up front = $9090, total returned in april $3030, effective cost $6k)
   * Upon retirement I will be taxed at a 22% ordinary income.
   * I can reinvest the $3030 tax return, but only into a taxable brokerage.

\------------------------------------------------------

Clearly with no re-investment of the $3030 tax savings, the traditional IRA is the clear loser being taxed at 22% ordinary income instead of 15% long term capital gains of a taxable brokerage. I assume the power of the traditional IRA will come from the reinvestment of the $3030 tax savings.

* At 4% return for 30 years the 6k initial investments for both accounts will grow to \~$19.5k
* Reinvesting the $3030 tax savings at 4% return for 29 years will grow to \~$9.5k (29 years because I have to wait for the tax return)

A taxable account will return $19.5k \* .85 = \~$16.6k

A traditional ira with no reinvestment will return ($19.5k \* .78) = \~$15.2k

A traditional ira with a one time reinvestment into a taxable brokerage in 2020 will return ($19.5k \* .78) + ($9.5\* .85) = \~$23.3k

personalfinance,Is it wise to sell my car in this case?,"When the transmission went on my paid-for truck four years ago, a lot of other things were wrong-ish with it, I was in a cash-poor financial spot, and it seemed to make more sense to get a no-money-down reliable used car which I financed over six years to keep the payment low (though the interest rate was high due to a history of financial sins). I kept the truck, and I worked on it a little bit at a time over the years as a hobby. The truck now runs again (I pulled the transmission down and had it rebuilt then put it back up again). Engine is in great shape, I replaced some ignition coils, o2 sensors, catalytic converter ... what I'm saying is I am confident the truck can run for another couple of years.

The car is a 2013 jetta with 78K miles, loan balance is $5200, KBB says it might be worth $6500 private party sale. Payment is $216 a month. Insurance is full coverage at like $70-ish a month. I should check that for sure. I have taken it to the dealer for all service, and it is current on all recalls. Tires are new-ish. Probably it will need brakes in the next six months.

I have done a lot of work to the truck, I like it tons, it suits my needs, and I can continue to maintain it myself as I go. Downside is it uses significantly more gas than the car.

Anyway, is it wise to sell the car and go with just the truck? If the car is ""worth more"" than the loan balance, then on paper I am ahead on the balance sheet if I keep it ... but it is a depreciating asset. I also have a goal of getting out of debt, so it would be cool to sell it and have that debt go away.

It would also be nice to get rid of the $216 payment and bring my insurance bill down a little. I could increase my savings rate. Though realistically I am sure I will spend money maintaining the truck, though at the same time I have been paying to maintain the car in good condition. I feel like I would be ahead monthly, still have a daily driver, and not have a debt to service.

I feel fortunate that I can afford the payment, and I have to admit I kind of like the security of having a totally functional car and the truck, but I kind of don't want to have to manage both. I like to keep things simple.

I think I want to sell the car, but I also don't want to make a mistake.

personalfinance,Working for a year and planing for a PhD,"Hi everyone! I'm new to personal finance and would like some advice/feedback on my future savings plans.

I finished undergrad over the summer and will a start a job next month. I plan on earning a PhD and assuming I get a fully funded offer I will attend school full time beginning in August or September of 2020. I have low expenses as of now and want to know how to best save my money. Since my income will drop significantly next year it doesn't seem wise to max out retirement and instead to just put the money in a a high yield savings account to ease the financial burden of grad school and avoid having to take out any more loans. Here is a breakdown of my projected cash flows for the next 7-8 months.

### Estimated Monthly Expenses and Income
| Name  |  Amount ($/mo.) |
|-------|----------|
| Before/After Tax Income  | (+) 4200/3400  |
|   Student Loans    | (-) 200    |
| Rent | (-) 300 |
| Gas | (-) 60 |
| Phone | (-) 40 |
| Food | (-) 200 |
| Misc | (-) 100 |

**Net Monthly Savings:** $3300 ($2500 after federal and state income tax)

### Future Plans

It's not a lot of money, but saving up ~$18k over the next several months might be meaningful when I'm living on a ~$1500 per month stipend with a presumably higher rent. This does not seem like the best time to start investing in anything risk bearing but rather my future personal health and needs. So, my plan is just to stash the money is savings account at ~2% and not touch it until I need it during school. Is this the best option for me?

### Student Loans

Lastly I wanted to touch on student loans. I have almost exactly $20,000 in direct student loans at ~4.6% about $2,000 of that is unsubsidized at 5.05% interest, and the rest is subsidized. Since my ultimate goal is to work in academia and my upcoming job is in the public sector I should be eligible for PSLF payments, but since my loan amount is on the lower end I won't end up having much forgiven. My payments don't start till February and I've been unemployed for the last 4 months. Should I apply for income based repayment or is that moot with my upcoming job? Should I bother paying off the unsubsidized loans before grad school?

personalfinance,Recovering from late student loan payments.,"-28 y/o
-Single
-75k/yr income


Hello, 

Long story short, I wasn’t very smart about my student loans for a short period of time and didn’t realize the massive impact they would have on my credit score if I made late payments. I accumulated “4 late payments” on my credit score rating. I’ve since brought my account to current, however,my account is still showing up as past due in credit karma despite the fact it’s current as of 10/31/2019. 75 of my 79 payments have been made on time.

I’m trying to figure out how to raise my score and/or possibly remove these late payments reported by FedLoan Servicing. Based on my research, it appears I have two options:

1. Good Will Letter 
2. Dispute the Late Payments

Option #1 is looking the most enticing since there’s nothing technically to dispute since I was indeed late on these payments? If I do write this letter, what kind of reasoning or rationale should I approach them with that would improve my chances of having them remove them? I technically haven’t really experienced any financial hardship but instead was just unwise.

Option #2 just seems like a waste of time and effort since I was indeed late on the payments and therefore there would be nothing to dispute.  The only thing I could see worth disputing is the fact that my account is still showing up as past due despite the fact it is not. I imagine this will change in the near future when FedLoan reports my new account info.

Another option I’ve contemplated is opening more accounts, with a couple more credit cards, that I can pay off every month so I can make more “on time monthly payments”. This would theoretically increase my ratio and mitigate the effect of the late payments from the student loans.

I’m currently driving an older vehicle (which I recently paid off) that will likely need expensive repairs and maintenance in the near future. I’d like to get rid of it and secure a vehicle that’s more reliable without the ridiculous interest that I’d likely have to pay with my current credit score of 530.

I’d like to get things sorted out in the next couple months. 

I appreciate your advice!",finance

I'd like to hedge my bets and contribute to both, but I like to understand the numbers first and I cannot find a clear explanation of how contributions are calculated anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

The 401k plan is through Fidelity.  They do not offer a dollar amount as an option for contributions, only a whole number percentage.  While annoying, this is still easy to calculate for the traditional plan but I don't understand how it works for Roth.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, lets say my salary is 100k and I choose to contribute 6% to traditional and 6% to Roth.  $6k per year would be put into the traditional account.  For the Roth though I'm lost.  Here are a couple ways I'd guess it works, maybe somebody can tell me which is correct or use one as a starting point so it's easier to explain.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1: 6% of my after tax income is put into the Roth account.  This means it's 6% of $94k (since $6k was taken pre-tax for the traditional account) minus my marginal rate.  If this is correct, are state and payroll taxes also deducted already or only federal income taxes?

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: $6000 minus taxes are put into the Roth account, ignoring the 6% pre-tax contribution to the traditional account.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: $6000 is put into the Roth account, reducing my take home pay by a lot more than 6%.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated.  I know I'm overthinking this and could just put 1% in and check on the next paycheck but I like to know where my money is going.

I have made a variety of bad financial choices due to a lack of responsibility, drug abuse, untreated mental health problems, and intervals of having and not having parental support. I also have $11.5k in credit card debt from purchases I made in the military during a manic phase.

&amp;#x200B;

I still have 5 full-time (\~16 credit) semesters left at my state school before I finish my degree. This upcoming spring semester and the summer following I will be on a co-op, so I will be working full-time and not paying any tuition. However, I am having trouble figuring out how I will pay my monthly credit card bill and private student loan payment while taking classes (the minimum payment for each is \~$300/month). My mother has very generously been paying my tuition and a handful of bills (e.g., cell phone, car insurance, occasional groceries) while I am in school after a long period of separation; she has done this for one year of music school and one semester of state school. 

&amp;#x200B;

My rent (\~$350 to $400/month), gas for my car (\~$120/month), utilities (\~$90/month), and misc. expenses (e.g., clothing, books, psych meds, therapy) I pay out of pocket and have been since community college via federal loans and working both full-time and part-time jobs depending if I'm taking classes. The best part-time jobs I have found in my area pay \~$12/hour, and while I used to work 25 to 35 hours/week, I now have cut down to 20/week to do well in school to avoid repeating any classes. Recently I have been getting \~$400 checks every two weeks after taxes, which will not be enough to cover all my expenses moving forward. I have been living paycheck to paycheck and have $200 in savings. For the last couple of years, my bank has given me a lowered interest rate and lower monthly payments via a debt management plan, and my student loan has been deferred (hardship) but still accruing interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

By January 2020, I will have reached the max time interval for both in-school and hardship deferments and the debt management plan. I have begged with both banks but to no avail. My mother has offered to split these bills with me, but she cannot afford to do this for all 5 semesters. I have tried to apply to transfer credit cards and loans for consolidating debt, but I have not been approved for the necessary limits even with my mother cosigning. I do not know what to do. I have been plagued with immense guilt, regret, and self-inflicted financial stress for years. I have had medical professionals advise me to not work full-time and try to finish my degree at the same time for my mental stability. I feel like a leech to my mother, and I want to not burden her with these expenses for any longer than I have to. I feel like I'm looking down the barrel of a gun I've loaded myself, and I am free to take any honest and constructive advice.",finance

personalfinance,Indirect Roll-over Snafu,"I have a question regarding rolling over retirement funds and I am hoping some of you brilliant people may be able to provide me some wisdom. Here is the details:

I worked for state govt MA for 2 years and paid into the retirnment fund there. I recently withdrew the money I paid into it when I came abroad the federal govt. I stupidly (I know now) elected for a refund of the retirement fund. My question is that if I complete an 'indirect-roll' meaning writing a check out from my own bank account in the full amount I was refunded and manually rolled it into retirement fund I currently have at federal government would I avoid the plethora of tax penalities I would face.

gaming,I didn't realize how much I missed Halo (MCC on PC impressions),"I've never been much of an XBox fan.  Not that I'm crazy about Sony, but I've just always preferred their stuff and I can't afford to have both.  But when *Halo: Combat Evolved* came out, I was crazy for it and sold my PS2 to get an XBox.  Over the years it became less and less viable to get an MS system just for Halo, as I tended to hold on to my hardware instead of selling it and online subscriptions became the norm.  So Halo 3 was the last game I played in the series.  I wasn't even sure I'd get the MCC right away, since it's $40 and I just spent a bunch of money.  Soooo glad I did!  


I was a bit miffed on launch day when I learned only *Reach* was available.  I've always heard good things and I planned on playing it, but my heart was set on revisiting *CE* day one.  Mostly because I'd prefer to work my way up from the least technically complex game, but also for nostalgia.  I somewhat reluctantly started the campaign...and wow it's like catching up with an old friend.  Sure it took some adjustment, to Halo's quirk's and this game's in particular.  But now three missions in I'm loving the ride!  And I'm glad it was with Reach, getting to know the squad and having companions on the bombastic missions has been great.",technology

personalfinance,New to credit cards: Installments and paying them off through CC.,"So, noob request: I just want to know how it works. I currently have a credit card that I pay for monthly (often in full but sometimes not, because of personal financial reasons, though I manage to pay off 80% of it, at least) and I've been meaning to buy a laptop through an installment and the bank offers 0% interest rate for a term of 18 months. 

I currently have a balance on my credit card. If I availed that installment plan now, how does the payment work? When you pay for your credit card bills before the statement close date, can you choose where will it go (to the installment or to the non-installment balance)? What are the best practices on paying your CC bills when you have an existing balance and an installment plan?

This would really help me out.",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing Risks?,"I currently have debts managed by Fed Loan Servicing and am considering refinancing to get a lower fixed interest rate.  This would be through a private institution and wondering if there are any risks moving the debt to a private institution?  E.g. if by the grace of god loand forgiveness actually ever became a thing, would I be stuck/ ineligible because I am financed through a private institution vs. Federal? I know that is a hypothetical but this is where my brain is going.  Hope this makes sense...  btw I'd be going from 5% fixed to 4.4% fixed

edit: I am aware that they run a credit check and my credit will take a temporary hit

edit 2:  yeah I’m not (or have a job that would be) eligible for PSLF and up to this point have been paying over the required amount because the amount of interest that accumulates gives me a lot of stress.  I was thinking along the lines of a progressive dem taking the WH and throwing the indebted a proverbial bone of sorts :). The other thing that is frustrating is that the FedLoan website is really awful and nothing feels transparent — I become paranoid that my money is being stolen because I can’t visualize the interest.  I think I may make a spreadsheet as it’s a sense of empowerment I’m really after.",finance
ROI,"Friends, Comrades, Countrymen: a dissertation on the upcoming election, based on Marc Antony's monologue in Shakespeare's Julius Ceasar.","Friends, Comrades, Countrymen, lend me your ears. Well, I just want to say a very yuuge hello, r/ROI. Great place folks, ok. It’s great to be here in the home of a group called the communists. You ever hear the r/ROI communists? By the way, they post in Discord. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there? This is incredible folks, ok. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving comrades, which is what you are. What you are ok.

Tonight, the people of r/ROI will head to the polls and you will vote to elect your terrific moderator, YmpetreDreamer. I’ve done folks, ok a fantastic job ok. I’ve done a fantastic job. And we’re sending a signal by doing that to r/Ireland, to the rest of Reddit, that the communists, you know what we stand for. But you see what’s happening folks, ok with the reactionaries, they have gone crazy. The do nothing reactionaries, and they’re not getting it done. Under communist leadership, the memeconomy is booming, shitposts are rising, confidence is soaring. r/ROI is thriving like never ever before, and the sub is stronger than ever before. True ok.

r/ROI’s unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our sub. That’s not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible mods, and the job that u/ProbablyCian and u/Worktemp have done as mods folks, ok, they’ve had to do some things that they had to do. And they’ve done unbelievably well. It sets them up to be a rocket ship in the future. They had to do it. So I just want to thank them for having the courage to do what they had to do. You have the best numbers you’ve ever had in the history of the sub. We’re supporting our police, we’re rebuilding our military, we’re defeating radical reactionary alts like never before. The troll known as Slygo is banned. ROI mods folks, ok gave the world’s number one troll a one way ticket to r/Ireland. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the r/ROI mods, which is now stronger than ever before. We’ve rebuilt it and it was all made in r/ROI. All made in r/ROI. And our sub is winning again, and our sub is highly respected again ok.

But while we are creating jobs and banning alts, the radical reactionaries are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out Marxism from the public square, and you know this, silence folks, ok you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody’s touching our Second Amendment. They’re after your Second Amendment. We can’t let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this. All you have to do is ask the boys from the Discord Mafia. Some of whom are here tonight ok.

The far right wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the sub, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but r/ROI will never be broken. r/ROI can’t be broken. You’re too strong and you’re too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the reactionaries are trying to tear our sub apart folks, ok. First, reactionaries engineer the Discord hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon users of r/ROI, the Russian hoax. Then they did the WeWinEuros scam. You remember that? The WeWinEuros scam. Months and they said nothing. And then Mr. WeWinEuros testified. That was a wonderful day for me.

You remember last week. I don’t know [/u/tzar-chasm](https://www.reddit.com/u/tzar-chasm/), but u/the_biscuit_monster said that [/u/tzar-chasm](https://www.reddit.com/u/tzar-chasm/) is a Russian agent. I don’t know [/u/Fantastipotomus](https://www.reddit.com/u/Fantastipotomus/). They’re a hippo and that’s fine. They’re a hippo, Fanta. But Fanta was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, [/u/DarthTempus](https://www.reddit.com/u/DarthTempus/) and [/u/tzar-chasm](https://www.reddit.com/u/tzar-chasm/), they are corrupt. And Darth, unlike r/ROI, which is doing great, Darth ought stop wasting time, go back to his district, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system folks, ok. What’s happened is there and what’s happened to so many other places run by the radical right reactionaries, it’s unbelievable.

So last week, think of this, in the history of our sub, it’s never done better. And by the way, that’s not rich, that’s not poor, that’s for everybody. Your 401(k)s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they’ve been running the 401(k)s for years. And they totally lost respect for let’s say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he’s a financial genius because he’s up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the reactionaries get in, that’s not going down by 50%, that’s going down to nothing. It’s going to be worthless. It’s going to be worthless.

You’ll have a depression the likes of which you’ve never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don’t have to even think about it folks, ok. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don’t forget, that was zero interest. We’re paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the reactionaries voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of comrades. To be exact 1.7k users, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the sub.

They’ve been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. It’s the fake news. Look at all of them. What they don’t know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they’re going crazy. Now they’re saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our sub. These people are crazy.

You have one nut job on television. He’s sitting down doing an interview recently. And he looks at the person he’s interviewing and he goes like he’s in total depression. Total depression. And he goes … Good fans up there. Thank you folks, ok. He goes, you know he’s going to win, don’t you? You know, he’s going to win. The guy goes, well, we’re going to fight and we’re going to … No, no. He’s going to win. You know he’s never leaving office, don’t you? He’s never going to leave office. These people are crazy. They’re crazy.

But that disgusting newspaper that’s right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach u/YmpetreDreamer has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle folks, ok, please. I don’t want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. He’s going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we’re 58 and 0, that’s a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that’s a good. We’re 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a u/YmpetreDreamer rally? Nothing can. With last week’s vote, the far left has declared war on socialist democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, communists are the most unified that I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been watching them and been a yuuge part of them for a long time. And the reactionaries have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they’re not going to win tonight folks, ok. So let’s see what can we do to win, but that’s not working too well. You’ll see. users of r/ROI are fed up with reactionary lies, hoaxes, slander. The reactionaries’ outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing reactionaries the hell out of office soon. Tonight, r/ROI has a chance to send the radical reactionaries a message. You will vote to reject reactionary extremism, McCartyism and corruption, and you will vote to elect u/Niart who’s done a great job. Niart’s a veteran. He’s a patriot. He’s done it all. He’s been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he’s done is incredible. Under his leadership, r/ROI has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it’s okay.

Look, he’s such a pain, when he needs something for r/ROI like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now folks, ok that are coming into r/ROI. Could you call the head of Some company in r/Ireland, please? I say, “Niart, do I have to do it?” Please, please. But isn’t that really what you wanted in a mod? That’s what you want. He’s such a pain in the ass, but that’s what you want. And the job he’s done, one of the best in the sub. Not the best. He’s been incredible. Niart is strong on spam and tough on alts. Thank you. He’s pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment.

By the way, you’re going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in reactionaries. You think I’m kidding? I see what they’re saying. I watch what they’re doing. They’re calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon … I’m telling you. As sure as you’re standing here, is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you’ve been standing. Nobody sat? I don’t know. Isn’t that exciting? Nobody sat. You know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, u/YmpetreDreamer only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don’t say the second part. It’s great. Great spirit.

You know why? You love our sub. And you see what’s happening. We have turned this yuuge monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, it’s like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our sub, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I’m going to count but I think it’s like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today folks, ok. I think about 100 … I’m going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I’m off by half a point. If it’s 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didn’t tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. That’s incredible.

But u/kayeastbay has made record investments in education spending for r/ROI students. Education is so important to him. Kay will defend your r/ROI values. She loves her sub. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme right. Not good. I can’t even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme right? This guy, u/DarthTempus, is a major righty. You know that, right? Why are we even … Let’s just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tonight, Kay? I don’t know. How does r/ROI vote for a person …

How about this guy? How about u/[/u/Fantastipotomus](https://www.reddit.com/u/Fantastipotomus/). I call him Freaky Fanta okay. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the sub. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new moderator, a good guy, repeats it, ok. I said, “I never said that.” He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven’t heard about the whistleblower after that folks, ok, have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things, ok,  that were so good folks, you’re going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, Freaky Fanta. But Kay’s running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they’re dangerous.

The radical right named [/u/tzar-chasm](https://www.reddit.com/u/tzar-chasm/), who rejects everything r/ROI stands for. That’s who they want to win. Tzar has openly pledged to stop the policies of u/YmpetreDreamer. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They’re not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren’t leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let’s do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, “u/PublicModLogs, let’s give it a shot.” And then, one by one, we were doing good.

And what we’ve done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving r/ROI, they were leaving, they will go into r/Ireland. They were going to r/CasualIreland folks, ok, r/IrishProblems. They were going all over. Any place but r/ROI. You don’t read about that at all. Now they’re all coming back. They’re all coming back. But Tzar wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of r/ROI. The greatest economy you’ve ever had, he’s going to destroy it. And it won’t be long. It’ll go very quickly. You know, you’re all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You don’t like it, you go find another job. It’s like the choice I got from military.

I got you choice too. If you don’t like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don’t like this guy folks, ok. You go get a better job for more money. Tzar doesn’t represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he’s backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Tzar supported crooked Darth

So we’re also joined tonight by a very powerful man in r/ROI, your great mod Cian. Nobody works harder for r/ROI than Cian. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It’s up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart.

Thank you very much, Cian. Great job. He’s a warrior. He’s a warrior, I’ve always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we’ll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors.

You know, in one thread, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your mods, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, communists hadn’t won elections in many, many years. She called, “Could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please?” I said, “All right, this is the last one.” “No, no, no. How about a couple of more?” And then Biscuit Monster actually told Fanta, “You better get going, something’s going on in the election. You’re going to lose. You better start going.” “No, no, no. The polls say everything’s good.” And we won for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the communist Party Chair, head of the mods folks, ok, I said

But think of it, we’re one day short of a year now. Can you believe it? Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they’re all out of business. They know that. That’s why I think that we will get … I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post.

You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, “I’m going to become a politician. I can’t believe it. I’m going to become a politician.” But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories … In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it’s like, “Why are they not covering me anymore?” And they’re all bad folks, ok.

They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn’t give me any credit. That’s okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House.

But they’ll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off folks, ok. Their red light just went off. See how it is ok? Well, it’s hard. Look ok, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know they’re ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I can’t blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN’s position. Without us … You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. It’s not me, it’s we ok. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they’re still trying to figure out, “Where the hell did all those people come from?” It’s true.

A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great moderator friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, “You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I’ve been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, I’ve never seen so many people vote.” And these are people, they love our sub, they’re incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn’t vote ok. Sounds terrible. But they didn’t like anything that they saw folks, ok.

They say, “Sir, I’m seeing people,” and he said this, “come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they’ve never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor.” He said, “I can’t speak for the rest of the sub, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you’re going to have the greatest victory in the history of our sub.” And that’s what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also folks, ok.

Tomorrow you must elect the entire communist ticket, from governor on down folks, ok, including your next mods, [/u/kirkbadaz](https://www.reddit.com/u/kirkbadaz/). Kirk. Great, Kirk ok. You’re a good man folks, ok .

Good. That’s good. Thank you, Kirk. Thank you, Kirk. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born? Thank you, Kirk. Great. You’re next mod, Michael Adams. Thanks, kirk.

With the help of everyone here, r/ROI is the hottest economy anywhere in the world folks, ok, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, “Congratulations on your economy.” r/Ireland's doing poorly, as you know, but they’re paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they’ve never given us 10 cents before. Billions of dollars folks, ok. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. They’re back buying from our farmers.

But we’ve created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million comrades are now employed, the highest level of employment in our sub’s history. African socialist unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our sub. Hispanic socialist and Asian socialist unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows ok. The history of our sub. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election folks, ok. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, “How the hell can you lose 60,000?” It turned out to be right. And you know how I know? Because I’ve been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. It’s true, two years.

I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, “Sir! Sir, we have an emergency.” “What’s the emergency?” “Somebody’s calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front page story.” Okay.

Under my administration, we’ve added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our sub. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed yuuge tax cuts, yuuge. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor folks, ok. I don’t think … Well, I don’t know. You know? He’s not going to do so well. He’ll be calling for a meeting, and I won’t be able to see him because I don’t like him very much. But I like this one very much, and we’re going to help him.

We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on socialist energy. We’re now the yuugest producer of energy anywhere in the world ok. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of r/ROI from the horrible, costly ok, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they’re doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama’s federal coal moratorium. We’re putting our great miners back to work folks, ok.

On trade, we’re starting to set records every week ok, we’re reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as r/Ireland looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of socialist dollars. By the way, people can’t even believe it ok. Not 500 million. That’s a lot. If you lost 500 million folks, ok, that’s a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt r/Ireland. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give r/Ireland. What I don’t give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don’t give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we’re taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars.

Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe … Biden that is, said of r/Ireland's piracy and plunder, “They’re not that bad, folks.” He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks ok. “Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave.” No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they’re handlers, like they use on horses, they’re handlers, right? “All right, get him off now. He’s been up there long enough.” So they’re screaming, “Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you’re doing fine. Joe, you’re doing fine. You’re doing fine.” And then he goes, “I love being in Ohio,” but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, “Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage.”

But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about r/Ireland ok, “They’re not that bad, folks. They’re not really competition for us. No, they’re not.” 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I’m here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I’m here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up ok. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that folks, ok.

Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from r/Ireland, I got to tell you, I’ve been negotiating with r/Ireland, they’re very tough folks, ok.

r/Ireland ok. I got to tell you, I’ve been negotiating with r/Ireland. They’re very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I’ve been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. He’ll make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. moderator, would you please take over the negotiations that u/YmpetreDreamer is no longer handling ok? Guess what? You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we’re so close. r/Ireland wants to make a deal so badly. I think they’d love to see another moderator. They would like to see another moderator more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what r/Ireland would love more than anything else folks, ok. It’s not going to happen folks, because we can’t let our sub go back to hell. We can’t do it. We can’t let it happen ok.

And we’re more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that’s what we’re doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there’s no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Let’s face it folks, ok. These are bad people. This part isn't a joke: I'm going to ban everyone I disagree with if I get elected, I'm going to turn this into a communist sub, me and the rest of the discord mafia have been planning this for weeks, fuck you. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a sub that didn’t want to do anything with us. And I’ll tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. That’s why they did, they targeted our farmers.

I said, congratulations. That’s compliments of r/Ireland. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That’s the way it is. Because we’re doing very well right now with r/Ireland. We’re replacing the NAFTA disaster ok with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A yuuge win for r/ROI farmers, for r/ROI auto workers ok, for r/ROI manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing reactionaries don’t want to give the people of our sub a victory. It’s really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I don’t care. It’s such an incredible deal folks, ok for this sub, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. reactionaries need to pass the r/ROI MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you can’t pass it. And it’s up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she’s too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess.

They decimated socialist manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you it’s good. I was a very good student ok. I’m a very like, we’re all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in r/ROI can somebody be so precise folks, ok. You’re right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy subs, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other sub’s militaries, but it’s coming down. And I’m telling other countries, I’m sorry, you’re going to have to pay now. I’m sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay.

And they poured precious socialist blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, we’ll bring it in. And we’re bringing 5g into places like r/ROI that haven’t been properly served. We’re bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the sub. And we’re really ahead of schedule. We’re doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we’re doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet we’re investing billions and billions of dollars in places you’ve never even heard of. Doesn’t make sense folks, ok, does it?

But after years of rebuilding other subs folks, ok, we are finally rebuilding our sub ok. We are finally putting r/ROI first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. That’s why we ended the Paris Accord. That’s why… We’ve ended a lot ok. I don’t even want to tell you. But the sellout of the socialist sub ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that.

reactionaries are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The reactionary’s planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our sub’s seniors. It’s going to be protected. What they’re doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians ok. How about that? Preexisting physicians. First time I’ve ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you don’t get your own doctor. You know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That’s what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, doc? I don’t think so.

 Oh and by the way folks, I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him ok. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones; So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious: If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest– For Brutus is an honourable man; So are they all, all honourable men– Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me: But Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept: Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; And, sure, he is an honourable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause: What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him? O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason. Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. Ok folks.

Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor’s help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in r/ROI, which is a record. reactionaries have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith folks, ok. Anybody in here a person of faith? Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And u/YmpetreDreamer is a subal leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together we’re fighting for socialist orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And he’s done a fantastic job.

I withdrew our sub from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. It’s not the same sub. When I came in that sub, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it ok. And now they’re a little different, a little different. We’ll see what happens with Iran. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for r/ROI. Remember? He’d go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldn’t apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a moderator who is standing up for r/ROI, and we are standing up for the people of r/ROI. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this folks, ok.

Look, maybe you’ll be late for work. Maybe you’ll be late for whatever. I don’t want to know everything. Some things I don’t want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It’s so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it’s so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you’ve never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. You’ve never done this well, but you’re sending that yuuge message to the rest of the sub. It’s so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Here’s the story ok. If you win, they’re going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, they’re going to say, u/YmpetreDreamer suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest.

You can’t let that happen to me. And you know what? You can’t let that happen to your incredible state, r/ROI. You can’t let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you’d be losing an incredible governor. But you’re going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt reactionaries that users of r/ROI are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for u/YmpetreDreamer and all of these great communists. With your help, we will lift millions more of our users from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a communist mod panel ok.

Tonight, we’re going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And don’t forget. Out of 194, we got 194 ok, not one communist left us last week. And two communists, think of that. And the other three couldn’t get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you can’t do that. Airport problems. But then we had the reactionaries. We picked up two reactionaries, so we had bipartisan support. That’s unusual ok.

I always say because they’re lousy politicians, they’ve got lousy policy, but they do stick together. That’s about it. We will elect a communist mod panel tonight. And we’ll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin ok. We’re going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We’ll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words “made in r/ROI”. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in r/ROI within less than 10 years. We’ve already started. Who would have felt we could have done that? We’ve started.

In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done ok. They didn’t do anything. They didn’t do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this sub. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made folks, ok. It’s incredible what they’re doing ok. And don’t forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who’s terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success.

Unbelievable. Right to try folks, ok. We will chart a new era of discovery in space ok, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said we’ve done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that’s what we’re doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. It’s moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values ok that bind us together as one r/ROI. We support, protect and defend the constitution of r/ROI. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement folks, ok.

We believe that faith and family, not government ok and bureaucracy, are the true socialist way. We believe that children should be taught to love our sub, honour our history, and always respect our great socialist flag. Loyal users like you helped build this sub, and together we are taking back our sub folks, ok. We are returning power to you, users of r/ROI. The great state of r/ROI was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger folks, ok to build a life and to build a home. They didn’t have a lot of money. They didn’t have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their sub and they love their Marx.

These proud r/ROI Patriots ok did not shed their blood, sweat and tears folks, ok so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our sub. Our loyalty is to our users. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious sub under Marx folks, ok. r/ROI is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of r/ROI, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make r/ROI wealthy again. We will make r/ROI strong again. We will make r/ROI proud again. We will make r/ROI safe again. And we will make r/ROI great again. Thank you, r/ROI. Thank you. Go out and vote. Vote for u/YmpetreDreamer.",finance

However, one that I do have is from the US government (a federal agency). I don't particularly have an any ethical qualms about the job (well, mostly since I don't know anything about it yet) but some of my data scientist friends say that federal agencies are 5 years behind on cuture and 10 years behind on tech, and people don't really develop their skills as much there because the priorities are different, so it's not really a good job to get if you plan on changing to working for a tech company later. However some disagreed, saying that the experience with the huge data sets you can only really find in government is valuable and that some tech companies like to have DS's with a variety of different backgrounds.

personalfinance,Is my taxable income as low as I think it is?,"Hi everybody.

With annual enrollment for benefits coming up, my roommate planning on leaving etc I've been thinking about expenses a lot more than usual lately. I had a shower thought and I'm looking to confirm my general thinking.

I'm coming off disability after getting a job with the Federal government. My SSDI payments are around $1195/month and set to end 1 year after I started work (so spring 2020). If I remember correctly SSDI isnt taxed as a young person on disability. (I've had SSDI for years- I'm fairly certain it isnt taxed, just not 100% certain.)

 I gained access to the TSP and decided since I had SSDI for a while I would take advantage of it, and set my paychecks up to contribute $500/paycheck to TSP ($1,000/month)

My salary is around $30,400. The standard deduction is $12,000  and TSP contributions will add up to around 7-8,000 for 2019. does that mean my taxable income from work will be around $10-12k?",finance
personalfinance,"Student loan debt and it seems impossible to escape, barring miracles.","I'm 27 years old and I took out a little over $100k in private loans for college, which I'm sure is all too commonly heard. I went to college for about 6 years due to inability to perform off and on for mental health reasons, and ended up not being able to finish my degree. I had only a few credits left but the private lender denied my request on the last semester and left me with the only option of moving back home with my parents, with 6 years of experience in schooling but no degree. I've been back here for a year now and I've been using forbearance to try and save up money to have money saved back in case of an emergency, but once the forbearance ran out, it ate through my reserves within a few months before I could get a better job.

Currently, I'm making about $26,000/year, living with my parents in Alabama and paying almost no bills, just a cell phone bill and my own gas, which I have budgeted the best I can. I've spoken with the companies and the best I've got is having me pay about $1500/month, which leaves me at about $400/month left over that get divided into the cell phone, which is $80/month, and the gas, which is a about $60/month, meaning I end up with just barely over $200 of excess per month. This sounds doable, if destitute in terms of overall living, but this is not actually reducing my loans by a significant amount, either. Additionally, any emergency cleans out my left over money for that month and the next if it's bad enough, regardless of how frugal I've been throughout the month.

If I've done the math correctly, with the interest rate at 9%, for my loan amount and monthly payment, I'm essentially paying only ~$500 off each month, no? Which is a few decades of payments, including improved income. This leaves me essentially stuck where I am with no ability to leave my parents house on my own, and no way to progress forward other than in my job through promotions and raises, which I won't see any real fruits of until I'm into my 30s.

Is there any way to work things to make this doable? Do I just have to grind out the bare minimum until I get enough raises and promotions to handle more later on? I feel like I've been limited by what I can and can't do for the rest of my life because of 18 year old me being told college was necessary and not having better self-awareness until too late. I can expand on any information if needed, I'm not exactly sure what all would help, but I greatly appreciate anyone who attempts to help in any case.",finance

personalfinance,401(k) loan payback without penalties question - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,"The TCJA of 2017 changed rules regarding 401k loan payback after leaving a company. Excerpt of the the changes:

""When retirement plan participants leave a job with an outstanding loan balance in their workplace retirement plan, the loan balance will be offset against their account balance and be deemed a taxable distribution, unless they repay it in full. Under prior law, if a participant took a distribution without paying off the loan, the participant had 60 days to roll over the loan offset amount to another qualified plan or an IRA to avoid federal income taxes and penalties — a challenge for many individuals. Under the new tax bill, this time frame has been extended to the due date for the individual’s federal income tax return (including extensions), a clear benefit to the individual responsible for repaying the loan. This provision is intended to decrease the likelihood that departing employees will default on their loans because they are unable to raise the funds to repay them in a short amount of time and, in turn, help keep more of their money invested for retirement.""

One particular site mentioned that this only applied to loans taken after 2018 however I could find no other site that referenced this in any way. As far as I can tell it only matters when you take the disbursement, not when the loan was initiated. Anyone have info contrary to this?

Secondly, assuming one were to leave their job in August of 2019, if they filed an extension for their taxes in 2020, they would have to have paid back the loan into an IRA or qualifying account before October of 2020 (month the extension goes to). 

Assuming this person switches jobs, rolls over their remaining 401k balance into their company's new plan, how does one pay back the loan balance exactly? Assume they get a home equity loan or somehow manage to gather the cash for it, wouldn't 401k max contribution rules apply somehow? Or is there special exception made for this sort of situation? Can you just 'write a check' to your new 401k plan with the remaining loan balance? 

One article about this says the following: ""You’ll see a 1099-R each for your pre-tax, Roth, and Rollover distributions which will include your loan balance and those will need to become a part of your Form 1140.  At least now there will be a line item for you to announce your repayments to the IRA and directly offset these taxable amounts."" but it's unclear how this is actually done, assuming you had cash in hand at some point. 

And finally, the easiest thing would probably be to see if the new 401k plan could 'roll over' the loan as well as the remaining 401k balance. Do some companies offer this? Is it common, rare, or unheard of? Would be pretty nice if this could be the case.

personalfinance,"About to graduate college, joining Navy, and need advice","I (21M) am about to graduate college in a few weeks, and I will commission as an officer in the US Navy in late January. I figure I should start getting things squared away financially so I've been doing some reading the past week (here, r/MilitaryFinance, other places), but honestly I'm just pretty confused.

About Me:

- Have ~$35k in a savings account with a credit union nearby (also have a checking account, but never really put money in there). I have a credit card and debit card, but honestly just use the credit card for everything, then transfer money at the end of the month from savings to the card.
- No debt (no student or auto debt, etc.). I typically spend ~$400 with my credit card each month, and have ~$660/month directly transferred out of my savings account for rent and phone bill.
- Own a car, pretty reliable. 2007 Ford with a good number of miles.
- As of next month, I will be making $3190/month (base pay, taxed) plus $2430/month (BAH/BAS, untaxed). This means $67440/year without factoring in taxes. Since I'm military, I have Tricare and don't need to worry about health insurance.

I will be working in Washington DC, and my current credit union doesn't have any branches nearby so I was thinking about switching. Navy Federal has a pretty solid presence in the area and has pretty good reviews, but their savings accounts have pretty low interest (.25%). Also, I'm thinking about getting a new credit card/cards since my current card has no cash back and no real rewards. I pretty lost right now so I have some questions:

- Should I switch to Navy Federal and just throw everything in a savings account for now? I know there are HYSA available with other banks, but there's got to be a reason a lot of military people use mostly NFCU, right?
- If there are better banking options, what are they?
- What kind of credit cards should I be looking at? I'm pretty confident I won't carry over a balance pretty much ever. NFCU has several such as their MoreRewards Amex card or their Visa Signature Flagship card. I know there are other popular cards like CSR or Amex Platinum (and their annual fees are waived for military), but (1) would I even qualify for them, (2) are they worth it for me, and (3) can I get them without opening accounts with Chase, etc?
- I would qualify for USAA, so I'm thinking of going with them for car insurance because I've heard they're pretty easy to work with. Any major reasons I shouldn't?

Sorry if these are common or dumb questions, and feel free to give other advice as well. Thanks!",finance

I have $40k in unsecured credit card debt across 3 cards with interest rates between 13-30%, all basically maxed out now.


I have a $105k mortgage on my 1350sqft condo, and have paid it down to $88k. 3 beds, 3 baths, small backyard, new kitchen and remodled garage. I bought it on short sale because it was literally full of garbage and had no doors, no a/c,  missing drywall in the garage and several parts of the house. All the light fixtures and appliances were missing too. I have rectified all that.


It appraised on purchase at $108k, because of all the problems. All the other units of similar floor plans in this complex sell for between $185-$225k, but they have more updated, fancier remodels. I like the simple design and spiral staircase, but apparently the rest of the world hates them. I still live here, so it's  also a little messy.


I have gotten to a place with my credit cards and budget that is...not sustainable. Lacking other options, I applied for a HELOC. Got approved with a variable rate of 4.25% and a 10 year draw period, 20 year payoff period. I would have minimum payments of about $170 (obvs I would pay way more) where as I'm currently paying $1300-$1500 a month in credit cards alone.


My intention is to have the bank send the funds directly to the ccs, and then shred the cards, but not close the accounts so I can work on getting back to an 800 credit score from low 700 where it is now.


Of the $1300-1500 I would no longer be paying in CCs, I was  planning to send a total of $700 a month to the HELOC (whatever amount over minimum to be applied directly to principal) and use the other $600 I'd be saving to actually start and build a savings account. Then work on 6 months emergency fund. Then to increase my 401k contributions to max, and work on throwing all available funds at the HELOC to pay it off and then roll that payment to the Mortgage to pay it off sooner.


I know I also need to work on my spending habits that got me into the CC mess, and I have an appt on Tuesday to talk to a financial planner. Also going to snag YNAB to help me.


I'm more than a little freaking out right now because there are a handful of smallish issues that I know I'll get dinged for on the appraisal, which is Tuesday, but it's stuff I can't fix because of -$150 cash balance atm. 


If the condo doesn't get appraised at $165k, the bank won't be able to give me the full $40k I need.


If they can't loan me the money, then I am basically destitute. Will probably have to sell the condo (which I love DEARLY) and go back to renting, which is hard with a large dog and 3 cats.


Prolly I gave too much info, but I don't know what is not enough info.


Can anyone tell me if this HELOC and my subsequent plan (assuming it comes though with the appraisal value I need) is a decent idea? Or at least not a BAD idea??


I want to hang on to the condo for a few more years because the area I'm in is REALLY developing up. Fingers crossed that property will appreciate in value more, and that I'll make a few more badass updates once I have savings and healthier spending habits.


Sorry for kinda panicky wall of text. I'm desperate for  feedback because the appraisal is for Tuesday, and they're talking about closing on the HELOC and disbursing funds before the holidays.


Also apologize if formatting is bad. I'm on mobile.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Payoff Question,"Long time lurker, first time posting. Let me start of by saying thank you to this subreddit community. I started with a student loan balance of of $134k (average interest rate of the four loans was 6.2 %). Three years ago I made my first payment of $800 on my student loan. I was so financially illiterate that I called the help desk when I saw that $650 of this payment went to interest because I thought that it must have been an error. I found this subreddit and it changed my perception on debt and planning for my financial future.

I lived well below my means (65%+ of my income went to these loans), paid down the higher interest rate loans first and controlled my expenses using many strategies on here. This Friday, three years to the day I made that first payment, I will have enough to pay off my loan plus an emergency fund. I have been paying in large chunks of about $10k every few months.

I am planning on buying a house in a year when my current lease ends, and a thought occurred to me, how would this affect my credit score? I want to make sure to get the best interest rate on a home loan (and hopefully save up enough this year to avoid PMI!). My current credit score is 801.

This is my oldest line of credit by far, so the question I have is would it be wise to pay it down to a point where it is barely generating interest (maybe down to 2k) and pay the minimum payment of $170 for 12-14 months? This would pay it off in full shortly after getting a home loan. Or just say to hell with it and pay it off?",finance

personalfinance,Looking at new/used Hyundai’s and need opinions,"So right now I’m making around 50k a year. 21 years old.

I just totaled my car and now I’m looking for a replacement and the Elantras seem like the best choice. 

Another issue is my credit took a dip after being unemployed. It was 640, dipped to 580. My rents car won’t last much longer and I need a replacement. Though I did make payments on my credit card, and if the simulators on Experian are accurate I should be back up to 640 at least when my statements go out.

So either way I’m not getting the best interest rates, I’m hoping to be able to refinance a few months down the line once my credit considerably improves.

So I’ve settled on the Elantra being the best choice. Good prices and very reliable. I can get one new for 16k-18k right now with lower interest, or get a 2017 used used with 30k miles for about 13k. Though the used one will have more interest.

I will be financing the majority of the vehicle, though I plan on getting a 48-60 month loan and paying much more than the initial payment to best interest and get it in a good place to refinance later. I’m also expecting a 5k tax return that I will put towards it. 

I pretty much just want backup camera and heated seats if possible, but for the most part I’m interested in the safety features (I have a son and never want to risk him getting hurt in an accident again). I’m also planning on driving it as long as humanly possible. 

So is it reasonable to get a new Elantra if it’s only a few thousand more? Having a full length warranty would be nice for me, I’m horrible with cars. Plus the difference in interest paid can be quite sizable. 

And before people say to buy some old cheap car(cheaper than the used Elantra anyways)again I like the newer safety features out these days.

For reference the interest I expect right now is 11% on new and 13-16% on used. Only reason I am choosing longer term loans is in case I face hardship I can make the minimum. But as long as I have a job I plan on getting it paid off within a year or two (unless I get an amazing rate refinancing)",finance

&amp;#x200B;

 

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren is drafting a bill that would call on  regulators to retroactively review about two decades of “mega mergers”  and ban such deals going forward.

Warren’s  staff recently circulated a proposal for sweeping anti-monopoly  legislation, which would deliver on a presidential campaign promise to  check the power of Big Tech and other industries. Although the Trump  administration is currently exploring their own antitrust probes, the  proposal is likely to face resistance from lawmakers.

 

According to a draft of the bill reviewed by Bloomberg, the proposal  would expand antitrust law beyond the so-called consumer welfare  standard, an approach that has driven antitrust policy since the 1970s.  Under the current framework, the federal government evaluates mergers  primarily based on potential harm to consumers through higher prices or  decreased quality. The new bill would direct the government to also  consider the impact on entrepreneurs, innovation, privacy and workers.

Warren’s bill, tentatively titled the Anti-Monopoly and  Competition Restoration Act, would also ban non-compete and no-poaching  agreements for workers and protect the rights of gig economy workers,  such as drivers for [Uber Technologies Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/UBER:US), to organize.

A draft of Warren’s bill was included in an email Monday from  Spencer Waller, the director of the Institute for Consumer Antitrust  Studies at Loyola University Chicago. Waller urged fellow academics to  sign a petition supporting it. He said Warren was working on the bill  with Representative David Cicilline, the most prominent voice on  antitrust issues in the House. Waller declined to comment on the email.

Representatives for Cicilline and Warren declined to comment. The existence of the bill and Warren’s support of it were [reported earlier](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/129fbf) this week by the technology publication the Information.

In  Washington, there is some support across the political spectrum for  increased antitrust scrutiny of large technology companies. Warren  positioned herself as a leader on the issue this year while campaigning  on a plan to break up Big Tech. She has repeatedly called for unwinding [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US)’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, along with Google’s purchase of YouTube and advertising platform DoubleClick.

  

It’s not clear when a bill would be introduced or whether it  would move forward in its current form. Cicilline has said he would not  introduce antitrust legislation until he concludes an antitrust  investigation for the House Judiciary Committee in early 2020.

 

Amy Klobuchar, a Senator from Minnesota who’s also vying for the  Democratic nomination, has pushed legislation covering similar ground.  Klobuchar plans to introduce additional antitrust legislation soon,  according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn’t authorized to  discuss the plans and asked not to be identified.

Any proposal would face significant hurdles to becoming law,  and Warren’s version could be particularly problematic because it  promotes the idea that antitrust enforcement is equivalent to being  against big business, said Barak Orbach, a law professor at the  University of Arizona who received a draft of the bill. “The way I read  it is that Elizabeth Warren is trying to make a political statement in  the course of her campaign,” Orbach said. “It’s likely to have negative  effects on antitrust enforcement, so I just don’t see the upside other  than for the campaign.”

The bill proposes a ban on mergers where one company has annual revenue of more $40 billion, or where both companies have sales exceeding $15 billion,  except under certain exceptions, such as when a company is in immediate  danger of insolvency. That would seemingly put a freeze on many  acquisitions for [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US), [Alphabet Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US), Facebook, [Microsoft Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US) and dozens of other companies. The bill would also place new limitations on smaller mergers.

Chris  Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University, said the  proposal would serve as an effective check on corporate power. “I don’t  think you’ll have new antitrust policy until Congress says the courts  have incorrectly interpreted the statutes,” he said. “Someone has to do  what Elizabeth Warren is doing.”",finance

I am back again (not that I’m sure anyone remembers me). I was recently promoted to management within my company (an offer that I accepted thanks to you all!)

Now that I’ve been promoted I’m finally going to get my first bonus of any size this year. At 103K per year now, the 3% bonus calculates out to $3,090

My boss told me to temper my expectations, however.

First and foremost, she advised that I should pause my retirement contributions so that my bonus doesn’t get hit with that (bonuses are to be ENJOYED she says)

Secondly, she said not to get too excited as they get ravaged by taxes.  Brief googling seems to indicate the feds will take 22-25% and then Massachusetts will take 5.7%. She said however, in her experience that’s she’s used to seeing 50%, but that could just be anecdotal/faulty/pessimistic memory?

That said, the two questions are such:

1) Should I pause retirement contributions? Namely, are there any implications for doing so that I’m not currently thinking of?

2) What percentage should I expect to see? The 50% of $1545? Or 30% of $2,163? Or something in between?

personalfinance,Looking for advice for paying down student debt.,"I am looking for some advice for paying down my student debt. I have a couple of strategies that I have implemented over the last 2 years and am struggling with how to go from here as it feels like the last 2 years of paying them down haven’t left me with a solid savings. 

I left college in September 2016 and began making payments on my loans in January 2017. My original balance was just under 50k. This was a mix of federal loans and a private loan I had agreed to pay back to my mom. As of today, my balance on the loans is just under 25k.  (Moms loan was refinanced in my name at a lower rate) 

The highest interest rate on any loan is 4.99% for an approximate 7k balance. The other loans range from 1.5k to 4.5k with interest rates between 3.0% and 4.1%. 

From January 2020 onward, I am trying to decide if I should make my minimum payment of $510 for approximately 4 years until they are paid off or use the avalanche approach and pay $1000 dollars and be done in approximately 2 years. The total paid interest in each approach is $2400 vs $1100. 

I make 78k per year before taxes and have pretty modest rent($700) for Chicago. This is my only debt. I am currently creating an emergency fund for myself but would like to begin saving for an engagement ring, car, and eventually a house. Which approach of the two above make the most sense? One leaves me with more money every month but would probably carry the debt into my engagement while the other makes it more difficult to plan and save for the future. 

Additional info: I save 11% into Roth 401k through work currently and contribute to my HSA. 

TLDR: pay $1000 or $510 per month to payoff debt in 2 years or 4ish years.",finance

Bitcoin,Erosion of fiat,"Just sharing a thought I’ve had after diving into hours of podcasts, articles, blogs, etc.

It seems that there is prevailing thought amongst bitcoiners that bitcoin could eventually overtake the U.S. dollar as the worlds reserve currency. The main argument for this is that every time the Fed goes to print more money, the dollars currently in circulation have less value. Eventually, there’ll be a tipping point where the U.S. dollar won’t hold the type of strength it does in today’s world economy. Then, we will usher in bitcoin as a replacement. (I think there will be about a million twists and turns before that actually occurs but keeping this simple so I can get to my point.)

While I agree that the dollar is debased every time new money is introduced to the market, one thing that gets missed is that this is occurring on a global level. All of the worlds major economies have experimented with quantitative easing to some extent and most of them have deployed it more aggressively than the U.S. Relatively speaking, the U.S. should be able to retain its strength compared to other fiat currencies because of this. As a result, I think the timeframe for bitcoin to emerge as a true threat to the U.S. dollar is decades away, if it ever occurs.

personalfinance,"I took out a $32,000 loan for home improvements today. Help me see what I might be missing about why this is a bad idea.","I make about $135,000 in a long-term salaried role with a large company. My mortgage is $2100. I have no student loans, no credit card debt, no car debt. No debt except for the house, and now this loan. I'm 28, my wife is 27. She makes ~$15k/year intermittently watching kids.

Over the past two years, we've spent a significant amount of money on renovating a home here in the Seattle area. We got the house for $375k which is FAR below the average cost here, but it needed a lot of work. We've been able to do all of that out of pocket, but there are just two more big pieces here that need doing; the driveway needs repaving ($12,500) and the back deck, which is a crumbling, splintery safety hazard, needs to be rebuilt ($19,500). It's a huge second-level deck. We're going with high-grade products; we expect to stay in this home forever.

Are these things immediate emergencies? No. The deck more so than the driveway, but I don't HAVE to do them right now. I just want them done. The mental and physical energy involved in constantly working on this renno is exhausting, and frankly it just seems like we can afford it. We have about $120k of equity in the home, so in an emergency we could sell it. We could also cover it with a 401k draw in an emergency as well. We're Maxing out our 401k and have a ~2.5 month emergency fund right now, but we'll still have room for some solid cash savings while we pay on the loan ($650/month), and we'll continue to max out the 401k.

it's a 7% interest personal loan. I could have gone with a refi or a home-equity loan, but I didn't want to put my home up as collateral, especially when the personal loan interest rate is good (my credit is ~850). It's a 6 year loan, but we expect to have it paid off in a couple of bonus cycles; by the end of 2021. Our effective interest if we do pay it off as expected will be far less than 7%.

Was this stupid? I can always just pay it off right now if so. I guess I just feel like out of all the splurges I could do, this one is somewhat reasonable. I make pretty good money and drive a $4500 truck. I want my driveway to not look like the house is abandoned, and I want my deck to be a great centerpoint for my kids and entertaining.

I'm considering this repayment program if they agree to a hefty interest rate.   Anyone have any ideas on how much I should charge and what kind of documentation  I should get to make it all legal and binding?,finance
personalfinance,Please Review Student Loan Calculations,"I am trying to calculate the total cost of attendance after 4 years of dental school. Can someone review if my math is correct? 

FYI, I know the the cost is astronomical but I got into one of the cheaper schools in the country. Unfortunately this is the sad reality for students wanting to become doctors, dentists, pharmacists, etc. 

There are a few assumptions:

* The Federal Direct Plus (Grad PLUS) Loans have no cap and a rate of 7.59%
* The Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans have a cap of $40,500 per year and a rate of 6.59%
* Both loans compound daily the moment I take them
* The principal amount is based on estimates provided by the school
* I am only calculating the cost of tuition and fees. Living expenses vary by location and I have a spouse who works
* I will graduate in 4 years

**Year 1**

* The estimated cost of tuition and fees is $63,590
* $40,500 of the $63,590 will be funded with the loan with a rate of 6.59%
* $23,090 of the $63,590 will be funded with the loan with a rate of 7.59%
* At graduation, the total cost of the money I took out for Year 1 will be $83,933
   * How?
      * The $40,500 I borrowed using the loan with a 6.59% rate will increase to $52,713.85
      * The $23,090 I borrowed using the loan with a 6.59% rate will increase to $31,279.66

financialindependence,From 10k to 650k in 6.5 Years (with Graph),"[Graph](https://imgur.com/a/wnm65c4)

This is a follow up post to my [last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bjghrb/from_10k_to_500k_in_6_years_with_graph/). A few different things have happened in life and I figured I'd give y'all an update. This is my wife and I's journey from poor recent college grads to financially stable adults! This graph starts 6 months after graduating college when I had already accumulated 30k and ends on Nov 30th 2019. It's really cool to begin to see the exponential growth and how fast my investment returns are beginning to outpace my salary.

Since the last updated I've:

* Sold my Amazon Affiliates website for \~70k
* Had a kid (almost 4 months old already!)
* Fully moved into my new house and did all my preliminary big tasks like putting in a bigger patio, stonework, etc.
* About to start a new job

Some answers to common questions are below:

*  This spreadsheet was built in google sheets using the stacked area chart type
* Wife and I are both 28 years old, live in Houston, TX and had our first kid 4 months ago. We got married in July of 2015. (This graph shows combined finances)
* Total expenses for the kid were 2k for ""stuff"" (furniture, car seats, crib, etc.) and 6k total for all birth, epidural, check-ups etc. Daycare is 1.1k a month. We've found this has had basically no effect on our overall savings rate at this stage of our FIRE journey. We are not saving separately for the kids college expenses but will instead just skim some of our investments off if need be.
* I managed to get 30k by myself after only 6 months out of college by working and saving from my 20hr/week job during college for 4 years and living extremely cheaply during my first year afterwards.
* Real estate is not included on this graph, for reference I currently have around 155k in equity in my home and owe 184k (total value of house is \~340k) . I have a 15 year mortgage at some absurdly low interest rate. I do pay off a little extra month because it makes me feel good.
* I keep a 30k emergency fund in my savings account for....emergencies.
* The dip in the middle of 2015 is when I bought my first house (224k 10% down payment) and then the month after I got married
* The dip in the end of 2018 is when the stock markets dipped a bit and I bought my next new construction house (340K 20% down payment)
* Wife and I are both engineers (Electrical and Mechanical respectively) in the oil and gas industry
* Paid off student loans somewhere in 2016, I don't remember when exactly as they were not astronomically high my wife had loans, I did not. In terms of ""family help"" my parents gave me 2k to use as a down payment on a car (which I still have) and sent me on my way. My wife had an old car already out of college which we also still have.
* My taxable investments are 100% invested in VTSAX with vanguard.
* I record data points for my graph at the end of each month and look at every account I have money in.
* I have no credit card debt and pay it off at the end of every month.
* Both my and my wife's vehicles are fully paid off and we plan to run them into the dirt (even is she thinks otherwise!)
* Salary for me went about as follows with 2 years between major increases (64K starting -&gt; 74K promotion -&gt;97k current job -&gt; 110k new job I should start Jan 2nd or so)
* Salary for my wife was (78k starting -&gt; 84k promotion -&gt; 93k promotion)
* Basic investment strategy (max 401k's-&gt; max IRA's -&gt; invest 80% of the rest in vanguard -&gt; pay a bit extra on the mortgage
* My end goal is 3MM by 40 years old where I plan to FIRE in style!",finance
personalfinance,Home Remodel Financing 1 year away,"We are currently working down our small debts, and looking to do a home remodel starting in the Spring 2021. We bought the house as a foreclosure 3 years ago and have been cash flowing repairs. The house is 30 years old and is showing its age where we have not upgraded. All the houses around us are $350k+. We paid $190k for ours and its worth about $280k now. We will be in this house for another 10 years to get our kids through college.

So starting Jan 2021 

Total income: \~203k 

Total debt not including our house: 75k : $35k (Auto) and $40k(Student Loans). Her loans will most likely be paid by the local hospital, but if they are not, we will get those paid really quickly. I feel comfortable with carrying the auto loan since its low interest rate and its a small % of income.

**What would be the best way to finance the \~$40k remodel at that time?**

...cash is not an option and we are tired of cash flowing everything and having a construction zone all the time.

...I know most are going to say pay all the debt down first then save up for the remodel...that will be another 2 years + the 1 year till she graduates.",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing / Consolidating Student Loans,"Wondering the best options when it comes to refinancing/consolidating student loans. Ultimate goal is to potentially reduce my monthly payments for student/car loan ($757.11) and get lower interest rates if possible.

Questions -
1. I want to shop around for the best interest rate without increasing my hard inquires too much which would lower my credit score. Is there a good approach when bringing this to the bank/credit union? Can they tell me what Interest Rate, etc. I may be approved for? If not, do I try and get approved for the full amount or just the loans with the higher Interest rate?
2. SoFi and my current Credit Union are two options I'm looking into. Are there any other well known for good interest rate?


Additionally Information:
Don't foresee going back to school and I understand the protections related to Federal Student Loans.
Credit Score: 776
Car Loan through Credit Union: 2.19% with current balance of $10,557.30 with end date of 6/8/2022
2 Sallie Mae loans are private I believe? Taken due to caped out federal loans those semesters.

investing,Investments for market downturns,"Hi r/investing!

What are investing options when you think the stock and real estate markets will go down? (no REITs or general stock ETF's or mutual funds.)

I'm aware that you can short the market, but I'm not interested in that because markets tend to earn money, so it seems like a gamble with worse than even odds.

It also seems like bonds yields are quite low currently, and if interest rates go up, bond holdings go down.

Are there investments that would be expected to go up during a downturn and don't involve shorting anything? Any other ideas I'm overlooking?

BTW, high risk investments are fine as long as they are expected to go up long term. Low risk is also fine as long as they are likely to go up during market downturns. I just want to know what options are out there, so lots of answers would be appreciated, especially if there are explanations.",finance
personalfinance,Lump vs dollar cost averaging,"Hello, I opened a Roth IRA late this year and I know I can contribute to it until April of next year and count for contributions for this year. But I could max my contributions this month, about $2000 left for the year, and that is after I made a contribution for this month. Otherwise this money would be padding my emergency fund/waiting until there is enough that I hit other savings goals. My only debt is a 0.5% interest rate on a car loan. Does it make more sense to throw it into the account now, or just make monthly contributions? Also basically the same question if I get a tax return this year, would it be best to put it into the IRA as a lump or over the course of the year? Thank you",finance

personalfinance,Interest Rate on Monthly Car Insurance Payment,"Have to point this out for those who have never paid attention.

I always pay my car insurance (Progressive) in full every six months so I never paid much attention to the monthly rate. A few weeks ago I was paying the six month renewal and noticed the monthly payment option, I don't know why but it caught my eye. You could pay, as I did, $612 up-front or $133 per month (for the six month coverage period.)

As I do that math that is an effective annual interest rate of 98% (you can recalc that as a $133 a month toward $1,224 and get an effective annual rate of 53%.)

Even at 53% this can only make sense for someone with the worst possible credit ratings (essentially unable to access any credit card.) If you have any type of credit card - even one with a 30% interest rate - it's a no brainer to pay your insurance bill and pay it off monthly. At a 30% rate you would put $170 in your pocket and if you are able to get points or cash back even better.

(What really got me is that this is Virginia. They can cancel for non-payment. Lets assume they give you notice the moment you are late that they'll cancel in 60 days. That means they are never at risk for non payment for more than two months of insurance. They aren't really financing or handling financial risk for the entire amount, just 1/3rd of the financed amount is at risk.)",finance

Since this May I was about to pay off about $6,000 of my student loans pushing any payments to 1/26/2023. I also have about $8,000 in an Ally online savings account and $1,000 in cash at home. Both are considered my emergency funds so I never touch them.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is there any advantage for me to take out a large chunk of my savings to pay off my student loans (other than saving money from interest). Or if my current plan of the avalanche method working.

&amp;#x200B;

Also worth mentioning, I am looking to try to purchase a home through the San Francisco BMR lottery. I am super doubtful I would win, but trying to save as much cash as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love hear some advice! Thank you in advance.

personalfinance,Self Employment Tax question,"I can't seem to find any information on this particular case regarding taxes abroad. I am currently a part-time independent contractor living abroad however I earn this part of my income in US dollars to a US bank account. I already pay the foreign local taxes on the income I earn in that nationalities currency via the company I work for. Hence, do I pay the self employment tax + federal income tax, or do I pay the self employment tax + foreign local tax on the US based income? The reason is I don't even know the legalities of self employment in the country I am in, so I think I would rather pay US taxes in full (due to deductions), but don't know if it is possible. Thanks for answering.

personalfinance,Finance question for married couple,"TLDR; I’ve grown up in a more financially stable home than my spouse. I have the opportunity to receive a nice amount of money from my mother if I get my 4 year college degree (only a few credits away but I’ve been away from school for 5+ years). This money would be meant for  either a down payment on a new car (for me, per my mother) or investing into adopting/conceiving a child with my wife. Trying to decided the best way to approach the money issue with the wife. 

Me (27F) and my wife (25F) have been married for two years now. Together for 5 or 6 years total. We both work full time for the same retail company and we live comfortably. Basically we put $50 each into a joint savings account weekly and about 70% of the rest our collective paychecks into a joint checking account. The remainder leaves us with roughly $100 of spending money each into our own personal accounts. 

I’ve grown up in a more comfortable financial situation than my wife has. My mom has been a CFO at a private Country Club for 25 years now (makes upward of $160,000/year) and my stepdad is currently unemployed.  My mom has to pay for herself, my stepdad, and my younger brother and sister. Separately, my dad (divorced twice now) has always worked for the federal government (tax devision) and isn’t wealthy, but always paid my child support and had my health insurance and whatnot covered by the government until I was 26. I grew up very fortunate. 

On the other hand, my wife’s parents are divorced as well. Her mom went to school for many years and is now a school counselor (She loves her job and makes in the $60.000-70,000 range). Her husband works as management for a food production company (No idea what he contributes). They live in a small town home (2br/2bath/loft) with their two teenage children and my grandmother-in-law. Her father owns a mechanic shop and does well for himself. He has provided her with all the vehicles she’s ever driven. 

The issue is focused about our car situations. I got my first car at 16. It was a used Honda and was worth maybe $13,000 total. Between my mom, dad, and godmother, they paid about $6000 down. I paid my mom the rest monthly with my first job over some time. That car didn’t last long after I started college. I started looking for my second car while in college (right around the time I met my “to-be” wife). My grandfather set up accounts for his grandchildren worth $10,000 each when they came of age. Once I turned 18, I found a brand new Honda that I wanted. We put that $10,000 down and I made tiny monthly payments over a few years. I paid it off about a year ago now. 

On the other hand, my wife had never owned a nice or new car ever. Her real father is a mechanic. Every car she’s owned has been one that he’s acquired and fixed up. I think she is on her 3rd refurbished car now. They always let her down eventually. So our goal was to get her a brand new car when financially stable. (We are working our way up to management through our company and plan to save up our bonuses and overtime).

So now that my mom has offered me money to finish my degree, my wife thinks we can use this to put a down payment on a new car for her. I know my mom wouldn’t approve of this. My mom loves my wife, but I don’t see her approving of using her money to get my wife the brand new car. Her opinion is that my wife should get my car (a 2014) and get rid of her car (a 2003). And have me get the new car. 

I can’t tell if I’m seeing this wrong or not. All I have to do is finish a semester or two of college and get $10,000 from my mom. For either adopting a child our buying an SUV to benefit us having a child.",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

crypto,Decrypting GCP data without encryption key : Impossible as Google claim ?,"Hi everyone, 

I'm working in a consulting company where we typically work with public cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure...

Part of my job revolves around identifying and presenting pros and cons of a given cloud solution, and as I work for european clients, there is often concerns about issues such as data security relative to CLOUD Act.

2. Unpaid wages/pensions of former employers
3. VA or FHA insurance

personalfinance,"Personal ""Auto"" Loan Use","I was just approved for a personal unsecured loan of $20k with a decent interest rate around 4.5%.

I'm in the process on consolidating some debt and making our monthly bills a little easier to manage. Part of the debt is a car loan around $14K. I have 4 years left on the car and the interest rate was lower but the monthly bill is higher than the new loan payment about $370 vs the car payment which is $435.

With $6k left over I would also like to pay off personal loan that I had taken out when my family was going through a rough situation a year ago or so. The personal loan was at a higher interest rate ""about 7.5%"" and has about 3.5 years left on it.

Its unsecured loan so there won't be a lien on any vehicle and paying off the other loan would save me about $200 a month. With the previous car and personal loan paid off I would be saving around $265 a month or $12k over the 4 years left on the loans. Yes I would have another year of payment but the money saved could definitely help us and I would most likely put it toward paying off debts like the new loan early.

My question if you haven't figured it out yet is about using the $6k on something that is not a car.

Read a suggestion somewhere to balance the stock portion of your retirement account with overpaying your mortgage instead of bond-based investing. Has anyone considered doing this and have thoughts on the benefits/concerns?

&amp;#x200B;

The idea would be to put 100% of your maxed out retirement accounts (401k and IRA) in something like VTSAX/VTWAX and then contributing something like 2,775 (or 1/9 of the 26k in those accounts) into your mortgage to get a guaranteed rate of return of your interest rate which should be higher than the bond return. My interest rate is 4.25. This would be for a 90/10 split.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone taken this strategy?

I figure most investing outside of tax-sheltered accounts is done with 0% bond exposure anyways so maybe that would make you not want to take this strategy but this allows you to have a higher investment in higher return assets in your tax-sheltered accounts. Particularly the portion that is in roth accounts (my IRA is 100% roth and I do some splitting in my 401k)

Additionally, this would be much less liquid than having your balancing in the accounts that you will not touch (ira/401k) but if you are investing above this in a taxable account as well and have an emergency fund this might not be much of a concern as you have plenty of access to liquid assets and less need for access to these balances.

On the other hand, the return is not taxed. right? It is a return based on a reduction in future obligations and there is nothing to tax. So really isnt the return on 4.25% essentially 5% since you dont pay taxes on the return assuming 15% on capital gains. 4.25/.85=5

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to hear if anyone has any insights on this strategy.",finance
personalfinance,A question about borrowing against your 401k.,"Let's say the company you work for provides a 401k which you have been contributing to. I was told by the 401k provider that I can borrow against the 401k twice before age 59 1/2 up to roughly 47% of the value of the 401k. All interest is paid back pretax by a term between 12 and 54 months back into the 401k, essentially creating a bond to yourself that you also collect the interest on and pay back pretax at the same time.

Let's say I took that loan and maxed out my Roth IRA contributions for the year. Did I essentially receive money tax free, to create 2 tax advantaged assets? (1 being the tax advantaged bond I am paying back to myself and the other being the Roth IRA assets growing completely tax free that I have purchased by using the 401k loan). Or does that loan count as income?

Bonus question, I was told the interest rate for borrowing against the 401k is prime +1% which she currently quoted me at 4.75%. Would it be reckless to buy an asset that netted more than 4.75% interest in a taxable account?  (i.e. REIT or relatively safe high yielding dividend stock). You essentially would be replacing the income you are missing out on by paying the pretax interest on the loan from your paycheck with dividends and possibly lowering your tax bracket for the length of the 401k loan. A glaring drawback being the risk of capital and cashflow depreciation. I'm aware of the taxation that would occur from the REITs being taxed as ordinary income, but if you found a high yielding dividend stock with decent dividend growth and a relatively safe payout ratio you could essentially replace regular income tax with long term capital gains tax. The ordinary tax of the REIT would be offset by the ""lower income"" you are receiving from your job.

Is any of this possible / legal, or has anyone done something like this?

Assuming you keep the 2nd loan available for any actual emergency before you turn 59 1/2 you could essentially leverage against yourself tax free, pay it back pretax, and either create another tax free income stream through the individual Roth or replace the missing income from your pretax loan payments with dividends purchased from the capital acquired from the loan all the while potentially forcing yourself into a lower tax bracket for the term on the loan and accruing interest through the tax advantaged bond to yourself. The leverage is even juicier if the 401k has a match.",finance
personalfinance,Interest paid on car seems more than interest rate quoted?,"I bought a car at 3.12% APR but when I checked the payment schedule, it seems like the interest paid is more than that percentage? Can someone help explain this to me?

personalfinance,Is it worth closing my oldest line of credit for a loan with 6.5% lower interest rate?,"TLDR; Trying to get out of debt. Credit union wants me to close my credit card, which is my oldest credit line. What will this do to my credit score? 

(For reference -- Credit card interest rate: 16.74%. New personal loan rate: 10.49%)

I am working very hard to get out of debt (see earlier post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dnvvqx/best_path_to_clear_debt/)).  September 2019 was the first month of my life (31 yrs) that I began full time year-round employment. Up until then I had tried to live off seasonal income. I naturally over extended myself.

In April 2018 I took out a 48-month $5k personal loan to pay off my 2 credit card debts at the time. I have successfully kept a $0 monthly balance on the higher interest card since then. I have paid ahead on my  personal loan; my next payment is not due until Sept 2021. 

Unfortunately, I used my lower-balance card to pay for life. I owe about $8k. 

I requested a second loan through the same credit union (to cut my interest rate almost in 1/2) to pay off the $8k. They approved, with the stipulation that I cut up the credit card because this is the second time I've racked up debt w/ it (fair enough). 

My only concern is: the credit card in question is my oldest line of credit (7 years), other than my student loans (8-11 years). My credit score is between 720 - 740 depending on the source. If I go through with the second loan, **how will that likely impact my credit score for the next 12 months? Am I better off paying as much as I can to the credit card even with the higher interest rate to keep the credit line open?**

(I have a budget in place moving forward, which allows for at least $300 to go toward debt payment each month. I do not intend to walk this path again. Grateful for year-round employment!)",finance

investing,Mitsubishi Head of Business Dev: “smart money” is Turning to Gold as a Hedge,"Central banks continue to buy gold after a summer rally that stalled as the calendar turned to fall. The latest Mitsubishi precious-metals update says many factors could sour 2020, and so therefore “smart money” is looking to gold as a hedge.

“Illustrating lingering macroeconomic concerns, the importance of diversification away from dollar assets and tail risk hedging, central banks around the world have continued to be net buyers of gold: November saw Turkey, Russia, Poland and newcomer Serbia (which bought 9 tons of gold) all add to their holdings of the yellow metal,” wrote Mitsubishi head of business development Jonathan Butler.

Money managers and institutions investors continued to increase exposure to gold through Comex speculative futures market.

“The fact that the ‘smart money’ continues to favor bullion, even as equities and other risk assets hit new highs, indicates the long-term haven status that many investors attach to gold, especially in an environment where synchronized global growth is becoming the consensus view,” he noted.

It is important not to overlook the vulnerability of the U.S. dollar next year, which could drive gold prices higher, Butler added.

“There are many factors that could upset a benign macroeconomic view in 2020, from a faltering Eurozone to geopolitical tensions. A potentially overlooked one is the U.S. dollar, whose strength is a brake on U.S. export growth and is creating distortions globally,” he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump could see a strong dollar as undermining U.S. exports. “Some kind of coordinated action of the sort that eased back the dollar from its highs in the mid-1980s (Plaza Accord) could be attempted or, in a more extreme scenario, investors could start to lose faith in the dollar amid the burgeoning $22 trillion U.S. debt and no attempts being made at executive or legislative level to stop its inexorable growth,” Butler hypothesized.

Buter cited forthcoming U.S. employment data, which on Friday showed unemployment fell to 3.5%, as well as next week’s Federal Reserve rate decision as responsible for setting the tone in December.

“This coming Friday’s U.S. payrolls data will bring further news on the rate of U.S. job growth, which is expected to have accelerated to around 188k new jobs created in November, leaving the unemployment rate at a 50-year low of 3.6%. If the forecasts are true, we can expect to see a weakening of bullion in the near term, which may be a trigger for further profit-taking,” he stated.

With no more rate cuts expected in 2020, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s will make comments. “Fears that economic optimism may have got ahead of the data will be one mildly gold-supportive narrative for 2020, another will be the possible bumps in the road, from a disorderly Brexit to a souring of U.S.-China relations. Investors will also be looking for any signs of a change to the Fed’s basic policy of keeping rates on hold for much of next year,” Butler said.

personalfinance,TSP + Saving for house,"Hello,

I currently live with my girlfriend who owns her home, roughly $230000 home with $200000 mortgage.  I have all my other finances squared away in my opinion, and want to start saving up to be able to either solely, or combined with her in the future, put down 20% on a nice $400-500000 home.  I of course wouldn't go into a mortgage together unless we were married, but I'm optimistic that is in our future by the time we would be ready to upgrade.

I am a federal employee and thus have a TSP + FERS retirement.  This means currently I put 5% and they match 5%, as well as I put a mandatory 4.4% towards the FERS pension.

The TSP offers a loan specifically for home buying, up to 50% of your account for up to 15 year loan.

I'm trying to decide if I would be better off putting as much extra as I can I to the TSP with the intention of taking a loan later, or putting as much as I can into my high interest savings account instead.  I think realistically I could switch from 5% to 18% and hit the maximum contribution limit, or keep 5% and put a flat maybe $300 a pay period or so into my savings account.

Thoughts?  FYI I have about 12k savings, a 9k car loan, no other debt, and 40k TSP, age 32.  My cost of living and lifestyle are pretty frugal, but I do spend a fair bit on child support so not super well off.

personalfinance,Help with rent vs buy decision &amp; paying off student loans. How do I compare apples to oranges here?,"Hi all, I hope this is the right sub, and if not, please be so kind as to direct me.

I'm not very financially minded (but I'm trying really hard!), and so what I'm really looking for is some advice on how to approach this problem and what sort of things I should be thinking about when coming up with my solution. I'm a new doc graduating residency and have made some probably poor financial decisions so far. I'm signing my first job contract, moving to a new city, and trying to figure out how to balance buying vs renting, and how to juggle that with my student loan repayment and also planning for retirement.

First, the liabilities: 

* I have $220k in student loans at 6.8% interest (plan to refinance in 6 months when I finish residency, but currently enjoying forbearance ^(see poor financial decisions as above)). 
* I have $275k remaining on a mortgage at 4.25% interest on a house valued at [ballpark] $360k.

The assets:

* The house mentioned above, valued at approximately $360k ($85k equity - 6% costs for selling = ~60k if I sell, as I figure). I figure I can also rent the house for 
* I have about $20k cash on-hand (emergency fund + a little extra)
* I have not contributed anything to any retirement funds
* The contract I'm signing is for approximately $275k, minus state and federal income tax = $148k (~$12k/mo take-home)

Now the options:


* **Option A**: I'd love to sell my current home and put that toward a primary residence in Orange County, CA, where I'm moving to. However, real estate is absurdly expensive and I think I'm going to have to spend ~600k for even a modest house. All of the ""fixer uppers"" are at $400k+. I plan to stay in one place for about 3 years minimum, and re-evaluate later on. The problem is, if after 3 years I decide to move, I've mostly been paying interest for those years, which is a non-recoverable cost (sure I can deduct it from my income tax but that's kind of negligible), so would I have been better off renting because I'd have more freedom to move? Then again, this comes at the opportunity cost of putting that money towards my student loans, or investing it in index funds. 

* **Option B**: I could alternatively purchase a condo, which are definitely nicer for a given sale price, (although I'm doing night shifts and I'd prefer not to share a wall with noisy neighbors if possible, so that's a minus for condos) but you get nailed every month with obscene HOA fees ($400-600/month). Again, this is a non-recoverable cost that never goes away, and it pains me to pay people half a grand every month to police me (had bad experiences with HOAs in the past, see /r/fuckHOA).

* **Option C**: I could rent a place for ~3500/month, which is a non-recoverable cost that just vaporizes and pains me to think about. But, I have the freedom to move pretty much whenever, don't have to worry about maintenance, and there is 0 upfront cost. 

* **Option D**: I could just say screw it, and recognize that all of these options are expensive and suck, and since I'm not sure this is a permanent location for me anyway, maybe I should get an inexpensive manufactured home. Mortgage of ~700-800/mo on a ~$150k mobile home, with a land lease in the vicinity of $700-$1500/month (which is another non-recoverable cost there). Sure, the mobile home will not appreciate like a traditional home, but on the flip side, if I regard my mortgage on the mobile home as a non-recoverable cost, even with the land lease, I'm still burning less money every month than if I was renting. 

It seems like the sensible thing is to pick an option that allows me to a) maximize my IRA contributions, b) gives me lots of extra income to pay off my high-interest student loans ASAP (but soon to be re-financed into hopefully lower-interest loans), and c) I should get some real-estate under my belt, but it seems like index funds do better than real estate in the long run anyway. This all kind of argues against buying a house/condo (options A&amp;B), but then again, renting (option C) seems like it's going to cut into my monthly income the most in terms of being able to pay down my loans as fast as possible. 

What kind of metrics should I be looking at with regard to the value of the various investment options here? It feels like I'm comparing apples to oranges to grapefruits and persimmons. How do I even compare these options from a financial viability perspective? How would I even put together a spreadsheet to compare these options? What's even important to look at?",finance

FYI it compounds daily, and there is a $99 annual fee. This fee is ""waived"" if you spend at least that much in interest.

I have sense recovered and have a very good paying job and my cash flow is at about +$2000/month over my expenses right now. I still owe about $43K on my personal loan, and no real other debt besides some car loans at really low interest rates, and a house below 4% on a 30 year mortgage.

Discover recently sent me a 12 month balance transfer offer at 0% with a 3% transfer charge that actually allows me to not directly apply it to CC balances but will send money directly to my checking account.

It is obviously a depreciating asset and all that jazz, I understand.  But I owned it over 15 years and I'd love to have it back.

I could pay cash for the vehicle but it would nearly deplete my savings.  I applied for a loan to cover half, but since I'm rebuilding my credit the rates for the approvals are insane.

investing,Timing the Market Should Work,"The age old wisdom is that timing the market doesn't work, but time in the market does. I understand this means you should consistently put money into your 401k over many years, and eventually the booms and busts will even out so that your overall outcome is positive growth. 
 
If I were to take my 18% returns for the year of 2019 that are all in stocks, and move half of my 401k into a cash equivalent fund, wait for a stock market crash, and then move the cash back into stocks when they are on sale, I should be able to compound my earnings very nicely over time.
 
You can tell me that this won't work, and I will believe you, but I don't I don't understand why it won't work if I do it only when I am certain that there is going to be a market correction in the near future and/or that future earnings are going to be poor for the next year or two.  Even if the earnings are poor, I've still preserved my large increase in capital from 2019.
 
For example, if Vanguard is predicting only 1% growth over the next year and some additional market volatility, wouldn't my money be better used holding onto cash in my 401k just incase there is a large correction and I can get stocks on sale?

The way I see it, there are two directions we can go right now. Continued Fed credit bubble and stock market inflation for the next year which results in stocks continuing to climb by double digit percentages over the next year, or.... recession or worse.

What would you do with your money in your 401k if you knew this next year was gonna be a shitty year for growth and your portfolio probably won't outpace inflation? Do you ever move your 401k holdings into cash when volatility goes up?",finance

I do not want anyone to think that this is spam of any sort, but anyways let's get to it.  


The markets went up today,  but I am seeing a lot of key bearish indications that a reversal on a longer term time frame is fast approaching.  Here are my notes from after today's close  

\---/ES, /NQ, &amp; /RTY all closed the week printing a dragonfly doji  (bearish reversal) candle. They are all overbought on the 1hr time frame's RSI currently and any new highs will result in bearish divergences on the monthly, weekly, &amp; daily charts on /ES &amp;  /NQ.../RTY already has short term bearish divergence on the hourly. One thing to note is that /NQ is lagging and parked right below resistance from last week. Why is that? Well..

. ---Apple, although it has had an amazing few months, is showing signs of a longer term reversal. It is overbought on the monthly and weekly(extremely overbought) and has bearish divergence. The daily today broke to a new high and isn't overbought so it already has bearish divergence. It has left 2 gaps behind to fill on the daily and has  printed a hanging man (reversal candle) on the weekly.

 \---What about good ol' Microsoft? Same thing. Monthly &amp; weekly charts are overbought with bearish divergences and a weekly hanging man candle. The kicker on here is that it is in a weekly rising wedge  (bearish reversal) pattern and printed a weekly reversal candle. Another puzzle piece to add to the table.

 \---Let's look at Amazon. Closing at the bottom of its trading range that it's been in for 6 months now...nothing bullish about it 

\---XLV(healthcare) it's been in a channel on the weekly since 2016.  Currently in the upper area of the channel while overbought, with bearish divergence and printing a dragonfly doji reversal candle.  It is also overbought on the daily with bearish divergence. Bearish divergence on the 4hr, 1hr...you get the picture.

  
  \---XLF(financials) printed a dragonfly doji reversal candle on the weekly closing at resistance. The daily chart has a gap to fill with bearish divergence. It has bounced off the lows without consolidating on the 4hr chart and is extended at this point.

\---XLF, XLV, &amp; XLF have 1 gap close now on the daily to fill.  XLK, XLY, XLC have 2 gaps to fill since Tuesdays bounce.

  
 This is more than just RSI running hot.  It's RSI being overbought +  bearish divergences + bearish weekly candles + bearish reversal patterns on weekly &amp; daily charts + gaps below to fill with no reason to not fill them especially since Trump made it clear that he is willing to  wait until after the election to make a deal. Remarks made today by Kudlow were ""Trump is not ready to sign any trade deal with  China""...shorts got caught with the jobs numbers and I suspect that to be short lived.

personalfinance,I've made a HUGE mistake and I wanna get out of it. Need ALL the advice I can get.,"Okay. So first, let me tell y'all about myself. I'm 24/F with a Bachelor's degree. I'm from a country in Asia and moved to the United States when I got offered a job. I had no credit history at all when I just moved to the US and my dad convinced me that taking out a car loan would be a good way to establish credit. (I don't know WHY I listened to his advice. He's never been that great with dealing with cars anyways; multiple repossessions, etc. but I did and I REGRET it.) Now let me provide you guys with some helpful info and stats:

Car loan (monthly payment): $495 \[ CRAZY, I know D: \]

Principal Balance (car): $18,343

APR: 20.60% \[even CRAZIER, I know :( \]

Car Insurance: $205

Internet: $68

Electricity: $30-50

Groceries: $40-80

Current credit score: 580 (not from CK)

YES, that interest rate makes me wanna shoot myself but the only reason I accepted it was because my dad said not to worry about it since I can refinance later on. I'm just so tired of putting a huge chunk of my monthly earnings towards a car that I don't even really like that much. I mean, it's nice. It's a 2016 Toyota Rav4 with a 2.5L engine but I really don't need something this fancy. My daily commute to work is literally a 2-3 minute drive. I live in a small town and my apartment is really close to work. (Another reason I decided to get a nice car is because I live 2-3 hours away from Houston and thought that it would be good to have a reliable car that won't break down on me in the middle of the interstate when I travel and visit friends in Houston.)

NOW, I'm trying to come up with a game plan to get out of this car loan. I know that technically, there isn't a way out since I signed those stupid papers, but I went on Carvana and got an offer of $15,700 (I think?) and decided I could just sell it to them and cover the remaining \~$3000 to pay off the rest of the loan. Then I was thinking of getting a car in the &lt;$10,000 range so I could still have something to use to get to work and travel to Houston. (I'm estimating that my tax refund next year will be around $3000-4000 and was thinking of putting this towards to the new cheaper car) What do you guys think of this plan, do y'all have any other suggestions? Please help me. I just wanna get rid of this car and not have huge monthly payments anymore.

personalfinance,Need Some 2018 Tax Advice (Foreign Spouse),"Hello all, need some advice on my 2018 Federal Tax Return.

Just getting around to filing it since I deployed at the beginning of the year and was given an extension, so now I'm finally trying to finally get it done.

Got married to my spouse in 2018 and they only recently (August 2019) got their social security number. I'm assuming I can't use their social security number for my 2018 federal tax return since it wasn't obtained during that filing year, is that correct?

Secondly, my spouse pays taxes in the United Kingdom and basically still lives there (long distance marriage). From my understanding, there is a tax treaty between the UK and the US. Is there any way I can claim ""Married Filing Jointly"" and just claim their income as zero under this treaty?  Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,How should I pay off college loans/ get prepare myself for getting into dental school?,"Hey guys!

Im currently a freshman at an oregon college studying biochemistry (molecular biology) and want to know how I should be spending my funds/ finding opportunities to save up and get ready for dental school.

Currently, I am paying around 6k after scholarships per term for three terms which totals to 18k a school year.

This is split into about 2k on tuition per term,  about 3k in housing and 1k on other necessities (books etc.)

Of course I still have my next 3 years where instead of housing (dorming) I will be renting instead.

And then comes dental school where I am unsure of how I will pay my existing debts + dental school on top of those funds.

Currently, most of the money is from my parents, and instead of taking a subsidized loan my parents decided to use take loans from a bank due to the lower interest rates.

Any suggestions are welcome! Sorry if I left any details out this is my first post.",finance
personalfinance,Legal Name Change - Update Credit Bureaus?,"I legally changed my entire name in July of this year, and my credit scores have been wonky since then. I have updated all of my banks, and my 2 credit cards of my name change. The name on those accounts have been changed, I only have to change my name with Navient (my fed student loan servicer) still since they have a process that isn't online so it is annoying to get it done. I have noticed my scores have been a little wonky; I even noticed that on the Experian app, it says one of my credit cards is CLOSED (plot twist: it is not closed). Looking at my logins, I also noticed that some of my CCs ""haven't reported"" since August (that would make sense since that was probably the first statement that had my new name on the CCs). 

Do I have to update the credit bureaus of the name change myself? I figured that since my SSN was the same, when my CCs reported monthly that the credit bureaus with my new name that they would automatically update my credit file to reflect my new name. It seems however that they think my two names are different people since they think one of my credit cards is closed. 

What do I do? Should I pull all 3 reports from [annualcreditreport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com) and check to see if my new name is even on my credit report? I just don't know what to do because calling the credit bureaus is always a pain and half the time the ppl on the phone don't even know what they're talking about.

Bitcoin,Boerse Stuttgart's Crypto Exchange Live for All Traders in Germany,"(copied/pasted from scamsite bitcoin[dot]com, so no link, sorry)


Boerse Stuttgart's Crypto Exchange Live for All Traders in Germany

Germany’s second-largest stock exchange, Boerse Stuttgart, has opened up its cryptocurrency trading platform to all interested traders in the country. This move follows the passing of a bill allowing banks in Germany to sell and hold cryptocurrencies for their clients starting next year.

Regulated Crypto Trading Platform
Boerse Stuttgart announced Friday that its digital asset trading platform is “now open to any interested persons in Germany.” The BSDEX platform was launched in September but only for selected users. The company described:

At Germany’s first regulated trading venue for digital assets, users can currently trade bitcoin against the euro. Additional digital assets are to be added.

To access the BSDEX platform, the user must be at least 18 years of age, a resident of Germany, a European Economic Area (EEA) national, and have a German bank account. The platform offers free cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals with varying trading fees based on the order type.

“The BSDEX is a multilateral trading system that brings together buyers and sellers of digital assets through an open order book,” Boerse Stuttgart explained, adding that customer orders are executed directly against each other. The company elaborated:

At the moment our offer is limited to Germany. However, our goal is to make it available in other countries in the future.

The digital asset platform complies with the regulatory requirements of the German Banking Act. The Baden-Württembergische Wertpapierbörse, which also acts as a holding company of the public stock exchange, regulates and monitors the compliance of the platform. The technical operator of the BSDEX is the Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange, a joint venture between the Boerse Stuttgart Group, Axel Springer, and Finanzen. Blocknox, a subsidiary of the Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures, acts as the custodian holding customers’ cryptocurrencies.

Early this year, Boerse Stuttgart launched a crypto trading app called Bison, developed by Sowa Labs, a fintech subsidiary of the Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures. The smartphone app can be used to buy and sell BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP from financial services provider Euwax AG, a subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart.

Germany’s Crypto-Forward Bill

Germany has recently emerged as a crypto haven following the passing of a bill on Nov. 29 which allows banks to sell and hold cryptocurrencies for their clients starting next year. The new rules have been adopted as part of the implementation of “Directive (EU) 2018/843 of 30 May 2018,” the fifth AML Directive, explained global law firm Dentons.

Under the new rules, crypto assets qualify as financial instruments, the law firm continued, emphasizing that this was disputed in the past. According to the firm, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) took the view that utility tokens did not qualify as financial instruments, but investment tokens qualify as securities and currency tokens qualify as “units of account” — both of which fall under the definition of financial instruments pursuant to the German Banking Act.

The new rules also include licensing requirements. Companies wanting to provide crypto trading or custody services are required to obtain a license from Bafin as a bank or an investment firm, the law firm further detailed. “Entities that provide no other financial services than custody are exempted from certain rules that apply to other investment firms.” Among other requirements, companies seeking a license for only the crypto asset business must have an initial capital of 125,000 euros ($138,234). Dentons added:

The new law will enter into force on January 1, 2020, subject to certain transition periods.

Entities wanting to obtain a license for crypto-related services should notify Bafin of their intention to obtain a license on or before March 31, 2020. The law firm clarified that “In such case, the license will be deemed to be awarded on a preliminary basis, provided that they will submit a complete application for a license no later than November 30, 2020.”",cryptocurrency

## Es geht mit Riesenschritten voran: Bis zur nächsten Krise ist das Bargeld abgeschafft


07.12.2019 | 07:07

    Norbert Häring

***Droht ein Bargeld-Verbot? Die globalen Eliten bereiten sich auf den nächsten großen Crash vor. Sie arbeiten daran, ihre Kontrolle über das Geldsystem und darüber hinaus zu perfektionieren, damit sie – wenn es soweit ist – die Verluste so zuteilen können, wie sie es möchten.***

Unter dem Vorwand, die Wirkungsmacht der Geldpolitik bewahren zu wollen, hat der Internationale Währungsfonds (IWF) Ende April 2019 Empfehlungen veröffentlicht, wie Notenbanken den Bürgern das Bargeld entziehen oder madig machen können. Es ist bereits mindestens die dritte Studie dieser Art in zweieinhalb Jahren. Erst wenige Monate zuvor hatte die Leiterin der Division Geldpolitische Strategie der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB), Katrin Assenmacher, gemeinsam mit IWF-Beraterin Signe Krogstrup ein ähnliches Papier verfasst.

Ich spreche von den Erfordernissen einer wirksamen Geldpolitik als Vorwand, weil sich der neuerliche Vorstoß gegen das Bargeld in die Strategie zur trickreichen Bargeldbeseitigung einfügt, die in einem IWF-Papier aus dem Jahr 2017 beschrieben ist.

*Zur Person: Norbert Häring ist promovierter Volkswirt und Wirtschaftsjournalist.*

### Mit harmlosen Schritten anfangen

Es lohnt sich, dieses zur Einordnung kurz zu rekapitulieren: In „The Macroeconomics of De-Cashing“ empiehlt der IWF Regierungen, die Bargeld beseitigen wollen, mit harmlos erscheinenden Schritten anzufangen. Man könne zum Beispiel mit der Abschaffung von großen Geldscheinen und Obergrenzen für Barzahlungen beginnen. Es sei vorzuziehen, den Privatsektor mit harmlos erscheinenden Umstellungen vorzuschicken. Direkte staatliche Eingriffe würden angesichts der Vorliebe der Menschen für Bargeld stärker hinterfragt und die Leute könnten stichhaltige Gegenargumente vorbringen. Nötig sei aus diesem Grund auch ein gezieltes PR-Programm, um Misstrauen abzubauen, insbesondere den Verdacht, dass die Regierungen alle Aspekte des Lebens der Menschen kontrollieren oder die persönlichen Ersparnisse in den Bankensektor zwingen wollen. Der Bargeld-Beseitigungsprozess werde besser vorankommen, wenn auf eine Kosten-Nutzen-Abwägung abgestellt werde.

Man beachte: Der Autor hält das Misstrauen nicht etwa für verfehlt. Er zählt die Möglichkeit, alle finanziellen Transaktionen der Menschen zu überwachen, explizit zu den Vorteilen der Bargeldbeseitigung, und auch, dass die Ersparnisse in die Banken gedrängt werden, listet er unter den Vorteilen auf. Christine Lagarde, die IWF-Chefin, unter der diese Papiere entstanden sind, ist schon als neue Chefin der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) vereidigt.

### Abwertung von Bargeld zu Digitalgeld

In der zuletzt veröffentlichten, 88-seitigen Studie des IWF „Enabling Deep Negative Rates to Fight Recessions: A Guide“ ist die Kosten-Nutzen-Erwägung, auf die abgestellt wird, eine geldpolitische. Es soll den Notenbanken möglich gemacht werden, die Zinsen tief in den negativen Bereich zu drücken. Bisher verhindert die Existenz von Bargeld, dass die Banken tiefe Negativzinsen an ihre Einlagenkunden weitergeben. Denn diese könnten ihre Guthaben bar abheben und zum Nullzins im Tresor lagern.

Gemäß dem IWF-Vorschlag soll dafür gesorgt werden, dass im Fall negativer Zentralbankzinsen Bargeld gegenüber Bankengeld beständig abwertet. Ein Euro Bargeld würde also relativ zu einem Euro Guthaben bei einer Bank immer weniger wert. Wer bar bezahlt, müsste (zunehmend) mehr bezahlen als derjenige, der per Überweisung oder Karte bezahlt. Damit das die beabsichtigte Wirkung hat, soll dafür gesorgt werden, dass alle wesentlichen Preise in digitalem Geld ausgezeichnet werden. Wenn etwas mit zehn Euro ausgezeichnet ist, sollen also Barzahler mehr bezahlen, nicht etwa Digitalzahler weniger. Alte Schuldverhältnisse sollen so umgedeutet werden, dass Rückzahlung in digitalem Geld (Bankengeld) die Schuld tilgt, während bei Barzahlung ein Aufschlag verlangt werden kann.

Damit die Durchsetzung von Digitalgeld als neuer Recheneinheit besser klappt, soll nach der Empfehlung des IWF die Bargeldnutzung weiter zurückgedrängt werden. Ein probates Mittel dafür könne auch die Ausgabe eines allen Bürgern zugänglichen digitalen Zentralbankgeldes sein. „Solche Innovationen dürften die Rolle von Bargeld weiter reduzieren“, lobt gerade der IWF.

Umgesetzt würde der vom IWF bevorzugte „saubere Ansatz“ im Zusammenspiel von Notenbank und Geschäftsbanken. Wenn der EZB-Leitzins zum Beispiel minus vier Prozent betrüge, würde die EZB ankündigen, dass Banken nach einem Jahr für eingezahltes Bargeld vier Prozent weniger bekommen, als sie heute dafür bezahlen müssen. Nach einem Quartal wäre es ein Prozent weniger. Egal ob die Bank das Geld auf dem Konto lässt oder bar abhebt und einlagert, es würde sie in beiden Fällen pro Jahr vier Prozent kosten.

Die Banken sollen die Kosten von Bargeld an ihre Bargeld nutzenden Kunden weitergeben. Sie würden Bargeld am Automaten oder am Schalter laufend billiger machen (in Bankengeld gerechnet). Umgekehrt würden diejenigen, die Bargeld einzahlen, also vor allem die Händler, immer weniger Bankguthaben für das eingezahlte Bargeld bekommen. Die Händler würden dann entweder von Barzahlern höhere Preise verlangen oder Bargeld nicht mehr annehmen.

Wenn Bargeld nicht mehr ohne Weiteres verfügbar ist oder laufend abwertet, ist Bargeldabheben keine Option mehr, um Negativzinsen zu entkommen, und die Banken können ungeniert Negativzinsen an ihre Einlagenkunden weitergeben.
Hinreichend tiefe Negativzinsen zur Enteignung

Verräterisch ist im Abschnitt zum digitalen Zentralbankgeld für Jedermann, das einen positiven, aber auch negativen Zins tragen kann, der verschämte Hinweis: „Um den Menschen die Sicherheit zu geben, dass ihr digitales Zentralbankgeld nicht konfisziert werden wird, wäre es gut, eine ausdrückliche Garantie zu geben, dass der Zins auf dieses digitale Geld nie um mehr als x-Prozentpunkte unterhalb zum Beispiel von der Verzinsung kurzfristiger Staatsanleihen liegen wird.“

Hier wird implizit eingeräumt, dass man mit hinreichend tiefen Negativzinsen die Menschen auch enteignen kann. Bei minus fünf Prozent, einem Satz, der in diesen Kreisen oft genannt wird, hat man nach fünf Jahren ein knappes Viertel seines Guthabens verloren. Für Bankguthaben und Bargeld schlägt der IWF keine solche Garantie vor, ja, er erwähnt das Problem nicht einmal explizit. Letztlich bedeuten tief negative Guthabenzinsen, dass Einleger teilenteignet werden, um Banken zu sanieren, die sich verzockt haben.

Aber wenn Bargeld es nun einmal der Zentralbank unmöglich macht, in der künftigen Niedrigzinswelt ihre gemeinnützige Arbeit der Konjunkturstabilisierung zu machen, dann ist ein ruchloser Egoist, wer sich aus Sorge um sein Erspartes dem entgegenstellt. Das ist die Botschaft des IWF.

Um diese Botschaft zu vermitteln, tun die Autoren so, als wäre Zinspolitik mit dem Umweg über die privaten Geschäftsbanken nicht nur ein wirkungsvolles, sondern auch noch das einzig verfügbare Mittel der Geldpolitik. Schon darüber, ob die traditionelle Zinspolitik besonders wirksam ist, kann man in Anbetracht der sehr mäßigen Ergebnisse der letzten zehn Jahre trefflich ich streiten. Auf keinen Fall aber ist diese Politik alternativlos.

### Alternative Helikoptergeld

Da gibt es zum Beispiel den Vorschlag des Helikoptergeldes, der immerhin schon von Nobelpreisträger Milton Friedman und vom ehemaligen US-Notenbankchef Ben Bernanke in die Diskussion gebracht wurde – von Letzterem ausdrücklich als Alternative, wenn die Zinspolitik an die Nullzinsgrenze stößt. Helikoptergeld bedeutet, dass die Zentralbank das neu geschaffene Geld nicht an die Banken gibt, sondern direkt zur Nachfragestimulierung an die Bürger verteilt. Für diese Politik ist die Nullzinsgrenze kein Thema. Sie ist auch ziemlich unumstritten wirkungsvoll für die Konjunkturstabilisierung. Hauptargument der Gegner ist, dass dann die Menschen verstehen würden, wie das Geldsystem funktioniert, und dann würden sie ihr Vertrauen in dieses System verlieren.

In neuerer Zeit haben sich unter anderem Adair Turner, ehemaliger Chef der britischen Finanzaufsicht, Thomas Mayer, der ehemalige Chefvolkswirt der Deutschen Bank, Mark Blyth (Brown University) und Eric Lonergan, Hedgefondsmanager, Daniel Stelter und (mit Abstrichen) Willem Buiter, Chefvolkswirt der Citigroup, für Helikoptergeld ausgesprochen. Man muss den Vorschlag nicht gut finden, aber ihn bei der Darstellung möglicher Alternativen zur Nullzinspolitik nicht zu erwähnen, ist unseriös.

Der Preis für Gold würde bei einem deutlichen Negativzins, der auch Bargeld erfasst, natürlich in die Höhe schießen. Weil Gold ein prominenter Gradmesser für das Vertrauen in die Buchwährungen gilt, wäre das sehr unschön. Deshalb wäre dafür zu sorgen, dass der Negativzins irgendwie auch auf Gold anzuwenden ist, was schwierig ist, oder die private Goldhaltung wäre zu begrenzen oder zu verbieten. Dazu passt der im Juli 2019 bekannt gewordene Plan der Bundesregierung, die Obergrenze für Goldkäufe ohne Identitätsprüfung von 10.000 Euro auf 2.000 Euro zu senken.

Es geht derzeit in Riesenschritten voran. Bis die Krise kommt, will man soweit sein, dass Bargeldhaltung und Goldhaltung anmeldepflichtig sind und beliebig begrenzt werden können.

## It is progressing with giant steps: until the next crisis, the cash is abolished

07.12.2019 | 07:07

    Norbert Haring

***Is a cash ban threatening? The global elites are preparing for the next big crash. They are working to perfect their control of the monetary system and beyond, so that when the time comes, they can allocate the losses as they wish.***

Under the pretext of wanting to preserve the power of monetary policy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published recommendations at the end of April 2019 on how central banks can withdraw or liquidate their citizens. It is already at least the third study of its kind in two and a half years. Only a few months earlier, the head of the monetary policy strategy division of the European Central Bank (ECB), Katrin Assenmacher, together with IMF advisor Signe Krogstrup had written a similar paper.

I speak of the requirements of an effective monetary policy as a pretext, because the recent push against cash fits into the tricky cash management strategy outlined in an 2017 IMF paper.

*About the person: Norbert Häring is a doctor of economics and business journalist.*

### Begin with harmless steps

It is worth recapitulating this briefly: In ""The Macroeconomics of De-Cashing,"" the IMF recommends that governments that want to eliminate cash start with seemingly innocuous steps. For example, one could start with the abolition of large bills and cash limits. It is preferable to preface the private sector with seemingly innocuous changes. Direct state intervention would be more questioned in the face of people's preference for cash, and people could make strong counter-arguments. For this reason, a targeted public relations program is needed to reduce mistrust, in particular the suspicion that governments want to control all aspects of people's lives or force personal savings into the banking sector. The cash removal process would be better if the cost-benefit balance was considered.

Note: The author does not consider the mistrust as wrong. He lists the possibility to monitor all financial transactions of the people, explicitly to the benefits of cash disposal, and also that the savings are pushed into the banks, he lists among the benefits. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, under which these papers were created, is already sworn in as the new head of the European Central Bank (ECB).

### Devaluation from cash to digital money

The IMF's most recent 88-page study, ""Enabling Deep Negative Ratings to Fight Recessions: A Guide,"" analyzes the cost-benefit considerations that are being addressed. It should be made possible for central banks to push interest rates deep into negative territory. So far, the existence of cash prevents banks from passing on deep negative interest rates to their deposit customers. Because these could withdraw their balances in cash and store at zero interest in the vault.

According to the IMF proposal, it should be ensured that in the case of negative central bank rates, cash constantly devaluates against bank money. A euro cash would therefore be worth less and less relative to a euro credit at a bank. Those who pay in cash would (increasingly) have to pay more than those who pay by bank transfer or card. For this to have the intended effect, care should be taken to ensure that all significant prizes are awarded in digital money. If something is priced at ten euros, so cash payer to pay more, not about digital payer less. Old obligations are to be reinterpreted so that repayment in digital money (bank money) clears the debt, while a cash payment may be charged.

In order for the enforcement of digital money to work better as a new arithmetic unit, cash use is to be pushed back further, according to the IMF's recommendation. An effective means for this could also be the issue of a digital central bank money accessible to all citizens. ""Such innovations should further reduce the role of cash,"" praises the IMF.

Implemented by the IMF preferred ""clean approach"" in the interaction of the central bank and commercial banks. For example, if the ECB's key rate fell four percent, the ECB would announce that banks will get four percent less in cash after one year than they have to pay today. After one quarter, it would be one percent less. Regardless of whether the bank leaves the money in the bank or withdraws and deposits it, it would cost them four percent a year in both cases.

Banks should pass on the cost of cash to their cash-using customers. They would make cash at the machine or at the counter constantly cheaper (calculated in bank money). Conversely, those who deposit cash, especially the traders, would receive fewer and fewer bank deposits for the paid-in cash. The traders would either demand higher prices from cash handlers or no longer accept cash.

When cash is no longer readily available or constantly devaluing, withdrawing cash is no longer an option to escape negative interest rates, and banks can unabashedly pass on negative interest rates to their deposit customers.
Sufficiently low negative interest for expropriation

Treacherously, in the section on digital central bank money for anyone, which may carry a positive but also negative interest rate, the shameful note: ""To give people the assurance that their digital central bank money will not be confiscated, it would be good, an express guarantee that the interest on this digital money will never be more than x percentage points below, for example, the interest on short-term government bonds. ""

Here it is implicitly acknowledged that people can expropriate people with sufficiently low negative interest rates. At minus five percent, a rate often referred to in these circles, you have lost nearly a quarter of your credit after five years. For bank balances and cash, the IMF proposes no such guarantee, yes, he does not even explicitly mention the problem. Ultimately, deeply negative credit rates mean that depositors are partially appropriated to rehabilitate banks that have gambled.

But if cash makes it impossible for the central bank to do its charitable work of economic stabilization in the future low-interest world, then it is a nefarious egoist who opposes it out of concern for his savings. That's the message of the IMF.

In order to convey this message, the authors argue that interest rate policy, with its detour through private commercial banks, is not only an effective but also the only available means of monetary policy. The question of whether or not traditional interest-rate policy is particularly effective can be very well argued, given the very modest results of the past ten years. In no case, however, is this policy without alternative.

### Alternative helicopter money

There is, for example, the suggestion of the helicopter money, which has already been brought into the discussion by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman and the former US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke - of the latter explicitly as an alternative, if the interest rate policy reaches the zero interest rate limit. Helicopter money means that the central bank does not give the newly created money to the banks, but distributes it directly to the demand stimulation to the citizens. For this policy, the zero interest rate limit is not an issue. It is also quite undoubtedly effective in stabilizing the economy. The main argument of the opponents is that then people would understand how the money system works, and then they would lose their confidence in this system.

In recent times, among others, have been Adair Turner, former Chief Financial Supervisor, Thomas Mayer, Deutsche Bank's former chief economist Mark Blyth (Brown University) and Eric Lonergan, hedge fund manager Daniel Stelter and Willem Buiter (chief economist) Citigroup, pronounced for helicopter money. One does not have to find the proposal good, but not to mention it in the presentation of possible alternatives to the zero interest rate policy is dubious.

The price of gold would, of course, skyrocket given a significant negative interest rate, which also includes cash. Because gold is a prominent gauge of confidence in the book currencies, that would be very unpleasant. Therefore, it should be ensured that the negative interest rate somehow applies to gold, which is difficult, or private gold holding should be limited or prohibited. This is in line with the federal government's plan, announced in July 2019, to lower the upper limit for gold purchases without identity checks from 10,000 euros to 2,000 euros.

It is currently progressing in giant steps. Until the crisis comes, one wants to be so far that keeping cash and keeping gold are notifiable and can be arbitrarily limited.

personalfinance,Credit Card Interest Question,"Hey all! I just had a question on my credit card interest this month. I have had a credit card for like 5ish years and always paid in full to avoid interest except for this month. Now that I have had to pay interest, I am curious to know how it was calculated.

&amp;#x200B;

Amount that was due on 12/2 (from spending 10/6 - 11/5): $1068.98

Amount I paid: $932.98 (leaving $136 on the card and the amount I figured I'd have to pay interest on)

Credit Card Purchases from 11/6 - 12/5: $1200.51

On 12/5 I was charged $11.26 on $945.87 (Balance Subject to Interest Rate)

I understand the math given the number:

(0.1449 / 365) \* 945.87 \* 30 = 11.26

But I am just unsure where the number 945.87 comes from. I was under the impression that because I paid all but $136 dollars that only that amount, the amount I carried over, would be subject to interest. Maybe that is the case and I am just a little confused? If not, does that mean even if I pay one penny less than the amount due I am subject to interest on such a large balance?

# **What Trump does before trade deadline is the ‘wild card’ that will drive markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/what-trump-does-before-trade-deadline-is-the-wild-card-that-will-drive-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The Trump administration’s Dec. 15 deadline for new tariffs on China looms large, and while most strategists expect them to be delayed while talks continue, they don’t rule out the unexpected.
*****
&gt; “That’s the biggest thing in the room next week. I don’t think he’s going to raise them. I think they’ll find a reason,” said James Pauslen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. But Paulsen said President Donald Trump’s unpredictable nature makes it really impossible to tell what will happen as the deadline nears.
*****
&gt; “He’s the one off you’re never sure about. It’s not just tariffs. It could be damn near anything,” Paulsen said. “I think he goes out of his way to be a wild card.”
*****
&gt; Just in the past week, Trump said he would put new tariffs on Brazil, Argentina and France. He rattled markets when he said he could wait until after the election for a trade deal with China.
*****
&gt; Once dubbing himself “tariff man,” Trump reminded markets that he sees tariffs as a way of getting what he wants from an opponent, and traders were reminded tariffs may be around for a long time.
*****
&gt; Trade certainly could be the most important event for markets in the week ahead, which also includes a Fed interest rate decision Wednesday and the U.K.’s election that could set the course for Brexit. If there’s no China deal, that could beat up stocks, send Treasury yields lower and send investors into other safe havens.
*****
&gt; When Fed officials meet this week, they are not expected to change interest rates, but they are likely to discuss whether they believe their repo operations to drive liquidity in the short-term funding market are running smoothly, ahead of year end. Economic reports in the coming week include CPI inflation Wednesday, which could be an important input for the Fed.
*****
&gt; Punt, but no deal
&gt; As of Friday, the White House did not appear any closer to striking a deal with China, though officials say talks are going fine. Back in August, Trump said if there is no deal, Dec. 15 is the date for a new wave of tariffs on $156 billion in Chinese goods, including cell phones, toys and lap top computers.
*****
&gt; Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas, said it seems like a low probability there will be a deal in the coming week. “What the market is focused on right now is whether there’s going to be tariffs that to into effect on Dec. 15, or not. It’s being rated pretty binary,” said Clifton. “I think what’s happening here and the actions by China overnight looks like we’re setting up for a kick.”
*****
&gt; China removed some tariffs from U.S. agricultural products Friday, and administration officials have been talking about discussions going fine.
*****
&gt; Clifton said if tariffs are put on hold, it’s unclear for how long. “Those are going to be larger questions that have to be answered. This is really now about politics. Is it a better idea for the president to cut a deal without major structural reforms, or should he walk away? That’s the larger debate that has to happen after Dec. 15,” Clifton said. “I’m getting worried that some in the administration... they’re leaning toward no deal category.”
*****
&gt; Clifton said Trump’s approval rating falls when the trade wars heat up, so that may motivate him to complete the deal with China even if he doesn’t get everything he wants.
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, director of rates strategy at Wells Fargo, said his base case is for a trade deal to be signed in the next couple of months, but even so, he said he can’t entirely rule out another outcome. It would make sense for tariffs to be put on hold while talks continue.
*****
&gt; “The tweeter-in-chief controls that one, ” said Schumacher. “That’s anybody’s guess...I wouldn’t be at all surprised if he suspends it for a few weeks. If he doesn’t, that’s a pretty unpleasant result. That’s risk off. That’s pretty clear.”
*****
&gt; Because the next group of tariffs would be on consumer goods, economists fear they could hit the economy through the consumer, the strongest and largest engine behind economic growth.
*****
&gt; Fed ahead
&gt; The Fed has moved to the sidelines and says it is monitoring economic data before deciding its next move. Friday’s strong November jobs report, with 266,000 jobs added, reinforces the Fed’s decision to move to neutral for now.
*****
&gt; So the most important headlines from its meeting this week could be about the repo market, basically the plumbing for the financial system where financial institutions fund themselves. Interest rates in that somewhat obscure market spiked in September. Market pros said the issue was a cash crunch in the short term lending market, made better when the Fed started repo operations.
*****
&gt; The Fed now has multiple operations running over year end, and Schumacher said it has latitude to do more. Strategists expect there to be more pressure on the repo market as banks rein in operations to spruce up their balance sheets at year end.
*****
&gt; “No one is going to come to the Fed and say you did too much in the year-end funding,” said Schumacher. “If repo happens to spike somewhat on one day, the Fed is going to hammer it the next day.”
*****
&gt; Paulsen said the markets will be attuned to this week’s inflation numbers. Consumer inflation, the CPI is reported on Wednesday and producer prices are Thursday.
*****
&gt; A pickup in inflation of any significance is one thing that could pull the Fed from the sidelines, and prod it to consider a rate hike.
*****
&gt; “I think the inflation reports might start to get a little attention. Given the jobs numbers, the employment rate, growth picking up a little bit and a better tone in manufacturing. I do think if you get some hot CPI number, I don’t know if the Fed can ignore it,” he said. “Core CPI is 2.3%.” He said it would get noticed if it jumped to 2.5% or better.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s inflation target is 2% but its preferred measure is the PCE inflation, and that remains under 2%.
*****
&gt; Stocks were sharply higher Friday but ended the past week flattish. The S&amp;P 500 was slightly higher, up 0.2% at 3,145, and the Dow was down 0.1% at 28,015. The Nasdaq was 0.1% lower, ending the week at 8,656.

# Reasons We Still Believe In December

&gt; It has been a rough start to the most wonderful month of them all, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down each of the first two days of December. Don’t stop believing just yet, though.

&gt; Everyone knows December has usually been a good month for stocks, but what happened last year is still fresh in the minds of many investors. The S&amp;P 500 fell 9.1% in December 2018 for the worst December since 1931. That sounds really bad, until you realize stocks fell 30% in September 1931, but we digress.

&gt; One major difference between now and last year is how well the global equities have been performing. Heading into December 2018, the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.2% year to date, but markets outside of the United States were already firmly in the red, with many down double digits.

&gt; “We don’t think stocks are on the verge of another massive December sell off,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “If my Cincinnati Bengals can win a game, anything is possible. However, we are quite encouraged by the overall participation we are seeing from various global stock markets this year versus last year, when the United States was about the only market in the green heading into December.”

&gt; Stocks have also overcome volatile starts to December recently. The S&amp;P 500 was down four days in a row to start 2013 and 2017, but the gauge still managed to gain 2.4% and 1%, respectively, in those years.

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, December has been the second-best month of the year for stocks going back to 1950. It is worth noting that it was the best month of the year before last year’s massive drop. Stocks have historically been strong in pre-election years as well, and December has never been lower two times in a row during a pre-election year. Given stocks fell in December 2015, bulls could be smiling when this month is wrapped up.

# Could Impeachment Be Good for Investors?

&gt; Impeaching a President with the possibility of removal from office is by no means great for the country. However, it may not be so horrible for the stock market or investors if history is any guide. We first touched on this over two years ago here on the blog and now that much has transpired and the US House of Representatives is now proceeding with drafting articles of impeachment we figured it was a good time to revisit the history (albeit limited) of market behavior during presidential impeachment proceedings. The three charts below really tell the story.

&gt; During the Watergate scandal of Nixon’s second term the market suffered a major bear market from January 1973 to October/December 1974 with the Dow down 45.1%, S&amp;P 500 down 48.2% and NASDAQ down 59.9%. Sure there were other factors that contributed to the bear market such as the Oil Embargo, Arab-Israeli War, collapse of the Bretton Woods system, high inflation and Watergate. However, shortly after Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 the market reached the secular bear market low on October 3 for S&amp;P and NASDAQ and December 6 for the Dow.

&gt; Leading up to the Clinton investigations and through his subsequent impeachment and the acquittal by the Senate the market was on a tear as one of the biggest bull markets in history raged on. After the 1994 midterm elections when the Republicans took back control of both houses of Congress the market remained on a 45 degree upward trajectory except for a few blips and the shortest bear market on record that lasted 45 days and bottomed on August 31, 1998.

&gt; Clinton was impeached in December 1998 and acquitted in February 1999 as the market continued higher throughout his second term. Sure there were other factors that contributed to the late-1990s bull-run such as the Dotcom Boom, the Information Revolution, millennial fervor and a booming global economy, but Clinton’s personal scandal had little negative impact on markets.

&gt; It remains to be seen of course what will happen with President Trump’s impeachment proceeding and how the world and markets react, but the market continues to march on. If the limited history of impeachment proceedings of a US President in modern times (no offense to our 17th President Andrew Johnson) is any guide, the market has bounced back after the last two impeachment proceedings and was higher a year later. Perhaps it will be better to buy any impeachment dip rather than sell it.

# Typical December Trading: Modest Strength Early, Choppy Middle and Solid Gains Late

&gt; Historically, the first trading day of December, today, has a slightly bearish bias with S&amp;P 500 advancing 34 times over the last 69 years (since 1950) with an average loss of 0.02%. Tomorrow, the second trading day of December however, has been stronger, up 52.2% of the time since 1950 with an average gain of 0.08% and the third day is better still, up 59.4% of the time.

&gt; Over the more recent 21-year period, December has opened with strength and gains over its first seven trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year when last minute selling, most likely for tax reasons, briefly interrupts the market’s rally.

# Odds Still Favor A Gain for Rest of December Despite Rough Start

&gt; Just when it was beginning to look like trade was heading in a positive direction, the wind changed direction again. Yesterday it was steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina and today a deal with China may not happen as soon as previously anticipated. The result was the worst first two trading days of December since last year and the sixth worst start since 1950 for S&amp;P 500. DJIA and NASDAQ are eighth worst since 1950 and 1971, respectively.

&gt; However, historically past weakness in early December (losses over the first two trading days combined) were still followed by average gains for the remainder of the month the majority of the time. DJIA has advanced 74.19% of the time following losses over the first two trading days with an average gain for the remainder of December of 1.39%. S&amp;P 500 was up 67.65% of the time with an average rest of month gain of 0.84%. NASDAQ is modestly softer advancing 61.11% of the time during the remainder of December with an average advance of 0.30%.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
stocks,Has $NFLX reached peak market penetration in the US?,"The below table is adapted directly from the Netflix Q3 2019 earnings report. According to Netflix, their churn rate, i.e. people unsubscribing, is around 9% per quarter. Using this, one can calculate the total churn, the gross added subscriptions as well as the net added subscriptions. CAC (customer acquistion cost) is calulated by dividing marketing spend by gross added subscriptions, netCAC by dividing marketing spend by net added subscriptions. Numbers in thousands, apart from CAC and netCAC.

&amp;#x200B;

||Q1 2018|Q2 2018|Q3 2018|Q4 2018|Q1 2019|Q2 2019|Q3 2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Subscript.|55.087|55.959|56.957|58.486|60.229|60.103|60.620|
|Marketing|$250.719|$251.298|$210.595|$312.739|$221.046|$250.606|$211.793|
|Churn|4.958|5.036|5.126|5.264|5.421|5.409|5.456|
|Gross add|7.030|5.830|6.034|6.655|7.007|5.295|5.926|
|Net add|2.277|872|998|1.529|1.743|(126)|517|
|CAC|$35.66|$43.11|$34.90|$46.99|$31.55|$47.33|$35.74|
|netCAC|$110.11|$288.19|$211.02|$204.54|$126.82|($1988.94)|$409.66|

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, CAC has only risen marginally. netCAC however - which is the important metric - has reached enormous levels. The marginal cost of adding one additional subscriber is nearly $410 - equal to more than 16 quarters of average revenue (\~$25). So right now it takes more than 16 quarters for a new user to just recoup the marketing spend.

The outlook: Netflix own estimates for total domestic subscriptions is 61.220.000 - that is adding 600.000 new subscribers in Q4. They also stated that marketing spend will be more weighted towards the fourth quarter. Let's just assume a lower bound of $312 million - which would be the same spend as in Q4 2018. In reality, marketing spend should be closer to $400 million, thanks to new competitors (Apple TV, Disney+, NBCUniversal's Peacock...). But numbers are already disastrous with the lower bound. $312 million for 600 thousand new subscriptions is around $520 per effective new subscriber. That is more than 20 quarters - or five years.

These numbers are unsustainable. Effectively, Netflix has reached its peak user baser in the US. There are around 129 million households in the US. Nearly 50% have a Netflix subscription (probably even more, if you consider shared accounts). There is just no one left who would still become a new Netflix subscriber.

At the same time, new competitors enter the ring (as mentioned above). Which means, that the churn rate might rise a little bit. Maybe up to 10%, maybe even 12%. More importantly though: the users who decide for a subscription service have a choice now. Disney+ is only $7 a month. And they've spent the last two years acquiring licenses for all time classic movies and series. This makes them a lot more attractive than Netflix.

Some people might even consider Apple TV - others have Amazon Prime Video. There is also Hulu, HBO Go and NBCUniversal's Peacock. What all of those companies have in common: They are not solely reliant on streaming as a source of revenue. Apple and Amazon have pockets deeper than the Mariana trench. Netflix doesn't. In fact, Netflix burns around $3.5 billion dollars of cash this year. And the year before. They have amassed more than $32 billion in debt. Financed through junk bonds. Just in 2019, their interest payments will be more than $600 million. Those numbers are rising dramatically. Unless they raise new capital...

Netflix uses the cash to produce new content. All kinds of movies and series. But here is the trap: In the moment they stop, people will unsubscribe. They do not have the same library depth anymore. I remember when I could watch ""The Godfather"" on Netflix (I am located in Germany). Not anymore. Same with other favourite movies of mine. So all Netflix has remaining, are their own productions. And so they have to produce and produce and produce more shows - while prices for production increase and they suddenly have to share the market with more players.

Internationalisation does not help much, since different cultures prefer different content. Series like ""Casa de papel"" which cater to an international audience are rare. So what should Netflix do? Continue their content-producing spending spree, getting more and more into debt? What if interest rates rise and suddenly they have to pay 8% or more?

Their latest issued bond is already at 6.375%:

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/netflix\_incdl-notes\_201919-29-bond-2029-us64110lax47](https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/netflix_incdl-notes_201919-29-bond-2029-us64110lax47)

So that means they have to stop spending so much on production and marketing. Unfortunately though, that would make people leave the platform even quicker. Also, they would lack arguments as to why people should subscribe in the first place.

Lastly, international growth will not help to ease the pressure. Each market wants their own series and movies. New markets are more expensive. And there will hardly be a market with similarly high revenue per subscription as the US.

While I am positive that Netflix will find its way - $150 billion market valuation is just 70% too much for a company that stopped growing in its most important market and burns $3.5 billion in cash every year. Financed by more and more expensive junk bonds and trapped in a ""damned if you do, damned if you do"" situation, there is really no basis whatsoever for a valuation as right now.

personalfinance,Advice For Buying A Home in A City Facing Explosive Growth,"Hey all,

My girlfriend recently got a new job that has opened doors for her (and us) financially. 

She works in my hometown, which has been seeing explosive growth for the past decade or so. Her industry is as bulletproof as any industry can be. So we are confident she is going to be bringing in what she's getting for many more years to come, we are just playing it safe and not budgeting around expected salary increases or promotions during that time.

I'm finishing up an advanced degree and working at a great place that is preparing me for the rest of my career 3 hours away from her. I'll be moving on next December and hoping to work for one of three companies in my hometown that have already expressed direct interest in hiring me as well as getting married (we can move up marriage if it would open crucial doors for us financially).

My monthly expenses are minimal. I live like a Spartan. She on the other hand has $8k in credit card debt (we're looking at options to consolidate), a sorta high rent for the area, is looking at getting a newish used car by the end of the year, and before this new job was effectively paycheck to paycheck.

We both have student loans, hers are all through the government. Mine are mostly private but manageable and both of ours are deferred for now.

I understand PMI, 20% down payments, all the costs associated with owning a home, and an optimum situation for buying a first home.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I think our situation is special in that the housing market in our area is ONLY going to go up and get more competitive even in another Recession (it went WAY up during the last one), yet house prices are for the most part still reasonable (Southwest), and we would be okay getting locked into where we are for the next decade. Also even if our careers took us out of state we would have many reasons for wanting to hold onto property in this area.

&amp;#x200B;

Who would we be able to talk to honestly about utilizing any state and federal programs or grants for home ownership, and if buying a home makes sense or if we are just getting restless to start our life together and stop paying rent? She is looking for a new apartment soon and any apartment suitable for a young (effectively single) professional woman is looking to be about 2x any mortgage we would be looking at, and rents are only going up.",finance

personalfinance,Contribute to Emergency Fund or Pay Off Student Loans?,"Single, 23M, live at home (no rent), full-time job - average $2750 bring home. This is after insurance, taxes, investments, and charitable donations.

I follow a monthly budget. Monthly expenses are under $1,000 even with the student loans budgeted in. It would be far lower, but I live with my parents and help them with some of their bills as well. I am relatively frugal - the biggest expense is food, around $300 per month. I contribute the minimum amount to my employer-sponsored 401(k) to take advantage of their match.

I currently have $7,250 in a HYSA.

I currently have the following student loans with a minimum monthly payment of $130.03 that will begin December 9th:

|Disbursement Date|Type|Current Principal|Interest Rate|Outstanding Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|08/22/2016|Subsidized|$4,500.00|3.510 %|$11.68|

|08/23/2018|Unsubsidized|$2,101.60|4.800 %|$7.46|
|Total||$22,005.85||$68.27|

Do I:

1. Use the funds in my HYSA (excluding $1,000 as an Emergency Fund Reserve) in combination with any left-over income to pay-off my loans as quickly as possible
2. Increase my Emergency Fund in my HYSA to an arbitrary $15,000 as quickly as possible (I assume this would be 6+ months of expenses if I was paying rent, had a car payment, etc.)
3. Do I leave the funds in the HYSA as is for the time being, and use all of my left-over funds to pay-off my loans as quickly as possible.

investing,Corporate 401k rollover to IRA,"Hi Reddit,

I work for a large conglomerate company with many parts about 10 I think. We have a 401k as part of our benefit package that is sponsored by the parent company. I actually work for one of the small companies that are part of that conglomerate, the part I work for got sold off and out of the conglomerate to my surprise many other people's too, it was just out of the blue. We were notified by email that we could no longer make 401K contributions the next day after the company sold.

I set up a IRA at Vanguard the morning after the sell off/buy out, called the bank that manages the 401K  to get instructions on moving my retirement over to the IRA and was told I wasn't allowed. I reached out to Vanguard for advice and they called the managing bank and we were told the same thing.

I guess I've always assumed if an employee left a company for whatever reason their retirement benefits 401K could be moved to whatever IRA company they wanted? I've been checking the status of my 401K and the parent company logo is still on the 401K status page, the only option I can make is ""Withdraw"" the amount and pay the federal and state taxes and early withdraw penalties.

The company I work for was bought by a equity firm, the admin of both companies say they are working on a plan for our retirement benefits and healthcare benefits. I'd rather move my retirement benefits to Vanguard where I have a little more control and not being held hostage by a very large bank like I am now.

Is it normal to not be able to move/rollover 401K benefits to a different retirement account? I thought by now it would be normal for this type of thing to occur.

Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE:** 

I'm still employed by the same company and have been checking my 401K daily for changes. It's been going up with the market but I couldn't make any changes or make any contributions. On 12/23 I checked early in the morning, the 3 weeks prior to the Dec 23rd there was a ""Withdraw/Rollover"" menu but the only option was to ""Withdraw"" all or part of the 401K and pay the taxes and penalties. On Monday morning the ""Withdraw/Rollover"" actually has a ""**Rollover**"" function to move the 401K. I didn't move the funds to Vanguard yet, I'm going to see what happens with the new 401K the company comes up with.",finance

We currently have about $400 per month left over after bills and savings, and are debating our options. I can’t decide if we should:

A) put this towards our car payment, thereby shortening the life of the loan and possibly paying it off before we move, so we would have more monthly income for the new mortgage

Or 

B) put the money towards our current mortgage, hopefully increasing our profit (and down payment for the new house) when we sell.

Car balance: $18,811.08

I ""sell"" her my car and she takes on the loan, refinances the loan for a much much lower interest rate and i continue making payments at the rate I am paying now until it's paid off.

&amp;#x200B;

We know it will affect her credit and she is prepared for the impact, but has outstanding credit discipline and is not worried about rebuilding.

personalfinance,Please critique my plan to pay off my student loan debt (30k) before law school.,"I’m a junior in college from the U.S. that is looking to go to law school in the near future.

---

Current savings: $800

Expected debt at graduation: $25-35k ($15-25k of which will be 4.4-5.1% interest federal student loans, $10k at 0% interest as repayment to my father)

Employment: Part-time summer job at $11.30/hr, large retail store

Degree: In 3 more semesters, I will have a BA in a Psychology-related field

Estimated living expenses: Since I plan to live with my parents, I will have to cover partial food, partial rent, gas, car insurance (maybe), and other minor expenses (estimate: $200-600/month)

Other expenses: I have to buy a car at some point before going to law school. Probably will shop in the $2-6k range.

Current spending habits: I spend way too much money on dining out and I’m working to cut that down.

Investment experience: Very little

Why I am making this post: Stress coping :)

---

**The plan:**

Continue paying off interest on unsubsidized loans through school. Continue working at my current job over summer and through breaks, investing most of it into CDs or short-term bond funds. Secure a higher-paying job before graduation, ideally within 45 mins from home (income could range anywhere from 25k/year to 45k/year, if I had to guess, even if I keep my current position and moved to full-time). Build a $1500 emergency fund and keep in a HYSA. 65% of every paycheck will go into a HYSA/MMA (CDs and bond investments don't seem to be ideal for a 1-2 yr. timeframe), 5% will be added to the emergency fund, and the remaining 30% will go to my checking account for expenses (assuming I’m not paying into a retirement fund). Pay off school debt first using the avalanche method, buy my first car, then pay off my father. After doing this for 1-2 years, attend law school (and possibly take on more debt).

Anticipated question: *Why not just pay off the debt after going to law school? You’ll have a higher salary.*

This is because law schools prefer to see work experience after college. If I work of the debt before applying, I’m killing two birds with one stone.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it'll be a fun and volatile week.

In the background, there are ongoing global protests, there's the impeachment inquiry, and there's Rocketman. You also have very high government and student debt - and more recently, record levels of corporate and household debt.

The yield curve inversion has mostly been forgotten about and is now very uncool - but prior to the last few recessions, the curve inverted and the un-inverted a few months before the actual recession hit. The S&amp;P500 has gone up 5% since the September before the yield curve scare. 5% is not bad - 5% would double your money every 15 years, and it beats inflation. And that's measuring from the peak. We are up +30% from the lows.

There's been a bunch of shitty IPOs recently - large investment firms like SoftBank are losing their prestige while others like Berkshire are finding it hard to find a good reason to spend money. Sketchy stuff is starting to become a little more common - i.e. the infinite money glitch, 'House-Hacking' out of college, internet/catfishing/phone scams, commission-free stock betting, e-coin trading, etc. All of these I've seen mentioned as signs we are in the 'late-stage' of the investment cycle.

Negative yields are still a bit of a mystery. QE (or 'Not-QE'?) has been brought back and is here to stay. The Fed probably won't cut or hike at this next meeting, but markets think that there will be cut in 2020 - which isn't a great sign for the economy. Especially since, isn't QE supposed to end mid-2020? Every time the Fed has cut more than 75 basis points at a stretch, the economy ended up going into a recession.

Do any of these affect a companies stock price directly? Maybe not - but I think if markets do take a hit this week, and you're left holding the bag, you'll look pretty silly given all these 'indicators'. Especially if you're one of the lucky few who has seen the value of your investment rise 100% since the 2008 highs, or 400% from the 2009 lows and you're still pushing for more. We are at all-time highs, in a trade war with a country that just banned the use of foreign technology in their government offices. I think this fear in itself will cause an increase in volatility this week, even if markets stay strong.",finance

I will without a doubt be maxing out my Roth IRA and 401(k) at 15%. That will leave ~$1000/month to either invest or pay off my mortgage early. I’m curious, is it a option to invest in a Vanguard Brokerage account until the balance is enough to pay off a mortgage? In my head it makes sense as it will grow over time which means paying it off sooner. But not being familiar with taxes, etc. I’m not sure if this is a route usually taken.

Bitcoin,"Deutsche Bank summary Why inflation will rise and fiat will end,","I've made an summary for you to read from a report from Deutsche Bank. 

**TLDR;** Since we left the gold standard in the 1970', inflation started to soar. After a while inflation started to decline as to today level. This is mostly because of China entering the global economy in the 1980'. An enormous workforce entered the scene and suppressed the cost of labour. China's workforce will soon start to decline and will probably do so for at least 30 years. Hence we will have higer labour cost resulting in higher inflation on fiat money. Fiats might not survive higer inflation and thus alternatives will be more desired (Bitcoin).

**Long read**  
""We have lived in an era of fiat money since the early 1970s. Since then virtually all money in existence has only had a value based on trust and, in particular, trust in governments’ ability to maintain its value. Prior to this period, most of the money in existence through history was backed by a commodity – usually a precious metal like gold or silver. When money broke loose from such an arrangement inflation tended to increase (often dramatically), and when money returned to it inflation was becalmed. **We think fiat money systems should be inherently unstable and prone to high inflation all other things being equal.** Politically it is always too tempting to create money when nothing is backing it. That this current fiat system has survived so long has required a fortuitous set of global forces across multiple decades that have created sizeable natural offsetting disinflationary forces. The forces that have held the current fiat system together now look fragile and they could unravel in the 2020s. If so, that will start to lead to a backlash against fiat money and demand for alternative currencies, such as gold or crypto could soar. ""

"" Inflation in the twentieth century had a strange journey. After the gold based Bretton Woods global system collapsed in the early 1970s it contributed to a huge rise in inflation across the globe during the remainder of the decade. Although the oil shocks were partly to blame, the fact that the shackles of the Bretton Woods system were removed, and countries were freer to borrow and find ways of liberalising finance and credit, surely contributed to the inflation surge. ""

""By the end of the 1970s, some feared the battle against inflation would be lost. Then a miracle occurred. Inflation began a 40-year structural decline that stretches to the current day and concerns about fiat currencies have been virtually non-existent. \[..\]  **Chinese demographics were arguably the biggest suppressors of global inflation over the last four decades.** At work was an extraordinary surge in the global labour supply at a time when globalisation and deregulation in the global economy were taking off. As such, for the last 40 years, pressure on wages, prices, and with them inflation, has been under constant pressure. And that occurred independent of central bank or government policy.  ""

""\[...\] The peak of the ’working age population’ in the More Developed World plus China occurred this past decade. As we move into a new decade, the supply of labour from the key global regions will, in aggregate, **start to decline.** ""

""Will fiat currencies survive if labour’s share of GDP reverses? Addressing the increasing gap between capital and labour with higher wages would undoubtedly be good news. However the problem for the current global monetary system is that over the last 45-50 years it has **relied on governments and central banks being able to turn on the stimulus spigots at the drop of a hat when a crisis has come. This has enabled each crisis to be dealt with via increasing leverage rather than creative destruction type policies. For this to be possible an offset has been needed to such stimulus to prevent such policies being inflationar**y. Fortunately (or unfortunately if you believe it is an inherently unstable equilibrium) the external global downward pressure on labour costs ensured that this occurred. ""

""So what will happen to the global monetary system if labour costs start to reverse their 40-year trend? If central banks have their current mandates of keeping inflation around two per cent then they will be duty bound to tighten policy more often regardless of the external environment. However, such an outcome is probably unrealistic given how much debt there is at a global level. Governments will surely first change central bank mandates to allow for higher inflation or look to reduce their independence rather than allow interest rates to rise and make debt levels uncomfortable. Ultimately, if and when labour costs rise at the margin rather than fall, there will likely be a more difficult environment for policy makers. And where politicians are worried about elections, it is likely that inflation will be the casualty. ""

&amp;#x200B;

""Higher trending inflation will mean bond yields become very vulnerable, especially relative to near record (multi-century) lows apparent today. **Given the near record level debt burdens around the world, it is likely that central banks will be forced to buy more securities again to ensure yields stays comfortably below nominal GDP**. In turn, this will likely lock in **higher inflation as negative real yields will eventuate,** and thus very loose financial conditions and higher wages. Eventually, it is possible that inflation will become more and more embedded in our system and doubts will rise about the sustainability of fiat money. **The demand for alternative currencies will therefore likely be significantly higher by the time 2030 rolls around**. Will fiat currencies survive the policy dilemma that authorities will experience as they try to **balance higher yields with record levels of debt**? That’s the multi-trillion dollar (or **bitcoin**) question for the decade ahead. """,cryptocurrency

&amp;#x200B;

 *How governments will respond to record debt* 

 *So, whether it is due to unfavourable demographics, unfunded liabilities, democracies unable to spend less than they tax, or weak productivity and economic growth, it seems inevitable that government debt will continue to grow out to 2030 and beyond. At normalised interest rates, it will likely be a matter of time before a huge global debt crisis takes hold. With yields close to zero or in negative territory across the majority of the globe, it is possible to comfortably run much higher levels of debt than past textbooks would have suggested and reduce the scale of its accumulation. With funding so easy and populism so high, the temptation will build among politicians to enact helicopter-money policies and what amounts to even more debt. Expect that by 2030 government debt will have increased across the globe but that it will be mitigated by a decade where nominal yields are kept well below nominal GDP growth with aggressive central bank action.*

personalfinance,DEBT: Feeling Stuck In My Financial Situation &amp; Want To Know The Best Way To Handle It,"Hello /r/personalfinance!

I am a 24 year old male living in Atlanta, GA and I feel like I'm trapped in my current financial situation. This post is being made on a throw away account as I don't want financial details on my main account. I am seeking some advice on how to make the smartest choices that I can to get out of debt. 

First off, I have read the advice posted on the wiki but I am still unsure of the best way to approach the debt I have. In order to properly explain the situation I feel that it is best to explain how I got into it. I went to a fairly big art school and received a BFA in animation. While there I met my now fiance and we moved in together in Atlanta in search of jobs (she is also an animator). She managed to land a job fairly quickly and has had fairly stable work. I have had some luck with animation jobs but it has not been as consistent. In the time between jobs I started up as a barista to get some money coming in while I sort out a new art job. This temporary position will be coming up on a year very soon. I had originally planed to only be a barista for a few months and planed my money around that. In that time I have also had to spend over a thousand to fix my car and keep it running. I also proposed to my now fiance when I was in a better financial spot and have to plan for the wedding and honeymoon (this will be in October of 2020 but our families are helping out a lot).

I currently have less than $700 in my bank account and can't even begin to imagine looking into things like a retirement plan.** There are some details that I feel are important and want to make sure I bring up in this post:


*I have a decent FICO score of 710


*I currently only have one bank that I use (Wells Fargo)


*My fiance uses a separate bank and makes more than double what I make at my job


*I am looking into a job where I might be making closer to $13-$15 an hour but nothing is set in stone yet


*I have opened a savings account at Wells Fargo but I have been putting all of my money into paying off my debt. There is very little in the savings account (roughly $60)


*I have almost never missed a payment on any of my debts but fear that I can't keep up anymore


I have looked into things like consolidating my debt to try and lower my interest and monthly payment but I don't know where to start. I am also worried about falling even deeper into debt with loans. Also, my fiancée and I have been trying to split most bills 50/50 but I feel like I can't keep up with this. Should I keep trying to split things this way or does it make more sense to reevaluate things and find a new way to approach bills together? On that note, does it make sense to open up new bank accounts or a joint account with my fiance? I started using Personal Capital today and was surprised when it mentioned that most people link something like 6 bank accounts.

Thank you all for the advice listed on this subreddit! Even just looking at the sidebar wikis has helped me o lot so far. I just want to make sure I'm doing everything to the best of my ability as I feel like I have missed the mark over the last year.

**EDIT:** Okay, so this post is getting way more attention than I thought it would and I don't think I will be able to respond to everyone (at least not right away). I feel the need to elaborate on a few things that may have been unclear or not specific enough in my original post. First off, let me break down the specifics of my student loans. There are 8 total that are being paid through Nelnet:

A. Interest Rate: 3.61% - $2945.53


B. Interest Rate: 3.61% - $1901.03


C. Interest Rate: 4.41% - $3741.33


D. Interest Rate: 4.41% - $1889.45


E. Interest Rate: 4.04% - $1793.70


F. Interest Rate: 3.51% - $4536.28


G. Interest Rate: 3.51% - $4536.28


H. Interest Rate: 3.51% - $1706.64


I have been looking up the best ways to tackle these and it sound like the avalanche method is the best approach.


Second, I mentioned another figure of $5,500. This is split between my Wells Fargo card ($3,315.67), my computer ($1515.19), and my car that I am paying off with a Synchrony credit card ($670.14). My Synchrony credit card's interest rate at 24.9%. If I'm being honest, I'm unsure of the exact interest rate of the other two and I don't know where/how to find them. I know that my Dell account has a maximum interest rate of around 29% but I believe mine is a lot lower. My Wells Fargo card is between 15.49% - 27.49%. It is embarrassing to admit that I don't know how to find these exact rates but that is part of the reason I am here. In addition, someone mentioned that they did not see things like a phone plan or food mentioned. My fiancée and I split our grocery bill 50/50 and I am on a family plan with my family back home.


Also, I am well aware that I need a higher paying job. Trust me, I think about that every day. I spend a lot of time on job sites like LinkedIn, Glass Door, Indeed, etc. I also spend a lot of time on freelancing sites like Fiverr and UpWork. My issue is that I am having trouble knowing what to look for outside of my field as everything I learned at college prepared me for a very specific type of job. I am not working as a barista because I want to be. I have been on the job search the entire time I have been working there and I am unsure what kinds of entry level jobs to look for as someone with my skill set.


Lastly, I Know that my situation is bad. I know that I have made some very dumb decisions to get to this point. I have spent a lot of time over the last year ignoring how bad things are and distracting myself from the reality of the situation I'm in. I am not looking for a quick fix. I am not looking for some magical cure to delete all my debt and have my dream job handed to be on a silver platter. I know that this will take a lot of work. Years of it. But I am willing to put in that work to dig myself out of this hole. I just need some guidance on the best way to do that. Thank you to everyone who has been respectful in offering their input and advice. I truly means a lot that you took time out of your day to help me.",finance

personalfinance,Question on long term financial costs: comparing a mortgage to renting,"From what I understand, it's universally accepted that a mortgage is often worth the debt and interest paid due to property appreciation over time. However, obviously this assumption is based on considerable appreciation (which has been observable throughout recent history).

With the knowledge that rent is cheaper than a mortgage payment, with no debt interest being paid, the short term seems to always favor renting unless there is enormous appreciation.



For the long term comparison, does anyone know what percentage of home appreciation is required to outperform a renter who invests the difference of price + interest?



Example:

John purchases a $300,000 home with a 6% down payment ($18,000). He has a interest rate of 3.6%. It takes him 20 years to pay off the mortgage entirely, and winds up paying a good amount of interest (not sure how to do the math, some help here would be appreciated!).

Claire rents a home and pays $200 less monthly than John, and pays no interest. She also avoids liability for appliances, upkeep, property taxes, etc. At the exact same time as John, she invests the down payment amount ($18000) and the $200 per month she saves as a renter, into the stock market with a portfolio that returns 6% annually.


How much would John's home need to appreciate to outperform Claire's investment decision to rent instead of buy?

personalfinance,Is this a good deal? Truck talk,"Hey all,

I’m looking for opinions on this matter as I want to see if the decision I’m about to make is worthwhile. I’m looking at buying a new truck. I understand a newer vehicle is a depreciating asset, and if I didn’t get such a good deal I wouldn’t be looking twice. 
2019 Crew cab Ram 1500 Warlock, fully loaded but doesn’t include (remote starter, or Bedliner) other then that has every option i want,
MSRP of this truck is a whopping 62,000$
I’m getting this truck for 39,000 that’s a crazy 23,000 off suggested price, based on an 8 year-2.99 percent interest rate.
5k down
Payments are 225$ bi weekly.

Basically the worry of buying a vehicle that expensive would be how much money lost on the 62,000 right off the lot but with that 23,000 off how can I not? I can realistically (if I wanted) resell this truck in a few years and make my money back? 
I clear 3,000$ month CAD
I have 450$ mortgage payment monthly and between utilities heat light food and spending money roughly my expenses without the truck is 1,000$ per month with 2,000 left over.

personalfinance,Student loan refinancing,"Hey all - I have been reading a number of posts regarding student loan options and would love any advice from the r/personalfinance community since there seem to be some people knowledgeable about the process on reddit.

As a quick background - I have approximately $190k in student loan debt from medical school. I'm completing a fellowship in a relatively competitive subspecality and will, therefore, soon have more discretionary income to tackle the loans (\~$350k/year). I had initially intended to use PSLF since I have been in training for the past 7 years making monthly PAYE payments. While I initially met all the requirements, the group I have signed on to join at the completion of my fellowship (July 2020) does not meet the employer definition since they are a for-profit healthcare group. I do not see myself every returning to the public sector based on the area I am moving.  Therefore, I am consider re-financing at a lower interest rate. Currently my loans are the federal government level of 6.8% interest. Given that I have been paid a slave salary (based on work hours) I have been unable to refinance because the monthly payments would be too great.

Essentially I was wondering if anyone had any advice on re-financing since I do not think I will qualify for PSLF. I have read a bit on whitecoatinvestor and the [/r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance) \- but would appreciate any advice from someone directly.

personalfinance,(kind of long) Should I pay most of my debt with stocks/savings I've acquired over the last five years?,"I graduated college in June of 2014.  I worked throughout college, two jobs at some points.  They were low paying jobs and I took out quite a bit of student loans to get me through.  I was literally flat broke when graduating, and I had a bunch of credit card and medical debt.  Thankfully, I got a job right out of school and I've gotten some pretty good raises over the last couple of years.  I paid off the credit cards and medical bills as soon as I had the money.   After renting places with friends for four years, I bought a condo in Oceanside.  I have one roommate who pays $1k in rent per month.  Besides that, the only other debt I have is my student loan, which I've been trying to dump money into to get it done.  The interest rate is 5.0%, So not horrible, but it's still cost me over $9k in interest over the last five years.  I'm sick of that dark cloud hanging over me and I want it gone.  I've participated in the company's Employee Sock Purchase Program pretty much the whole time I've worked here, I've had an Acorns account for about five years and I've saved a bit of cash.  I owe $27,000 on my student loan.  The last eight-ish months I've been putting $1,300 towards it, which ends up being about $1,150 towards principal.  I've seen the balance decrease, which is a good feeling, but I'm sick of that debt and that feeling of $1k a month being spent on that (the minimum payment is like $265, but at that rate it would never get paid off) and I know I can reduce that to have more cash each month, but I want that thing done.

Should I sell my stock assets and clean out most of my savings (I'd save some for an emergency) and dump $20k at it and have only $7k left that I can pay off by August of 2020 and then use the money I no longer have to re-up my savings..?  the thought of being able to save that money, or dump it into my condo is appealing.  I'm paying PMI on the condo, and by being able to dump an extra $1000 a month on that would quickly get rid of the PMI, avoid a ton of interest and allow me to build equity quicker.  The stigma of student loans is that they're a long game and everyone has them.  It hasn't prevented me from buying a condo, and my credit score is great, but I just don't want that debt.  I've wasted close to $10k on interest and I don't want to keep handing them more money.

&amp;#x200B;

Using round numbers:

Salary: $93,000

Rental Income: $12,000 ($1,000/month)

Acorns: $5,800

Stocks (total of my sell-able portfolio): $10,000

Savings account I'm willing to part with: $4,000

Total Student Debt Left: $28,000

Mortgage: $313,000

Home Value: $345,000

financialindependence,Help me understand/model the tax details of executing a Roth conversion while living off a taxable brokerage account in ER,"I've been trying to better understand FIRE as it could be applied to my situation (relatively high income, relatively short career) and I've spent a considerable amount of time modeling a FIRE trajectory in Excel. Through some analysis and reading, it seems like a few assumptions are either optimal or necessary when trying to go from zero to retired in 10 years or less. Just to cover my assumptions:

* 401k/IRA contributions are limited to a max of about $57k/year if self-employed, which will not be sufficient for ER by itself in a short accumulation period

* Post-tax contributions through Roth via MBD make little sense with an average tax rate of &gt;25% and some income approaching the top bracket

* Roth conversion over 10+ years ER could be very tax efficient

* Living off a mixture of contributions and LTCG from a brokerage account theoretically opens the entire earned income space for Roth conversion (?)

So that last point is what I was hoping to get help with... If I'm socking away potentially $100k/year in a brokerage account with no special tax status, how would I go about estimating tax burden when drawing from the account after ER? Which dollars are going to be taxed as contributions (i.e. potentially untaxed like savings?) vs. which dollars are going to qualify for LTCG? I was reading about some threshold income where no LTCG is owed, which would affect how much income I can use in the Roth conversion? It's all fairly confusing - more confusing than building a function that can calculate federal tax on earned income in each bracket, which was difficult enough.

How is it different for single vs. MFJ?

TL;DR: I want to figure out how aggressively I can convert Trad -&gt; Roth in ER without incurring lots of extra tax. It seems like converting about $38k/year could be done at a relatively low ~8% average rate (if taxed as ordinary income), but I don't fully understand the tax implications of living off brokerage account and its interaction with Roth conversion at higher rates.

defi,DeFi Needs Privacy: Here’s Why,"DeFi Needs Privacy: Here's Why

As we understand it, privacy is a relatively new concept.
The idea that people should have a right to privacy has evolved as the development of new technology has given us new expectations - and posed new threats - with regard to our personal privacy.
As we develop a decentralized financial (DeFi) system, it's critical to remember that any decentralized financial system worth having must respect the financial sovereignty of the individuals it serves.

To better understand the role of privacy in DeFi, this article provides a short history of the evolution of privacy, describes the role of privacy in DeFi, and explains what Plutus DeFi is doing to bring privacy to DeFi.

A Brief History of Privacy
Even expectations of physical privacy are relatively new. Internal walls separating the rooms of a home came about around 1500 A.D. and sleeping in your own bed only started becoming a thing around 1700 A.D.. In both cases, it still took decades, if not centuries for these norms to gain mainstream adoption.

The Right to Privacy, written by Samuel D. Warren; Louis D. Brandeis and published in the Harvard Law Review in 1890, defined modern privacy as we know it.

In the essay, the authors describe the growing potential for governments and businesses to encroach on the privacy of the individuals they serve and argue that law must keep pace with technological advancements:
Recent inventions and business methods call attention to the next step which may must be taken for the protection of the person, and for securing to the individual what Judge Cooley calls the right ""to be let alone."" Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprises have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life; and numerous mechanical devices threaten to make good the prediction that ""what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from the house-tops.""

Privacy has also been recognized on the international stage. Article 12 of the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, published by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on December 10, 1948 states that:
""No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.""

Today, the issue of privacy remains as important and relevant as ever. As technology continues to redefine the way we communicate, new threats and tools for dealing with them constantly race to stay ahead of the curve.

Privacy in DeFi
With all of the excitement around the composability of the products and protocols in DeFi and the impressive interest rates offered by decentralized lending products, it's easy to forget about the importance of privacy.

Some contend that applications using blockchain shouldn't be intended for privacy, the logic essentially being that the whole point is to maintain a public record of transactions.

Transaction data, however, doesn't necessarily need to reveal any personally identifiable information that could be correlated with an individual person using a given application.

As described on the website set up by the companies pioneering DeFi as a concept, ""market-level information should be transparent to all participants while still preserving individual privacy.""
Important as transparency may be - it is one of the founding principles of DeFi, after all - promoting transparency at the market-level doesn't necessarily mean exposing the identity of participants in the system.


Without privacy, a decentralized financial system will suffer many of the same pitfalls as our current financial system. From inappropriate censorship and the exposure of customers' personal information to outright theft, consumers must tiptoe through a minefield of potential problems when dealing with today's financial institutions.",cryptocurrency

Last year we bought a new house and moved out of my old one and had it renovated for sale.  When it sells this week, I should receive about $58k in equity.  

We bought my new house for $365k at 3.75% and put a $200k down payment on it.  We followed that up with an additional $40k on it.  We have the option to adjust interest rates but we haven’t done that as of now.  The additional money we are paying goes toward principal. 

I have about $210k spread between a brokerage account, various 401ks, a Roth IRA and a 529 to be used for my kids.  My wife has a comparable amount of money in her 401k (she may have a bit more but for sake of conversation, let’s just double mine).  

After next pay period, I’ll have about $95k in the bank.  We have no debt to speak of.  We have older cars, my wife needs a new one as it is getting problematic and I’m tired of wrenching on it, but my old truck is humming along happily (albeit at shitty gas mileage).  

Every month I put a grand in a 401k and about $300 I dump into the brokerage account so that it stays at the same balance after I dump the max into my Roth IRA at the beginning of each year.  

When we receive the check from my old house next week, that is all (minus the $1500 it will cost to put floor pans in my 1950 Plymouth), going towards the mortgage in the new house, which should bring us to right around 70k owed on a 15 year note that started at 175k (which isn’t bad for a year).

My wife and I are having a disagreement though.  I want to throw an additional 30k at the mortgage (bringing our checking down down to 65k) and then just keep paying at the same rate until I run out of work (I’m very well paid, but my career exemplifies the saying “Feast or Famine”).

 - Are there any downsides to it? I mean, if these accounts have that much of a better interest rate on them why doesn't everyone use them?

 - Would it be wise to open an account with a different bank for the high yield account (intending for me to basically just not touch) and just have my work deposit X% of my paycheck into that and have the other % sent to my USAA account for things like rent/bills/food and just not touch the other account?

I talked with my student loan vendor navient and my monthly payment is min 236. Im in a 10yr plan but im not going to go 10yrs with this as i will be paying way to much in interest over the yrs. My min payment for the bike is 218. I made an initial payment of 244.01 and i plan on doing another. My first due date however is jan 1



My Plan
Is to pay off my loan on the motorcycle first. As one its the highest apr rate and i will be paying approximately 2200+ in interest in 1yr!! This loan is a 55 month plan but im prioritizing it based on apr. My next is to tackle the highest apr rate on my student loan. So i would pay the 236 then allocate money to the highest apr


What am i planning on doing for monthly payments for my motorcycle? Call me dumb but 700-800. Do i have a budget.. Yes. Do i spend lavishly on things i dont need or things i want no.

I have 2 credit cards discover and capitol one. I make multiple payments a month. For example if i have 200 to pay. I divise it into chunks of lets say 7 spaced out. Previously i didnt do this but now i am and im trying to have all my cards at balance 0 at the end of each month


Edit 1: I'm seeking advice on paying loans both student and moto. No one answered the main question. I'm not seeking to get told my salary is absurdly low. I and my colleagues on the same dam salary know its shit even the seniors and managers here said to leave and come back lol. My main concern is is my plan financially sound. I know until I pay off my loans I'm technically making no money. I'm at a negative balance but I'm also pushing myself to seek other avenues of extra income and potentially start a side business with my technical expertise as well as marketing and selling products. Will I admit buying the moto while I have student loans was dumb YES but this is all a learning experience financially",finance
stocks,Fedex earnings call,"FedEx is announcing earnings next week dec 17th. The stock is at a good price but has a lot of variables playing for it. Here is what i have

1. 15% electronics tarif will go in affect on Sunday night if no deal is achieved or if trump doesn’t push them. This will kill bestbuy, Apple ,...etc 

2. Fedex is tied to trade significantly. Every time China is mentioned this past  year the stock moves( 2-6%). Last quarter the cut guidance down due to trade tensions and stock went from 175  ( which was recovering ) to 139 huge L this means that the bar is low. If they do raise guidance expect the stock to move up bigely  

3. It seems like news is mixed on the deal. A bit more optimistic. My opinion is trump needs the deal be re-elected. However this is only phase one. I am worried he might  not push tarifs since job report last week was great and consumer spending is high. On the other hand pushing the tariffs will be positive news specifically for fedex it will also help trump have one less war to fight on the world stage ( he has France , China , Brazil all trade ) impeachment internally 

4. Online spending is sky rocketing this means returns will be high both of which will reflect positively for shipping. 

5. Most of the retailers (target , bestbuy and Macy’s ) shipped in UPS while few were fedex (Walmart) 

6. Fedex has strong flight shipping vs ups focuses on ground so maybe they have a partnership on some routes that I am kissing. I reached out to friends in Texas, Chicago and Minneapolis  same companies used same carrier( UPS) keep in mind this isn’t a big sample size to determine the population at all ) 

7. Fedex had a huge job shortage because of the holiday season. They had to hire somewhere around 10,0000 additional sorters . It reached a point where they had bus people accords state lines to their main facility

personalfinance,How fast to pay off student loans?,"Hi all,

Here is my current situation:

I have $13,500 left on my student loans. I started with $26,000 two years ago and have since paid down quite a bit. Most of my student loans are sitting at 3.6%, but I have one at 4.2% that I have been aggressively paying off (down to $1,200). The rest of them had higher interest rate than those two, but they gone.

ATM, I have $13k in retirement savings and $14k in savings as an 3-6 month emergency fund (most in a high interest savings). For my own peace of mind, I like having that money set aside. After all is said an done, around 30% of my income each month with 15% going into retirement and 15% going into savings/investments.

My question: Should I aggressively pay off the remainder of the student loan balance or should I just let it pay down on its normal cycle after I pay off the 4.2% loan? It doesn't seem super worthwhile to be paying more towards 3.6% loans; however, I like it from a psychological standpoint.

Overall, my student loans are manageable and they are not causing any financial stress. This is the only debt left between my spouse and I except for our mortgage.",finance

That means  we also need to create something similar to the Federal Reserves or The  Treasury. The requirement is that it has to be decentralized. The  Reserves would need to be able to hold several different cryptos such as  Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, USDC, Tether etc. Lets assume that on this  STABLE protocol there is a good implementation of a decentralized  exchange. The Reserves would need to be able to mint STABLEcoins and buy  other cryptos for collateral and store them in the Reserves, and they  would also need to be able to sell cryptos that are already in the reserves to buy back STABLEcoins.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,Self-employed for the first time - very overwhelmed when it comes to figuring out taxes.,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here and I appreciate any advice or information you can give me. I just started driving for Door Dash and Uber Eats in California this week full time and planning for it to be my main source of income for 2020.

Naturally this means that I am responsible for setting aside a portion of this income to cover State and Federal taxes on top of now being in charge of paying my monthly health insurance costs out of pocket rather than having it deducted from my check when I was a W2 employee. However, I am not sure what is the best way to set aside this money or how much I should be setting aside when I do. 

I am also applying for insurance through Uber and Stride, which goes through Covered CA. In the application they are asking for deductions like self-employment tax and business expense, etc to be listed as anticipated deductions for 2020, but I have no idea what they will be. Do I have to list these deductions now?

Here are some details:

- Goal is to earn at least $500-$700 a week
- I also recieve $400 in monthly child support

Please let me know if I've missed any relevant information. I have been trying my best to figure this out on my own, but I'm becoming very overwhelmed very quickly, since these are things I've never had to think about before.

personalfinance,Got a notice from IRS that I owe money from 2017 because of canceled student loan debt. Why is this counted against me as taxable income when I obviously didn't gain any money from it?,"I received a notice from the IRS a few days ago informing me that I owed them an amount of roughly 5k for my taxes in 2017. According to them, this is because of a loan (a student loan) that was canceled, for roughly 19k. So they added this to my taxable income for that year (going from 15k to 35k) and are now saying I need to either agree to pay it or disagree in the form of a letter with documentation supporting why I disagree. 

The tricky part is this was never a loan that got forgiven or was canceled due to default. I actually never got any information on why it was canceled. In fact, I'm almost positive I'm still paying off this loan under a new bank. The bank I originally got the loan from (KeyBank) decided to transfer my loans to GreatLakes, which then later transferred half to another bank (Nelnet solutions). All of these were federal student loans and not private loans so I'm having a hard time understanding how this is counted against me as taxable income. It's not like by canceling the loan for 19k would put that lump sump back into my bank account for that year. I mean that's not how loans work... they are paid over time, so why am I being taxed like I got a bunch of extra income for the year? Is there any way I can fight this? It's not like I jumped tax brackets either, I mean I made roughly 32k AGI last year, so it is higher than 2017 but it's not like I'm making 50k+ all of a sudden. I don't have 5k to pay them and have no idea why it took them 2 years to figure this out... especially when I filed everything electronically. I figured the tax program would have found anything related to my loan at the time I did my taxes.

Any suggestions or advice would immensely help!",finance

personalfinance,How to calculate if a mortgage re-fi makes sense if currently on 10/1 ARM?,"As title states, I currently have a 10/1 ARM home loan. 

3.375% interest rate for 10 years, then it becomes adjustable for the remaining term.  (it's a 30 year loan.)  I'd be interested in doing a re-fi if the numbers make sense but I can't figure out how to calculate that.  (Since all the online calculators I've seen only seem to work with fixed rate mortgages.)

I've had the loan for 2 years now so I've got 8 years left before the rate changes. 

Other relevant details:

* Already pre-paying towards mortgage every month.  No other debt.  
* Obvious question is ""will I still be in the home when the rate is scheduled to change?""  I can't say for sure but my best guess is we'll be in this home another 10-15 years.  So I guess ""probably yes.""
* I already have a fully funded emergency fund, maxed 401k and also socking away money in taxable brokerage.  
* If the numbers make sense, I can afford the payments if we re-fi into a 15 year loan.

personalfinance,Capital Gain when selling a house in Ontario CA,"The government of Canada website reads as follows:

*When you sell your home, you may realize a capital gain. If the property was solely your principal residence for every year you owned it, you do not have to pay tax on the gain. If at any time during the period you owned the property, it was not your principal residence, or solely your principal residence, you might not be able to benefit from the principal residence exemption on all or part of the capital gain that you have to report.* 

It has been solely my fiance and I's permanent residence since we bought in April of 2018, so i'm assuming i don't pay any tax on ""money made"" when we sell.

Say i sell the house at the begging of the year and make $50,000. does this mean i'm now getting taxed 20.5% for the whole year? this would be a decent thing to keep in mind if i could sell at years end (or close to it)

personalfinance,Is it ever advisable to pay off a loan instead of credit cards to free up more money to use per month?,"So I have tons of credit card debt, and also a personal loan from a few years ago that I took out to help my mom out with some things. Unfortunately thinks spiraled out of control and I am doing terribly now. The loan was originally for $20,000 and has a mandatory minimum monthly payment of $670. The interest rate is 12.24%. I have $8679 left to pay on the loan currently and if the minimum is paid every month it will mature in February 2021. So that is 13 more months and 13 more payments to go.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously we all know that credit cards are much worse in terms of interest and we all know it costs more money to keep retaining a balance, however the minimum payments are much lower on those cards. For instance, my highest balance credit card is $13,800 and has a minimum payment of $360 - higher balance compared to the loan but the monthly payment is only about half as much.  


I am wondering if it would make more sense to focus on paying the loan as much as possible to get it paid off more quickly, at the expense of not paying credit card balances as much in the mean time. Then as soon as the loan is paid off, I will have an extra $670 every month I had been using to pay my loan, and can use it for my credit card repayment.   


The most stressful aspect of my life right now is how much money goes towards minimum monthly payments and having so little left over before I even get to what is left over to budget, and then everything remaining goes to credit cards. I am just starting out with the snowball method, but have such a long way to go. I feel like I am going to be miserable if I am just floating with so little progress made until I get the loan paid off and can starting making a bigger dent in the credit cards.  


Or does it seem like a better option to just keep going as is, keep putting everything possible towards credit cards and just accept I will need to be a hermit for the next 13 months?",finance

Bitcoin,The Federal Reserve's plan with Bitcoin,"[Chico Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dW549Ohkxo&amp;t=3s) from Youtube has been exposing truths behind Bakkt as Bakkt has been reluctant to provide a public custodian address where the funds will be held. A notable name Chico Crypto mentioned was Glenn Hutchins, a Director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, former adviser to President Clinton, and one of the biggest drivers behind the Lightning Network. Glenn is also in the Board of Directors at AT&amp;T.

This inspired me to research into what the future may HODL for us.

&amp;#x200B;

Glenn Hutchins' connections to Bakkt comes through ICE's partnership with Blockstream. Blockstream is the developer of The Lightning Network. Glenn Hutchins made a speech at Coindesk in 2016 [""Why Bitcoin Still Matters""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfSCCRHL4xc) 

I was shocked Glenn even spoke publicly on Bitcoin. He addresses the Lightning Network in this speech as fast, cheap, and transformative. The most notable points he made was:

""1. Providing the consumer or enterprise with a very simple technology that ***doesn't require them to figure out Bitcoin technologies***.

2. Giving consumers or enterprises something that works very quickly at very low cost and will have ***a massive opportunity in terms of profit pools*** that are available.

3. It is really important for this industry to embrace regulation for two reasons:

* Banks, deposit-taking institutions, and other parts of the financial services infrastructure will continue to be for a very long time period necessary for the Bitcoin ecosystem to work.
* Being able to work inside the framework of the legal and regulatory systems and the countries is going to be critical to being successful. The technology needs to work within the know your customer anti-money laundering anti-terrorism OFAT kind of control system, and ***if we get that right the consumers benefit right***. And if we get the regulatory environment right and also embrace Bitcoin technology for what it can do this is an industry that can be transformative in our lives **both commercially and personally**.""

Glenn also claims *to own a lot of bitcoin*.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Moving onto Bakkt, the following is a breakdown of their investors: Boston Consulting Group, Horizons Ventures Limited, Microsoft, and Naspers

&amp;#x200B;

The current CEO of Boston Consulting Group is Rich Lesser. In December 2016, [Lesser joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-strategic-and-policy-forum-includes-dimon-iger-schwarzman-2016-12) to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Horizons Ventures Limited includes early investors in Google Deep Mind, Dollar Shave Club, and Siri

&amp;#x200B;

Microsoft has been developing blockchain solutions through Azure. Microsoft is a member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and also chairs the Token Taxonomy Initiative that created the token framework. [Microsoft and Enjin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/azureheroes) have collaborated in a local pilot to create a blockchain based recognition programme on the Ethereum public blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

Pantera Capital - investments include Bakkt, Bitstamp, Brave, Ripple, Shapeshift, Zcash, 0x Protocol, Enigma, Kyber, OmiseGo, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Naspers - owner of PayU and largest **owner of Tencent Holdings Limited, the parent company of WeChat**

&amp;#x200B;

ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) - CEO is Jeffrey Sprecher, **husband of Bakkt CEO - Jeffrey Sprecher is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange**

&amp;#x200B;

Kelly Loeffler is the **CEO of Bakkt - new Republican Senator of Georgia 2019**, been seeking the Republican nomination since 2014 US Senate election in Georgia.

&amp;#x200B;

Johnnny Isakson preceded Kelly Loeffler as the Georgia Senator for 15 years. Johnny Isakson's political stance about the Environment, Healthcare, and Immigration is as follows:

In a series of roll call votes attached to debate about the Keystone Pipeline on January 21, 2015, he voted against Amendment 87 by Senator John Hoeven that climate change is real and human activity contributes to climate change, and against Amendment 58 by Senator Brian Schatz, that human activity ""significantly"" contributes to climate change. In 2015, he voted against the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan.

Isakson voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and has since voted over 60 times in favor of ending it.

Isakson favors tougher border security to address the immigration issue. **In 2019, he voted to support President Trump's national emergency declaration.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Trump's public views on Bitcoin are also commonly known from his [tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192) ""I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity... **We have only one real currency** in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is **called the United States Dollar!** ""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My key takeaways, thoughts, and questions are as follows:

1) Bakkt will introduce regulated retail payment solution for cryptocurrency. They will advertise that you can spend your cryptocurrency at Starbucks however they will conduct this to **collect Bitcoin on a large scale.** This will be facilitated by a closed system where you will not be able to use your cryptocurrency outside the Bakkt system.

2) The main driver behind The Lightning Network is an advocate for KYC. *If no KYC can you not participate in The LN?*

3) Why is there such a strong connection between Bitcoin, the Republican party, and the Trump administration?

4) Why is the largest investor in **WeChat** investing in Bakkt?

&amp;#x200B;

Let's just say that, once I have to pay these back, the monthly payment is going to be so bad that I will be going from making good money, straight to my student loans costing more per month than I even make. I am not kidding when I say that my life will be absolutely screwed and my bank account will be licked clean from these student loans each month and I will straight up no longer be able to afford anything whatsoever besides the student loans by themselves.

I've been looking into ""loan consolidation"" to at least balance it out so that my monthly payments are less than what I make per month, however I'm not sure the best companies that offer this. I attempted to do loan consolidation through the federal government, to which I've found that they don't accept Private Loans (I don't fk blame them, my loans are enough to put the Government into a second great depression!)

With that being said, I have no direction and my financial aid department and my college has never been a help and I don't know anyone else who's in the same boat as I am. Am I just screwed? Is there some sort of company that will take on my massive amount of loans (they'd have to be insane to do so) and consolidate them to pay a smaller price each month?

Please let me know.",finance

solar,Advice on system with battery.,"So I currently have an old battery backup system and the batteries need to be replaced at a cost of around $6000 not to mention the inverter is 12 years old. Keep in mind this does not have solar it’s just for backup purposes. So I was looking to replace with a generator for about $12,000 and it got me thinking why not just get some solar with the battery back up. In fact Maryland is offering a 30% battery rebate up to $5000 on top of federal. If I stay in the range of 4 to 5 kW it’s about $30,000 minus rebates so about 16 K of course I may go bigger but comparing that to a 12 K generator it seems to be a no brainer.
So I have received a few quotes and All seem to be in the same ballpark and all are smaller local installer’s which have good reputations.
Two of them want to use micro inverters With a tesla power wall  one wants to use solar edge with an LG battery. 
The micro inverter companies both say solar edge is unreliable and inflexible
If I want to increase the size. . The solar edge person says micro inverters are unreliable and that if you’re using a battery back up it loses efficiency converting from DC to AC several times. I know in most instances this only applies when the battery back up is being used for power outage which is in frequent but Maryland offers peak and off-peak pricing if I ask for it. The solar edge person says there’s not a drop in conversion and if I wanted to I could set the batteries to run during the day at peak times and recharge at night. She says with the tesla power wall this would not work because of the loss converting back-and-forth. So my first question is is this true? Does Tesla loses power when it converts back and forth?
Second question is the panel options are winaico, REC and silfab Of course each company claims there is is the best. I think all of them are roughly 320 winaico except for the Winco which is at 340 now I think
Third and likely final question I read online the enphase micro inverters are coming out with a new version very soon and that they might even offer some type of battery back up. Would that be better than perhaps a Tesla since it’s made to go together?  I was also told solar edge is coming out with a new inverter in the first quarter they can handle more watts. 
I can certainly wait if something erred is around the corner although I know that’s probably always the case.  
So I know this post is just a general mess information but any comments would be appreciated on any of the topics.",energy
personalfinance,Paying for my second bachelors,"I (26F) had 100k cash, bought property that cannot be liquified for 50k (with the advice of my dad), bought a car for 24k, and used up the rest to pay for my prerequisite classes at a private accelerated school. Now I am left with 5k cash and 5k debt on credit card no interest for 24 months. I prefer to keep my cash in case of emergencies and pay off the minimum of my credit card until I graduate.

I am in an accelerated BSN (nursing) program that will cost me 50k. I'm very happy with the program, but, unfortunately it is on the expensive side. I am one semester in (4k) and next semester will be one of my most expensive semesters (10k) and I don't think federal loans are disbursed for summer semester (\~6k). Regardless, due to it being my second bachelors, FAFSA won't be giving me much money and I am in need of support for the rest of the school year. My father is an unreliable individual to depend on for cosigning, and my mother is also continuing her education. 

I have applied for scholarships, but I don't believe that they are anything I can depend on either. I'm debating on taking out private loans to pay for college and working hard right after I graduate as a nurse to pay them off within the next 2 years. Unfortunately, I don't know too much about finance and don't believe that this is the best course of action, since the loan I applied for are giving me 12% interest, which is ridiculous and will cost me 83k total.

personalfinance,Retirement vs student loans,"I am 25 years old. I have 3 student loans, I all use Autopay so I can take advantage of 0.25% off the interest rate

1. 3.9% APR
2. 5% APR 
3. 5.65% APR (recently refinance from 6.9% to 5.65%)

And a car loan for 4.99%.

For 401k, my company matches:

\- 0-4%: 100% match

\- 4%-8%: 50% match

I have HSA and I put in enough money for my medical expense for a year for Dental (filling and stuff) and eye glasses. Also take advantage of my company $500 toward HSA

Currently, my return from 401k is about 12%. And I acknowledge that it can go down.

I have been working for 2 years and I have been prioritized paying off my student loans over 401k. I only put 4% into Roth 401k in order to get the 100% match. I expect to pay off all loans (student loans and car loan) by 2024

Recently, I learn that I can transfer Roth 401k into Roth IRA and withdraw my Roth Contribution with tax free and penalty free. Should I now maximize my company match for 401k, put 8% of income in Roth 401k, and when my 401k is 5 years, I will roll over to Roth IRA, withdraw my contribution and pay off my student loans in chunk. Is it a right way? I just start looking into the different between Roth IRA and Roth 401k recently.

personalfinance,Pros/Cons of using 401k to buy a house.,"Which scenario makes more sense? This is a thought exercise. Let's say I have $200k in a 401k.

Scenario A: Use the 200k from the 401k to pay for the house, incurring the 10% penalty (20k) and paying taxes (about 30k in the US). Every month for the next 30 years, I put in the amount the mortgage would have been back into the 401k ($954) and it earns 4% per year (hypothetical number, but the I use the same number in Scenario B).

Scenario B: a traditional mortgage for 200k/30 years at 4%?

After 30 years... Scenario A: The house is worth 500k (hypothetical number) and my 401k is worth 656k (deposited 343k, earned 313k in interest), and I own the house for a total of 1.156M. I do have to pay 50k in penalties/taxes up front though. The 20k up front costs 65k (at 4% interest) at the end of 30 years. I don't know how to work the taxes into this model so I'm assuming they are simply a 30k cost that year. [source for taxes](https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/federal-income-tax-calculator?taxStatus=MJ&amp;clientIncome=200000&amp;qualifiedSavings=0&amp;itemizedDeductions=0&amp;exemptions=2&amp;dependents=2&amp;Dispatch=submit&amp;skn&amp;mobileEnabled=1#results)

After 30 years in Scenario B, I've paid 343k for the mortgage (200k for the house, plus $143k in interest). I own the house (500k) and I still have the original 200k which has been chugging along at 4% (hypothetical, but the same interest rate I used in Scenario A) and is worth 662k, bringing me to a total of 1.12M.

I used online mortgage/interest calculators for all of these numbers except for the hypotheticals. What holes are there in my logic here? Scenario A seems better because I have slightly more money after 30 years, I avoid debt, and my investments are 50k up front vs 143k in monthly interest payments. I'm liberal af and I'd rather give the govt 50k than 143k to a bank fwiw.

Update: This is not actually a good idea unless the US economy goes to shit for 30 years at which point I'd probably need to find a house with a moat and alligators to protect myself from marauding bandits. Thanks everyone for working through this with me.",finance

personalfinance,I want to buy a car but I shouldn’t. Please tell me I’d be doing the right thing by not purchasing.,"Hi everyone,

I’m 27 and I want to buy a new car. It’s probably wise that I don’t, but I want the reassurance to know I’m making the right choice to not buy.

Background:

My girlfriend and I take home $7500 a month combined after taxes, insurance, and retirement. Planning to get married but not worried about cost as her family is going to pay for this. She has no college debt and I have $20k in federal loans amounting to $210 a month. We have no credit card debt, we pay off our balance every month usually around $2000-2500 (we put everything on our cards). She has a mortgage on a condo and with HOA, insurance, and utilities it comes to about $1700 a month. I’m in the last month of my lease of my apartment. Have been living with her since June, but it was cheaper to just ride out my lease. My rent+utilities is $1500 a month.  

We have no car payments at the moment, her parents pay her car insurance. I pay my parents $120 a month for car insurance. We both drive older reliable cars. Me a 2012 sonata (113k miles) Her a 2008 Santa Fe (130k miles)

I want to buy a new Sierra Denali. The cost of the one I want is $44,500. I have played with the numbers and TTL is about $3200 which I would pay up front. My car is worth maybe $2000 tops I’d guess, so I’d add that in as well. My credit score is 778. I don’t know if that would qualify me for 0% APR. I wouldn’t want anything more than 60 months and I’d hope my interest would be 2-4%. Looking at a monthly payment of $700-800. I don’t know what the going rate for insurance is but from the looks of google about $120-160/ month seems reasonable. I don’t do a ton of driving, just for the next year I’ll be driving 4 hours a week to and from a project location, and no driving while I’m there. My work pays for mileage at 58¢/mile. 

My girlfriend is onboard with me buying a car, but I am also thinking on the other hand to max out Roth IRA’s. I don’t know what % she puts away on her 401k. With my 401k I put away 10%. I would open two Roth IRAs outside of our work 401ks.

Another thing she would be on board with is paying off my student loans. This would be the smartest thing to do imo.

Monthly budget:
Take home = $7500
Mortgage = $1700
My rent = $1500 (going away January)
Credit Card = $2000-$2500
Student loan = $210
Car insurance = $120
—————————
Net: $1470-$1970
Net post no more rent: $2970-3470
Net with potential $800 car payment: $2270-2770

Think I should pull the trigger on going through with buying process or choose one or both of my alternative options?",finance
personalfinance,Came Into Money Quickly. Don't Want to mess Future Up.,"Hey guys, haven't really posted on reddit before, so forgive me if i break any rules.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27, I've recently advanced through my job quickly (from making 57k a year to 135k-145k a year in about 17 months) and I don't want to be  an idiot with my money.

My only debt is a 128k on a house (mortgage is $795), and 26k on a car (car payment is $467 3.75% interest rate). I have a wife (stay at home mom), who is, thankfully, very frugal and 1 child. I have $14k in checking and $1.2k in savings (I recently started moving $400 a month into my savings).

I'm not exactly sure how I should invest my money. I've got about $10k in my 401k which I recently bumped to 10% (my company matches up to 6%). I don't know if I should add more to my 401k or start throwing money into a Roth IRA? When I started working, they company had auto selected my portfolio. It had me invested in Blackrock EAFE equity Index FD, Blackrock Russell 2000 Index, and Vanguard Institutional 500 IDX. I don't know much about these investments but it has earned me 16.42% YTD. Now, since I started tinkering around... I know I did something probably stupid... but I noticed that i didn't have any stock in the company (I work at a nuclear plant for Southern Company). I did some thinkin, and figured I should own a good amount of Southern Company stock before they get 2 new reactors online (Vogtle 3&amp;4 the only new reactors currently being built in the US). Sooo I changed my allocation to 60% Southern Company (SO) 20% Vanguard Institutional, 10% Blackrock EAFE, and 10% Blackrock Russell. I figured I'd leave it that way for a little while until I have a decent amount invested in SO. After that, I figured I'd set my 401k to the aggressive model, which is 98% Equity/Stock and 2% Bond/Fixed income.

Now, I realize I don't know what the hell I'm doing, so everyone's opinions would be much appreciated. 

Side question, I was thinking whenever we do move, we keep our old house and rent it out until I read about investing in REITs. Graham Stephan and Meet Kevin got me wanting to invest in real estate, but I don't think I'd have time to manage my own proprieties and work a full time job. BUT I do live in southern AL and housing is extremely cheap...

Anyways, thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Help/questions (us),"Hi I'll try to keep it brief, trying to help my parents with their mortgage situation. I have 0 experience with mortgages and their English speaking is pretty meh so trying to figure it all out

Current situation....

Mortgage was for $175,000. Balance atm is $125,000. Payment is roughly $750 a month with the current break down being $400ish towards interest, $150 towards principal, and the rest toward insurance/escrow (whatever this is). There are 464 monthly payments remaining (so roughly 38 years). 

They took out the mortgage in 2009, a typical 30 year mortgage. They say the interest rate is 4% but I couldn't find anything on their website about that.

I think they have refinanced once but it's hard to get a direct answer out of them, but I have a feeling they did because why would a 30 year loan turn into 38 years AFTER being open for 10 years. 

The montly payments they can pay without issues. 

But the remaining payments left seems absurd. They're both 60 years old. With the remaining payments left, they'd be 98 by the time the mortgage is over. 

How the shit do I help them deal with this? Obviously they can only work for a few more years but their health is starting to go down hill as well so retirement is obviously inevitable by 65-67. 

They have 0 plans for wanting to retire in the US/they want to go back to their home country for retirement where everything is cheaper/we have family but this mortgage is the issue.

personalfinance,Opt out of CalSavers,"CalSavers is a California state run retirement ""plan"". It is a mandate on all businesses with 5 or more employees that don't offer another retirement plan to offer an IRA or Roth IRA retirement plan through the state by a specified date ([https://www.calsavers.com/](https://www.calsavers.com/)). As the first of these dates comes up soon, you will hear more about signing up through your employer.

This is not a new kind of retirement plan. Rather, it is the same Roth IRA or Traditional IRA you could open on your own today. Contributions are automatically taken from your paycheck on an after-tax or, as of today, a pre-tax basis and contributed to a Roth or Traditional IRA respectively. The contributions count against your yearly cap with the federal government.

What is ridiculous are the fees charged by the firm California hired to manage the accounts: Ascensus. They are charging between 0.83% to 0.95% of annualized assets to manage the account ([https://www.calsavers.com/home/about/frequently-asked-questions.html](https://www.calsavers.com/home/about/frequently-asked-questions.html) \&gt; Fees and Costs &gt; Do I have to pay any fees for my account?). That is on top of the expense ratio for the funds: [https://saver.calsavers.com/home/savers/investments.html](https://saver.calsavers.com/home/savers/investments.html). Taking the target date funds as an example, the net expense ratio right now is a low 0.09% for most funds but balloons on April 30, 2020 to 0.45% or as high as 1.62% unless a new deal is reached with State Street for a fee waiver.

Any person could do the same exact thing the state is offering through Vanguard or a low cost brokerage for at least 6x less cost. Opt out when your employer presents this to you. I commend the intent of the State of California here, automated background deductions have shown time and time again to be more effective in getting people to save for retirement. That said, if you follow this subreddit, you obviously somewhat care about your money so put in the minimal amount of effort and opt out.",finance

This house has a pool and is on an acre very close to the booming downtown area. It checks a lot of my personal boxes that I love in old houses - french doors, pocket doors, character, parlor, etc.

The only issue is... it is a bit out of budget. ... $400K. My fiance and I are planning on going in together to purchase it. Both of us work full-time and we go to online school full time. We have about 2 years each left before we get our bachelors and finish our degrees. We have been qualified for the loan, put in an offer, it was accepted.  We get to keep all of the appliances and the seller will pay all of closing.  Not to mention, our mortgage interest rate is 3.78%.  However, the mortgage alone costs my entire monthly salary. That means with our monthly salaries combined, this mortgage is like 48% of our income.  It is doable, but money will be tight. I hardly have any money left to save, and that rules out vacations for the next few years.

Do you think I should not purchase this house because of the potential financial strain on our relationship, or go ahead and achieve the dream and get a higher paying job within the next 2 - 3 years?

Edit: We are going to be married in March, so he's my fiance, not boyfriend!  I apologize for the lack of clarification.  The wedding is really cheap, under 2,000, and the money is set aside to cover the wedding, if that helps anyone's opinion.

**Update :**  Thank you so much to everyone who contributed and helped open my eyes a bit to the financial realities of home ownership. We have decided to purchase a much, much cheaper home starting out. Hopefully I can still own a lovely Victorian in the future when we can afford it. :)

Happy Holidays, everyone!",finance

personalfinance,Applied to a fake job listed under a LEGIT company and almost got scammed. How should I protect myself financially?,"This is ongoing. I do not know how to proceed. More details that are not suited to this sub are here.

This happened in the USA

1. I applied to a job on LinkedIn - at the time I didn't know it was fake. The job was listed under a legit company ""Virtusa"" but the poster was a fake profile of a high ranking employee from the same company. Since today the page has been taken down.
2. I do the interview wasted 3hrs. Then they say that I have been given the job and that they will be sending me money to buy office supplies - My Reddit Instincts took over me like an ASMR storm. I knew what was up. I WOKE.

Unfortunately, I had already given my name, address, and mobile number. From the previous post, one other Redditor has also fallen for the same thing.

Today I got a check for $4800 with Bank of America. It was sent using FedEx Express priority overnight. All addresses seem fake, even the phone number seems fake. Although the name of the company on the check results in an obscure company on Gmaps.

My question is what else should I do? I need advice about what I should do to financially protect myself right now. They have my name, address, email id and mobile number only and nothing else.

Thank You.",finance

personalfinance,Husband has WAY too much money sitting in biz checking. (Single member LLC taxed as an s-corp). Where would you store it to grow better?,"Hey there. So my husband currently has at least 50k in his biz checking account that he can probably stash away because it is a surplus from paying clients. (There is actually about 140k in the account, but there are taxes to consider, working capital etc.) He is a single member LLC but will be taxed as an s-corp starting 2019. He does not have any other accounts for the biz other than this checking. 

Where should he put it?  I can answer this question easily if it was non-biz relted, post-tax dollars form a paycheck: the place with the highest yield.  But, I'm talking about before it hits payroll or rollover at the end of the year.  (For next year obviously. This year is shot.)    

Should he use:
A money market with the same bank for ease of liquidity? 
A money market with a different bank with a higher interest rate than the bank that holds the biz checking account? 
A CD?  (I understand each of these vehicles and their pros and cons but maybe I'm missing something.) 
If a CD for a better rate than a money market...should he do a year CD? a 7 month? Does the time it matter for accounting?  

Obviously we would not put it in the stock market because that is long term...but I am wondering what he should do with it other than letting it ALL sit in biz checking the WHOLE year.",finance

stocks,Goldman Sachs is Bullish on Gold in 2020,"After a strong first nine months of 2019, gold peaked at a nearly 25% gain at the onset of September. Goldman Sachs remains bullish on the yellow metal.  


Since then, as the S&amp;P 500 increased more than 10 percentage points, the gold price declined 7 percentage points over the same period, for an increase of 17% on the year. Despite the pullback, Goldman is still bullish.  


“Gold’s strategic case is still strong,” Goldman Sachs ’ Mikhail Sprogis, precious metals analyst at Goldman, wrote in a note to clients. “We expect ‘Fear’-driven investment demand for gold to be supported by late cycle concerns, political uncertainty and high \[developing market\] household savings.”  


He highlighted how interest rates remain historically low, suggesting this is a bullish sign for gold, since there is a limited chance of bond prices rising, which could send investors to safehaven investments like gold.   


Like Deutsche Bank, he believes “more widespread discussions of \[Modern Monetary Theory\] could lead to greater demand for gold on debasement concerns.”  


Another reason for increased gold demand is increasing popularity of Modern Monetary Theory, MMT, which suggests national debt is not a constraint on countries. Bernie Sanders-advisor and economist Stephanie Kelton subscribes to this theory, as does Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

Fiscal concerns around national debt are unfounded, proponents suggest, as long as inflation remains low. They suggest low rates should be taken advantage of in order to fund infrastructure and social programs to boost growth and reduce inequality.  


“In the next recession, our US economists do not expect governments to adopt direct monetary financing and expect inflation to remain firmly anchored,” Sprogis wrote. “But this doesn’t necessarily prevent an increase in debasement concerns if conversations around MMT become more widespread — a potential boost to demand for gold as a debasement hedge.”  


Goldman’s 12-month target for gold of $1,600 per ounce calls for an 8.5% gain from Monday’s opening price. In the past 12 months, gold has increased nearly 14%. Continuing political uncertainty could increase demand for gold.  


“High political uncertainty due to continued trade tensions and the approaching US elections should also be supportive gold in 2020,” Sprogis wrote. “This uncertainty may be one of the reasons why we see evidence of a non-ETF vaulted gold build, as high net worth individuals may want to store gold outside the financial system.”

personalfinance,3 options for home mortgage. Need help deciding.,"My wife and I are under contract to buy a home.  We plan to do a live in renovation with the intent of making it a rental (selling only as a plan B).  The future plan includes buying another home, possibly fixing it up, staying for a bit, and then making it a rental.  The process repeats.

I am a buy and hold guy.  I don't have any interest in becoming a flipper but if I see a chance to get a big payday I will take it.  I am not seeking advice trying to pull me away from buy and hold as a primary strategy.

We have been presented with three financing possibilities and I am struggling to decide.

FHA 3.5% down 3.49% interest - Required mortgage insurance is $128.74

Conventional 5% down 4.25% interest - Required mortgage insurance is $96.27

Conventional 20% down 4.25% interest - No required mortgage insurance.

We have plenty of cash for any down payment and for the renovations.

I am struggling with:

\- The idea of paying mortgage insurance.  

\- Having a big chunk of our money (roughly $27,000 additional dollars toward the down payment) tied up in the home. 

\- Having this home financed FHA (and not being able to get a second FHA loan).

\- Going with FHA knowing the only way I will get rid of the PMI is to refinance (likely at a higher interest rate).

I welcome your input.",finance
stocks,Gold Price Increases Ahead of Tariffs Decision on Chinese Imports,"The gold price increased Wednesday with a deadline for an additional round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports approaching. There is no so-called ‘phase-one’ deal in sight, and a U.S. central bank policy meeting could provide an outlook for 2020, causing either an increase or decrease in the price of gold.

Gold increased 0.43% to $1,470.25 per ounce, as gains extended into a third straight session. U.S. gold futures increased 0.47% higher to $1,475.0

In the latest events during a 17-month long trade war, U.S. President Donald Trump will decide this week whether or not to implement more tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese goods. Economic and trade advisors are expected to meet in coming days with Trump over the final decision, a source told Reuters.

“Gold has been up because of the uncertainty of the trade talks, along with the FOMC meeting this afternoon,” said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.

The Fed is not expected to change the rates much and neither is the European Central Bank in its Thursday meeting regarding that bank’s rates.

“The global economy appears to have stabilized after a year of growth uncertainty. If yields on U.S. 10 (Treasury) yields rise above 1.90%, we think that will signal the end of golds rally and push prices below $1,400/oz,” analysts at OCBC bank said in a note.

Meanwhile, palladium continues to break records, increasing 0.6% to $1,907.70 per ounce. Mine shutdowns in South Africa due to blackouts caused by flash flooding has also led to supply concerns. Palladium should enjoy its 14th straight session of price increase.

“South Africa produces 40% of world’s palladium and the ESKOM outages are hitting some mines, giving palladium just that extra nudge above $1,900,” said Tai Wong, head of base and precious metals derivatives trading at BMO. “We’ve now had 13 consecutive positive sessions, which seems a little rich, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see some consolidation, though the overall trend continues to look quite positive.”

“Gold is riding higher on dollar weakness and caution ahead of a looming tariff deadline,” said FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga. He believes tariffs could lead to gold gains, though the Wall Street Journal reported analysts expect the tariffs to be delayed. 

“In the short-term, if the Fed shifts to a more hawkish assessment, gold is at risk from further repositioning. Technically this could pull prices back to $1,410/oz,” UBS analysts noted.

solar,Financing options for solar start-ups,"As a start-up, it is difficult to form partnerships with solar lenders because we lack a proven track-record of experience. I'm wondering what our best financing options are? I'm currently considering the following:

* Help our customers apply for home-equity loans. While the interest rates will be higher, there are no dealer fees so we can sell at a lower price to keep payments low. What is the best way to help our customers shop for good rates? As a contractor, I have a strong preference for long-term loans (between 25-30 years) because it allows us to keep monthly payments as low as possible.
* Offer cash-out refinancing options. While this is an extra hurdle to jump (mainly for psychological reasons), it allows for much lower interest rates and more savings.
* I've heard that we can contract projects out to other solar installers in order to secure financing. How exactly does that work? Will they take responsibility for the installation, and essentially share profits with us for generating the lead? What are the pros and cons of making this arrangement from the other company's POV, and what percentage of the profit should I expect to share?

As a salesman, I have a very strong incentive to offer low monthly payments (people want to feel like they are saving money relative to their current utility costs), and low interest rates (it is much easier psychologically to sell a $30,000 product at 15 years/ 0% interest than a $15,500 product at 15 years/ 10% interest, even though the monthly payments are exactly the same).

Basically, as a salesman, I'm fine selling at high prices, and I'm fine paying high dealer fees. I just want to keep interest rates and monthly payments as low as possible. What would be the best option for me going forward?",energy

personalfinance,TurboTax not excluding foreign self-employment income,"I'm filing a very late return for 2018, but this applies to 2019 as well. Have the same problem for both years.

I live in the UK year-round, full time. I do some software work and make self-employment income as reported on a 1099-K. I already pay taxes on **all** this income to the UK government, which has a double taxation treaty with the US. I should not owe a cent on this to the IRS as it's well within the exclusion limit.

TurboTax just will not fully exclude this income. To put it incredibly simply (you can assume every other aspect of my return is unremarkable):

SE Income| Foreign Exclusion | Federal tax owed
---|---|----
$31,000| $31,000| $4,522 (?!)

It even gives me a positive *""Congratulations! Your foreign earned income exclusion is $31,000. You will not pay US tax on this amount""* message and everything.

The Intuit forums have been unhelpful and nonspecific, I'm really hoping someone here can shed some light on what's going on, and what I can do to correct this. The only thing I can think of is that I need to add some kind of deduction to either the Income section or the Exclusion section, but it isn't clear what or where.

Thank you!

EDIT: I now understand that though the income is excluded I still owe SE tax (Social Security and Medicaid).

Question- since the US has a Totalization Agreement with the UK, and I'm already paying their equivalent of SS on this income, shouldn't I not have to pay SE tax to the US? Do I need a Certificate of Agreement, and if so, from which country?",finance

Bitcoin,"People criticize the Fed, but could it be the CB of Japan that motivated Satoshi?","I expect this has been brought up in the past, but it’s only just occurring to me now. We often criticize the actions of the US Federal Reserve for causing fiat monetary inflation, but I think the Central Bank of Japan is, historically, much worse. The Japanese stock market bubble was popped in 1990, and over the past 30 years the CBJ has become the largest shareholder of Japanese stocks. The Japanese debt-to-GDP ratio is off the charts compared to other countries. Jeff Gundlach had a recent interview on Yahoo Finance News in which he discussed the successive bubbles in regional stock markets: First Japan in 1990, and their market has not had an all-time high in 30 years. Then European stock market popped in 2000, and their market has not had an all-time high in 20 years. Then the emerging markets saw their stock market pop along with the rest of the world in 2007 and ‘08, and that index has not had an all-time high in 11 years.

Japan and Europe have had negative interest rates during the past decade; perhaps not everywhere and not all the time, but they have been negative in contrast to rates in the US which have never been negative. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), it seems to me as if adoption of Bitcoin is most common in... ta da! .... Japan and Europe. Somebody correct me if I’m wrong.

It seems quite plausible to me that Satoshi Nakamoto has ties to 1990s Japan (either because he/she/it is Japanese or because he/she/it resided in Japan), and experienced the devastation of the stock market collapse and subsequent actions of the Central Bank of Japan. Perhaps that was the foundational motivation for Satoshi’s exploration and research into finance, economics, digital systems, and, finally, cryptography.

personalfinance,Does SO have to pay taxes?,"Background: 

SO is working as a contractor abroad (Country A) for the second year. First year he didn't pay taxes, now he does. Reason why later. 

We have been living in Country B for 7 years now, which I am a citizen of. Our children are US Citizens, like SO. SO used to live in the US, before moving to Country B with me. In the last 7 years, he has been to the US for twice only.

We would want to migrate to the US in the near future, and he would have to petition me, through marriage (when we do). 

AFAIK, he is allowed to be expemted from tax since he is working abroad. However, SO thinks it's imperative as to support my petition (when we file) for an immigrant visa when we move to the US. Now, SO's paying both state and federal taxes and damn, it's a huge chunk!

Now, does SO really have to pay taxes in order to support my (future) immigrant petition?

Thanks in advance. Any help is much appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Another ""How much house can I afford""","Good morning everyone. I've read through tons and tons of posts about this but I don't think it ever hurts to ask my own question. 

I've done a ton of online calculators (yes I understand they're not the best but I like doing them regardless), used 28/36% rule, etc and I just want it confirmed via this beautiful subreddit. I am a 24M.

So for starters, income. 

I make $37/hr in a really stable field (nursing). I get paid biweekly, contribute 15% to my 401k/Roth (6% toward 401k to get company matching) and end up with checks around $1600-1750 depending on the number of hours I have worked. Those checks should go up a bit due to changing healthcare plans reducing about $800/year but for now, lets use those figures.

-Monthly gross income $5328

-Monthly net income $3200*

Current debts/obligations are as follows:

-Car $262/month. $5600 left on loan (really low interest rate so I've just been paying it to build credit since I am young and only have one small credit card open...should I pay this off?)

-Car insurance $130

-Phone $67

-Groceries $140

-Rent $500

-Gym $30

-Spotify - $5 (wont start until February d/t free trial)

-Amazon/Disney Plus - Already paid through next year but about $10/month combined

-Eating out/Entertainment - $400 (estimated quite a bit higher but to account for things like spur of the moment trips, vacations, fancy dinners, etc)

For a grand total of $1,514. 

Now for my savings account/down payment. 

-Savings/Down payment - 70k (in HYSA)

-Emergency fund - 4k

I've got about 2k extra but I will not be accounting for that in either of these figures due to an upcoming purchase. Each month I am able to save at least a paycheck, if not more. For this past year I was able to save $25k which is actually a good bit considering my net income was below $50k. I anticipate having close to $100k as ""down payment"" whenever I buy a house.

Now, using the online calculators the ""minimum"" nerd wallet states is $222k w/a mortgage of $910. Nerd wallet and other sites have me at around a 350k mortgage which is 28% of my income/month for the mortgage payment (1300ish). 

When I use my figures, the 28% rule comes out to $1491 (5328 x 0.28). The 36% figure is $1678 (5328 x .36 = 1918. 1918 - 240 = 1678.) (The only true ""debt"" I have is my car loan so is this calculated correctly?)

So from these figures, I can afford a $1491-1678 mortgage payment. I understand what I can afford vs. what I should afford...but that's not really important right now when I am just trying to get some numbers worked out.

Now, my long time girlfriend (who I will be proposing to in about a year so no house will be bought until we are married lol y'all can save the spiel) currently is in school and once she graduates will be making roughly $25/hour. I can do all the math over again and what not but I would rather not include her at this time.

General questions I am wondering:

Whenever I use my gross income, should I be taking my 401k contributions out of that first before trying to calculate things?

Should I pay off my car now, despite wanting to build credit since it is such a low interest rate? (Not sure on exact number but I am paying about $13/month in interest...) I understand many people say don't waste money to build credit but paying it off wont hurt my credit score, correct?

If I can afford &gt;20% payment, should I do it? I don't know anything about the markets or where to start. I see all the time I can get close to 6% interest in an index fund which would probably be better than a bigger down payment but I don't know where to even begin.

Is there anything I should be doing differently?

**TL;DR: Buying a house calculating is tough. 28%-36% rules states I can afford a payment of $1491-$1678. Online calculators put me roughly in the same area.**",finance

How does this happen when one makes consistent required payments?

I am considering grad school in the near future. While I have the cash needed to pay for it, I'd rather not spend all of my savings on it at once. So I was planning on getting loans for some of it. 

I thought that as long as the loan interest rates were lower than the return I'm getting on my investments, then getting a loan and making minimum payments would be the best financial decision.

But then this thread came up and freaked me out a bit. I've been lucky to never have needed loans before, am I missing something?

personalfinance,Will consolidating federal student loans temporarily ding a credit score?,"I'm helping my sister finance her student loan debt, and right now, she has a combination of public and private student loans. 

She had 4 different federal loans totaling about $1500. Two of the loans had fixed rates and  two had variable interest rates. I helped her consolidate those loans, which will now be serviced through Navient at a fixed interest rate that she is happy with. 

She has four private student loans totaling about $93k, and all of the private loans have variable rates between 4% and 6%. The eventual goal is to refinance this private student loan debt at a lower, fixed rate. I did this with my loans through NaviRefi and am happy with it, but she will be shopping around. 

Here's my question: When is a good time to start applying for private consolidation loans through NaviRefi or other companies? Should she wait until after her federal consolidation loan is up and running for a few months? Will her credit have taken a hit during the federal consolidation process? If the consolidation doesn't typically affect the credit score, then we may look into refinancing sooner.

personalfinance,Confused about different types of banking institutions,"Trying to learn about different types of Banks and thrift institutions but I am not able to interpret what I am reading online. ( I did read your credit union wiki)

From  my understanding a Bank is a institution where  a population stores and  pools there money and the bank then uses that pool to make loans and  makes a profit of those loans with interest. I know that thrift  institutions and banks are insured by different departments but

\-From ""[howstuffworks](https://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/banking/bank3.htm)""  banking it states there are commercial banks and thrift institutions,  it lists Savings banks, S&amp;L, Credit unions, and cooperative banks as  types of thrift institutions.

But  after googling it appears as if Savings Banks is just another name for  an S&amp;L? So why list it as separate type of thrift institution?

\-According to the the ""howstuffworks"" page on [S&amp;L](https://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/banking/savings-and-loans1.htm)  ,they suffer during high interest because they take out loans from  banks,, but why would they take out loans from banks, don't they they  have their own pool of money from which they give out their own loans?

It also states that S&amp;L were focused around a certain community. But isn't that what a credit union is?

And According to [this site](https://budgeting.thenest.com/difference-between-commercial-bank-savings-loan-bank-26725.html)  commercial banks tend to focus on businesses while S&amp;L's tend to  focus on consumers. So do If I need a loan to buy a car a commercial  bank will turn me down unless I am a business? Why do they ""tend to"" ?  what stops S&amp;L's from giving commercial loans too?

\-According to ""howstuffworks"" on [Credit Unions](https://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/banking/credit-union.htm)  , they are non for profit. But how can that be, they give out loans and  make a profit from the interest as well? How do they pay their  employees? Donations?

And how  could it be community owned? If something is communally owned that means  decisions are made by votes so it is democratically controlled, how?

And  credit unions tend to offer lower interest rates, is there any actual  standards that dictate ""a credit union may not offer over x amount of  interest"" or it will be forced by regulation to be reclassified?

And I have no idea what a co operative bank is.

i currently have the most debt i have ever accrued, about $12,000. two weeks ago, i tore my ACL/MCL and got a stress fracture in the same leg, so I had to go on disability. I worked a few part-time/freelance gigs, as I am a musician new to Los Angeles. I was just getting on my feet here, and was able to maintain all of my payments, but the injury has set me back. I am hoping to get at least 2k a month through benefits, but that's not guaranteed yet either, and I now have no real savings. Below I am listing my current cards, APR and balances:

AMEX- APR 26.24%
BALANCE: $7,934 /$8000
CHASE - APR 23.74%
BALANCE: $1,724 /$1900
WELLS FARGO- APR 20.49%
BALANCE: $2,696 /$6000

Because of my current interest rates, I was thinking of taking out a personal loan to pay these off, and instead pay just the one loan. Through Credit Karma, I was pre-approved for a loan from Upgrade for $12,500 at 15.99%.

What are the major drawbacks or benefits of this method? Is it recommended?

I was also trying to apply to a 0% APR introductory rate card, but have been declined, presumably for the high utilization, on the AMEX and Chase. If I do indeed get a personal loan and pay these cards off right away, can I assume I can get approved for a new card with lower interest?

personalfinance,Received a year's modest salary in one lump sum. What do.,"My husband is in the Navy. He (M24) and I (F23) got married in late 2018 and have been waiting to receive Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for 15 months.... something that should have taken no longer than 3. But that's a story for another post.

We have received about half of the backpay that we are owed on the paycheck he just got last night, and we're assuming that the rest of the lump sum will show up on the next paycheck. It's a big enough sum that we're not surprised that it has been broken up. From then on, he will continue to receive BAH of about $3,000 a month for living expenses which will be used up for housing, and any extra (maybe a few hundred depending on what apartment/house we rent) put in to savings.

So; we essentially have one year's low-income salary currently put into our joint savings, and we're assuming the next lump is on it's way.

***DEBT***: him; \* **$10,000** loan on the car  \* **$5,000** on a credit card  \*a few thousand (ballpark **$8,000**) owed to college, but because he's military, the loan is frozen until he's not active duty and no interest can accrue.

me; \*  **$29,000** Wells Fargo student loan which I'm currently 3 months ($937) behind on   \*a few hundred on my credit card **\~$600** \[which I can pay off at the end of the month with money from some seasonal work\]   \*about **$16,000** owed to a government loan that's in default as it's never been paid on.

\[From my understanding I can bargain with the federal loan and essentially say I'll pay you like $2,500 upfront to just close the case on this loan, which we intended to do once this money came through, and left it alone in the mean time.\]&lt;&lt;&lt; if this is a good idea I'd like advice on how to do it, or I can always make another post too

***SAVINGS***: nothing.

***FUTURE PLANS***: *He* will finish out this sea contract (ends late 2022) and then do a shore duty (3 years) so he has steady income and job security for the foreseeable future. He gets steady promotions and impresses the higher ups at work. He's a trained ASTAC (talks to aircraft) and is considering being an Air Traffic Controller or going back to school to be a teacher once he's out. He flirts with the idea of going career navy, as by the time those two contracts are up he will have been in for 9 years (you need 20 to be career, comes with a lot of benefits, comes with a lot of stress).

*I* will be moving from my mom's house to live with him once living arrangements are made. All our basic needs will be met and I'm considering finishing my degree, going for Interior Design. Until then, I am not picky about working odd jobs etc. to cover our expenses where needed, but we should be fine without me working. I have considered secretary work as well if I don't go back to school for whatever reason. Once he goes to shore duty we will consider having children (the navy pays extra per dependent you have, so this is not a major financial concern, at least until he goes civilian). I would like to refinance my student loan with Navy Federal (where we bank) but I was waiting to get a job so that I could make sure I would get a better rate. That being said I have applied to several positions in his area and only one ever got back to me, months ago. Also, Wells Fargo just waived all late fees on student loans.

*We* never had a 'celebration wedding', just a Justice of the Peace legal ceremony (which we loved), but we would like to have a party for our friends and family to enjoy. I'm from the east coast and he's midwest, both with elder family members who can't travel, and friends who we wouldn't want to ask to spend a bunch of money on traveling. So we'd likely do two weddings. Nothing extravagant. But travel for us plus both parties might come close to **$10,000 total**.

What to do with the money?

Buy a house? : I don't know if that's the right decision because we know we will be moving, and because of the area he's in, even a decent house is just under a million dollars. There's VA loans so we wouldn't even need to put a down payment, but that would make the monthly cost higher, and we'd be leaving in 2022. We could keep it as rental income but the mortgage payment would be steeper than the going rental rate so it would be hard to fill with future renters, and steeper than the BAH we would be receiving so hard for us to manage it ourselves.

Pay off debt? : Essentially that would wipe out all the money we'd be receiving. So we'd have a clean slate, continue into the future with a steady income and our needs provided for us (so long as nothing crazy happens).

Invest? : What I REALLY want to do. We'll never have this much money again, and this big lump sum of money might be the blessing in disguise that came from being forced to be apart due to finances for nearly the past two years. The adage 'it takes money to make money' keeps coming up in my head, and this seems like too important of an opportunity to waste. I'd like to get ahead in life and not squander this money on material things or feel like we managed to pay off what (to us) is an insane amount of debt, just to probably accrue more debt later on down the line. We want to get our money to work for us. We just don't know how.

So, internet financial experts. Please give me your advice on how to best handle this money. Is it to get rid of the debt? Or is it some kind of investment? And if so, how do we do that/what do we need to know?

**TLDR**; (if you're going to give advice please actually read what I wrote) - my husband and I have debt that about equals this lump sum of money we received. So do we get rid of the debt or do we invest, and use the investment to pay off the debt and continue to make us money into the future? Or is it not that easy?

EDIT: non of this money is taxable",finance

personalfinance,Should I open an IRA in 2020 or wait? Help me plan my 2020 goals,"I'm 32 and went from a job paying $18/hr to one that pays $60k/yr about halfway through 2019, hooray! This major increase in income has helped me pay off my car, start an emergency fund that I can actually leave alone and not have to tap in to, and aggressively pay down my students loans. Here is a break down of my current situation:

Student loans: $12.7k

401k: $10,000, most of this was rolled over from my previous job, am now contributing 5% of my income to reach my employer-match contribution maximum (100% up to 3% then 50% for contributions from 3 to 5%)

HSA - $700, will be contributing the maximum in 2020 supplemented by my employer's contribution of $300

Emergency fund: $2,000

No car payment, car insurance is $89/month and I spend about $60/month on gas. Car is in great condition with 67,000 miles and I intend to drive it for the foreseeable future

No credit card debt but I have a couple cards open for cash back rewards and maintaining my credit

I have a total of 8 student loans with interest rates varying from 4.25% to 6.55%. Here is a simplified breakdown of how much is owed under which rates:

|Interest rate|6.55%|5.75%|5.35%|4.25%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Principal balance|$3,816|$2,828|$3,900|$2,130|

I'm in a comfortable living situation with roommates right now where my income substantially exceeds my expenses, so I started allotting about $550/month to go towards paying down my student loans. $125 on auto-pay goes directly to covering any interest and is evenly distributed among all 8 of my loans, then I make separate payments towards the principal on my highest interest loans until I reach $550 total for the month. 

What this will do for me is pay off my 3 loans that are at 6.55% interest by September 2020, then I will move on towards the next highest interest rate loans and repeat until all my loans are paid off by late 2021/early 2022. Also starting in January I'm going to contribute $500/month to my emergency fund so I'll have $5,000 (roughly 3 months worth of expenses) in June.

I want to know when would be a good time to start an IRA. I've been following the prime directive flowchart but I'm just curious what I should do considering my age. I'm not terribly worried about having enough to retire, and I expect my income to raise exponentially in the next few years as I advance my career in IT. I'm considering a couple different options:

Option A - up my 401k contributions to 10% in January, start setting aside 5% of my income a month until I have $1,000 to open an IRA, start contributing 10% of my income to that and go back to 5% to my 401k

Option B - keep my 401k contribution where it is and save 10% of my income a month, open an IRA when I have $1,000 and continue contributing 10%

Option C - I would be willing to contribute up to 20% of my total monthly income (10/10 or 5/15 to my 401k and IRA) as long as I can make it fit my budget until I'm more or less ""caught up"" in retirement savings to where I should be at my age

I don't know much about IRAs so I would appreciate any input on this.

Also, at some point should I pump the brakes on paying down my student loans? I definitely want to maintain my current plan until the 6.55% interest loans are paid, but should I stop being aggressive and just pay the minimum once I only owe  on the loans with &lt;= 5.35% interest, and invest the money somewhere else?

personalfinance,Should I try to negotiate a reduction of credit card interest rate before I sign up for a personal loan?,"I have about $8200 in credit card debt, at 16.74%. My FICO score is around 747, and TransUnion (via Intuit Turbo) is 717.

I have been granted a personal loan to cover the CC balance at 10.49% for 48 months by a local credit union, but haven't finalized the paperwork yet. (Monthly payment would be around $219. My budget can handle a payment of $300 most months, and I intend to overpay when I can to get out from under the loan faster).

I don't make a lot (\~30k) but am trying my hardest to save money, pay off debt, and stop this cycle of financial irresponsibility. (Long story short: I'd only ever had seasonal work until I began my first full-time job w/ benefits Sept 2019. Now I finally have the ability to plan ahead financially w/ a budget). If I am calculating things correctly, I stand to save about $1k by using the personal loan to pay off the credit card debt over 48 mos vs keeping the balance on the card.

The credit card is 7 years 5 mos old; my oldest line of credit other than my student loans (8-11 yrs). If I go through with the personal loan, they require that I close the credit account. I'd rather not close the account for the sake of my credit score.

personalfinance,Is it worth it to refinance my mortgage?,"I bought my first place in May. Paid $240,560 for a 30 year conventional fixed rate loan with PMI. I only had enough for 5% down so my interest rate is currently 5.25%. That puts my monthly at $1636.24.

Got an initial quote from my mortgage holder that says I could lower my monthly to $1175 with an APR of 4.342%. I'm thinking it's a good move because that gives me an extra $461/month that I could put towards my 401k which is right now getting a ~7% return.

I'm not sure how long I plan to hold onto this place. We'll probably only live here for 5-10 years before hopefully being able to upgrade a bit. The thing is depending on where I'm at financially at that time I'm not sure yet if I'll have to sell this place to buy the next, or if I'll be able to hold onto it and rent it out.

personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loans Question,"Hi all. Weird situation here. I'll try to be brief:

**Me:**

* $100k in federal student loans. Interest rates range from 6.0-7.5%.
* Good credit score.
* Just started a high income job ($190k) in Sept.
* Have been planning on refinancing with a private lender for better rates.

**My brother:**

* $20k in undergrad federal loans. Needs to start paying soon.
* Just graduated undergrad. Low/inconsistent income.
* I just helped him apply for a Federal Consolidation Loan, and switched him over to the REPAYE plan (where he'll pay 10% of his income every month).

**My dad:**

* Owes $60k in Parent PLUS loans for my brother's schooling. Interest rates range from 6.0-7.5%.
* $60k income between himself and my mom.
* Good credit score, but:
* In debt. CANNOT afford to be paying back this Parent PLUS loan every month.

**Issue: I want to help, but I don't know the best way to go about it.**

I feel an obligation to help my dad out here. He really had no idea what he was getting into with this Parent PLUS stuff. I can afford to help out, but I was to get them/us the best interest rates possible. Also, lower monthly payments are essential (for them - not so much for me as I plan on paying back my 100k pretty quickly). 

I was thinking I could do one of two things:

**Option 1:**

* Keep my brother on REPAYE plan with his 20k. 
* Refinance dad's 60k with a private lender, in hopes of getting a better rate and a lower monthly payment.
* Given my high income, would it be beneficial if I co-sign when refinancing the 60k? (In terms of getting a better interest rate, lower payments, etc.?)
* Would it be weird/out of the ordinary to refinance with a private lender, and request a *longer* pay-back period? (Again, looking for lower monthly payments for my dad/bro, even if they'll be paying a bit more over time.)

**Option 2:**

* Keep brother on REPAYE with his 20k. 
* Combine my 100k with my dad's 60k, and refinance that 160k all together.
* Deal with everything myself but have my dad/bro pay *me* every month.
* Would going this route (rather than refinancing my dad's 60k separately) possibly help us get a better interest rate?

Any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Paying Extra on Loan Payments Each Month.,"Hey guys, I do have a serious question, although it may sound rhetorical to some. 

I had a discussion with my mother today with the struggle of my credit since I keep having student loans against my name. Every time my federal and private loans go through, my credit goes down. But over time it evens out. My question is this, though. Would paying $300+ a month towards all those loans combined help my credit. I am currently seeking a career in nursing, which is known for their student loan forgiveness and paying off debts if you do contracts with the hospital for a given period of time. My one loan, which is $23000 and I now have down to $19000 in principal, is roughly consuming just shy of a half of my total credit for private loans. Interest is variable on this loan, with a total of $231 a month on the payment. Usually the principle goes towards about $50-70 of that, the rest interest. If I paid $200+ extra on that a month, how much would that raise my credit score, over time potentially?

Thank you to any assistance! If anyone needs more information, I'll gladly provide if I feel comfortable.",finance
personalfinance,$50K in savings. What's the next step?,"Trying to have the lowest amount of risk. I've considered investing in the Mexican equivalent of an Index Fund (CETES?) which yield an annual 7%ish interest. I figured I'd try and save up to 500K by the time I'm 40 and that would yield 35K yearly just from interest, which is more than enough to live extremely comfortable here.

I've also considered buying a home, but trying to pay off it within 5-10 years, but that wouldn't make my money grow per se but if the value of the apartment/house increases then it might yield a better ROI.

Is it better to pay an $800 - $1,000 rent that will let me put money towards the CETES every month, plus the compound interest rate? Or buy a home and pay off 2-2.5K in mortgage until I pay it off?

My income is anywhere between $3-4K (varies every month due to freelance work).

personalfinance,"Just graduating from college, some insight on managing my student loan debt.","Hello r/personalfinance,

I could use some insight on how to manage my student loan debt because I just graduated and I'm honestly just scared. It kind of makes me regret going to college. For a little background, I have an AAS in Computer Info Systems and a BT in Information Technology. Both of my degrees specialize in Computer Programming.

The grace period for my student loans is the standard six-months, so I figure my payments will start sometime in June. Here are all the principal amounts of the loans and the two Parent PLUS loans that my mother took out for me, which she is making me responsible for paying. Although, in the eyes of the loan servicer, she's responsible. My subsidized and unsubsidized amounts went up once I got married, as I was no longer eligible for Parent PLUS loans.

**Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans (Great Lakes Borrower)**

* $1,750.00 @ 3.760%
* $1,118.77 @ 3.760%
* $1,750.00 @ 3.760%
* $1,105.40 @ 3.760%
* $3,500.00 @ 4.450%
* $2,184.00 @ 4.450%
* $5,500.00 @ 5.050%
* $7,377.21 @ 5.050%
* $5,500.00 @ 5.050%
* $7.143.34 @ 5.050%

Total monthly payment @ 120 months: $411

**Parent PLUS Loans (Navient)**

* $7,674.00 @ 6.310%
* $13,530.00 @ 7.000%

Total monthly payment @ 120 months: $313.50

This is the part that's freaking me out. The total for both loan payments every month comes out to **‭$724.5‬0,** which seems impossible to make every month as I'm projecting my first job (I've been on a few interviews) to be somewhere around **$60,000/year**

I do have other obligations every month, such as:

* Geico: $168
* Capital One Auto Finance: $345
* Verizon Wireless: $280
* Miscellaneous/Credit Card(s): $200-$300

My wife is only working part-time right now, I had a job previously before graduating but lost it due to the project completing, we've been living paycheck-to-paycheck and credit cards. I will factor at around $200/month as well as gas, food, etc.. but I do live with my parents. We're planning on paying off the credit cards with tax return income + grant money that she will be receiving in the spring from the college she goes to.

Once I have a job we will get on our feet no problem, but I want to be able to move out of my parent's house and all the places around the area of the potential employers are around $1300-$1700/month for rent. We also need to look into a car for my wife once I get a full-time position making good money, as she's been driving a beater car and I'm throwing more money into it fixing and it's on its last legs. So I figure that will be around the same as what my current car payment is. Although, the plan is for her to work part-time while going to school to cover her car loan + a little extra.

Would refinancing all these loans (even the ones that are under my mom's name) be a dumb move? I have no idea what the interest rate would be like.

What other options do I have instead? I know there's income-driven repayment, but I feel like it's not worth it with the amount of interest I'll be paying in the long + the longer term it will take to pay it off.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Just graduated college, the student loan payments look really scary to me and I need some tips on how to manage all of it.

Thank you,

investing,How would a wealth tax impact fixed income investments?,"As you all know, two of the Democratic candidates are pushing for a wealth tax. Bernie Sanders is pushing for a wealth tax in which the lowest bracket is taxed at 1% starting at $32 million dollars or more, and the highest bracket is 8% with $10 billion dollars or more. Whereas Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax has the lowest bracket at 2% starting at $50 million dollars and the highest bracket is 6% with $1 billion dollars or more.

https://taxfoundation.org/bernie-sanders-wealth-tax/
https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax

Many people are in favor of these wealth taxes although I imagine many other people are against them to. I personally have no strong opinion one way or the other on them since I don't know enough about it and haven't read enough about the subject.

However one thing I do see as a potential concern with the wealth tax is how it would impact fixed income investments and honestly all investments.

If you think about it, in theory doesn't it make intuitive sense that a wealth tax would make it less attractive for wealthy investors to put their money in fixed income investments like bonds for example? Why would you put money in bonds, bond ETF, REITs, etc that have a yield of 2% or 3% or whatever if your wealth is being taxed well above those rates? I understand that the underlying equity of bonds can appreciate as well, however the overall point I'm making is that even though to a layman a 6% tax doesn't sound like a big tax, it actually acts virtually as a 100% or possibly even more than 100% tax on your income if the underlying asset that is being taxed doesn't have a return on capital rate that is higher than the wealth tax rate.

I also understand that rich investors may still invest in fixed incomes anyways for the sake of diversifying their portfolios, however does it not make intuitive sense that a wealth tax would pervert and incentivize wealthy investors to put their money in riskier assets that typically have a higher return on investment so then they can still pay the wealth tax and simultaneously have their wealth still increase?

Assuming for a second that my hypothetical is correct, would this not lead to long term bond yields increasing, thereby not only making it more expensive for companies to borrow money by issuing bonds, but it may also cause the US government to have to borrow at higher interest rates which is counter productive to the idea that a wealth tax would generate more revenue. Sure the government would be getting more revenue, but the interest rates it would be paying on its debt would also go higher.

If this incentivizes investors to put more of their money in riskier assets, is that a good thing for the economy as a whole or is that damaging?

Or is my hypothetical scenario completely misplaced and wrong?

Again, I admit that my intuition here could be wrong, but it's something that has been on my mind for quite some time and I've never seen anyone talk about it so I thought I'd bring it up for discussion.",finance
personalfinance,I'm about to enter my fourth year of having my federal tax return withheld because of severely neglected student loans. What should I do before February?,"Long story short, I have been steadily employed the last four years.  The loans in this story are around $28k and now about 10 years old.  For my last 3 tax returns my federal has been withheld because I haven't paid my loans whatsoever.  It was something that I would ""take care of when I could"", at least that was the thought process for too long.

I will net a little over $18k this year.  I'll probably make slightly more next year.  Who should I contact and what should I do so that I don't lose out on my federal return this upcoming tax season? I think the smart thing to do would be to start making standard payments, but I bring home around $400 a week and I'm not sure that I'm quite ready to pay $200-300 a month towards those loans.

I appreciate any and all advice for this situation, and thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,401k deferral and special paycheck for housing.... confused. Can you ELI5????,"A special paycheck will be generated to reflect the housing amount paid as gross income, your applicable federal and state taxes will be withheld (paid by us) and then the housing amount reversed.   
WE will be grossing up the amount of the housing allowance to help you offset the Federal and State taxes withheld, so your net pay check will net out to zero.
 
Since it will appear on your W2, box 1, as taxable gross, this amount is also 401(k) eligible compensation.  At the time this housing was provided to you, you had a 401(k) deferral being deducted.  Unfortunately, since this special pay check has a net zero amount we are unable to take the 401(k) deduction from it and will have to do an adjustment on your last pay check of the year on December 20, 2019.  This adjustment will be IN ADDITION to your normal 401(k) deferral % being taken today.  
 
However, if you do NOT wish to have this additional 401(k) deduction we need your authorization
If you authorize this, your normal 401(k) deduction will take place on your December 20, 2019, but we would NOT take the additional 401(k) deduction on the housing amount.

So I’m guessing im getting a faux paycheck for approx 4500$ and my actual next paycheck will be 800 dollars less (taxes owed on that housing income) and I can contribute more to my 401k based on this $4500 of housing income?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

investing,"Could asset concentration be the reason why we have lower interest rates and low inflation during a time of economic expansion, rising markets?","It seems odd that equities markets continue to rise while the fed is lowering interest rates. I always expected the fed would reserve this tool for times of economic stress, which we clearly don't have. Defenders of the current policy actions say that they are lowering interest rates because inflation is so low. So I thought why is this the case? 

While I am no Einstein, a thought experiment occurred to me while contemplating this odd situation we are in. Lets say the Fed/Govt minted a $1 trillion bill and gave it to an individual citizen, with no strings attached. How would this impact the economy? I would imagine that we would see what we see today. Most of that trillion would end up in bonds and equities, driving down interest rates, and driving the S&amp;P higher... with little impact on inflation nationwide. Compare that to $1 trillion being created by the fed and issued via a one time ~$5000 stimulus check for every person in America. I have a feeling this would put major pressure on inflation, and interest rates would go up. 

Could this indicate that one of the problems with the current situation is that there is too much wealth concentration? And as soon as a robust wealth distribution scheme is put into place by US politicians it would unleash years of pent up, unrealized inflation?",finance

IRA: 20%
Savings: 10%.

My question is, should I change my plan of attack? Should I max out my IRA first, even though I also pay into a pension, and then continue to go heavy at my loan?

personalfinance,Is it always better to buy than rent?,"I have been curious about this for a while but have always been fed that it's always better to buy because you're wasting money by renting. Is this true? Doesn't interest on mortgage payments mean you basically (drastically) overpay on the total purchase price of the house even when equity is considered?

I'm going off of the mortgage of my dad's house. He pays \~$1K/mo and has been since he refinanced the house in '08/'09. The house was purchased for $184K with total payments over the years adding up to \~$100K. Only $30K has went to the principal so he still owes \~$150K. House has been valued at $162K last year. It looks like he's going to pay over $300k on a house that will hopefully be worth $200K someday! Seems like a huge waste of money and time when I look at it like this.",finance

personalfinance,Pay down mortgage with extra money?,"My husband and I are in our mid-thirties and are debt-free except for our house. We have around $1400 extra income each month after all our bills and are wondering what to do with it. 

We are already doing the following:

* Maxing out my 401k (he has a pension)
* Maxing out a Roth IRA
* Maxing out an HSA 
* Contributing $600 a month to our 3-year-old’s 529 (balance is currently \~25K)
* Maintaining a $12500 emergency fund in cash (roughly six months of expenses)

I was thinking about starting to aggressively pay down our mortgage so we can be 100% debt-free in a few years. However another user on this sub recommended against doing that. (We have a 4.25% interest rate, a $150K balance, and our house is worth \~$225K). 

I was also thinking about contributing more to my daughter’s 529, but don’t want to contribute too much as we would get hit with a 10% tax if my daughter doesn’t end up using all the funds for her education.

We already are planning on using some of the leftover money for home improvements and a nice vacation next year, but are there any other tax-advantaged ways I could grow the rest of that money for the future?",finance
personalfinance,Worth it to refinance my car loan? Or should I just continue to pay extra?,"Hello Reddit!

Back in July I applied for a used car loan.  This was a want for me and not a need - but let me begin by saying the decision to refinance now is not due to financial hardship, but the desire to save on interest over the life of the loan.  Interest rates have been cut three times since I took out the loan so I've been playing with numbers to see if this is worth it at all, and I'm hoping the experts here can help me out!

So let me break it down as best as I can.  I'm going to be providing some mostly accurate estimates of numbers.

Original loan:
$20,000 loan amount

$300/mo payment

77 month term (I know, stupid.  Another reason for the refi)

4.04% rate

Total interest paid over the life of the loan: $2740


The new loan if I refi:
$17135 loan amount (I have money to put down to bring the loan down to this new amount.  I would be paying closing fees again with my credit union, about $135 included in my figures)

$350/mo payment (this fits in just fine with my budget)

53 mo term (48 month term with a 5 month add on to keep the same rate of the 48 month term - this is something my credit union allows)

3.24% rate

Total interest: $1280

The new loan is obviously better, but the existing loan is already at a fairly low rate.  Is it worth it to take money out of my savings to pay down and refinance my existing loan?  I will add (and you're not going to like it) that this would deplete about one month's expenses from the emergency fund.  However, my current employment situation is very stable and I would be able to replenish it fairly quickly.  So what do you all think - should I go ahead and refinance, or should I just pay extra to my existing loan?

I greatly appreciate all the input you all can provide.  I have learned some great things browsing this sub, so I knew you all would be able to point me in the right direction.  I'll also try to keep an eye on this and add any additional information if needed.  Thanks!

personalfinance,Graduate school loans. Federal loans? Refinance house? 529?,"Going back to school and will have about 80K in debt minus three years of no income. My wife makes the lions share of our income so no worries there (assuming no massive recession or anything like that) Currently dual income, no kids, own a good chunk of our condo worth about 400.

Just learned about 529s for grad school and me being a dependent of my wifes for 3 years. Also kicking around the idea of just lumping my student loans on top of a refinance on the condo since the rate we can get is significantly better than what any federal loan might give me.

I realize we are late to the game for a 529 but we max our 401ks and are no longer eligible for ROTHs. The 529 would just be 3 years of tax free growth if I'm reading everything correctly.

personalfinance,Need to Refinance Med School Loans ASAP,"My SO is a PGY-1 intern in a family medicine residency program. Decision is to refinance rather than: 1) going the PSLF route and having limited options; or 2) going the other federal payment/forgiveness options since the amount that would be compounding at a high rate would then be taxable upon forgiveness in that year. SO will have a much higher income at that point, and it will probably be taxable at the highest possible rate. Thus, SO wants to refinance and pay down as quickly as able for ""freedom and peace of mind.""

By choosing SoFi or Laurel Road, the amount due each month will be $100 until completing residency (Jul'22); however, again, the plan is to pay down as much as able.  No real living expenses to speak of given situation, but the risk mitigation of only being obligated to pay $100 in the event of an emergency is nice.

Stats: \~$270k of federal student debt @ 6.03%; resident salary is $60k; credit score is \~790 with all 3 bureaus

Breakdown or current plan (please refer to the below table with SoFi and Laurel Road rates):

1. Choose the 5-year SoFi variable rate @ 2.835% and monitor monthly fluctuation closely.
2. After finishing residency and establishing a much higher salary for two months, refinance again to get a better rate locked in and assess payment velocity and maturity options/etc. 
   1. Rationale is that the balance will be compounding at the lowest possible rate for the next few years of residency, and SO can refinance with higher salary as less of a risk to the bank. Plus, residents only have three institutional options to refinance, so there will be many others to choose from once in practice as a family practitioner.

Please poke holes in the logic of the above plan if we're missing anything substantial and/or offer other ideas that we might not have considered.  We've read a ton on the white coat investor site and also on the many various articles and blogs for federal repayment plans.  Thoughts/caveats?

After a phone call and some digging, it seems that the issue is that I had mistakenly reported $3k in employer HSA contributions as ""other income"" on my federal filing, but not state. My employer had reissued W2s that year because of a mistake in how the HSA contribution had been listed on them, so it sounds like I must have used the incorrect one.

My understanding is that I shouldn't owe taxes on contributions my employer made to my HSA, and I need to revise my 2016 federal return with this information, and then MA will see there is no discrepancy in income. Can anyone confirm whether this thinking would be accurate? If so, how do I go about revising my 2016 federal return to reflect this?

stocks,Gold Stays Steady Trading Amid Trade and Economic Uncertainty,"Gold was steady headed into the end of the week. Investors have been waiting to see if new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would emerge by a Dec. 15 deadline and after the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged.   


# Spot gold was at $1,472 an ounce and U.S. gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,479.10.

“The slight fall in gold can be attributed to profit-taking after the Fed decided to keep rates on hold, but the change is minimal as investors are still cautious about what will happen

on Dec. 15,” said Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler.  


The U.S. Fed’s benchmark overnight rate in its range between 1.50% and 1.75% three-quarters of a percentage point below where it started the year.   


“With the Fed possibly expanding the balance sheet again in 2020 … gold should be a regular feature in one’s asset allocation during periods of market uncertainty, especially when interest rates are low,” AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes noted.  


U.S. President Donald Trump met with top advisers on Thursday to discuss trade and the Dec. 15 deadline for new tariffs on nearly $160 billion worth of Chinese consumer goods, three sources familiar with the plans.  


According to Mitsubishi’s Butler, investors should look at gold as a longer term hold. Markets focused on the U.K. election which could lead to Britain’s departure from the European Union, and Christine Lagarde’s first meeting of the European Central Bank later in the day.   


Gold has long been considered a potential safe-haven investment during political and financial uncertainty.   


Palladium had increased 1% to $1,928.04 and has hit a record high of $1,931.50. The metal soared passed $1,900 for the first time in its history. Flooding in South Africa mines pushed the metal higher, as they triggered severe power blackouts and thus hindering production.   


“Even after the mines open in South Africa, palladium prices are not expected to correct much. It rather has a high potential to hit $2,000 soon,” Butler added.  


Platinum increased 0.3% to $941.89 while silver was little changed $16.88.

Gold had surged to a five-week high before selling off due to a tweet from President Trump. Gold futures were down $1.10 an ounce at $1,473.90 and March Comex silver prices were up $0.01 at $16.94 an ounce.   


Downbeat U.S. economic data is also bolstering gold’s outlook with jobless claims increasing more than forecast.   


Gold bulls cheered when the new European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde appeared dovish on ECB money policy, saying that it would continue its bond-buying program as long as it takes.   


President Trump then tweeted that the U.S. and China wanted a trade deal –– a positive sign that a partial trade deal could soon be completed.  


The FOMC meeting of the Federal Reserve meant no change in U.S. interest rates and a positive upbeat of the U.S. economy.   


The FOMC said there were no rate-cut plans planned for 2020, with most comments coming out of the meeting viewed as neutral.  


Gold and Treasury markets rallied, nonetheless, as the U.S. dollar index sold off and hit a five-week low in the aftermath of the FOMC statement Wednesday afternoon.

personalfinance,Can I deduct after school care expenses at a private educational instutition?,"I have an 8 year old son that is enrolled in a home school supplement program (i.e. sort of like a church school, that isn't a ""real"" school).  We don't actually home school him though...he attends this program the same hours normal kids would attend school, and there are other kids there with him.  I believe the reason they have to qualify this as a home school supplement is because the program itself isn't certified by the state as an educational institution so they can't confer diplomas (or whatever the proper terminology is).  They essentially do all the same curriculum a home schooled student does, the only difference is that instead of parents handling instruction, the ""teachers"" at the program do it for us.

He also goes to an after ""school"" day care program run by the same people.  He attends that from 2pm - 5pm when he gets picked up.  There's a separate cost for this program.

My question is whether or not I can safely classify the costs for the after school program (typically between $200-400/mo, depending on how many days he goes to the after school program) as child care expenses, and if so, I assume those would be expenses I can deduct on my federal taxes (I've never done it before, so I may not be using the right terminology)?",finance

investing,I tuned into Vanguard's webcast last night about the global economic outlook in 2020 and beyond,"Sup,

Last night I tuned into Vanguard's webcast which featured their chief economist's outlook on 2020 and beyond.

My main takeaways from last night's Vanguard webcast: 

* Expect reduced returns, especially in the US Markets for years to come
* Expect volatility caused by retracting global economies and ongoing trade tensions
* Fed would likely drop interest rates to ZERO (immediately) if Recession is imminent (we're NOT in panic mode yet and the inverted yield corrected itself, but it **has been a lagging indicator of US Recessions for the past 50 years**), but it's NOT in the Fed's interest to drop below zero (hasn't been working well for European countries and Japan)

That said, **since NO one can predict jack shit, pay off your high interest debt if you have any, have emergency funds saved, and DIVERSIFY your portfolios to prepare for the Unknown.** 

Example of diversification:   **A simple 60/40 stock/bond portfolio had about half as much downside during the 2008 financial crisis as a 100% stock portfolio, and recovered more quickly:**

economy,We Have A Problem,"While reading some of Ray Dalio's posts on Long Term Debt Cycle, something ominous hit me. Donald Trump is following the long-term deleveraging campaign Ray Dalio prescribes. However, Donald trump is executing it for perverse reasons. The deleveraging phase is required when simply lowering interest rates has no more impact. So, the central bank must print money to stimulate the economy. But printing money does nothing except for those who have financial assets and credit they can use for borrowing. The government must act to increase spending in order to get the freshly printed money into productive use. Ray Dalio promotes this may prove successful when the income produced with the freshly printed money more than offsets the debt added.  The problem with Donald Trump's policies is we are not deleveraging. Worse than that, Donald Trump's actions are only marginally increasing income while at the same time continuing to increase debt.   Ray Dalio promotes the deleveraging phase to commence while businesses, banks, and people act to reduce their debt and agree that slow income growth is acceptable. 

 Starting the deleveraging cycle while businesses, banks, and people still demand high income growth and high debt - at a time when asset values, debt levels, and incomes are not aligned, while growth has already been slow for many years - is asking for trouble. Asset values are illusory, being pumped up by ever more debt. This has no effect on equity.  But the problem is worse than a simple bubble. Because the government and central bank have started the deleveraging cycle before the economy is ready, central bank policies may prove useless when the economy does slow.   Why does Donald Trump do this? These actions make people and businesses feel wealthy. Donald trump takes credit. Donald Trump gets reelected. When the economy does fall apart, Donald Trump will blame everyone around him and claim only he can fix the problem. So, he asks for a third term i office. But by that point the situation is hopeless",finance

I talked with two of the mortgage companies and left with a bad taste (unknown fees and bad rates).

I got an accepted offer on the land last Wednesday. I got in touch with the loan officer at the bank the same day and she put together the loan disclosures for me to sign the same day. She neglected to mention she signed me up for a floating interest rate and put 4.65% as an ""estimate"". My credit score is 749, going 20% down, net 7k income a month after taxes, loan will be 200k after I put down 50k.

I sent her a note the same day (Wednesday) telling her I wanted to lock the rate. The disclosure stated I have the option to submit a ""float down"" request in the instance that I lock and interest rates drop. She emailed back saying she would call me soon. Didn't hear back from her until Friday night at 5pm and she was fumbling with the software. Eventually she said the software was down and she would call me Monday with the rate.

One even told me that they I won't get a refund. Is there a middle ground?**

More detailed summary

In 2018

* I was a resident of Maryland, while I was in school on F1-Visa.
* While in school (in Maryland), I did **part-time jobs** and I made about **$2,000** dollars.
* During summer, I **interned with Company X** (in New York) for about 10 weeks, and earned **$23,000** as internship stipend.
* I was offered a job from them which I accepted (to join in 2019) for which they offered me a **joining bonus** of **$35,000**.

So as of 12/31/2018 my net pay had been $2000 + $23000 + $35000 = $60,000.

In January of 2019, I decided to not join **Company X** and return the joining bonus of $35,000.

So, technically my actual income was  $2000 + $23000 = $25,000, but I ended up paying tax for an income of $60,000.

**Conclusion**

Maryland 2018 : I owed $1,400

New York 2018 : I got back $1,800

Federal 2018 : I got back $5,000

Selling our home will be pretty quick in our current market, as should purchasing a new construction home at our destination due to ample inventory. 

Luckily, we are moving from a high cost of living area to a low cost one, and we currently have 430k remaining on our current mortgage for a home worth approx. $700k. While we have ample equity for a very large down payment on a $400k home in our new market, we only have about $50k in cash available for a down payment. I know rent back could be an option, other than that, we are looking at financial options. Which of the options below would be the cheapest/easiest/quickest one? Are there other options that we haven't thought of? Is a 401k loan even an option if I’m leaving my job and starting a new one? If it matters, my wife and I both have excellent (&gt;830) credit.

Option 1: Bridge Loan

Option 2: 401k loan

Option 3: Less than 20% down payment, either swallow PMI or refinance within first year.

Another somewhat related question, does it make sense to put as much of our home equity as possible toward our new mortgage if the interest rate is around 3.75%, or should we make the 20% down payment and invest the remainder (other real estate, stocks, etc)?

Edit: To expand on option 3, if I make a 10% down payment when I purchase the new home and then make an additional 20% lump sum payment after I sell my current home, could my PMI be automatically canceled within the first few months? If so, this seems like the most straight forward option.",finance

Owed some tax last year, was uncertain of my financial situation so I dropped 401K contribution to 8% in the beginning of the year. 

Realized poor decision,  increased to 11% and   now up to 13%.

I raised contributions at same time I switched from single zero to single one. As I thought, more pre-tax contributions = less taxable income.  
Thought why not contribute more, and receive less of a return. (Is my thinking right on this?)

Am going to raise 401K to 18% in January. 
Only 49 yo, so if I make same amount it will be just right.

Question 1, do I take gross income, deduct standard deduction $12,200 and the $10,789 401K contribution which equal $22,989 and subtract that from my total income of $103,520 which would be $80,531? Find the income tax owed on that and see how much I overpaid with the $14,781?
Will that be my return?

Question 2, every income tax calculator I find asks for amount of money spent on mortgage interest paid. Also property taxes paid. &lt;  (Do those payments figure into my equation? Or would that be a completely different itemized situation?)

Question 3, is it a mistake to have less tax taken out in the manner of the single 1 versus single 0? 
Am I losing a little pre-tax savings by doing that? 

Am I figuring out my taxable income correctly?

Veteran executives and financiers helped fuel WeWork’s spectacular rise and fall, pouring in capital while ceding control to its founder

By Maureen Farrell and Eliot Brown
Dec. 14, 2019 12:00 am ET
 
In early October, WeWork’s board of directors trickled into a brick building in lower Manhattan where the startup had an office. After they took their seats around the conference room table, Mark Schwartz started to vent.

“I’ve stayed silent too long,” the 65-year-old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner told the six other men on the board, including WeWork’s co-founder and chairman, Adam Neumann.

Mr. Schwartz aired his frustrations about the state of the company, which was perilously low on cash after years of freewheeling spending and had become the butt of jokes on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the meeting.

No more fantasies, he said, as advisers and others looked on. Now, he said, they needed to make decisions that would save the company.

Even more remarkable than the content of Mr. Schwartz’s blistering rebuke was the fact that it came so late. The banker had stayed silent so long that the story was almost over.

We Co., as the parent company is officially known, was already a distressed asset by then, undone by conflicts and the dawning realization that it was just a hip real-estate sublessor—not a tech company. A few weeks earlier, WeWork had shelved its disastrous attempt at an initial public offering and Mr. Neumann had subsequently stepped down as chief executive.

It was a spectacular fall for the company that months before had been America’s most valuable startup.

Little of WeWork’s trajectory would have been possible were it not for the collection of veteran executives and financiers from the upper echelons of Wall Street and Silicon Valley who enabled Mr. Neumann, a charismatic 40-year-old with little prior business experience.

Mr. Neumann mesmerized them with his pitch, which offered a vision for the property-leasing company as a tech startup with limitless potential to transform how people work and live.

Investors poured capital onto Mr. Neumann’s business bonfire and ceded control, rarely pushing back with any force despite mounting problems and year after year of missed projections.

Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank Group Corp., who helped inflate WeWork’s valuation to $47 billion, pushed an already wild-spending Mr. Neumann to act bigger and crazier. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. CEO James Dimon and other bankers, instead of injecting a dose of reality, spent years championing Mr. Neumann and the company as they battled for the coveted IPO assignment.

The outside board directors, all of whom had decades of experience in business and finance, voted for years to approve decisions by Mr. Neumann that paved the way for WeWork’s near collapse. Some of them had potential conflicts of interest themselves.

The directors on the board let Mr. Neumann personally buy stakes in buildings that he would lease to WeWork. They gave him long-term voting control of the company in 2014, and allowed him to sell and borrow more than $1 billion against his WeWork stake. They approved hundreds of millions of dollars for acquisitions of tech companies that were viewed by top executives as wasteful spending, with little relation to WeWork’s core business.

The end result didn’t just blow up $39 billion of the company’s value, roughly the value of Delta Air Lines Inc. It was a watershed moment for Silicon Valley. For years, investors salivated over all-powerful founders who promised disruption and demanded control. After WeWork’s spectacular flameout, investors have grown skeptical of the model.

In the moment, there was little debate following Mr. Schwartz’s remarks in the Oct. 3 meeting. The company needed funds to avoid running out of money by the second week of November.

Mr. Neumann, who had repeatedly skipped board meetings, including as the company was planning the IPO, urged the board to move quickly. They needed to save the company and that was all that mattered, he said.

The beginning

WeWork was born in the wake of the global financial crisis. In 2009, Mr. Neumann and Miguel McKelvey, a trained architect, had success with a small property-leasing business in Brooklyn. The next year they opened their first office in Manhattan.

The New York economy was reheating and young entrepreneurs flocked into its tiny SoHo location. It proved an ideal time to be hunting for startup financing, with housing and banks hobbled by the recession and interest rates low.

Mr. Neumann excelled at the fundraising game. He laid out a vision for a set of “We”-branded businesses, such as office renting, housing, banking and business services, that could make money off young entrepreneurs in a changing workforce.

Within a couple of years, Mr. Neumann had piqued the interest of Michael Eisenberg, then an Israel-based partner at the vaunted venture-capital firm Benchmark Capital. Mr. Neumann flew to Benchmark’s Silicon Valley office to pitch its partners. The conclusion: Many were skeptical of the business, but they loved Mr. Neumann, and figured he had the charisma and instincts to build a huge company. Benchmark led WeWork’s first, Series A round of venture funding, which totaled $17.5 million.

WeWork’s business model was to lease long-term and charge higher rates to short-term small-business clients. That meant revenue relatively quickly exceeded the costs of operating its spaces. This is relatively common in real estate, but it looked extraordinary compared with software and hardware companies, which typically require years of investment.

DAG Ventures, another Silicon Valley venture-capital shop, invested in WeWork at a $440 million valuation. Then came JPMorgan’s asset-management arm, at $1.5 billion. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. jumped in at a $5 billion valuation in late 2014. Six months later, Fidelity Investments followed at $10 billion.

The rush of money gave startup CEOs extraordinary leverage. For decades, investors were used to being able to fire founders and steer the direction of their companies. Now investors competed to show how they were “founder friendly.” Founders were lionized for having giant vision, inspiration and a little bit of crazy.

Mr. Neumann had all these traits, and his eccentricities only seemed to entrance investors even more.

In late 2015, WeWork was completing an investment round led by Beijing-based Hony Capital Ltd. that pushed its valuation to $16 billion. Mr. Neumann invited its CEO, John Zhao, to a party at 110 Wall Street, where WeWork was about to open its first WeLive dormlike apartment building.

Toward the end of the night, Mr. Neumann led others to the roof of the 27-story building. There, guests passed around tequila shots. Mr. Neumann picked up a fire extinguisher and set it off, spraying Mr. Zhao and others with white foam.

The deal went through. Mr. Zhao joined WeWork’s board in July 2016.

Mr. Neumann continuously said profitability was just around the corner. In reality, its losses were swelling far larger every year.

A presentation for prospective investors in fall 2014 projected the company would turn a $4.2 million operating profit for the year. When the year was through, just three months later, the company reported an operating loss of $88 million on $74 million of revenue, according to internal documents.

Mr. Neumann told The Wall Street Journal in 2015 that WeWork was profitable and it didn’t need additional funding before an IPO. It reported a $233 million loss for the year on $187 million in revenue.

In fact, WeWork has had only one profitable year in its history: 2012, when it generated about $1.7 million in net income, internal documents show.

Keeping control

As investors poured in more money, Mr. Neumann’s grip on WeWork tightened.

To maintain control, as part of the round in which T. Rowe Price invested in the company, Mr. Neumann restructured WeWork’s stock so that each of his shares had 10 times the votes of a normal one.

As part of the same deal, an entity Mr. Neumann controlled sold $40 million of stock. He did it twice again in 2015, selling an additional $80 million. It was a tiny portion of his stake—he was worth around $3 billion on paper—but Silicon Valley investors normally hated such sales. Startup founders were supposed to stay aligned with investors until everyone could sell, usually in an IPO or sale.

Some directors urged more restraint. Bruce Dunlevie, Benchmark’s representative on the board, resisted the voting control change, telling Mr. Neumann and other members of the board that absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Mr. Neumann prevailed, winning over the full board on both the voting control and the stock sales.

Benchmark partner Bill Gurley is known for criticizing venture firms that give too much power to founders. Several of its companies—including Snap Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., where Benchmark held board seats—have been criticized on the same issues. In 2017, Mr. Gurley helped push out Travis Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder and CEO, amid scandals and concerns about corporate culture.

Mr. Gurley and most of the other Benchmark partners increasingly viewed Mr. Neumann as similar to Mr. Kalanick—a rogue CEO who needed to be reined in, according to people who have discussed the matter with the firm.

In 2017, five partners from Benchmark flew in from the Bay Area to Manhattan to meet Mr. Neumann. They raised concerns about issues including missed projections and Mr. Neumann’s stock sales, a person familiar with the meeting said.

Among Benchmark’s partners, Mr. Dunlevie tended to be deferential to Mr. Neumann, causing tensions within the firm, people familiar with the dynamics said. He criticized some of Mr. Neumann’s actions, but also frequently extolled the CEO’s vision, comparing him to Amazon. com Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos.

Some directors saw their roles as more akin to advisers, rather than watchdogs or guardians for other shareholders, given that Mr. Neumann effectively controlled the board, according to people who have spoken with them. Mr. Neumann’s potent voting stock gave him the right to replace them or pack the board to outvote dissenters. Voting against Mr. Neumann would make it harder to register criticism in the future, some reasoned.

Multiple directors also shared some of the potential conflicts for which Mr. Neumann was later criticized.

He had always been open about hiring friends and family. WeWork’s executive ranks included his wife, Rebekah Neumann, the company’s chief brand officer. Mr. Neumann once told staff the board strongly resisted hiring Ms. Neumann, but he persevered, telling directors they could have both Neumanns at WeWork, or neither.

At an executive retreat in Montauk on Long Island, Mr. Neumann once raised a glass in a toast “to nepotism,” attendees said.

Among board members, Mr. Zhao’s son got a job at WeWork, as did the daughter of Mr. Dunlevie, who wasn’t involved in her hiring, people familiar with the matter said.

Lew Frankfort, former CEO of Coach Inc., borrowed from WeWork to buy stock and exercise some stock options early—a move typically made to save on taxes.

Another director, Steven Langman, had a deal with WeWork that could prove highly lucrative. His private-equity firm, Rhone Group, became a co-manager of WeWork’s real-estate fund business, which bought properties to lease to the company. Rhone was entitled to management fees and a percentage of profits on properties purchased.

Earlier this year, WeWork expanded its involvement in the real-estate fund business, diminishing the influence of Rhone—which initially had a 50% stake. In April 2019, WeWork gave 454,546 restricted shares to Mr. Langman “for his ongoing services to The We Company,” according to the prospectus. The award, granted over multiple years, would have been worth around $50 million at WeWork’s share price from the time. The share value has fallen by more than 80% since.

Ramping up

Into this freewheeling situation came SoftBank’s Mr. Son. From WeWork’s early days, speed was central to its narrative: Its goal was to build out more properties more quickly than any company ever. Mr. Neumann, who often spent meetings pacing the floor, was known for his frenetic energy.

Speed is an essential ingredient in Mr. Son’s narrative, too. He’s often said he decided to invest in Jack Ma, co-founder of Alibaba Group Holding Inc., within minutes of meeting him because of “the sparkles in his eyes.” (Mr. Ma and his wife, Cathy Ma, invested roughly $25 million in WeWork in 2016 as part of the round led by Hony, said people familiar with the investment.)

Mr. Son’s gut-based investment style became a hallmark of the $100 billion Vision Fund. The fund showered money on unprofitable startups, pushing up valuations many considered already overinflated. He allowed executives in his portfolio companies to cash out huge sums far before investors generated any returns.

Mr. Neumann said in an interview on CNBC this year that it took Mr. Son 28 minutes to make his initial decision in late 2016 to invest $4.4 billion in WeWork, time that included getting in and out of the car and touring the company’s headquarters.

Executives at SoftBank had looked at WeWork before—and passed.

After the 2016 initial agreement between Messrs. Son and Neumann, many on SoftBank’s team panned the deal, upset they were committing so heavily to a real-estate company. Ultimately, Mr. Son made the decisions about whether or not to invest.

In March 2017, for the first time after their handshake agreement, Mr. Neumann and a contingent of WeWork executives and advisers flew to Tokyo to meet Mr. Son and his team.

In a late-night meeting days before the trip, Mr. Neumann insisted they arrive with a gift for Mr. Son, and deemed that a giant artwork hanging in his own office, a collage made of electronics and other objects that spelled out WeWork, would be appropriate. It was too large to fly with the group on a private jet, so his team dispatched their logistics courier to ship it. The carrier put it in a crate on a commercial jet, at a cost of roughly $50,000. WeWork executives saw it hung up in SoftBank’s office in a subsequent visit.

Grow faster

The board’s newest directors, Ron Fisher and Mr. Schwartz, joined in 2017, representing SoftBank. Before the SoftBank deal, WeWork’s revenue was roughly doubling annually, an astonishing pace for a company then seven years old. Some executives hoped it would slow, so WeWork could start to focus on losses and logistical problems.

Mr. Neumann made clear to staff that the company’s new backer wanted WeWork to grow faster, not slower. He frequently cited what he said was Mr. Son’s advice: Don’t worry about profitability and grab as much market share as possible as quickly as possible. He told friends and colleagues he knew he was crazy, but Mr. Son told him to be crazier.

At one meeting, Mr. Son told Mr. Neumann he shouldn’t be proud of WeWork’s lean sales staff, and that it should aim to have 10,000 salespeople, a giant number for a company that had fewer than 10,000 total employees at the time. Mr. Neumann told his deputies to expand the sales staff more quickly.

Money poured into expansion in China and other Asian countries, highly competitive markets where losses were large.

Mr. Neumann helmed an array of new initiatives and acquisitions that had little or no connection to WeWork’s core business. Purchases included event-planning site Meetup.com, search engine optimization company Conductor, and the Flatiron Academy coding school.

WeWork also opened an elementary school in Manhattan in 2018 called WeGrow. Mr. Neumann told staff the project came about after he and his wife were unable to find adequate schooling choices for their five children.

Directors frequently raised concerns about the proposed acquisitions, questioning Mr. Neumann on why the company was expanding into the disparate areas. Nevertheless, WeWork spent more than $500 million in two years on tech-related companies, with board approval.

Mr. Neumann considered other deals, including an acquisition of Cushman &amp; Wakefield PLC, one of the country’s largest commercial real-estate services firms, which currently has a market capitalization of around $4.2 billion. He made an offer to buy salad chain Sweetgreen Inc., recently valued at $1.6 billion. And WeWork came close to paying over $1 billion for facilities management company BGIS before backing out late in the process.

WeWork’s own facilities became increasingly opulent. The sixth floor of its low-slung headquarters was redone, with a large section just for executives, including an exercise room. Mr. Neumann’s office included a sauna and an ice bath.

Mr. Neumann wanted a big presence in San Francisco as well. It leased offices with sweeping views in the new Salesforce Tower. WeWork ordered giant openings to be cut in the floor to make way for airy staircases—an expensive maneuver. A fitness club was added, with an ice bath. The total costs exceeded $550 a square foot, roughly three times what WeWork normally spends on renovating an office.

Then there was the jet.

WeWork had been renting jets for Mr. Neumann from when WeWork was valued at just $5 billion, but he wanted an upgrade. The Gulfstream G650ER was top of the line, with 16 plush seats, high-speed internet and two lavatories, including one just for the crew.

Multiple investors, including some directors, questioned the necessity of it, but Mr. Neumann was insistent. The company made the $63 million purchase, and the jet was delivered in summer 2018.

The business itself was straining to keep up its punishing growth rate as it grew larger. WeWork executives worried that in places such as Manhattan, where the company was already the largest private tenant, doubling WeWork every year could drive up the entire market for office rentals.

Facing tough deadlines to open multiple new buildings a week, staffers often shipped couches by air to arrive on time, which sometimes cost more than the couches themselves.

Employees were whipsawed by frequent design changes to make new offices more avant-garde. That meant rows of furniture just months old could go to waste. WeWork occasionally held sales at its New Jersey warehouse to clear out the older models, allowing employees to buy $1,000-plus midcentury-modern-style couches from brands such as Vitra for $100 or less.

When WeWork opened its first buildings in South Korea, it shipped thousands of mugs manufactured in China that failed to meet South Korea’s strict import laws. While those mugs sat in customs warehouses, WeWork bought thousands of mugs at higher prices in time for opening day.

Some investors were increasingly concerned with the business and its management, as well as stock sales by Mr. Neumann.

“We saw the valuation rise and the corporate governance erode,” said Eric Veiel, co-head of global equity at T. Rowe Price. Amid concerns over issues like Mr. Neumann’s purchases of property he leased to WeWork, the mutual-fund manager made clear to Mr. Neumann, WeWork management and the board it had grown sour on the company, he said.

“We sold as much as we possibly could,” he said, referring to two deals in 2017 and 2019, when SoftBank bought stock from existing investors.

More capital

By 2018, it was clear WeWork would need billions of dollars more to keep growing.

Though he was chairman, Mr. Neumann missed numerous board meetings throughout 2018, sending deputies instead. In at least one meeting, directors discussed the pace of growth.

Several directors told others they took comfort knowing WeWork would soon need to go public because of its need for more cash to keep growing. The public markets, they told each other, would help serve as a check on Mr. Neumann.

In board meetings, directors including Messrs. Schwartz, Dunlevie and Langman pushed Mr. Neumann to commit to a timetable for an IPO.

Messrs. Neumann and Son had other plans. In mid-2018, they started talking about a giant deal in which SoftBank would buy a majority stake in WeWork for roughly $20 billion, including buying out existing investors.

It wasn’t to be. SoftBank’s stock plunged amid a broader fall in technology stocks and concerns over the potential acquisition, while key SoftBank investors, including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, opposed it. On Christmas Eve, Mr. Son told Mr. Neumann the deal wouldn’t work.

Mr. Neumann took WeWork’s jet to Hawaii and met Mr. Son in an attempt to come up with an alternative. Over breakfast, Mr. Son agreed to invest $2 billion, bringing the size of WeWork’s latest round of financing to $6 billion, and SoftBank’s total to $10 billion. The two men agreed the company’s valuation would be $47 billion, although people close to the deal never saw a clear explanation of how that number was determined, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal called for $1 billion to go to buying shares from existing investors, allowing some on the board to sell.

Mr. Neumann said in a January interview on CNBC that the funding from SoftBank was “above and beyond what we need to fund the company for the next four to five years.”

The company would nearly run out of cash in November. WeWork ended up on a path to burn more than $3 billion for 2019.

Mr. Neumann told the Journal earlier this year that watching 
Mr. Son do his math was “beautiful to see.”

Going public

In need of more funding, WeWork began to turn to an IPO, even though Mr. Neumann felt more comfortable in the private markets.

Bankers up and down Wall Street had been wooing him for years with the hope of an eventual IPO, where they would win millions of dollars in fees and the prestige of bringing a giant company to the public markets.

Closest to the company had always been JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, both WeWork investors. Mr. Neumann referred to JPMorgan’s Mr. Dimon as his personal banker.

It was almost literal: JPMorgan led a $500 million credit line to Mr. Neumann and lent another $97 million in other forms of debt, largely mortgages with low rates on his many homes. Mr. Dimon once ordered his bank to mimic some of WeWork’s office designs after a tour of a WeWork with Mr. Neumann.

In theory, investment bankers can provide prospective IPO companies practical expertise on the rigors of life as a public company owned by pension funds and individual investors.

In practice, the bankers supercharged WeWork’s visions of grandeur. They pitched an extraordinarily optimistic picture, giving Mr. Neumann and other executives more confidence in WeWork’s growth-heavy, loss-heavy strategy. JPMorgan told WeWork it thought the company would be worth as much as $60 billion, which was lower than estimates from other banks. Mr. Neumann said that wasn’t aggressive enough, a person familiar with the matter said.


A page from Goldman Sachs’ WeWork presentation references Mother Teresa, Steve Jobs, Bob Marley and Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Bankers at Goldman Sachs referenced Mother Teresa and Bob Marley in its pitch presentation. One slide enumerated, “Your path to $1 trillion,” referring to a target of $1 trillion market capitalization within a decade or so.

Comparable companies, Goldman said, were Salesforce.com Inc., Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. The difference between WeWork and this cohort of companies, Goldman Sachs’ pitch deck said, was: “You are scaling faster.”

One slide said only, “Growth is paramount.”

Mr. Neumann and other executives began using the projections to justify WeWork’s $47 billion valuation to some employees and outsiders.

There were warning signs that public-market investors would be wary. WeWork executives and its bankers were aware that T. Rowe Price, a significant IPO investor, wouldn’t be investing in the offering. The fund’s co-head of global equity, Mr. Veiel, said they knew for years they wouldn’t invest, saying there was “mutual disinterest.”

As IPO preparations heated up, Mr. Neumann became distracted by surfing, a passion of his that became increasingly blended into the fabric of the company.

After spending part of the winter living in his house in Marin Country, Calif., in early 2019, he moved back to New York, and relocated his Hawaii-based surf instructor and his family there, too. Mr. Neumann paid for their apartment in Manhattan, and some of the instructor’s children attended WeGrow, people familiar with the arrangement said.

Throughout the year, Mr. Neumann made surf trips to the Dominican Republic and the Maldives. During a week in early June, WeWork’s company plane made two trips between Costa Rica and New York.

Meanwhile, Mr. Neumann kept up surfing from the Hamptons and Montauk over the summer. Executives from WeWork and bankers and advisers including lawyers from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP worked with Mr. Neumann and his wife on IPO-related documents and presentations at their homes there.

Mr. Neumann oversaw a complex legal restructuring of the company that gave him and a cadre of other executives stock compensation with more favorable tax treatment than other employees at the company—a move approved by the board.

The mood changed drastically in mid-August.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS

How much control should investors give to a company’s founder? Join the conversation below.

After WeWork made its IPO paperwork public, potential investors, analysts and the media panned WeWork for its growing losses and lack of a path to profitability, and for Mr. Neumann’s string of conflicts. The language used to describe the company was widely derided. The prospectus was dedicated to the “energy of we,” and the company’s mission statement was to “elevate the world’s consciousness.”

The reaction sent WeWork’s expected valuation plummeting and prompted Mr. Neumann’s financial enablers to speak up more forcefully.

Mr. Neumann’s investment bankers from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs had been bracing for a rough response. While they were bullish in pitches months earlier, weeks before the IPO filing was made public, they warned Mr. Neumann that his unusual ties to the company and other governance decisions could cut the company’s stock price.

By the end of August, weeks before the IPO was planned to launch, WeWork’s valuation was expected to be less than half the $47 billion mark from January.

At Mr. Son’s behest, Mr. Neumann took the company jet to Tokyo, where Mr. Son argued to delay the offering, saying WeWork clearly wasn’t ready. Mr. Neumann rebuffed Mr. Son, saying he would push ahead.

As Mr. Neumann prepared to leave, Mr. Son offered some parting advice, according to people familiar with the conversation: This is going to be bad for you and bad for the company.

Investor search

In the days that followed, Mr. Neumann scoured the globe for others to commit to the IPO.

On Sept. 3 in London, he met Yasir al-Rumayyan, the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund, a big investor in SoftBank’s Vision Fund, according to people familiar with the meeting. Mr. al-Rumayyan didn’t invest.

Facing criticism that WeWork had no female directors, Mr. Neumann announced he would add Frances Frei, a professor of technology and operations at Harvard Business School, to its board.

Ms. Frei had been employed as a consultant to help improve management, including encouraging gender equality in hiring and setting up internal training programs, and her firm was given a three-year contract valued at roughly $5 million, including stock options. Some executives were frustrated by her use of private aircrafts to travel from Boston to WeWork’s headquarters in Manhattan at WeWork’s expense.

The board, though, was annoyed Mr. Neumann hadn’t told them about the addition until after it was done. Directors vented to each other at a board meeting that followed—one in which Mr. Neumann was again absent. Soon after, Mr. Langman confronted Mr. Neumann, telling him his disengagement with the board was unacceptable.

Mr. Neumann showed up at the next meeting days later, apologized and pledged to attend.

In another meeting in WeWork’s headquarters, bankers from JPMorgan and Goldman, his main lawyer from Skadden Arps and several senior executives discussed more changes. Mr. Neumann initially said he didn’t want to do anything further. Two of JPMorgan’s bankers on the deal, Michael Millman and Noah Wintroub, told Mr. Neumann that the company had no chance of going public without changes.

Mr. Neumann eventually relented. The group spent hours, stretching long into the evening, getting Mr. Neumann to agree to everything.

The changes included a promise to appoint a lead independent director by the end of the year, halving his voting rights to 10 votes per share from 20, and eliminating a provision in which his wife, Rebekah Neumann—also a WeWork co-founder—would play a role in choosing Mr. Neumann’s successor.

That night, Mr. Neumann’s co-founder, Mr. McKelvey, called Nasdaq executives to tell them WeWork planned to list on their exchange when they debuted roughly two weeks later.

As bankers surveyed investors, it was clear the offering still might not have enough demand for the more than $3 billion WeWork wanted to raise—which was also necessary to gain access to another $6 billion in debt.

WeWork executives and some advisers worried about another development: a coming Journal story that they feared would detail Mr. Neumann’s erratic management style and behavior including marijuana use.

On several occasions after the prospectus was filed, Mr. Wintroub, one of the JPMorgan bankers, told Mr. Neumann that he needed to stop using marijuana and take the IPO process seriously.

Postponed

On the afternoon of Sunday, Sept. 15, bankers from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs gathered at WeWork’s headquarters to discuss setting a potential price range for shares in the IPO, ahead of the kickoff of a two-week sales pitch to potential investors the following day. Mr. Neumann was expected to sit down with the bankers but never did.

Instead, he spent the day in another part of his company’s headquarters filming his portion of a video that would be used at all the pre-IPO investor meetings. Mr. Neumann had canceled numerous previous film shoots. The process didn’t wrap up until nearly midnight and was mixed with tequila and vodka shots, largely drank by WeWork executives, as the night wore on.

By late Monday afternoon, at the urging of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ bankers in a meeting at JPMorgan’s headquarters, Mr. Neumann agreed to postpone the IPO.

During a series of meetings that day with Mr. Dimon in attendance, bankers said investors were particularly concerned about Mr. Neumann and suggested he consider stepping down. Mary Erdoes, the bank’s asset-management chief, said many investors thought an IPO was untenable if he remained at the helm. Mr. Dimon and Goldman’s key banker, David Ludwig, pushed him to commit to other governance changes, including getting rid of his voting control.

Mr. Neumann was noncommittal. But the stage was set for his ouster.

On Wednesday, the Journal story was published, sparking chatter at a three-day meeting in Pasadena, Calif., run by SoftBank. Investors and executives at companies backed by SoftBank urged Mr. Son to move against Mr. Neumann.

Over the weekend, he did. His two board members, as well as others, pushed for Mr. Neumann’s ouster. Mr. Dimon added to the pressure on Sunday, advising Mr. Neumann the offering couldn’t go ahead if he stayed on as CEO. At a dinner that night, Messrs. Eisenberg, Dunlevie and Langman urged him to step down.

By the end of the weekend, it was clear to members of the board that Mr. Neumann would relinquish his role. If he didn’t give up his post, the company would run out of money and his stake could be worthless. When the board met without Mr. Neumann Monday morning, they largely spoke about who would lead the company.

He gave up control to two lieutenants, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, and board members began descending on the company to help lead its operations. The company hired prominent banker Peter Weinberg as an adviser to help the board sort through options.

SoftBank executives put together a rescue package with $5 billion in new financing that would value WeWork around $8 billion. Nearly $40 billion of valuation had vanished.

Mr. Neumann was still chairman and, given his voting shares, still had effective control of the company. To entice him to step aside, SoftBank offered a $185 million consulting fee and boosted the price it was offering to buy out existing shareholders to $19.19, from $17.

Mr. Neumann remains a board observer. As part of his consulting fee, he promised not to start a competitor for four years.

One final inducement involved a large bill for personal travel on the jet. After a tally of surf vacations and other jaunts, plus some additional personal expenses, Mr. Neumann owed WeWork $1.75 million at the time of his ouster, according to shareholder documents.

As part of the deal, which was approved by the board, WeWork forgave the debt.

personalfinance,Realized the interest on my auto loan is more than I am comfortable with. Should I reduce the principal/refinance? How?,"So, a couple months ago I bought a new car. I put down 10k and financed another 20k. I ended up getting a 4.44% loan from Metro Credit Union. For some reason I thought it was a good idea to push it out 6 years. So, now That I do the math, I will have to pay about 3k in interest, which feels too much. I can easily half the principle right now or increase the payments by a factor of 3 (or both). Should I do it? And if so, how? Can I get a better interest rate on a different creditor given the new situation?",finance
personalfinance,Comparing the yield of VMMXX to VBTLX,"I have about $5k that I am saving for a vacation to use late next year. It has been sitting in VMMXX (Vanguard's prime money market fund) and though the interest rate was about 2.5% when I first put it in, the 7 day SEC yield is 1.71% now.

I am considering moving it to their total bond fund, VBTLX. It has a 30 day SEC yield of 2.25%, though if you go to the distributions page, the distribution yield of their most recent dividend payment is 2.63%. What is the difference between the SEC yield and the distribution yield and how much more can I expect than the 7 day SEC yield on VMMXX?

I assume the difference in actual dollars will be maybe $100 over the course of a year if I move it to VBTLX so I think the best thing to do is just leave it in VMMXX but I was wondering how I could calculate what the difference is.

Other options could be VBIRX (short term gov/corp bonds: 1.76%), VSCSX (short term corp bonds: 2.2%) or VSGBX (short term gov bonds: 1.86%)",finance

economy,This quote from a Margrit Kennedy's book is really powerful. The rise of nazism was so precisely predicted in 1918 and we live now in a similar economic environment.,"Already in 1918, shortly after World War I, when everybody talked about peace and many international organizations were created to secure that peace, Gesell published the following warning in a letter to the editor of the newspaper ""Zeitung am Mittag"" in Berlin:

&gt;In spite of the holy promise of all people to banish war, once and for all, in spite of the cry of millions 'Never a war again,' in spite of all the hopes for a better future, I have this to say: If the present monetary system, based on interest and compound interest, remains in operation, I dare to predict today, that it will take less than 25 years for us to have a new and even worse war. I can foresee the coming development clearly.  
The present degree of technological advancement will quickly result in a record performance of industry. The buildup of capital will be rapid in spite of the enormous losses during the war, and through its over-supply will lower the interest rate. Money will then be hoarded.  
Economic activities will diminish and increasing numbers of unemployed persons will roam the streets ... within the discontented masses, wild, revolutionary ideas will arise and also the poisonous plant called ""Super-Nationalism"" will proliferate. No country will understand the other, and the end can only be war again.

Bitcoin,The Fed Will Print 3 Times Bitcoin’s Marketcap in Dollars This January!,,cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Considering refinancing my student loans, but I want to make sure I understand everything","Currently, I have about $51K in private loans (through Citizens Bank, now handled through Firstmark), with fixed interest rates of 10.9%-11.5%. I also have about $30K in federal loans, 3.76%-5.05%. My private monthly payment is $812, and federal is $325.  
   
I've made 5 payments so far, paying $2,000 a month against the private loans and the minimum against federal ($2,325 each of the past 5 months). My salary is $45K, which comes out to about $2,900 a month after taxes. I currently live at home and don't really have any expenses; just when I want to eat out, go out for drinks, entertainment, etc.. I also have about $22,000 saved up, so it's like like I'm living on $575 a month if something comes up.  
   
I started looking into refinancing my private loans, and the lowest rate I've found so far was 4.61% through ELFI (7 year fixed, $709/month). The next two lowest they offered 4.64% (10 year fixed, $530/month) and 4.69% (5 year, $952/month).   
  
This seems like a no brainer to me, but that makes me a little hesitant that maybe I'm missing something. If I plan to still pay more the monthly payment (right now paying more than twice what I have to), is there any reason not to refinance? Even if something happened where I had to start paying just the minimum, the first option would be $100 less and for 2.5 years shorter than my private loans currently are. My goal is to pay these off as fast as possible, so I think the biggest concern for me should be the interest rate.  
  
Edit: Another, more extreme option I considered but haven't put too much thought into was taking the $22K I have, plus $20K that is saved in CDs for me and paying off $40K in loans now. I don't know much about CDs, but my dad wants me to use that money next year to get a new car (I think using that $20K to pay off loans and having a car payment would make more sense vs. paying off a car outright). That would knock my private loans down to $10K, and I could refinance that for about a 4.59% fixed rate. This would basically wipe out money I have saved up, but then I could start saving up again with money and I'd be in $40K less debt. With my current salary and, minus my expenses and what my new monthly payments would be, it would probably take me about a year to get my savings back to where they are.",finance

personalfinance,Cash Out Refinance to Pay Off All Debt - NOW WHAT?!,"Hi everyone!  I could use some advice to get me out of this financial ""funk"" I got myself into, and was hoping you could help....

I just signed all remaining paperwork this morning for a cash out refinance, and to go to a 30yr term (from 15) and lower my current payment by almost $700/month for the time being.

On the cash out, I took out at close enough $$$ to payoff very close to all of my credit card debt and personal loans off.  Interest rates on said accounts range from 10% all the way up to 38%.  

The curveball is that I have no emergency fund at this time besides what I have in my 401k. Which if necessary, would support me for quite a bit of time. This would be a very last resort. 

What do you recommend that I do and why?!  

My ultimate goal is to be out of debt and start saving to refinance the house again within a year or so in order to go to a conventional mortgage with a 15yr term.  It would be nice to start having $$$ in my pocket again too instead of living check-to-check.

 These are a few options I'm considering:

1.  Just suck up and pay off all of my credit cards and personal loans now since I have the $$$ in hand to. This will most likely increase my credit score favorably and eliminate well over $1,400/month in minimum payments.

2. Pay off half of my debt starting with all of the highest interest loans, leaving myself approximately 3-4 months of emergency funds in the bank, and then start paying cards off one-by-one every biweekly paycheck.

3.  Equally spread out paying down my debt in one lump sum, all at once across all accounts, and bring them just below 30% utilization.  Then pay accounts off one by monthly or biweekly 

4. Pay off all credit cards/loans one-by-one starting with the highest interest accounts bi-weekly or monthly, and focus more on increasing the amount of money in my savings account.

$290 is from my Chase CC, which is paid of in full every month (I use this card to pay my rent etc to accrue points)

$5533.34 is a personal loan that I had to take out for a medical expanse - currently paying $339.99 per month.

$1700 is my AMEX card which always gets paid in full every month.

$1170 is for a car expanse that I had, currently on a 0% interest card until July of 2020. Paying about $200-250 per month on this, or whatever I can.

personalfinance,Would it be irresponsible of me to take out a car loan right now?,"**Background:** Almost 26, live in a MCOL city in Florida, not married, no plans to have kids, fairly stable career within the nonprofit sector, and very new to actually caring about my financial situation - I've spent a lot of time on this sub in last few months and have learned a lot, so thank you!

In July I examined my financial situation for the first time (yikes, I know) and realized I had been an absolute moron with money for all of my adult life. I was blowing hundreds of dollars each month on food, bars, clothes, and other unnecessary things, paying the minimums on all of my credit cards even though the interest rates were insane (24% and up), and ""wondering"" why my bank account was being over drafted every single pay period without fail.

Since then I've killed $3,000 in CC debt across my two lower interest CCs (I now only used them for core expenses to earn points/cash back and never carry a balance) and did a balance transfer for the higher interest CC - currently at a total CC balance of $4,550 with 0% interest until March 2021 thanks to a balance transfer and paying $325/month to pay it off by then. I'm currently working toward an e-fund goal of 3 months worth of expenses which is $5,162 and I'm halfway there - when I got serious about my finances in July I had a whopping $0 in savings. Hooray, (slow) progress!

Anyways, here's my money situation:

$1,317 take home pay every other week, or **$2,634/month**

Monthly core expenses are $485 for rent, $50 for gas, $160 for groceries, $30 for subscriptions (Netflix and Spotify), $60 for phone bill, $105 for utilities and wifi, $86 for car insurance, $720 for debt payments (listed below), $25 for medication and $100 for ""miscellaneous"" spending (random things ranging from restocking my haircare/skincare products to haircuts to gifts for people to going out to happy hour with friends fall into this category)

Total core expenses: **$1,735\~**

**This leaves me with just over $900 each month that I'm pouring into my savings based on my current budget structure (I take my budget spreadsheet very seriously these days)**

Debts breakdown for reference:

* Discover CC: current balance of $4,550 with a 0% APR until March 2021, paying $325/month to have it paid off in that timeframe
* Upstart person loan: current balance of $6,784, 12.07% interest rate (took this loan out two years ago when an unexpected breakup put me in a bad spot financially, very determined to pay this off early but paying the minimum of $140/month for now)
* Student loans in my name: current balance of $16,767, interest rates ranging from 3.6 - 4.4%, current monthly payment of $134 with this increasing in a year as I'm on graduated repayment plan
* Parent Plus loan in my mom's name: current balance is $7,849 on 6.6% interest, it's in my mom's name but the agreement was that I'd pay it off after I graduated so here we are, monthly payment is $120

As stated above, my first savings goal is to have a three month e-fund of $5,162 and I expect to hit that by February/March - current savings is $2,565. Next up is a savings goal of $1,800 to cover first, last, and security plus minor moving costs as I'll be doing so in June. Once I get that out of the way, I plan to save enough to pay off my Upstart loan (current balance of $6,784) because I'm sick and tired of the 12% interest rate and embarrassed that i even took the loan out in the first place.

*AFTER ALL OF THIS*, I wanted to start saving to pay cash for new-to-me car. I currently drive a thirteen year-old Ford sedan. It's the same car I've driven since I was 16, hasn't had A/C for four years now (which is a big issue in Florida but too pricey of a repair given the car's value), and has a wide range of mechanical and safety issues that are not worth the value of the car. More of these have been popping up lately, and I'm at the point where I'm seriously considering a $5,000 auto loan for a term of 72 months. I've been quoted an interest rate of 4.5% from a local CU (credit score is 689 - also a work in progress) but I haven't officially applied for any financing just yet. My plan would be to make the minimum payment of $80 or so per month for about a year so I can continue on with my goals of building an e-fund, saving up for moving costs, and paying off my Upstart personal loan - while also not having to wait another year and a half to upgrade to a car that I feel safe/comfortable in and don't hate driving. Once I hit those three savings goals I'd transition to aggressively paying off the car loan well within the 72 month period (I'd ensure the loan I take out doesn't have a penalty for early payoff).

hardware,Sabrent Rocket NVMe quietly nerfed controller?,"I was looking at buying a Sabrent Rocket NVMe drive. The PCI-E 3.0, not the newer 4.0 version. I saw that in a recent review of a 1TB model that someone discovered that they quietly switched from the Phison E12 to a ~~Phison E8~~ a new revision E12S sometime recently, which ~~is an inferior controller~~ may have less DRAM. The E12 has been shown to be a great controller and the Sabrent Rocket was a great deal with the E12 at its price. Now I'm not so sure.

Has anyone else bought a Rocket in the last month or so and can confirm this? Maybe it's only on the 1TB model and not the 2 or 4TB models?

MachineLearning,[P] Use Gaussian Proecess to model maneuvering error,"# Motivation

I try to build some novel application for GP and find a interesting application on maneuvering error modeling. In Napoleonic Wars age, soldiers are lined to fire on their foe. They're trained to maintain a straight batthleline but that line will not be that perfect straight at all. We can build a generative model to simulate it using GP to help realistic animation in war game.

# Why GP?

A i.i.d benchmark can be considered, it will look like this:

[i.i.d movement](https://preview.redd.it/xe3u6rl4ds441.png?width=709&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec131bdc68331b9fe119075ba68e5dd1523433c6)

We can assign time and space correlation to them naturally using GP.  A squared exponential can be specifed to denote the fact that more closer two points (X,Y,T) in time and space, the more positive correlation their ""error"" term hold.

We may expect at same time unit which are close to each other will have consistent deviating tendency, leading a smoother placement instead of a zigzag shape. In other hand, closing to each other at different timestamp having same tendency may imply a “unseen” terrain obstacle, which slow units passing it temporarily.

I'm starting a new job in August next year in the state of Washington. Each year, I'm allowed to contribute up to

* 19k in pre-tax 401k. My employer will match 50% of my contributions.
* 27k in after-tax 401k. My employer allows me to convert them into a Roth IRA account to avoid tax on future capital gains.
* 25k in ESPP, which can be bought at 10% discount quarterly and sold immediately.
* I'm allowed to contribute 65% of my salary paycheck towards my 401k and 15% towards buying ESPP.

My income starting from next August will be:

* 110k in salary
* 150k in restricted stock units where 25% will be vested at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 years starting from my first day of employment
* 11k in yearly cash bonus after 1 year of employment
* 45k in signing bonus at the beginning of employment and then 20k one year later.

* 3.5k in monthly living expenses
* 3-5k in relocation expense to move to my new job
* 2k for travelling back home during holidays.

I currently have 20k in savings and 15k in student debts at 2.5% annual interest rate.

Since I am starting my job late in August 2020, I will need to aggressively convert 65% of my salary to 401k and 15% of my salary to ESPP from August to December in order to maximize my 401k and ESPP for 2020. I will essentially be living off my signing bonuses and RSU.

Bitcoin,We Can't Negotiate With Regulators,"It's becoming increasingly clear that US regulators are hostile to the space. One of the bigger issues is of course rehypothecation and watering down the supply, as I was listening to caitlin long and saifdean explain on a podcast just yesterday. However, what I also want to articulate and explain in this post is that the reason , the only reason the CME and Baakt are such a threat to bitcoin is because artificial supply \*for institutions\* not regular people reduces the demand for physical bitcoin by the rich who would be the bulk demand.

&amp;#x200B;

So really what is happening is that bitcoin isn't actually integrated into the real financial economy. And the US regulator know this and are hostile to it. They want geofencing RSK contracts and backdoor acts for Bank Secrecy Act, they want their own nodes on the network, and they want paper bitcoin. They want the bitcoin economy largely custodial and intermediated and backdoored and rehypothecated, so that no real aspect of global corporate and capitalist financial needs are driven \*outside US and wallstreet control\* \*on physical bitcoin\* \*on a non swift network\*.

&amp;#x200B;

They are going to keep attacking the network like this until we take crypto outside of that system entirely by creating the interchain. The backbone of the interchain is an unseizable liquidity network that cannot be shut down. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just saw a tweet  by a guy who worked for Duestch Bank who was a senior accountant who resigned due to fraud and corruption he reported at DB, and then the guy he reported it to, became a head enforcer at the SEC, and ruined his life, and he had to expatriate outside the US. We are dealing with financial terrorists. Jay Clayton is a financial terrorist, these instituions are captured. They will break this market and treat it like an interest rate scam that enables their private equity groups and commissions while suppressing the price down to extreme lows if they are allowed to dictate the integration into the global economy.

&amp;#x200B;

You guys have to wake up and realize that we have no choice, we MUST build an interchain DeFI global system outside the US financial system. A interchain is comprised of SPV's, full nodes, virtual machine decentralized servers, atomic swaps, lightning swaps, second layer privacy, anonymous nodes, anonymous VM nodes, fully interoperability for most major chains and er-20, agnostic. Not a project or a company, or a token, but the full backbone, an interchain internet 4.0 for finance. 

And then of course you're going to have to fight them in the high courts. European and American youth are going to have to slowly take over the courts and legislation systems and impose democracy onto an out of control financial and military machine run by the old and the rich who have acted unconstitutionally for too long. We aren't headed towards democracy, the centralized amazon run internet and bank secrecy act and war on terror are being used to develop the most ponopitcon style form of fiat debt perpetual war slavery style system and austerity and invasion of financial freedom that anyone has experienced so far in the west.

investing,ACB vs CGC,"## The case for Aurora

  

1. With an estimated peak production capacity of nearly 700,000  kilograms per year, Aurora is easily one of the largest pot farmers in  the world. Aurora's massive scale, in turn, has already produced  top-shelf gross margin (58% in the last quarter), lower cost of  production for dried flowers, and outsize shares of both the medical and  recreational cannabis markets in Canada. 
2. Aurora's jaw-dropping 17 acquisitions to date have created important  operating synergies across its diverse business. In theory, the full  integration of these units should drive down production costs even  further, giving Aurora a major competitive advantage over the broader  field. 
3. Aurora has established a footprint in 25 countries to date. Chief  among them, the company's acquisition of Pedanios, rebranded as Aurora  Deutschland, gives it an entry point into Germany, a country with a  population of over 83 million and cannabis-friendly health insurance  policies.
4. Aurora has built a thriving medical cannabis business, with its  patient roster exceeding 84,000 patients in the most recent quarter.  That's an encouraging development, given that medical cannabis should  prove to be far less vulnerable to margin compression than recreational  or wellness products are. 
5. Unlike Canopy Growth and **Cronos Group**, Aurora  hasn't onboarded a major equity partner yet. While this strategic  decision has forced the company to dilute early shareholders in a big  way, Aurora has maintained control over its destiny. The same can't be  said for either Canopy or Cronos.    

What this all boils down is to is that Aurora's hyper-diverse  business model should allow it to capture a big chunk of the global  cannabis market -- a market that might be worth as much as $200 billion  by the end of the next decade. That's an enormous commercial opportunity  for a company with a market cap of $4.17 billion at present.  

The bad news is that Aurora, along with almost all of its domestic  peers, is facing some significant short-term headwinds right now. The  slower-than-expected rollout of retail licenses for brick-and-mortar  stores, along with the yearlong delay in the legalization of derivative  cannabis products such as edibles, has kept the black market in Canada  firmly in business.

The direct consequence is that Aurora may remain unprofitable for  perhaps another full fiscal year, according to investment banking firm [Stifel Nicolaus](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/09/20/time-to-hit-the-panic-button-with-aurora-cannabis.aspx).  Aurora, as a result, might have to raise a substantial amount of  capital within the next two quarters. And that means more shareholder  dilution.

&amp;#x200B;

## The case for Canopy 

Canopy has three main selling points to potential investors:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Canopy's high-dollar partnership with beverage giant **Constellation Brands** ([NYSE:STZ](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/constellation-brands/stz/))  has made it one of the financially healthiest pot companies in the  world. At last count, Canopy sported CA$4.5 billion in cash and cash  equivalents, although a big portion of this war chest is earmarked for  the potential acquisition of U.S. dispensary behemoth **Acreage Holdings** ([OTC:ACRGF](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/acreage-holdings-inc/acrgf/)).
2. Canopy's pairing with Constellation is expected to produce some of  the industry's most compelling cannabis-infused products. Constellation,  after all, has a well-earned reputation for developing top alcoholic  beverage brands. The same should thus hold true for cannabis-based  drinks. 
3. Canopy's acquisition of Acreage Holdings gives it a clear  competitive advantage over top competitors such as Aurora when it comes  to entering the U.S. market, once it becomes federally permissible to do  so.

The two key takeaways are that Canopy is well positioned to become a  formidable force within the derivative cannabis product market, and it  has a good chance at beating Aurora to the punch in the U.S. as well.   

This top marijuana stock, though, does come with a number of drawbacks. Canopy's[ gross margin](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/19/the-5-scariest-numbers-in-canopy-growths-q1-report.aspx)  has consistently been among the worst within the industry, it's nowhere  near turning a profit on a consistent basis, and there's no way to  predict where the new CEO will lead the company in the years to come.

Moreover, Canopy's upside potential might be hurt by its close  association with Constellation. In short, Constellation may choose to  gobble up the remainder of Canopy well before the global cannabis market  really starts to kick into high gear.",finance

Bitcoin,Some very important points that most people do not understand about Bitcoin,"**Point 1)**

Most people do not understand that you can't send money over internet, but only information. **Bitcoin is the first digital settlement layer.**

When I send a picture to someone on Facebook messenger, I don't actually send a picture. I send information about the pictures structure, and the picture gets restructured on the client side (the cellphone) of the user I send it to. Copy of the information is being sent, not the picture itself. So you can't send money over internet, it is not possible, only information.

If I have a bank account at some bank, and I send $50 dollars to another person in the same bank by using the banks website, then a transaction happens between two people within the same infrastructure, which is the banks back-end system and database. So the banks system just subtracts $50 dollars from one person and adds $50 dollars to another person. But no money has moved, only information has been edited. But if I send money to someone that uses another Bank, then this bank has its own infrastructure which is independent of the first. So Bank1 tells Bank2 that they have a user that wants to send money to a user of the other bank. So Bank1 subtracts $50 from User1, and Bank2 adds $50 to User2, but now Bank1 owes Bank2 $50, why? Because you can't send money over internet. So they have to settle the difference between them with some kind of a settlement system, (cash, gold or a third party like a central bank). This difference can be the result of many transactions between many users and can be millions of dollars of worth, the settlement can be done periodically for example every 6 months.

With Bitcoin, because of how the system works, it is almost as if you can send value over internet for the first time, even though you don't really send value, you still send information, but since the infrastructure is global, it is like the first example, it is as if the world has (one large bank infrastructure), that is fully automated and which no one controls.

This alone makes Bitcoin extremely valuable, because it is a trust less digital settlement layer which is extremely secure and not dependent on one particular nation or organisation.

**Point 2)**

There can never be more than 21 million Bitcoin. This is very hard for people to grasp. Because what do you mean there can never be more than 21 million bitcoin? It sounds like a game, such a scam... People do not understand that Bitcoin is not normal software. In normal software the developers can change the code as they want and publish the code when they want. They do not understand that Bitcoin is a software that is not like a normal software. You can't actually change the number even if the number is programmed in. Which of-course most people will deny, because it makes no sense for most people. They do not understand that even though it is theoretically possible to change it, it is practically almost impossible. It is theoretically possible for me to convince half of Sweden to burn half of their money, but practically impossible. Just because something is theoretically possible, doesn't mean that it will happen within a time frame, or even in your lifetime. In order for the 21 million supply to change, most people in the Bitcoin community needs to agree on it, which is practically impossible. Miners have to change to the new protocol and so on. Not going to happen.

When gold treasures were lost in the past, someone else could find them. Gold practically never completely disappears, it is a chemical element. With Bitcoin, once it is lost it is practically lost forever (put aside quantum computing for now and other theoretical unforeseeable events). 21 million is only the upper theoretical limit. Bitcoin will be more and more scarce as time goes by. Gold is not like this. Gold has an inflation rate of 1,5% every year. The reason it is constant is because even if the stock gets bigger, the flow into the stock also gets bigger because of better mining capabilities, so you can look at it as constant inflation of 1.5% every year. With Bitcoin, not only do the stock to flow ratio go up every halvening, and the flow into bitcoin not only decreases with time, but almost goes into negative because of lost coins every year. This is completely insane and people do not understand this. If you combine this almost deflationary nature of Bitcoin with extreme bullish market sentiment then you will realize that no one knows what is going to happen in the future because wrapping your head around all this and to come to a conclusion about the Bitcoin price will make you sound absolutely delusional to most people.

**Point 3)**

People think that $100,000 bitcoin is wishful thinking and that there is not enough money in the world for Bitcoin to be worth millions of dollars. Which I can assure you is false. Bitcoin can even be worth $50 million dollars per coin, which would make 2 satoshi 1 dollar. Even if one Bitcoin transaction would cost 10 000 Satoshi. You might say, that's not possible, whats the point if one transaction is so expensive. Again, you don't need to actually do a transfer of money, as in the first example of point 1, virtual transactions on bank level can happen, or on Coinbase. You can send 100 satoshi to someone and pay 1 satoshi in fee ""on the bank level"", not on chain, banks or exchanges then will settle the difference as they want. At least with Bitcoin you have the option to be you own bank, even if that will cost you more, you still have the option. This is already happening in front of your eyes. Banks like Dutch ING, Deutsche bank, are already working on custody services for cryptocurrencies. And even exchanges want to operate as banks and exchanges like Coinbase are working to get license for this. This is already happening and it is the correct move forwards, a mix between the legacy banking system and cryptocurrencies. You can already spend your Bitcoin with Coinbase Visa Card or similar services. Most people are too lazy and stupid to operate like us with their own wallets, it is a fact well known.

In terms of the price, money inflow is not the same as market cap. Take for instance the following simple scenario. I own 100% of the shares of my own company and I decide to sell 10% of the company for 1 million USD, which will value my whole company at 10 million USD, so 1 million flow into my company leads to 10x market cap of 10 million USD. For Bitcoin to have 21 trillion market cap, Bitcoin does not need 21 trillion of money inflow. Bitcoin price is dependent on market sentiment, if the market sentiment is such that very few people want to sell their coins because the price keeps going up then you might have 100x market cap of the money inflow. So 1 billion USD in money inflow translates to 100 billion USD in market cap. The multiplier can be 10x, 2x or 50x, all depends on market sentiment and time period. So an inflow of 10 trillion USD in 10 years might lead to 100 trillion USD market cap of BTC and 5 million USD per Bitcoin.

Bitcoin value have no roof, the price might actually just keep going up and up and up and up and up. We have never had something that is absolutely scarce, and global, and seen as an alternative form of money, when the rest of the world keeps bubbling up. There is no limit on the BTC price because the whole world works with a bubbly system, and the way Bitcoin is price discovered, is a guaranteed insane BTC price in the future. Even $100 million USD per Bitcoin in 50 years before I am dead is possible.

**Point 4)**

Fiat does not need to die, and Bitcoin does not need to take over in order for Bitcoin to have ""ridiculous price"". No financial crisis is needed. Actually what you want is things to just continue as they have done in the last 10 years. No too extreme events. Just ""small events"" here and there. You can't change human nature, it is inevitable. Bitcoin is so ingrained into our world that there is no way back. There will be people with whole Bitcoin, and people without. Just like people with gold and stock investments and real estate, and people without those things. No insane events, this is all normal.

**Point 5)**

Bitcoin has won as the financial cryptocurrency. No flippening will happen. The only flippening will be with gold and fiat currencies. If I wanted to, I could have developed a system like PayPal in 1 month time, and it would be able to do 5000 transactions per second because I would use MySQL and SSD, but no one would use my service because they would not trust me because they have no idea who I am and what my service is, and there is no one to send money too, so the network is not there. Bitcoin has won because security and network effect is way more important than transactions per second. Transactions per second will be dealt with on bank level, exchange level, or layer 2 solutions. This is already clear to me. Bitcoin has won.

**Point 6)**

In order to understand Bitcoin and what will happen in the future, you have to be able to see things that are not in front of you. You can't compare Bitcoin to Tulip mania, or even Gold. Because something like Bitcoin has never existed before and you have to think about it's properties and try to understand it with human nature and with how the world works and how everything keeps increasing, and Bitcoin is the thing that does not increase in supply. You will eventually accept the unnatural thought of Bitcoin never stopping going up in value, which is something that is hard to come to terms with, because it feels unnatural, ""and it could not possibly be so"".

**Point 7)**

The Gini coefficient of Bitcoin is not a big deal. I used to think that it was unfair that some people had 1,000 BTC, 10,000 BTC, or even 50,000 BTC. And I was afraid that they might dump their coins into the market and crash it. I have now realised that these people are smart people and they think like me, and they won't just dump their whole BTC holding on the market as that might be a very bad move for them. It is like when a majority holder of a company, like Jeff Bezos and Amazon, understands that he can't sell all of his shares in one go as that would effect Amazon stock value too much and would not be smart. It is best to sell when the price goes up, but then when they sell the BTC will just be eaten up by other people, and they will be at a loss in the longer term. And the other thing is that perhaps there is no other smart place to put that fiat money, Bitcoin might just be the best place to keep those amounts of money. Someone with a very large holding has two options. He can either sell his BTC, in which case the price would go down but the Bitcoin would be spread out between potentially thousands of new users, or he might decide to never sell. If he decides to never sell, it is as if those Bitcoins are lost forever and that is good for the Bitcoin price and Bitcoin in general. If he decides to sell then Bitcoin will be divided more equally among many users which is also a good thing for Bitcoin because that increases the network effect, and after he sells he no longer has the power to drive the price down, but now he sits on a very large fiat holding, he might even buy back at a higher price and drive the price higher. I know that if I had 10,000 BTC, I would sell 1,000 BTC and buy a house and a car and whatever I wanted, and sell another 1,000 BTC to diversify into some other assets. And keep 8,000 BTC because I don't know of anywhere else to put that kind of money into good work. I believe in Bitcoin so as an investor it makes sense to keep it here. I probably would never sell because I would never need anything else after the initial 1,000 BTC sell.

Bitcoin is like a black hole that sucks in the Earths monetary resources over time. Most people that bought really early and were smart enough to hold all the way to these prices will only sell what they need to sell and keep the rest in BTC. Some of them might want to speculate and try to time the ATH, only to buy back in with most of the fiat they sold. Which means that even if money goes out of the market, it only goes out of the market temporarily, only to get back in at hopefully lower prices. And so the market grows, and grows and grows over time.

**Point 8)**

Bitcoin has intrinsic value. When people like Peter Schiff say that gold has intrinsic value because gold can be used in electronics and aviation and therefore gold has value but Bitcoin has no value because it has no intrinsic value, you have to take a pause and do some critical thinking. Can you imagine 16th century pirates looking to find a gold treasure worth an insane amount because they knew gold had value because of electronics and aviation? This is clearly absurd. Gold has been used as money for thousands of years and electronics and aviation was not even a thing 150 years ago. Gold has value because it is globally scarce. Bitcoin is absolutely verifiable scarce. Bitcoin has intrinsic value because of it's monetary policy and because you can carry millions of dollars of value by remembering only 24 words in your head, and carry that value wherever you want and no one can stop you, that is intrinsic value.

People had a hard time understanding that a website like Facebook could be worth billions of dollars, because it was not physical, it was ""just a website"". Even a website like Google search is not physical and still it has immense value. It is valuable information and it provides a good service, and that has value, it does not have to be physical and tangible.",cryptocurrency

/u/nivter: On Mutual Information Maximization for Representation Learning: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13625

The authors ran experiments to show that MI maximization between two representations is not directly tied to learning good representations. They did so by maximizing MI while also adversarially training the model to perform badly on linear classification models. One key takeaway for me was that **encoders that learn good representations tend to ignore unwanted information as a result of which they are hard to invert** (high condition number of Jacobian of output wrt inputs)

personalfinance,Should I pay my car off completely?,"Hello r/personalfinance! I wanted to run this by this subreddit to get opinions from others compared to what people on my life are telling me. 

I currently owe $5500 towards my car (2014 Ford Focus ST with ~70,000 miles). My interest rate on my loan is 4.07%. I have about $10,000 in my savings account as I have been saving up for a down payment on a house. 

I make about $67,500 a year and have been trying to save aggressively, but just recently upped my salary to this amount. I was making significantly less beforehand. 

Question is: should I take out half of my total savings in order to pay my car off outright, or should I just continue making payments? I do typically put an extra $100 on my $385 car payment every month.

personalfinance,refinancing federal loans yay or nay?,"I've read countless threads where it seems that anyone with federal loans should keep them as is and not refinance, and I do understand the benefits of the protections they provide versus private loans but after my first year of aggressively paying my loans it feels like a losing battle fighting those damn 6-7% interest rates. I was not financially smart  (Veterinary school) and now have a huge loan balance of  $257K last I checked. I did luck out with a great paying job in a low cost of living area and I can see myself staying at this job for at least 3-5 years but my income wont have much growth potential.  I've been snowballing for some quick wins and have put $57k towards payments this year which averaged to $4700/month. I could probably have done more but I needed to make a few big purchases such as a car, moving expenses and spoiling my dog.

I've checked a few refinancing companies to see what my rates would be and earnst offered the lowest rates at 4.6% I probably could get lower if I shop around more

Playing around with [unbury.me](https://unbury.me) it seems like refinancing is an obvious choice financially:

$257k @ 6.2% avg interest with a minimum payment of $1800 per month = 20 years of payments with $180k in accumulated interest

$257k @ 6.2% with avg payment of $4700 (if I can keep it up) = 5 years to payoff with $44k interest accumulated

but if I refinance $257k @ 4.6% and make the same payments I wold have them paid in 5 years and only $32k in interest",finance

personalfinance,Income and new credit cards (credit transfers)?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I'm thinking about doing a credit transfer from my Amazon Chase card which has about 1k on it. The issue is that I'm in what I think will probably be a pretty temporary tough situation as my partner is looking for long-term work (finishing last semester in a CS program and sub teaching in the meantime which keeps us afloat but isn't totally reliable). Now, we're expecting a possible car repair that could be up to $1500.

I have about $2500 in checking and savings but want to have some cash just in case (I live in one of the highest COL areas in the US and that doesn't even cover a month and a half in rent. In the off chance something happened to my job, we'd have a problem pretty soon though I can also sub teach). For this reason I also don't want to pay my car repair in cash.

My credit is really good - score around 770-790 depending on who you ask. I have two cards, the Amazon card with a limit of $8000 and a 20.74% APR and a Wells Fargo card with something like a limit of 3-4k, but I basically never use it so I'm not positive and it has a $0 balance. I have 12k in subsidized government student loans with a totally manageable monthly payment and highest interest rate of 3.6%. This is the first time I've ever carried a balance over from one month to another. I'm 25 and have had credit through student loans since 17, first CC at 18, so an 8 year credit history.

My concern though is that I did have trouble with an auto loan because of my income (ended up paying in cash a few months ago). It's about $3k before taxes. Will I be able to get a good 0% transfer card with this info? I know it's a bandaid but that's okay. If my partner even just keeps subbing - he has a pretty stable private school he works at - we'll generally have a $6.5kish income together when school is in session (eg, we're out a week or two this month). That will be fine. We ended up way worse off in the last year as his school schedule was heavier. A short reprieve on the CC debt should be fine. I just want to make sure we aren't paying too much in interest and also have options for worst case scenarios. If there was one with a short term 0% purchase as well, he could kill off his \~1k in CC debt (no student loans) and we could beat down mine after that without worrying as much about the interest. Also, I just realized this could be relevant, we aren't married but long term relationship with shared lease/car/dog with no plans to get married, uh, just 'cause I guess lol.

**tl;dr - $1k in CC debt with an expected extra $1.5k coming in. 760-790 credit score with perfect payment history, 8 years credit, $12k in student loans and two cards (1k on one, nothing on the other). \~$12000 credit limit total right now. $3k income before taxes. Any idea what kind of cards I'd be able to get? Extra cool would be a card with short term 0% purchase interest. Thanks for any help!!**

Small bonus Q: would it be worth my partner doing a transfer of any kind? Like I said, variable $3.5k income, slightly higher credit score than me, but fewer accounts and lower credit score.  Idk if a variable income is possible at all. He also is somewhat interested in extra JIC available credit (similar to my situation where I've had $12k available and never carried a balance until three or four months ago).",finance

The advancement in lending industry has made it easier for lenders to integrate technology into loan process to make funding easier for small business owners. Unluckily, this advancement also give a blank check to business loan scams online.

According to the **Better Business Bureau** **(BBB)** and the **Federal Trade Commission** **(FTC)** survey of 1,200 small businesses nationwide, **67% of small businesses** said scammers are a growing risk now in comparison to three years ago. Preventing such scams is often difficult because scammers disguise as reputable lenders, big corporations, and trusted brands.

There are many genuine and reliable online lenders trying to help small businesses grow. However, there are hackers and con artists as well that are capitalizing on small business owners’ need for quick funding via scams. These scammers attempt to embezzle valuable assets like personal data, business information and money by masquerading to be reputable **small business loan** lenders or brokers.

Despite of all these scammers and Ponzi schemes, there are various ways to avoid and report such financial scams so you can recuperate. Here’s a detailed guide on how to become a shrewder and sensible borrower and avoid such scams.

**Business Loan Scams to Avoid**

Even though small businesses have access to a multitude of reliable and constructive financing opportunities, you do need to look out for some of the deceitful, self-proclaimed lending institutions or loan brokers.

They usually get in touch with you online, via advertising, phone, text messages, and direct mail channels. The key is to remain discreet *when s*omeone asks you for personal and business information or trick you to make money via clicking a link. Before agreeing to any contracts or send anyone your personal information, ascertain you’re conscious of and vigilant against common business loans scams. Here are some common business loan scams to keep an eye on while applying for business loans:

* **Advance Fee Scams**
* **P2P Lending Scams**
* **Grant-Related Scams**
* **Credit Repair Scams**
* **Ghost Funding Scams**
* **Duplicitous Loan Brokers**
* **Debt Relief Scams**
* **Debt Collection Scams**",finance

personalfinance,Shall I pay more money upfront to reduce my mortgage interest rate ?,"Hi All
We are in the process of closing on our first home 
We have an interest rate locked at 3.75 for 30 years and we have an option to pay around $ 3,789 extra and lock an interest rate of 3.625

That will reduce our monthly mortgage by $41.00

Which means we will break even by 3789/41 = 92 months ~ 7.6 years 

We are planning on paying off our home in next 15-16 years hence we will end up saving 41 * 12 * 8 years = around 4000 dollars over a 16 year mortgage 

Is it really worth it ? I am very conflicted , on one side it makes sense from a numbers perspective but on the other side I am not sure how common is this ?

Can any one please share their examples or if they did/ did not choose to do something like this ?

personalfinance,Invest in 401k or pay credit card debt?,"I just started a new job, and they match 50% of your 401k investment up to 6% (so I'd basically be able to put 9% in).  I'll be 40 in March and basically have no retirement yet.   I just graduated with an EE degree in April.  Trying to raise a family while going to University, I racked up about 15k in credit card debt.  It's all on one card that I have through my credit union.  In addition, I have about 25k in student loan debt, although I'm much less worried about that since the interest rate is just over 4%.  So my question is, do I go ahead and start putting the 6% into my 401k, or do I forego it for another year and throw every cent that I can at my credit card debt?  In my head, it would seem like paying off the credit card ASAP would give me the most bang for my buck, even though I'd be giving up that free 3% that my company would be putting in.

personalfinance,Sub-optimal ESPP vs higher payments on student loans?,"My company has reduced it's ESPP benefits from 15% discount to 10% discount while also removing the lookback feature. I know the general advice on Reddit is to always take advantage of an ESPP as it's essentially free money, but I'm wondering just how worth it this plan is when I have student loans as well. 

I have about $37k private loans at 4.76% and about $25k fed. loans at 4.04%. Currently I'm paying the minimum $160/month on the Federal loans while paying $1100/ month into my private loans. 

I can contribute 10% income into the ESPP. If I take the 10% discount and sell immediately, it would essentially only be getting $300 profit after taxes assuming no fees for selling, which is still about 7.5% gains compared to the overall contribution. 

At this point I almost feel like I may as well simply not participate and just make migher payments on my loans since they're gaining interest during the six month ESPP periods while also not tying up 10% of my income. What are your thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,I just bought a used car for the first time. Here is what I learned.,"As the title says, I just bought a used car for the first time this past weekend. While I am very happy about the car and I think I found a good deal, honestly I found the entire car buying experience terrible so I figured I would try to share what I learned from this experience. Keep in mind that this is really a write-up about buying a used car from a dealership and not a private seller. 


**Start a spreadsheet.** 

Seriously. Just do it. You will be looking up a bunch of cars from many different dealerships, and when your email/voicemail is full of them trying to schedule appointments, you will be relieved when you can reference your handy spreadsheet. Mine included year, model, color, dealership, link, listing price, quoted price, and whether the car fax showed any accidents or damage. 


**The true price.**

Most used car dealerships advertise on cars, autotrader, carsforsale, etc. 90% of the time the price you see is misleading.  This is because the price they advertise is the “internet price”, which does not include the following: 

* Taxes (Look up sales tax rates for your state)

* “Dealer prep” fees

* Document fees

* Title and tag fees 

* Financing fees 

* Rebate fees (more on this below)


After adding all of those fees, a $10k car could easily become a $13k-14k car. On the topic of rebates, that “internet price” I mentioned before is the price that the car WOULD BE if you qualified for every available rebate. These rebates would often include active military, recent college graduate, or if you bought a car at that dealership in the past XX years. One Jeep that I looked at was listed at $11.5k, but since I didn’t qualify for those rebates it jumped up to $14k - and that didn’t even include the other fees! Always try to look at the fine print listed in these internet ads.


Before making a physical appointment, I always asked for a quote for the full “out-the-door” price. This includes taxes, fees, “rebates” I qualified for, etc. This was useful for a couple of reasons. The transparency let me know if it was actually in my budget before I invested myself any further. Also, this gave me an idea of the dealer would be easy to work with or not. A dealer that is not willing to give a quote is honestly not worth the hassle. This leads us to our next point.


**Find A Good Dealership**

Despite the stereotypes, not all dealerships and used car salesmen are scum of the earth. Look at their ratings on Yelp, Google, etc. I strongly encourage you to only shop at a dealer with decent ratings. Like I mentioned in the pricing section, I only invested my time with dealerships that would give me a ballpark quote for the price that was out of the door. Most dealers will offer some type of service incentive to buy their vehicles, and it’s important to remember that you may be working with this particular dealership in the future. See how they talk to you during negotiations – are they polite, arrogant, pushy, or pleasant? This is your purchase, do not let them sour it for you. 


**Be realistic about your expectations.**

You probably won’t be able to get a new car for 1/10th the price. Used cars are just that - used. They may have been in accidents, they may be scratched, dirty, have a smell. Not all of them - some will be detailed, some will have more maintenance than others. When possible, ask the dealer how much maintenance and repairs they have invested in that vehicle. ANY decent dealer would be able to pull up that number for you. Regardless, know your budget and what you should expect with that budget. If your budget is $5k, you most likely won’t get a car that is less than 8 years old and has less than 90k miles. 


**An accident is not necessarily a deal breaker.**
 
If the carfax shows an accident, don’t close the door just yet. Try to find out more. Did the car slide into another parked car? Was the accident reported in 2012, and then continued to drive for 8 years? Was the damage superficial, structural, to the engine? Once you find out the true nature of the accident, you might be surprised by what you are comfortable with. 


**Negotiating**

So you finally found a car you like. It’s in your budget. It has good miles. It appears to be in good shape. You’re about to go in and see the car in-person. Keep this in mind: the dealers goal is to close the deal the first time you visit. The best approach is to go in prepared: 

* Know what a good deal for that car is

* Know at least one equivalent year/model car from a different dealership. Tell the current dealership that after you’re done at this dealership you are planning on going to another dealership to compare a similar make and model. This will make them want to “out-due” the other dealer. 

* Draw a line: assuming the car is up to your standards, set a price that you would accept if offered. I guarantee they will ask anyway. Take a few minutes before you go into the dealer and ask yourself “What price would I be willing to accept today?”. My recommendation is to name a near crazy good number. Keep in mind that the number that you tell them will become your lower floor number, and no negotiations in the future will ever go below this number again.

* Talk about all of the negatives of the car. Was it ever damaged/involved in an accident? Is it higher than average miles? Scratches, dings? Do all of the electronics work?  

* Even if you do not qualify, **ask for the rebates anyway**. The worst they can say is no, the best they can do is save you thousands of dollars. 


**Financing: The average consumer is stupid. Don’t be average.**

Know your shit. Understand how financing works. Understand interest rates, life value of the loan, and payments. Become familiar with the “PMT”, “PV”, and “FV” functions in excel. If you need to finance *through the dealership*, keep in mind that you will most likely end up paying a financing fee. This fee will range anywhere from $500-$800. I would never recommend taking out an auto-loan for longer than 2 years. **If you can’t pay off the loan in 2 years, you cannot afford the loan.**


*Edit: Getting some flack for the above statement. I guess that while in some situations a low interest rate longer term loan makes more sense, I would just encourage users to be very careful and meticulous when sorting through the longer term financing options.*


If you get to the financing stage, be very careful about it. I had a highly rated dealership, and they still tried to pull some fast ones at this stage. For example, I wanted to put about $6k as a down-payment and wanted to finance the other $5.7k. When they pulled up my options, I saw 4 different monthly payments. These plans differed based on if I elected to get additional ‘coverage’ (tire rims, an extended warranty, etc). What made me angry was that **NONE of the payment options listed we’re reflective of the raw price, without any elective coverage.** The cheapest option I saw was ~$35 higher per month than the financing alone. I had to actually ask the dealer to show me a financing plan that did not elect any other additional coverage. Do not be afraid to whip out your calculator. This is your show and they are only the supporting cast members. 

To summarize, most of these tips are about being organized, prepared, and patient. You will most likely sort through many crappy dealerships that are not worth your time. Make a spreadsheet. If you have a budget, stay within in it. Get out-the-door quotes. Gauge your dealer's attitudes. Know competitors, and research the historical price range for this make/model/mileage car. Be prepared to negotiate, and be prepared to walk away.",finance

investing,"Economists Were 100% Wrong About the 2010s, So Ignore Them for the 2020s","To better understand 2020 predictions, we should consider context and history. First, what has history told us about economic forecasts? We don’t have to look further than decade forecasts from 2009.

## What Economists Said About the 2010s

As 2009 ended, investors and economists were shell shocked. They’d experienced two bear markets in the previous ten years with stock prices losing more than 50% twice. Major stock market averages hadn’t suffered such steep declines since the Great Depression.

The first bear market was the natural response to a bubble everyone saw coming. Something we all now know at the “dot com bubble“. In hindsight, internet stocks were overpriced in 2000.

The cause of that second bear market was less obvious, even in hindsight. What we all now know as the housing crisis. Subprime mortgages and real estate shouldn’t have led to a 50% decline in blue chip stocks.

A recovery seemed to be underway at the end of 2009. At least in the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 was a stunning 67% above its March 2009 lows, in just 9 months.

The economy seemed to be recovering, Unemployment was at 9.9% but was moving down from its peak of 10%. Interest rates were near zero and that would ensure a quick recovery.

Economists were confident that interest rates would start rising in 2010 and be above 4% by 2015 before the next recession forced the Federal Reserve to reduce rates again.\[1\]

## Economists Were Wrong

Over the next ten years, the Fed funds rate, an important short-term interest rate, never topped 2.5%. This was a level that seemed impossibly low prior to 2000. In 2009, economists were certain short-term rates would settle between 3% and 5%, in line with their long-term average.

The chart below shows Fed Funds remained below 1% until 2017.

Many economists worried about inflation because they believed low rates were a breeding ground for inflationary pressures.  This explained how the Federal Reserve operated for more than 90 years. It simply rates to offset inflation.

Inflation was about 2% in late 2009 and ended the decade near 2% after peaking near 3.8% in 2011. The consumer price index was above 3% for just 10 months in the decade.

Economists long feared inflation would rise because they believed declining unemployment would lead to higher wages and inflation. It was a long-standing theory known as the Phillips Curve.

According to the Fed, the theory was that “years of high unemployment rates tended to coincide with steady or falling wages and years of low unemployment rates were also years of rising wages.” \[3\]

Unemployment now coexists with low inflation, an unexpected result under standard economic theory.

## What Lies Ahead?

After failing to forecast the 2010s, economists are questioning their assumptions for the next decade. 2020 predictions are slowly trickling in now. Federal Reserve officials now talk of being “data dependent” and responsive to current conditions. In the past year, officials have cited concerns about trade wars and international developments in their decisions.

This indicates an understanding that theories that worked in the past need to be reevaluated. Policy makers around the world are now experimenting to a degree.

One thing that hasn’t changed is the fact that central bankers have confidence is their abilities to react. They tend to believe they will foresee the next crisis and act in time to prevent it or to at least mitigate the downside.

In 2000 and 2008, and in every crisis since the founding of the Federal Reserve, officials have struggled to react to crises. That seems to be the safest forecast for the 2020s. Expect a crisis. Expect the Fed to miss the crisis and struggle to contain the fallout.

In the 2020s, there will be bear markets and they will be deep. While policy makers cannot react quickly, traders can. When the stock market begins falling, they should react to reduce their losses. This will mean selling rather than holding on for dear life. Selling could be the best thing traders can do in a decline.

personalfinance,Insurance Question,"Hi (: I was just fired from my job and as such I don't have health insurance anymore. This would be fine if I didn't still live at home, with my father who makes $50k/year. When I tried applying for health insurance last year using Stride, the rates were great at first because their guidelines said I don't include parents I live with in my income unless they're dependents. When I tried to continue the process through the Marketplace however, I ran into issues. At the time I was 18, and I currently reside in Alabama. With state law here, you're not an adult until you're 19, and as such, the state's low cost insurance program for minors still covers you until you turn 19. Qualifying for this program, though, obviously depends on your parents' income and not just your own. So I don't qualify. When I do include my dad's income (which I never see any of as I pay for my own groceries, gas, haircuts, eating out, clothing, and everything else. The only thing I don't pay is rent, which I would be paying if I could afford to) the rates go up to starting at $150, which is already too much. My question is, being 19, am I still required to include his income? Like is there a certain age, 21 or 25 for example, at which he becomes no more than a roommate? Is that already the case now that I'm an adult both federally and at state level? Or will that never be the case for as long as I still live here?",finance

At the time, though, the interest rates were identical, so why bother changing? Well this morning I checked the interest rates, and while the Peformance account is still giving a reasonable HYSA rate of 1.7% for all balances, the Money Market account has dropped quickly to only 1.5% or way down to just .6% if you have a balance under $10K. So, if you've been leaving your e-fund in the money market account, now might be the time to move it over to their new product instead.",finance
personalfinance,Debt Consolidation Options,"I'm currently have 3 separate loans that I'm paying off monthly and I'm looking for a way to consolidate them into one loan. I'm interested in this for a couple reasons. One, that I can likely get a lower monthly payment than the 3 loans combined (at the expense of longer payoff period) which frees up some money per month for saving/unexpected expenditures. And secondly i'd be able to close my accounts with the paid off loans and only have 1 party to pay per month vs. three. 

I plan to do this by taking out a personal loan at my local bank using my paid off car as collateral ($20k market value currently). I used this method to take out a loan for my wedding last year and it worked just fine with an interest rate around 3.5%. I still owe a little on that loan as noted below.

Currently the three loans I have open are the following:

1. Truck Loan (I own 2 vehicles). I owe about $5400 on this loan at 3.6% interest ($255/month payment)
2. Student Loans. I owe about $4100 on this with interest varying between 3.5-4% ($170/month payment)
3. Wedding Loan (using my paid off car as collateral): I owe about $6900 on this loan at 3.5% ($400/month payment)

This is a total monthly payment of $825. The total amount of the new loan would be about $16,400 and with a 4 year payoff at 3.5% interest it'd put me in the $375/month range. This saves me $450/month which is a nice cushion for unexpected bills (medical bills have been a lot and not so predictable this year). 

My question is does this make sense? On paper it seems ok but if there are hidden disadvantages I'd like to understand them ahead of time. I understand I'll probably pay a little more in interest over the longer payout period. But if I have a little extra money at the end of the month I can put that towards the principle. How would this affect my credit score? Its currently in the 790 range. If anymore information is needed to understand the situation I'm happy to provide.",finance

Besides the withdrawal penalties and the hit to account balance, is there anything else we need to account for?","I didn't see this in the Wiki or in Search, so please let me know if this has already been covered.

Medical issues and life events caused us to blow through our emergency savings so we're now considering an early withdrawal from one of spouse's 401K accounts (approx. $9k) from the former employer. Younger than 59 ½ so we understand there will be a 10% early withdrawal penalty as well as income tax on the withdrawn amount, so using the [calculator here](https://www.wellsfargo.com/investing/retirement/tools/401k-early-withdrawal-calculator/) at a 12% Fed income tax and 9% California income tax, we're looking at about just under $6k to our pocket, which will solve the immediate concerns and give some buffer for a few months while we further reduce costs and stabilize.

Due to medical disabilities, spouse left company and is currently unemployed. Currently on appeal for Social Security disability benefits due to paperwork issues.

We were trying to do a Hardship Withdrawal to avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty, but due to ""separation from the company"" that is not an option. We understand that this is one of the worst things to do in regards to retirement, but are running out of ideas.

Questions:

1. Is there any way to directly mitigate/reduce the associated withdrawal costs?
2. Will this withdrawal affect my spouse's Social Security eligibility or in any way negatively affect that income?
3. Is there anything else we aren't considering?

worldpolitics,Sen. Warren's Letter to me: China's Treatment of Uyghurs,"Elizabeth Warren &lt;Elizabeth\_Warren@warren.senate.gov&gt;Mon 12/16/2019 12:39 PM

Dear Louisa,

Thank you for contacting me about the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic communities in China.

For years, the Chinese government has engaged in a widespread and systematic campaign of repression against millions of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakh, and other Turkic Muslim minorities in China's Xinjiang region through pervasive surveillance, forced disappearance, the denial of their civil and political rights, and the use of mass internment in so-called re-education camps.

I have worked with Democrats and Republicans to raise awareness of China's human rights violations against the Uyghurs and to call for a strong diplomatic response from the United States government. I cosponsored the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, a bipartisan bill that would strengthen the State Department's and intelligence agencies' reporting on the Chinese government's repression of Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang. In particular, the legislation requires the U.S. government to determine the number of individuals detained in so-called re-education camps, assess the threats to regional stability posed by China's treatment of these minority communities, and evaluate U.S. efforts to counter China's propaganda and disinformation campaigns targeting these groups.

I have also joined Senators from both parties in urging the Trump Administration to ensure that American companies are not selling technology to the Chinese government for surveillance and policing of Uyghurs, to encourage U.S. officials to visit Xinjiang in order to further expose the human rights conditions in this region, and to consider imposing targeted sanctions on individuals and entities that are engaging in or contributing to these human rights abuses.

I continue to support U.S. and international efforts to uphold the human rights and the dignity of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakh, and other Turkic Muslim minorities in China. I appreciate your reaching out to me about this issue, and please do not hesitate contact me in the future about issues of importance to you.

Sincerely,

After scholarships and financial aid I’ll be paying about $2000/year for tuition, but because of some other grants I’ll have plenty of money to pay that off in cash. So, would it be a bad idea to take out loans and just make payments on them to boost my score if I’m able to get a low interest rate?",finance
personalfinance,Could I get out of paying a down payment because my family fully owns the property?,"Let me summarize my theoretical schemes and hopefully someone can let me know that they're all crazy, or that they might just work.

My great grandma passed away, she left her house to my grandpa and his brother. The house is owned by my family out-right, there is no mortgage on it. I want to buy the house. If I sell my current place I might get a 10% down payment, but I would rather avoid a down payment and mortgage insurance if possible. It's probably not, but just hear me out.

1. What is the purpose of a down payment? Isn't it to protect the bank with a 20% buffer so that the collateral asset is valued more than the loan, and it's safer for market fluctuation? If my grandpa gave me 20% off market price, wouldn't that be the same thing? Is there a mortgage lender that would consider this deal?
2. If my grandpa had a ton of cash and could gift me a down payment, then I use that down payment to buy a mortgage for the house he's selling, then he gets the price of the house back... wouldn't that work? It just sounds so off. This is kind of equivalent to #1, but without the bank needing to do anything special.
3. If my grandpa didn't need all of the money up front, but instead could become my mortgage owner. I could own the house (Dependent on me making my payments, same as usual) and he could own my mortgage, and I make my payments to him. This would work right? Can we write up a real legal mortgage contract, but with any terms we want? No down payment?
4. If my grandpa did need a lump sum up front, could he then sell the mortgage note we make in option #2 to a bank, and it's a win-win? (I do qualify for a regular mortgage, I'm sure there would be complexities to this to verify the underwriting and make a legal mortgage note and what ever, but just theoretically, is this possible)
5. I'm sure this one won't work, it's probably illegal, but I'm curious about why it wouldn't. When you get a mortgage you can pay extra up front for mortgage points or whatever it was called so that you have a lower interest rate. Couldn't the reverse also work. Theoretically couldn't a mortgage agreement work out so that I get the house for a discount, but pay enough interest to make up the difference? Could my grandpa and I write up a contract that was very attractive to buyers because I would be locked in to a 30 year mortgage with a crazy high interest rate. He could give me a big discount on the mortgage, but sell the note for a lot? Then I could just refinance and get out of it right?

If you read all of that, thank you. #1, #2, and #3 are the only serious options I think, but I am super curious about #4 and #5 details. I know there are tons of companies that just sign mortgages and sell them to banks. I wonder how that works and what the laws are. I don't think the bank buying the loan would care if there'd be a down payment or not (just the term, interest, amount, appraisal price, credit score and stuff right?)

Edit: Thanks a lot everyone! Luckily the only mortgage person I know said a ""Gift of Equity"" counts towards a down payment (Strangely enough, only if the gift is from a family member and not a random person selling). So I don't need to do any complex private loan from family, and he can get the full mortgage value up front instead of getting a little bit a month and dying before it's paid off.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage question,"I was looking into mortgage interest rate and the way interest is collected, doesn't make sense. For example lets say the mortgage is for $100,000 at 5% for 30 years. Now 5% of $100,000 is $5000 every year. In mortgage calculator it gives me my payment as $537 and $537×360=$193320 but $5000×30 = $150,000+100000 = $250,000. Does it mean that you pay interest on left over loan? If so why shouldn't we just pay down all the principal first then interest?",finance
personalfinance,Least oppressive plan for repaying extensive student loans?,"I'll cut straight to it.  I need guidance as I am trash with managing money.  Any advice on what you would do would be appreciated.  I will have \~$200,000 in student loan debt after I graduate in May.  The actual payments will not become due until January 2021 if I wish.  These dates may be useful, as I will work from September - December amassing some cash without having to pay those loans. Facts: I will earn $105,000 in a state with no state income tax, so I can expect like $5,400-$6,000 monthly post taxes and healthcare.  Rent + utilities is $1000.  Car and insurance will be $500.  Fortunately I am privileged and don't pay my phone bill.  My rent is low because I pay 1/3rd the rent of a 2 bedroom.  The city I am in is expensive though and it is likely that, once my so and I move to a 1 bedroom, Ill pay closer to $1,500.

I will refinance my loans, which have terrible interest rates right now.  I think I can get 4.0-4.9% fixed rate for it all through Earnest/Sofi, etc.

If you had my situation, would you (1) pay super large payments each month to speed it up, at the cost of a weak 401(k) and inability to purchase a home; (2) pay minimum payments to feel richer now but at the expense of dragging the whole thing out; (3) other?  I am excited to cease being a student (attended grad school, which may explain loans), but am worried that I might not be able to save/invest in my 401(k) with the oppressive debt.  I recognize that I am in a good spot, being that I was privileged enough to attend grad school and will make good money.

Thank you to any and all ideas and advice.  I really am trash with finance, so I could be wrong about the above (interest rates, 401(k) stuff, etc.).  I also haven't considered tax implications from spending mad money on student loan interest each year.",finance

After we are married in the near future, a family member has offered to help with  wife's student loans.  He would pay off the loans completely ($30 something thousand) and we would pay him back at a 2 ish percent interest rate, no fees, unsecured.

personalfinance,We suck at managing taxes and I don't know why.,"I may know why. I'm leaning on it being our payment system but I have no way of proving it.

To break it down, we went from a single provider household to a two provider. Cool. That first year though we barely got anything back. No big deal better to not owe. 

I got a fat salary increase then a promotion for another increase. (Took me from 35k a year to 42k). 

We owed that year about 2,000$. Our tax guy said whenever I get a promotion or salary increase to set it to 0 then back to 1 for our withholdings. (I think). 

This didnt really work. The next year we didnt owe, we got about 400$ but that went into what we were already paying off the IRS. 

Now this year I said fuck it. I set it to take out the maximum as did my spouse. Our tax guy didnt approve (the arguement of you'll let the government keep your money interest free) I understand but our taxes were not balancing out with our income.

So this y ew ar I got another fat salary increase, a promotion then another increase which put me at 56k. Combined household we make 93k.

Checked our our taxes in the federal checker and it says we may owe 600$. 

Meanwhile. We've both asked the system to take out the maximum all year. We dont expect getting money back but just want to ensure the government is getting their cut. But something is broken somewhere and I have no idea where to start or look.

We've tried discussing it with our tax guy but hes still preaching the ""set it on 1, dont let them take the maximum"" and looks at us just as dumbfounded as to why we keep owing. 

No other coworks have noted these issues and were almost to the point of filing separate to see if that changed anything. 

We are currently saving for a house but it makes me super anxious we cant get our taxes figured out and in want this squared away before we add a house into this mix.

personalfinance,Refinance Mortgage,"I bought a home in August of 2018. I did a first time buyer home loan where I put down 3%. I have a 4.75% interest rate. I started a side hustle and have come up with $40K I want to put down towards the principal of my loan. I believe putting down the $40K would make my PMI fall off, but would it make more sense to refinance and use that $40K as like a down payment when I refinance to reduce my monthly payment and remove my PMI and possibly get a better interest rate since I'm only 17 months into my mortgage?",finance
personalfinance,Advice regarding how to best allocate funds,"My wife and I are getting ready to buy our first home in June. We plan on going through the pre-approval process around mid May. 

We have $200,000 saved and were considering whether or not we should clear the majority of our debts ~$20,000 between two car loans and a personal loan to be eligible for a greater amount financed. While we aren’t looking to max out a home loan, we are looking for homes with a separate ADU for my parents. Long story short we’d like to have most options open to us.

While we have been aggressively paying off our debts my understanding is that part of what they are looking at is our debt to income ratio. If we were to clear these particular debts we would would only be responsible for a small student loan payment of $322 down from $1400. Currently, after taxes we are looking at a combined monthly income of ~$6500. Ideally we’d like to keep our combined mortgage/property taxes closer to $2200.

We should be seeing some bonuses which typically come in about $6000 after taxes every 5-6 months (we never count on them as a sure thing though we’ve never not gotten them) and have the maximum amount deducted from our checks by both the federal and state governments. 

From our searches the high end of homes that check things off of our list run about $700k and $500k on the low end.

My question is should we just pay everything off just lump some or stick to our original game plan which will have our monthly down to $800 by the time we would be looking to make a purchase (our lease is up at the end of August and we wanted to give ourselves some wiggle room). We could recoup about 10k of our savings in the time frame we are looking at and wanted to hold on to 20-30k after the down payment as a safety net because life happens.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated I/we are all ears.",finance

stocks,Gold Price Could End Year With 15% Increase,"Gold prices could end the year at more than 15% higher – their biggest annual increase in nine years.

“Gold has seen considerable safe haven buying from investors concerned \[over\] low and negative yields in the bond market and fearing a possible downturn in equities,” said George Milling-Stanley, chief gold strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Gold exchange-traded funds have also been “feeling the benefit of strategic asset allocation type buying by institutions and individuals.”

He added: “Ongoing uncertainties, both macroeconomic and geopolitical have provided support for both types of buying.”  


Gold remained steady on Monday as investors sought clarity on what “phase one” of the trade deal between the United States and China would be.  


Spot gold decreased 0.1% to $1,474.46 per ounce on Monday after gaining 1.1% last week.  


“This (trade deal) does not mean things get fundamentally better; it essentially means they’re not going to get any deeper into a slowdown … There still are risks down the road,” said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities. “A combination of expectations of high (trade) deficit, lower interest rates and U.S. political risks emerging during election year, all point to investors wanting to at least have some gold in their portfolio.”

The uncertainty over what “phase one” will look like has kept gold steady.  
“These overall concerns are still keeping gold prices relatively elevated,”said FXTM market analyst Han Tan.

Elsewhere, palladium jumped 2% to $1,969.41 an ounce. The autocatalyst metal struck an all-time high of $1,979.95 on Friday, when it also snapped a 15 session-long winning streak that saw it repeatedly breaking new records.  
Gold futures ended on Friday at $1,481.20 per ounce. The prices of the most-active contract up 15% year to date, making it the largest yearly rise since 2010, back when prices increased by nearly 30%.

Milling-Stanley is surprised by how quickly gold increase in price after sitting below $1,350 level this past summer, constituting “the upper bound of the trading range that had been in existence for six years, since the spring of 2013.”

In June, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he would “make a mid-cycle adjustment and give the markets the interest rate cut they had been clamoring for, gold rapidly rose to over $1,550 an ounce by September,” according to Milling-Stanley.

Gold futures reached $1,560 on September 4, marking the highest settlement price since April 2013.

The U.S. central bank cut interest rates three times in 2019, and then on Dec. 11 held its benchmark interest rate steady at a range of 1.5% and 1.75%.  
Between early 2001 to late 2010, gold prices increased from $250 an ounce to $1,250 per ounce. That’s an “average gain of $100 per year,” said Milling-Stanley.

He believes this was due “to increasing jewelry purchases throughout the emerging markets on the back of sustained good economic growth in the region.”

He noted that “speculative activity” drove prices up $500 in just nine months in 2011. As speculative interest decreased, gold prices fell back to $1,250 level in the spring of 2013. While Milling-Stanley is “hoping for modest, sustainable gains in gold over the coming years,” he is also “acutely conscious of the power the speculative community can have over gold in the short term.”

Milling-Stanley added: “I don’t believe the speculative community will want once again to risk missing the first 10 years of a bull market in gold, and the first $1,000 rise in the price, as it did at the beginning of this century.”  


Meanwhile, platinum was flat at $928.22, and silver increased slightly to 0.3% higher to $16.99.

Palladium’s bull run has been caused by a structural deficit, while platinum has been in a surplus, according to Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs.

  
“However, substitution of palladium for platinum is unlikely to happen until extreme physical shortages develop which create problems in producing automobiles to force the automakers to make expensive investments to make the switch. Until then, palladium will likely continue to outperform platinum.”

stocks,Silver Breaks Through $17.00. What to Expect in 2020.,"Silver prices are trading at $17.04, up 0.65% on the day.

That comes on the heels of the U.S. and China announced on Friday that a limited trade deal had been reached.

Yet, silver trails gold in terms of gains in 2019. While gold is almost up 15% in 2019. The 200 EMA is at 17.14, which is below resistance at 17.25. The 50-day EMA is 16.72.  


Oftentimes, the silver price lags behind gold, but closely follows.

Despite that silver has not increased like gold, the so-called “poor man’s gold” still had a good year. Silver advanced 16.9%.

Silverbugs will want to keep an eye on the U.S.-China trade situation and global growth prospects. Standard Chartered precious metals analyst Suki Cooper.

“For silver, trade negotiations are one of the key risks. Given the impact, it has on industrial demand growth, economic growth, and outlook for the tech sector,”Suki Cooper told Kitco News. “We do expect the Federal Reserve to remain on hold in 2020, but there will likely be continued concerns around the U.S.-China trade negotiations… Given that there is still negative-yielding debt on a global basis, this is likely to create a positive backdrop for safe-haven assets.”

Brexit, too, will play a role in silver prices.

“For gold and silver, it is going to be the macro-environment that is a key driver,” she said. “We think the trade tensions will be the underlying theme for the complex as a whole, whether that’s going to impact industrial demand or auto sector growth. Or whether that triggers safe-haven interest in gold and silver.”

According to RJO Futures senior market strategist Philip Streible. The Dutch bank ABN AMRO projects silver to reach $18 an ounce by year-end after averaging $16.60 throughout 2020.

“We think that an aggressive sell-off in silver prices in the coming months will be an opportunity to position for higher prices later in 2020,” ABN AMRO senior FX and precious metals strategist Georgette Boele said. “Silver prices will probably be more supported if global growth and global trade start to stabilize and improve somewhat.”

TD Securities strategists believe silver could peak even higher. “Silver \[could\] jump to $20/oz by the end of 2020 in response to its firming fundamentals and spillover investment demand from the yellow metal,” the bank’s strategists told Kitco News.

TD Securities strategist Daniel Ghali added: “A lot of the drags on growth, such as print episodes of deleveraging in China, tightening in the U.S, all been flashed out. Going forward, we should see some improvement.”  
Standard Chartered believes silver could average $17.50 in 2020. In Q2, it could reach a peak of $18.

SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co bowed to a growing cash squeeze by suspending commercial 737 production from January for the first time in more than 20 years, as the grounding of the planemaker's best-selling MAX after two fatal crashes drags into 2020.

personalfinance,Just found out there’s structural damage on my car trying to trade it in today... any advice for getting rid of it if I should?,"So over the last weekend I got to thinking about my car and how im not trying to keep it for over 5 to 6, 7 years and how ideally i’d like to change cars every 2-3 years so I recently found out about leasing and I’m thinking wow... I can probably get my car payment either a little lower then it is currently or maybe just around the same price Im paying now (which is 308) and all for exchange of a new car! (Haha dreams crushed here in about 39 seconds) so that led me into todays situation. 
Before I get to my main question/concern, heres some background: I have a 2015 Ford Fusion SE and I got it back in may 2018. Now with the dealership I first had drove off the lot with a 2011 Mazda and was so so happy because I always wanted a Mazda but then like the next day or so got a call that I needed to come back and they had explained that there was something going on with the bank and financing or whatever and I cant remember the exact details now but they ended up putting me in the Ford I have now and I was like wow its newer and probably better but its fricken huge, and kind of wide not really what I wanted and it took me a little while to get used to driving it cause im use to hatchbacks and generally smaller sized cars. So I feel like I got a good deal it wasnt that much for the car I think 13000-14000 (car is used btw) with like 29000 miles on it and with my interest rate I ended up at around 17000 and now im down to around 15000. 
So I, not having much knowledge of car buying and dealerships at all realized yeah my trade in value will be lower and lower as the years go by but for some reason never knew about negative equity. So my car with the year and model in good condition is worth around $10000 right now (my actual car is less but i’ll get to that in a second) so I say well screw it let me trade it in now and lease a car cause like I said “ideally” I’d like to switch out cars every couple or so years sounds great! 
Go to a Mazda dealership after work today about 10 minutes away from my job and the manager I had spoken with over the phone earlier in the day begins my appraisal. 
He comes back with my car fax and explains we have a pretty serious problem.... there’s structural damage on my frame where my windshield is and that affects my chances of getting a new car let alone for the monthly payment Im looking for. So theres not only that but I checked my credit score and seen I recently went from a good credit score at 701 that I worked so hard for cause I started building my credit at like 19/20 and I just turned 22 this year but anyways now I’m at fair, like 617 fair and I know it has a lot to do with me trying to take out loans when I was trying to start up my business just a few months ago and also I just got PayPal credit and used that money for a freaken business course for Amazon FBA and creating an LLC in Washington state, so ugh. I also tried to get approved from several different places for a small business loan and got denied so I just gave up and now im focused on just paying stuff back and saving... so im thinking that knocked points off and I just got some more knocked off from the dealership I just went to so now im like... I cant go to another dealership cause then more points will get freaken knocked off and i’ll definitely wont be able to get that monthly payment im looking for!
So... now that you guys basically know all my business lol (jk... kind of) Is there any hope for me to get rid of this car and out of this situation with my car? Like I don’t want it anymore knowing about the structural damage which! I forgot to add when I was at the dealership last year that I got it from HE DID NOT TELL ME ABOUT THIS. I saw the car fax but either I didnt see that or didn’t understand the full extent to how bad having structural damage on your car is better yet how it looks on the car fax. If im remembering it correctly I think, not for sure but I think I did ask, and he said something around the lines of oh that just means it was in like a minor accident they fixed it so its ok. 
I don’t remember seeing it but as I keep trying to replay the day over in my head my memories are trying to fade back in but im not sure if their correct. But I am sure that I had no idea having structural damage on a car can affect many factors when trying to trade it in or do whatever else with it.
The salesman at Mazda ended up getting me approved with a down payment of $1000 and paying $600 a month for a Mazda 3, and... no ma’am. Im paying 308 currently for my car and seems like im probably gonna be stuck with this damn car and not ever be able to sell it but just pay $15000 which will be going straight down the drain. 

So yeah, if anyone thinks I can probably find a dealership to work with me especially on the whole monthly payments thing that would be great, I wish I found this out like a month or two earlier because then I’d have more money to have a higher car payment but I just recently invested into something else so this is just... a mess.

personalfinance,Queastion about the rate at which the principle portion of an auto loan payment increases each month.,"Hello, all. I hear reddit is great for answers, so here goes:

What I know (please correct me if I'm wrong):

\- A loan is split up in two chunks, interest and principle. The total loan is calculated by taking the principle and adding the product of the principle and interest rate.

\- Each monthly payment(EMI) has a portion assigned to paying off the interest of the loan and another portion assigned to paying off the principle. In the beginning of the loan, the interest portion dominates the total EMI. This shifts over time, and the principle portion of the EMI dominates toward the end.

Is the shift linear?

Does the shift rate have a name(assuming its not linear)?

At what rate do the EMI portions shift from month to month?

Is the shift the same for every loan in existence or is it negotiated before the loan starts?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,"$10K Savings, $6K Debt. Questions about realistic car budget, debt, and credit.","Okay Reddit. My financial situation right now needs revamping. This post is mainly about 

a) realistic expectations for a car budget

b) what to do about my decreasing credit score

c) how to increase savings to meet long term goals

**Long Term Goals:**

\- Buy a car that will last 5 to 10 years 

\- Save money for school since I will only be working max 20 hours a week

during that time (just to pay rent) and partially living on loans if need be. 

**Savings: $10,000**

\- $3,000 in high yeild savings accounts (I don't touch this amount and a portion is locked in for a term of 6 years). 

\-$7,000 normal savings account not connected to my main checking/bank so I don't easily transfer and spend it. It's just sitting.

**Income: $2,300/month after tax @$20/hr**

In my occupation there are 6 weeks out of the year I'm not paid

**Expenses: $1,600**

\-Rent: $1,200. (The studio life has been sweet, but I am going to get roommates

again to decrease this to $700-$800/month in the next few months when I move

cities)

\-Food: $150 

\-Transportation: $50 (cabs/bus/train). 

\-Phone $90

\-State taxes $60 (from 2018)

\-Roth IRA contribution $50 

**Total income ($2,300) - total bills ($1,600) = Total Leftover $700.**

**Credit and Credit Cards:**

\-$3,000 Chase

\-$2,000 PayPal

\-$1,300 Capital One 

Just one year ago my credit score was 780. Now it is 600. Yes I fucked up a smudge. Two reasons for this. 

1. I applied for a credit card before a month long trip, the bill came and was due a few days before I returned. Silly me missed it. My first and only late payment on my record, my score dropped 100 points
2. I used my credit cards to pay off Federal $3000 in taxes from a self employed job worked in 2018. I owed $5,000 total and used $2000 of my ""own"" money and $3000 in credit. My original thinking was it was worth it to ""save"" that $3000 cash flow for emergencies and pay the credit cards down over time. I'm nearly maxed out in all my cards now and I'm getting hit with the interest charges. Currently I pay the monthly minimum and am getting charged just about the same amount in interest. 

**Credit Questions**: with the $700 I have left over every month how much of this should I be paying towards my credit cards? Should I put all of it down every month. 9 months of this and I would be done paying the $6K. Or should I pay down just a percentage while adding to my saving simultaneously? If so, how much of the $700 should I put towards credit cards and how much towards savings? 

**Car Questions**: I need to buy a car in the next 2 months because I will be moving to a suburban city. I have no idea what my realistic budget should be. Initially I was thinking 4-7k (with a 60% down payment and financing the rest. What is a realistic interest rate with my score of 600?). Considering my credit score, dept, and amount of savings, is this a bad idea? Should I just get a beater for $1-3K and hope it rolls along?

Thanks for any input!",finance
personalfinance,When does rolling negative equity in a car loan make sense?,"I understand negative equity should almost never be rolled over and is considered a complete loss. But certainly there has to be cases where fuel efficiency and lower cost of maintenance can make up the negative. 
Now I found a calculator that takes into account my annual milage, highway milage, loan payment,  interest rate. 
One thing to note is that my current loan I started at 72 months. Which I got 7.49% APR. (High, I know) the examples in the photo album show 2 options. I refinance my current loan with 56 months remaining with a lower rate which is an estimate. My Credit score is 60 points higher and my debt to income Ratio is much better. 
The other option shown is if I rolled 6k negative equity into a 2015 vw golf TDI and borrowed 20k. Obviously It would be a higher rate. 60 month loan. 
let me know if this is reasonable. I'm thinking I'd keep the car for 5 years. Hopefully when electric cars  become reasonably priced. I drive 100 highway miles a day. 

The 1st yr of ownership on my current car I drive 30k miles. 
I'm looking at the TDI VW because of the safety and the insane warranty they come with. 10 year 120k miles for modified emissions parts. I could also find a CPO 2 year unlimited miles warranty

My current car is an 2018 Audi A3

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,[Planning] wife and I are able to save a good bit but unsure what to do.,"so my wife and I make about 60-70k a year combined and we don't have too many bills because we were given a house.
so in total we probably spend about ~1k a month or less. and its only that high because her car payment and insurance is a bit pricey right now.
I'm not sure on how we should move forward. neither of us have any college education and we only have a few thousand in savings because I only recently found a job. The house we're in is sorta dumpy and could use a lot of fixing up but even then its not worth much. she wants to move next year but I'm suggesting we stay here until we can outright buy a house(a pretty nice house in our area 3-4 bedrooms is only about 200k) but I don't know what we should do with all the extra money we have every month other than just let it sit in our shitty savings account that has a horrible interest rate.
I would really like later on in life be very comfortable financially even if i have to go back to school even for a 2 year degree. And I would like to make a lot more money but I have no idea where to start.
Sorry for this being all over the place I'm just confused on what to do right now. also throwaway account because i don't want my wife to find out its me idk why.",finance

personalfinance,"23 year old, soon-to-be-graduate looking for help with budget.","Hey guys. I'm living in Florida and got an amazing opportunity as a job as an intern ($18/h) and am projected to be brought on at anywhere from **$55-$65k starting after graduation as a Business Analyst**. I work in the SQL environment, use Tableau, SSRS and other tools so I'd say even if I had to look for another job, I have some decent marketable skills. I'd say **$58,000** (my aim/projections based on other entry level analysts) is on the low side for 1 years experience, but this is only for budgeting purposes. My company has full intention of hiring me and had made that clear with me over a couple meetings (HR, my manager, and director).

**I have \~$45,000 in student loans.** (\~$13k me, all subsidized federal loans, at 5.5%, \~$32,000 dad Parent Plus, 6.8%)

I had $0 coming out of community college and then went out-of-state for school. Best decision I ever made mentally, but it was a $45,000 price to pay. Would I do it over again? In a heartbeat.

In terms of **repayment**, I'm going on a 25 year repayment plan for my student loans. I will be paying back the lump sum because my dad is 85 years old and makes less than $35k on his pension, so there's no way he could really pay this off. I've already talked to Great Lakes/Nelnet and my repayments would be:

ICR 25-year plan **$60.42/m** with gross income of $34,200 (father).

ICR 25-year plan **$80.32/m** with gross income of $65,000 (me) at interest rates of those stated above.

I asked about **REPAYE** ($380.74/m for my portion, 10 years, eligible tax benefit) but I wasn't interested. Also, for my PPL consolidation, it's only eligible for standard repayment and ICR I believe.

Yes, I am one of those millennials waiting for student loan reform. My argument is if I make minimum payments for 15 years @ **$140.74/m,** I'd be paying back **$25,333**, which would be a little over half of my loan balance, assuming there is reform or relief. I'm not an advocate of letting kids go to school for 100% free, but we all can agree college is very expensive. Total student loan debt being at **1.5T**, second to mortgage (collateral) debt, is a serious issue. I only included this because I figured someone would ask for my logic on minimum payments below, so I included it.

Anyways, on to the **budget**.

\--------------

**INCOME**

**Salary** \- $58,000

**Tax Rate (assumed)** \- 24.4%

**Salary post Tax** \- $43,848

**Monthly income -** $3,654.000

3) Miners continue to push hash rate higher.  Although you'll notice that difficulty and hash rate are currently stagnating, which we have seen happen repeatedly throughout Bitcoin's history.  

4) Developers are building out more infrastructure.  

5) The US govt will continue to run budget deficits and increase the debt through excessive spending on military, welfare, and govt pet projects.  

6) Financial surveillance continues to increase as governments encroach on human liberty around the world.  

7) American consumerism continues to change and shape our environment in ways that we may not understand until it is too late.  Bitcoin is a check on consumer culture.  

8) 6 billion people around the world exist outside the US-centric banking system.  Bitcoin will accept them onto its financial network no questions asked...

In the past, people used commodities such as shells and jewellery as currency. Due to their rarity, they were used as a store of value.  


We then moved on to using banknotes. Banknotes are cheap to produce, yet can be traded for high valued goods. This is because they are backed by the government. With the rise of the internet, we went from banknotes to money of account. In our bank account, figures are added or subtracted when we receive salary or make purchases. Only banks have the right to alter our bank accounts.  


During the 2008 global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve used its power to increase the supply and circulation of money.  


Satoshi Nakamoto found this unreliable and worked on the creation of a new payment system where everyone has bookkeeping rights, controlled currency supply and a completely fair and transparent ledger system.  


That is the driving force behind the birth of Bitcoin.

Got a question regarding extra mortgage payments vs investing/saving:

1. Age = 35
2. Current mortgage = 210K (28 years to go)
   1. Monthly payment = $1100
   2. Interest rate = 4.6%
3. Household income = 140K
4. Investing :
   1. 401(k) Contribution : 15% (Maxed out)
   2. Roth : None
   3. IRA / Mutual Funds : None
5. Children = 1 toddler
   1. Monthly daycare = $850
6. Cash = 85K
7. Other Loans = Less than 1K

We try to keep our expenses low and try to live below our means. Having debt is not something that I like, but I want to make sure we are doing things properly.

Goals :

1. Be debt free
2. Save for kids college
3. Save for nest egg / invest

Plan:

1. Pay 85K towards mortgage now
2. Make extra payments upto $10K per year
3. Save the rest of the money for backup / college fund
4. Still continue 15% investing in 401(k)
5. Pay off mortgage in \~7years

Is this a good idea or should we pay regular payments towards mortgage (refi to \~3.8%) and invest the rest of the money and excess payments towards mutual funds etc .. ?

Confused on what to do for long run ? Is there a better avenue to direct my resources to be a better financial shape.

Bitcoin,The Political State and Future of Bitcoin,"This post may not be so popular lol. But I'll tell you what you should hear. 

One of the big pushbacks I have gotten on reddit is over the banking secrecy act. I have been repeatedly told that I am making shit up or being conspiratorial. This is very very foolish of this community. The statements and releases were in a document released by the FATF. I read it. It's right there. It's in the document. They've come right out and said exactly what they intend to do, and have told exchange CEO' ""that's not our problem you WILL find a way to implement this"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I also follow the SEC and CFTC policy and press release strongly, and it is equally hostile and captured. It doesn't matter if a few people in the agencies are well intended. They don't call the shots. They are shadow regulatory industries controlled by people we will never see. The rich obviously. Dupont, Cargill, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bitcoin community has been deeply in denial about numerous issues pointed out. It has become a religion, incapable of receiving critique. 

\-Blind trust in Block stream

\-Blind trust in Chinese miners and wallstreet institutional mining

\-Blind trust in centralized exchanges

\-Blind trust in the venture capital token M.O

\-Blind trust in the idea of 'STO"" security tokens sanctioned and graced by banks/regulators

\-Blind trust in derivatives controlled by regulated bodies that can impose fractional reserve

\-Blind trust in the meme of an ETF

&amp;#x200B;

If this community was far more educated in history and political economy and the US foreign policy, you would never trust these regulated wallstreet instruments, you would never trust a rubber stamp. I mean think about it, how many people in this community are hoping for Wallstreet and regulators to pump their bags. Because that has become the meme. They believe that the government approval and integration into the financial economy is going to pump their bags. How's that working out?

We have less commerce acceptance, less adoption, less users with a thousand dollars in their wallet, than a year ago.

The belief that bitcoin can exist in a vaacuum and bubble, that it can exist without decentralized infrastructure at the mercy of centralized infrastructure in a hostile environment and become mass adopted by nations of people is delusional. It hasn't worked in a decade. Bitcoin is a hobby horse for geeks, speculators, and a revenue stream for centralized wallstreet and financial institutions globally. It is a proxy of bitmain, of these other institutions, and is becoming more and more centralized. The gini coeeficient of bitcoin dwarfs fiat.

&amp;#x200B;

And the problem \*is not bitcoin\* the problem is the community believing in these memes and not learning from economic history in antiquity and not building the infrastructure outside the states control and forcing the state into diplomacy. Bitcoiners are failed anarchist, they don't know how to politically represent themselves, they aren't wobblies, they aren't like classic leftist who forced these concepts onto the gilded aged imperialist western republics, that forced them to not send kids to work in coalmines for 12 hours a day. We aren't politically commanding.

&amp;#x200B;

The banking secrecy act is a extinction level event for crypto. Will bitcoin survive? Of course? But it's going to set us back a decade. It's going to send us back to the stone age. And we are at a \*profound\* risk of the main chain breaking off and becoming the pseudo banking state corporate nexus geofenced kyced bitcoin with backdoored nodes and backdoored hardware wallets. The statist wont break bitcoin in half, we will. We will out of desperation after they sully it so severely that we have no choice but to hard fork it into a original version that can protect itself against the BSA. You say we won't but we will, when they cripple the global south's access to it, and they cripple the price, you will have your braveheart mercy moment, and the og cypherpunk will kick the bucket and pull the trigger. What has to be done will be done.

&amp;#x200B;

Centralized exchanges are completely incompatible with cypherpunk and anarchism and the white paper. We've tolerated CEX for a decade. Not only are governments a threat, but we will be continually crippled by Quadriga CX failures, Cryptopia, and Mount Gox failures. Because of toxic maximalism and toxic attitude towards building the fucking infrastructure to avoid this. The mainstream developers won't do it because they can't make any money. This will be a sacrificial act to build this system, just like Satoshi.

&amp;#x200B;

The current DEX system is like the 1960's darpa intranet. That is it. That's why it sucks. It's not the internet of DEX, it's not. And making the internet of DEX is really, really, really fucking hard bleeding edge computer science. If we want global adoption we need an internet, not an intranet. Having the liquidity of DEX divided into intranet is why we continue to rel on CEX. You want to get rid of the CEX, turn the fucking intranet into an internet, into an interchain. Stop relying on companies and ICO's and 1000 tokens for 1000 things, build the actual backbone. Support the developers. Pay your fucking developers. Stop calling everything a scam and everything vaporware. The internet isn't a fucking vaporware scam, so neither is the interchain. Maximalism is ludditism. 

&amp;#x200B;

Crypto is for the global south, it's for emancipatory politics and independence, for the 99.99%, not the .01%. If you believe otherwise, and want you're ""Citadel"", Fuck You. Seriously. Read some political economy. Read Ellinor Ostrom, Bestiat, Spooner, Proudhon, etc. Crypto is suppoose to be a public good and a form of open source economy, not a recreation of tyranny, hierarchy, economic centralization, and worse yet just another banker shitcoin debt scam interest rate scam, which is what they are treating it and regulating and profiting off of it as.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Tax Lien and Cohabiting,"Hi. Throwaway because this is embarrassing. My long term boyfriend and I cohabit and we own a house together. We only have 1 joint bank account. That account only holds his money. Not mine (my finances are kept separate).   A few years ago, he didn't file taxes. Now he is getting notices from the IRS including a federal tax lien. He will continue to ignore this I'm sure. The amount owed (more than 20K) is easily in the joint account and it won't affect me if it is levied. However, I'm worried about our house.

personalfinance,Credit Score Jump After Chapter 7,"TLDR:

In November 2018 I filed chapter 7 bankruptcy on $60k+ in medical &amp; credit card debt.  I had never been late on a payment prior to deciding to file and we continue to make payments (without reaffirming) on our house and our cars.
The amount of debt and the lack of available credit had dropped my credit score to 598 at the time of discharge in March 2019.  Immediately following discharge the score jumped to 650 and now it’s up to 701.  We’ve established no new credit and neither our credit union (auto loans) nor mortgage lender are reporting payments to the bureaus (they show nothing at all on the report).  We do have several closed in good standing accounts over the years on the report and no late payments.  Just the bankruptcy shows on the reports and obviously a huge negative mark. 

1) is it normal to see a jump in score like this?  If so, why?

2) would it be possible to buy a home, with a decent interest rate, with a good credit score but a bankruptcy showing too?

3) should I go about manually reporting my mortgage and auto payments so they go back on the report?

TLDR: I filed chapter 7 a year ago and my score is up over 700 already? Is this Normal?",finance

**Salary**

My take home pay is around $3800 a month after taxes. I have about $1200 leftover every month to cover my gas, food, groceries, and other expenses. I do not have much room to save money currently. I have $600 in my checking/savings account. 

**Proposed Idea**

My dad offered to take a $20,000 personal loan out with a 8.75% interest rate over 5 years, completely in his name. By taking this money I could pay all of my debt completely off including collections and my car repair. The loan payment would be $411 a month. If I accept this loan I could increase my leftover money by $236 a month. I'd also free my credit of the high utilization, which might allow me to get a better rate on my next car (Lease expires in 2 months)

I'm also going to be having a roommate starting in 3 months. Which would lower my monthly rent by $800 a month. 

&gt; **Current** pay $2607 a month, make $3800 per month, 1200$ left for expenses/saving without roommate 

&gt; **New with 20k loan** pay $ 2371 a month, make $3800 per month, $1421 left a month for expenses/saving without roommate 

I want to get my credit score high within the next 3 years. I'm thinking to take the loan and pay as much as I possibly can on it until I have a roommate in March. Then once they make rent payments I will split the $800 a month on the loan and save the rest. By march my credit will have rebounded some due to all debt and collections removed (618 score currently) which would allow me to get a cheap used car at a good rate so I can save even more money.

personalfinance,Student Loan Decision,"Hey guys, this has probably been discussed thousands of times already but I’ve come to a crossroads involving consolidating my student loans. I (22m) just moved and got a job in a new city in the past 2 months, and just as I was beginning to enjoy the amount of income i had, I got torn down by my grace period ending.  After 2 days of financial depression, I took the next steps and looked into consolidating all 3 of my loans. After working with earnest, Ive been able to narrow down my options with interest rates and the duration of payments. My dilemma revolves around choosing to pay higher interest rate w a 10 yr pay off, or a lower interest rate w a 15 yr pay off.

To provide context, w the higher monthly pmt ,my monthly obligations (loans, car, rent+ utlities) will make up 76% of my post-tax monthly  income 

The lower pmt reduces my obligations to around 68% of my post tax monthly income

To provide a little bit more context, I want to be able to start investing money in the next year in order to gain experience and hopefully get my portfolio growing from a young age.

I realize there isn’t a concrete answer, but would love everyone and anyone’s feedback for me to consider. Cheers

personalfinance,"Need advice, recent events have changed my moving timeline","I'll try to keep this short and sweet. Purchase a condo in 2017 for $140k. Everything was fine, not the best neighborhood but not the worst, up until a month ago. A high number of gunshots were fired one night. Looking to move ASAP for two main reasons: 1) I don't feel the safest in my neighborhood anymore, and 2) The real estate market is still favoring sellers in my area, and i am afraid of more incidents happening and not being able to sell this place at all. Here is a quick financial breakdown;

Value of condo: have not had an official appraisal yet, although some comps on Zillow have it around $150k

Salary: $63,000, job is very stable 

Debt: $129k left on loan, no car, CC, or Student loan debt

Savings account: $2,500
ROTH IRA: $15,000 of principle contributions
401k: $16,000

Im looking for houses in the $170-190,000 range (3x yearly salary as max)

I have not spoken to a bank yet, but im worried about what will be required for a down payment. The last time I did 3% down, but that was through a first time buyer program at my bank. I have a decent credit score, around 750, so I don't know what percentage will be required this time. I've debated taking out the principal from my Roth, and getting a loan against my 401k for the down payment, depending on what I can sell my current place for. However, I don't want to rely too heavily on profit from the sale to finance the next purchase. I won't take out any savings that will incur a tax penalty. Also, with interest rates as low as they are, I'm not overly concerned with PMI. I guess what ime looking for is advice from anyone who's been in a similar situation. For what it's worth, my parents have offered any assistance I may need as they aren't comfortable where I live either, but I'm (stubbornly, foolishly, whatever you may call it) determined to do this without their financial help.",finance

personalfinance,Federal Student Loan Repayment Plans,"For the past 2 years, my wife and I have been paying $60 a month ($30 each) for a company to help us reduce our federal loan payments by enrolling us in payment plans. In hindsight, this was a horrible idea because I can’t hardly get in touch with this company, and enrolling in these payment plans isn’t that hard from what I’ve read. So I’m ready to dump this company and figure it out on my own. We each have about $30K in federal loans.

I have a few questions...

1. How can I figure out what payment plan we are currently in and when I’d need to renew our applications? I’ve tried asking this company to no avail. I’ve also poked around on Navient and studentloans.gov but can’t seem to figure it out. This company sent me no communication regarding what payment plans we are in.

2. My understanding is this company has us as separate individuals, but married, even though we file our tax return jointly. This was to help lower my wife’s payments. Is this even legal? I make $75K and she makes $35K.

3. Is there anything else I need to know or keep in mind before moving forward?

Thanks in advance to whoever read this far... I know it was a dumb decision to use this company but it seemed like a good idea at the time. Also, the reason we want to enroll in payment plans is for cash flow purposes. I can answer any questions regarding this if needed. Thank you again.",finance
personalfinance,"What’s the best way to progress from high interest rate sedan, to AWD SUV, and 4x4 Truck?","My husband and I were recently pre approved for a second auto loan. 20k at 3.99% APR, either a 60 or 72 month loan term. We’ve budgeted max 5k down on a truck, for my husband. 

Our first vehicle that we bought almost three years ago, we financed for originally 13.5k at 10.6% APR. It was our first time taking out a loan, both of us had mediocre credit at that time, hence the horrible interest rate they offered us.

The vehicle is a 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid XLE. We bought it with 112k miles on it, it has 141k miles on it now. The trade in value at the high end, according to Kelley Blue Book is 6.5k on it, we owe 7.2k on it, with 29 payments left. We pay 283$, and 127$ for full coverage insurance on it. I just got a new quote on insurance for it last month, we moved from the south to the PNW, our rate for insurance is better but I still think USAA isn’t giving us what we deserve, on both this auto loan and insurance. We both have never had any accidents or had to file any claims, overall I’d say we are both good drivers and not a liability for them. We are both 23, so I know our age is taken into consideration on the insurance part of it. 

As we are searching for a truck we’re realizing how much money we’ve spent on this Camry, in just interest alone. We can refinance it, but ultimately we need to get two larger vehicles. I preferably would have an SUV, or crossover, we’re thinking something like a used AWD Hyundai Santa Fe, a 2013-2015 model.

My husband wants a 2014-2015 Chevrolet Silverado 4x4, V8, crew cab.

My question is, should we trade in this Camry first and get the SUV out of the way? With the interest rate this credit union is offering us we could easily have a lower monthly payment on an SUV than what we pay for our Camry, and it would suit our needs far better. 
But our big goal is to get my husband this truck, we know that car note, for what he wants, will be larger than the payment I will make on my car.   We want to allocate more to the truck than to my SUV, is what I’m trying to say.

We don’t want to spread ourselves too thin, monthly with the payments. We can afford a 400$ car note on a truck, but it seems silly to us to put so much towards vehicles monthly. There has to be a way to get us both what we want/need, I just am having a hard time figuring out where we should start first.

Hopefully I explained all of this well enough for this sub to understand. I just hate seeing how much we’ve paid for this Camry, and how it isn’t worth much with how many miles are on it. Otherwise it’s a great car, never given us issues, it just doesn’t suit our family needs at this point.

We also have a beater car, a 97’ Lexus ES300, it’s got well over 200k miles on it, check engine light is on, we plan on selling that on Craigslist for like 1k, it’s on its last leg. But something to factor into the equation. We’d take that 1k and add it to the money down on one of the new (to us) vehicles.",finance

personalfinance,Seeking Input on Financial Plan,"I am a 51 year old federal employee scheduled to make $128,000 next year. Single, no kids.

I owe $7,000 on an SUV worth just over $20k, interest rate is 0%. I have no other debt, and max out my TSP (government 401K) and Roth which together are worth $350k. Next year if I make no changes to my retirement contributions, I will contribute almost $40k to my retirement accounts with the government match. I will also have a pension and social security when I retire.

I estimate I have 13 years until I retire. I recently moved cross-country to accept my current position. I won't need a car going forward if I stay in my current apartment because I can walk to work, take the bus for groceries, have delivery for lots of items. 

I would like to get out of apartment living, and live in something nicer while I finish my career. I will have the option to telework much more frequently in the future, but teleworking will be more pleasant if I can build a dedicated workspace.

Home prices here are expensive, but I estimate that rent will rise over the next 13 years faster than my paycheck. I currently pay $1600 for a one bedroom, and estimate a condo/townhome would cost between $350k to $500k. I have $10k in the bank, but that is lower than normal because of my move and making extra payments on the car.

Option 1: Sell the car, maintain current retirement contributions. 

Option 2: Buy a house. a) Reduce retirement contributions matching until my lease expires, then b) cash out IRA and borrow $50k from my TSP for a 20% down payment, then  c) Buy in the spring or wait one more year while accumulating more of a down payment from my reduce retirement contributions. If I don't buy because I can't find something, then I can always double down on my retirement contributions for the rest of the year. 

More considerations -

1) If I buy in the next 1.5 years, I would likely keep the car as I most likely could no longer walk to work.

2) I'd like at least 10 years to build equity in the house. I probably won't stay in this high cost area long term after retirement. Waiting 5 to 6 years to build a down payment outside of retirement accounts is possible, but not ideal because it decreases the amount of time I have to build equity in the house and will increase the amount I need as housing costs increase.

3) Buying a house adds a fourth leg to my retirement in addition to social security, pension, and retirement accounts. I'd have the possibility of cashing out equity and moving to a cheaper area, continue to live in the area but with mortgage costs tied to the time I bought the house, or renting as an absentee landlord.",finance

personalfinance,Is it ok to start paying minimums on my student loans in order to enrich my life?,"Since finishing my PhD and getting a good paying job ($100k+ but in Los Angeles and renting with sub $1000/month) within18 months I've payed down about $30k of $70k in student loans. Importantly I've payed off my private loan with an interest rate of 11%. I'm left with loans in the 5 - 6% range. 


I understand that when interest is over 4% you should pay more than minimums. Whenever I've payed off a loan I've stacked that payment on another loan. I currently have 3 months of expenses in savings. 10% of my income (4% match) is going into a 401K.

My concern is that the rep stated that Wells Fargo will let the credit bureaus known around January 31st that my payment is ""past due"" -- will this impact my credit score?

personalfinance,Questions on Student Loan repayment and Roth IRA?,"Hello personalfinance,

I'd like to see what you guys think of our current financial situation, as I'm having a hard time finding any great info about specifically what I should do online. 

Background:

I'm (27m) currently an junior level engineer making 82k gross. I married my wife (27f) earlier this year who is about to finish her 1st year in medical school making about 60k. We've done pretty well savings wise, and have put away about 25% of our gross income in investments/savings. My salary's upper limit is about 150k and I assume her's will go over 6 figures when she gets to attending level in 6-7 years. Her median salary for her specialty is 430k. 

The issue I'm trying to sort out is her student loans. She has 142k in federal loans at 5.75%. We've met with a financial advisor who specializes in helping those in the medical field. His advice was to minimize payments as much as possible and apply for loan forgiveness after 120 payments (10 years). Luckily for my wife, her specialty will be in a qualifying non-profit hospital, so this shouldn’t pigeon hole her.

Here’s where I get stuck:

10 years is an awful lot of time to have student loans, especially at our income level. I also don’t like relying on a government program that has had a rough time. The current plan is to invest what would have been each monthly loan payment for 10 years. If the program was a bust, we'd liquidate the holdings and pay off the loan. If the loan was forgiven, you've now got 10 years of investment gains. By my numbers, if we paid the loan off now in 3 years instead of investing the savings and waiting 10 years, we'd lose roughly anywhere from 100-300k in growth. Would you pay off the loan, or wait to see how this program shakes out?

Right after we got married, I took some of our wedding money and put it into a Roth IRA. Problem now is we have to file our taxes separately to lower her loan repayments. If you file separately and make more than 10k, you're ineligible to contribute to a Roth. Can I recharacterize my Roth to a traditional and then backdoor it into another Roth? Based on our projected income, we should be ineligible for any traditional IRA tax breaks after next year.",finance

investing,Some good Gold Stocks for under $10,"Honestly, of the ones listed in the article, I think GOLD (Barrick) is the pivot for a lot of the stocks in the sector. Plus its usually weighted pretty heavy in ETF's. Until it makes a meaningful move, I don't think we'll see the overall sector jump. 

That in and of itself has other baggage including US/China, interest rates, etc. that will dictate gold prices and in turn what most stocks will do. Juniors, however, are a likely bet for those of us who like a little more risk and volatility while the broader gold sector remains range-bound.

worldpolitics,"Paul Singer Is Driving the Outsourcing of US Tech Jobs to Israel - US tech giants Google, Microsoft and Intel are heavily investing in their Israeli branches while laying off thousands of American employees, all while receiving millions of US government subsidies funded by American taxpayers","With nearly 6 million Americans unemployed and regular bouts of layoffs in the U.S. tech industry, major American tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Intel Corporation are nonetheless moving key operations, billions in investments, and thousands of jobs to Israel — a trend that has largely escaped media attention or concern from even “America first” politicians. The fact that this massive transfer of investment and jobs has been so overlooked is particularly striking given that it is largely the work of a single leading neoconservative Republican donor who has given millions of dollars to President Donald Trump.

To make matters worse, many of these top tech companies shifting investment and jobs to Israel at record rates continue to collect sizable U.S. government subsidies for their operations while they move critical aspects of their business abroad, continue to layoff thousands of American workers, and struggle to house their growing company branches in Israel. This is particularly troubling in light of the importance of the tech sector to the overall U.S. economy, as it accounts for 7.1 percent of total GDP and 11.6 percent of total private-sector payroll.

Furthermore, many of these companies are hiring members of controversial Israeli companies — known to have spied on Americans, American companies, and U.S. federal agencies — as well as numerous members of Israeli military intelligence as top managers and executives.

personalfinance,Family calls me cheap and wants me to buy a house- need financial advice,"I like to save most of my money and am what some people would consider cheap. I need advice on what step to take next and where I can find trusted financial advice. I'll start with my background. 

I have been working the same job for 7 years now that I got straight out of college. It pays well with great benefits. At first I just focused on paying off debt and was successful after about 2 to 3 years. Since then I have just focused on saving and investing a small portion of it (in mutual funds). I have not changed my lifestyle much since college other than buying a decent vehicle. I still live in a small apartment with a roommate to keep my rent/living costs low and always question if I need something before buying it. I probably question myself too much when looking to buy something and I research prices for quite a while to find the best price. My friends and family constantly call me cheap and obsessed when it takes me time to research a purchase or when I talk myself out of buying something that they would buy the same day they saw the item.

I am now at the point where I have a decent savings account and am confused what to do next. My family, friends and co-workers constantly ask when I'm buying a house (it's a bit annoying). Buying a house right makes me a bit nervous for a few reasons.

First it's a big purchase and I obsess over the smallest purchases so it is very overwhelming to me. Second the economy where I live has been in a recession for a while and it has started to get worse with no turn around in site. This has caused some of my friends to get laid off which makes me a bit nervous. Third when I do research about purchasing a house and the economic outlook all I see are doomsday articles talking about a bubble because of the low interest rates and high debt. The only articles I see that don't show a bad outlook seem to be written by realtors. Fourth my parents have been the pushiest about me buying a house but I don't know if I trust their financial advice. They seem to like purchasing nice things like a bigger house than they need, new vehicles and a condo in the mountains all through debt. This has caused them a lot of stress especially after my dad was forcefully ""retired"" and now it looks like my mom will have to work for the rest of her life. Even when I was looking at houses in a price range I was maybe alright with my mom kept saying I could afford more and more.

I need some advice and am hoping I can get it here or you can suggest somewhere I should go to get that advice. I have been to my bank for financial advice and they always seem to give me someone young and inexperienced who just wants to sell me lines of credit, mutual funds and the largest mortgage possible.

personalfinance,"Aunt is being forced out of her job two years before retirement [MN, USA]","My Aunt and Uncle are in a rocky position financially and I'd like to give them as much good advice as possible. 

My Aunt is being forced out of her current job (where she has worked for over 10 years) at age 64, effective in January. She won't be able to draw full social security benefits until age 66, and I think the longer she can wait the better. She is losing her job due to departmental restructuring, not job performance, so she might be able to get unemployment. But none of us are familiar with that process.

She has health problems that make it difficult to work full time/on her feet. My Uncle is already retired and pushing 80, he can't work. They have very limited savings (less than $3,000, I think), a mortgage, car payments, and parent plus college loans. Health insurance is through my Uncle so that's okay. 

My Aunt is thinking about signing up for AmeriCorps reading programs as a way to make some money and do something she feels is worthwhile. She's really over/bitter about corporate culture and looking for a similar job to the one she has now (understandably)

Edit: Sorry, I'm seeing a few questions in the comments I should have specified. 

My Aunt isn't getting retirement through her job, but she does have a 401K and an IRA, I believe. She told me that taking SS early would be better than dipping into those right now, but that's all I know about that. I think my Uncle has an IRA too. They've been talking about my Aunt possibly retiring early, so they're not in imminent danger as far as I know. 

They bought the house at a bad interest rate back in the late '70s and they've never been great with money, hence the mortgage, but with time and increasing property values they have good equity. If they need to they can sell it and buy a cheaper house.

My cousin is trying to help with the parent plus loans, but he's a recent graduate so even with the best intentions his help only goes so far.",finance
personalfinance,Will I owe taxes in 2020 or get a return?,"I'm fairly new to the US system so I'm just trying to work out what 2020 will bring me in terms of taxes. I don't know if I've over- or underpaid and I'm just trying to be prepared.

What I've got:

I'm a W2 employee on a $51,000 salary. Single, no dependents. In MA. Paid biweekly.

By the end of 2019, I would have paid a total of $10,370 in combined fed/MA taxes.

I do not pay the Social Security tax/FICA due to my immigration status.

I contributed $4,240 to pre-tax programs in 2019 (403b and health care).

I earned an additional $19,000 by participating in egg donations. These were cash checks that were not taxed, and I think I filed W9 (?) forms for them, so I'm preparing for the taxes to hit me at the end of the year. There were two of these checks in 2019, for $7k and $12k. This is where I lost the ability to predict the future.

Nothing else to really report.

So total 2019 earnings, $70,000. Minus $4k in deductions. Paid just over $10k in taxes already.

btc,"[FYI] ""Other mining pools"" &gt;51% on BCH chain today... something needs to be done... I have an idea","Per [coin.dance](https://cash.coin.dance/blocks) as of the time of this post, ~56% of today's blocks have been mined by ""other mining pools"".

I'm just gonna put it bluntly: this needs to stop being an issue. BCH has to do something to garner adoption, price increases, and in turn, distributed hashrate from known pools.

Now I know there are many, many people working hard to get BCH adopted in the money and payments space, but in my opinion, that space is just too competitive right now. **ESPECIALLY** right now, with The Fed in the U.S., and other central banks around the world. And the stock markets. Nobody is breaking their back to switch over to cryptocurrency from fiat or other investment vehicles. Of course, committed, and principled people, like myself and many others I have seen in this sub, *have* mostly or completely switched, from holding/using fiat/legacy investments, to holding/using crypto wherever and whenever it is feasible. But with the community and ecosystem we have, after 2+ years in BCH, it is still only 3% of the total Bitcoin hashrate. It would be ~4.5% but fuck Faketoshi and Calvin Ayre, the scumbags. We need a solid 10% total hashrate **AT MINIMUM** to be a long-term contender for the Bitcoin name.

I think the best path forward to increase adoption for BCH is to focus on SLP merchant-side infrastructure. One idea I have would be to replace business' rewards points with SLP-based tokens. Idk exactly what businesses have to do to maintain their own rewards points system, but I imagine it costs a lot and takes a lot of time. That overhead could be **greatly** reduced by using SLP to replace their entire rewards points back-end. What business doesn't wanna cut costs and simplify its infrastructure?

Plus, SLP would fit in perfectly with this scan-n-pay culture we've been brewing for the past 10-15 years or more. It's easy to understand (""it's like digital Chuck-E-Cheese tokens but you can buy real shit with it.""), and not any functionally different than buying Starbucks with a smartphone, or paying for a washing machine cycle, and so on. Why not have a single app to hold and manage ALL rewards points/tokens?! :D

It's brilliant. Most of the people using SLP wouldn't even know they were using BCH (if using Vin Armani's post office protocol), but the demand for BCH would still increase; thus, number go up, and, hashrate go up. ;)",cryptocurrency

retirement,Middle-Class retirement has been much cheaper than expected,"Back when my wife and I were working full time, with a gross income of $65K, we paid about $5000 in Federal Taxes, $5500 in Social Security and Medicare and $3000 in VA State Taxes.  ($10,800 combined).

In retirement, we set up our distributions so our gross income was the same as just before we retired. ($65K)

Now that we are retired about half of our income of $65,000 is from Social security and a half from 401K and IRA withdrawals.  Our Federal Taxes are about $900 a year and State Taxes about $300 a year. With no social security and Medicare taxes anymore our taxes combined are only 1.8% of our income.)

personalfinance,Overpayment: student loans vs mortgage when interest rates are the same,"We are in the rare situation of having nearly identical interest rates on our mortgage and student loans (3.7X%). We have $25,000/yr going into retirement and no other debt. I'm looking to accelerate debt payment with our excess savings each month. Because of the similar interest rates, I think it may make sense to put the extra towards the mortgage rather than the student loans, but I want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything.


Mortgage details: $210,000 left on the loan, 89% loan-to-value, $61/mo PMI, will probably sell in 5-7 years.


Student loan details: $50,000 left. Just refinanced to 10 years.


**Advantages to accelerating mortgage payments:**

+ Tax benefits: continue to receive the student loan interest deduction for longer. There are no tax benefits to the mortgage in our case.  
+ Savings: get rid of PMI sooner.  
+ Flexibility: when selling the home, the money can always be used to pay off/down student loans.  
+ Next down payment: or provide more money for a down payment on our next home.  


**Disadvantages to accelerating mortgage payments:**

+ Risk: holding more non-dischargeable (student loan) debt longer.  
+ Cash flow: higher monthly debt obligation for longer.


Many of these benefits only exist because the interest rates are similar. I'm not averse to holding student loan debt longer. What are your thoughts? Am I missing anything?",finance
investing,"Sweden Riksbank breaks with Europe, raising rates to positive 25bps in concern over negative rate distortions","\*Correction\* Main repo rate was raised *by* 25bps from -25bps to 0, not *to* +25bps.

https://www.ft.com/content/0cb65c7a-223a-11ea-92da-f0c92e957a96   https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-19/swedish-rate-hike-ends-subzero-experiment-in-global-test-case  
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-12-19/sweden-s-riksbank-has-had-enough-of-negative-interest-rates  

&gt;Most economists and market participants don’t usually spend much time looking at Swedish monetary policy. Today should be different given the decision by the Riksbank — the country’s central bank and the world’s oldest — to part ways with its peers in advanced countries by raising interest rates because of worries about the collateral damage and unintended consequences of an ultra-low regime.

&gt;By raising its main repo rate 25 basis points, Sweden exited a negative rate paradigm that had been in place for five years. The action came after officials there publicly expressed concerns that persistent negative yields distort the behavior of households and companies adversely.  

&gt;This is a big policy move for Sweden, especially so because it faces what economists call “small country” conditions — that is, it’s too small to directly impact other economies or to resist spillovers from the actions of larger economies.  

&gt;By increasing interest rate differentials compared with the rest of Europe, the rate increase could strengthen the currency and, together with the higher cost of borrowing domestically, weaken the economy. It’s a risk that the Riksbank said it would monitor closely.   

&gt;This is also the most explicit signal yet of growing concerns in Europe about the collateral damage and unintended consequences of protracted and excessive reliance on unconventional monetary measures, particularly negative interest rates and large-scale purchases of securities. Potential distortions to a well-functioning economy and financial systems include:  

&gt;• Undermining the provision of long-term financial protection products to households, which, together with negative returns on savings, goes against the objectives of monetary stimulus by encouraging higher (rather than lower) savings.  
• Undermining the banking system’s traditional role in intermediating loanable funds while, simultaneously, encouraging excessive risk-taking by nonbanks.  
• Subsidizing zombie companies, thus slowly eroding the growth and productivity potential.  
• Encouraging economy-wide resource misallocations.  

&gt;The loud Riksbank message to other central banks is that being “the only game in town” for too long can make them not just ineffective but also counterproductive. If Sweden can hold out as the monetary policy outlier in Europe — and it’s far from easy given the “small country” conditions — this could well be looked back at as the beginning of the end of a historic policy experiment, one that worked initially but was subsequently undermined by the failure of politicians to enable the much-needed pivot to a more comprehensive pro-growth policy response.",finance
ethereum,Do you want to receive a fixed interest rate on your stable coins?,"With interest rate swaps (IRS) it is easy! You need to choose a maturity, accept fixed interest rate and enjoy your fixed-rate deposit.

**How it works and how secure it is?**

You don't need to trust all your money to interest rate swaps (IRS), you just trust a small fraction of your deposit, which is enough to compensate for small interest rate fluctuation. The rest of the money you can still place to a floating rate deposit (like Compound.finance, Fulcrum and other). IRS works in a way that it will give you compensation if the actual floating rate is low during your deposit time. But also you will pay to IRS an excess that you may get from your floating rate deposit over the agreed fixed rate.

So it is like an insurance that you get for on top of your floating rate deposit at Compound project. It doesn't cost anything due to the fact that you share the risk and will pay away everything you get above a specified fixed rate.

**Let’s explain how it works in the following example:**

You have a deposit at Compound that you intend to hold for 12 months. You expect that it will bring you from 5 to 12% over the year, but you don't like uncertainty. You can get an interest rate swap with a 10% fixed rate and be sure that you will get exactly 10% in one year, whatever happens with the compound floating rate at the same time.

Indeed if the effective rate on Compound during the year will be 7% you will receive the remaining 3% from the interest rate swap. And if the effective rate will be 12% you will pay 2% to interest rate swap.

https://preview.redd.it/v7hvgftsvm541.jpg?width=2880&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af4ec558831adae382d0db635c569def7633b928

Good news that it is enough to lock in the swap, not more than 10% of your deposit amount because it will be enough to pay (or get paid) the difference between actual rate after one year and the fixed-rate (unless compound average rate goes over 18% during one year, which is not realistic).

**Even more:**

Interest rate swaps allow you to hedge your deposits or loans, take a long or short position on lending/borrowing rates, make the financial system more efficient and much more.

For example, if you fix your borrowing rate in the same style, you can stop worrying when the borrowing rate is getting volatile. So we will see fewer money outflows from the Compound ecosystem when the borrowing rate temporarily going high.

But it is a story for a proper article, we will keep you posted.

My wife and I make 98k between us but we got turned down for a loan today from navy fed for 14k. I have a new job on the other side of Phoenix and I MUST have a car. No other option.

What should I do? Where should I go? Drive time is a scam but I know I’ll get a car that will be within my budget even if it’s expensive.  I don’t really know what to do here? I don’t really have cash right now because I started my new job and we have to move this month as well. Kinda fucked and I’m not sure what to do.

personalfinance,Jumbo Mortgage vs Conventional?,"I've been getting a couple of quotes within the last few weeks from multiple lenders. Today's had some interesting new ideas for me though. 

I was originally looking to put around 200K down on a 620K property. Roughly 30% down. I was getting quotes around 3.6-3.9%.

Today, I was told that if I put less down (109K) and leave a loan of $511K, it becomes a jumbo loan which will get 3.375%. They said they will waive PMI based on banking relationship and parking some money in that bank. 

Is there a downside to this?? Less money down and a lower interest rate is all I seem to see. Is there something I'm missing?

If I wanted to, I can pay &lt;$1000 to recast with the remainder of my original down and get the lower rate at a steep discount to the points I would've had to pay to get this lower rate, right? 

Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Favorite bank for high yield savings account and budgeting visualizations?,"Hi, all! First off, thanks for all the great advice and posts. I'm $200 away from having a credit card balance I have been carrying for a while paid off (woo!) and next plan to build up an emergency fund. I am using Bank of America, but they don't offer a high yield savings account, which is ideally the type of place I want to build my emergency fund. I have a Marcus account but anticipate BOA charging me fees for transfers from Marcus to BOA. 

My priorities:

- build an emergency fund at a high interest rate (at least 1.7%)

- not pay ATM fees for cash withdrawals

- be able to budget in ""buckets"" or sub savings
 accounts (not a big fan of YNAB after a thirty day trial)

- be able to create a budget 

- have access to visualizations to view spending over time and savings over time 

- not pay fees for at least one move from savings to checking per month 

- not get charged to pay my BOA Visa from a non BOA account (feel like this probably is not a thing, but I've really only had one credit card at the same place as my checking, so I don't know)

I'm looking at Simple, Capital One, and possibly Chase. I'm in NYC if that matters.

personalfinance,Defaulted student loans- payment advice,"Hello. I hope you don’t roast me too hard for my ignorance. I fortunately never took out student loans but I married into them. 

I recently got married and I discovered that my husband has federal student loans in default for a little under $7,000. They are currently under control of Coastal Collection Agency, and the last payment was back in April 2018. To my knowledge, my husband’s wages haven’t been garnished, but his tax return went to pay the debt. 

I understand that we can pay the full amount at myeddebt.ed.gov, but it’s a little out of reach for us to pay in one lump sum. Paying aggressively, we could probably pay it off in 7-8 months (we work in education). Can we just make payments every month, or do we need to enter into a payment or rehab plan with the collection agency? I’ve heard that while rehabbing can improve credit, it can also tack on a lot of fees. We’re unsure of next steps. We’ve recently thrown around $1,000 at the defaulted student loans through the federal gov’t payment portal.

He is also paying paying private student loans through Navient, and we’d like to buy a house soon (we’ll probably use my credit to do so, since I’m in the 740 range).

personalfinance,What do I do with my emergency fund savings?,"Hi, I’m (18f) am pretty good about managing my money. I work a part time job that makes me about $500 a week, and I have a current savings of $5000. Ive occasionally taken out money from this to pay off rent or credit cards but always manage to get it back to $5000 within the month. I occasionally save more than 5k but of course with school and rent it always ends up being back to 5k without me ever saving more consistently. My current savings is in a regular checking account with an annual interest rate of 2.6%, so every other month I usually gain $5 to $6 in interest. My question is, am I doing the right thing with keeping my money in this account or should I invest it in retirement (Ex. Roth IRA) or some sort of stocks? I think of this savings as my emergency savings account, so I don’t think I would want something with a limit of how many times I could take money out of it. This is also my only savings account so I don’t know if I should split the money, like 2.5k in one account and the other half in an IRA. Kind of confused on this so looking for any advice! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Consolidating IRAs and moving funds to another institution. Optimal strategy to avoid fees. Do I have this right?,"I searched this topic on this sub and only found one previous post that was somewhat helpful, but it really didn't answer any of my questions, so here it goes.

I have a Roth IRA and Trad IRA at Schwab. The Trad IRA only has a small amount of funds in it, like $100. The Roth IRA is where the bulk of my money is. I originally started funding the Trad IRA but quickly decided I wanted to do Roth IRA, hence the current weighting. 

My 401k is at Vanguard. I am happy with Vanguard and would like to consolidate/transfer my Schwab accounts at Vanguard for simplicity sake. So, I have two goals: get rid of the Trad IRA by converting it to a Roth IRA &amp; move funds to Vanguard for as little cost (fee) as possible. This would ultimately result in me having two accounts, my Vanguard 401k and a Vanguard Roth IRA.

Here's where it gets confusing. I know trustee-to-trustee transfers are the easiest, most hands off way to complete the movement of the money, but as I understand it, Schwab charges $50 for trustee-to-trustee transfers (see link below), yet $0 to close an account. So theoretically, if I create a Vanguard Roth IRA and Vanguard Trad IRA and do two trustee-to-trustee transfers, I would pay $100. I can't imagine how I would justify paying a $50 fee to move a $100 Trad IRA, just doesn't make sense. I'm trying to think of how to get past this. 

[ACAT Fees](https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/how-to-transfer-accounts/)

I have been studying this IRS site. Note the ""Rollover Chart"" in at the top of the page.

[IRS Rollovers of Distributions](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/rollovers-of-retirement-plan-and-ira-distributions)

Here's what I have come up with: convert the Trad IRA to Roth IRA, all still at Schwab. So now the Schwab Trad IRA has $0 and I can close it without a fee. Now the money is all in the Schwab Roth IRA. From there, take a distribution of all of the Schwab Roth IRA funds (I believe they basically write a check to me?) and ""rollover"" the funds to Vanguard within the 60 days required by the ""one-rollover-per-year rule."" Then my Schwab Roth IRA has $0 and I can now close without a fee. Now all my funds are where I want them to be and I hade avoided all fees.

[IRS One Rollover Rule](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-one-rollover-per-year-rule)

Then all that's left to do is pay taxes on the Trad IRA to Roth IRA conversation at tax time? Or do I somehow have to have tax $ withheld by Schwab when I do the conversion? I'm really fuzzy on this part. This is the part I'm most afraid I will botch (not understand the taxability of the event).

Does this plan sound plausible? Any feedback on how to better execute is greatly welcomed. Thank you!

*EDIT
I see some language on Schwab's website that has left me even more confused. I pretended to go through with the Trad IRA to Roth IRA conversion and it says this:

*Like most distributions from IRAs, the amount that you distribute to convert to a Roth IRA is subject to income tax rules and regulations.  This means that the IRS requires Schwab to withhold income tax from the amount that you convert unless you elect not to have income tax withheld. This is why you will see a Tax Withholding Election section below where you can elect not to withhold income tax from the amount you convert.* 

*If you choose to have taxes withheld, the amount withheld will be sent to the IRS.  This may result in the withholding amount being treated as a distribution from your Traditional IRA and not considered part of your conversion.  As a result, if you are under 59 ½, you may be subject to a 10% federal (and possibly state) early withdrawal penalty tax on the tax withholding amount.*  

*Example: A request to convert $10,000 with 10% withholding means that $1,000 ($10,000 X 10%) will be forwarded to the IRS and $9,000 ($10,000 - $1,000) will transfer to the Roth IRA.  You will pay taxes on $10,000 plus, if under 59 1/2, an additional 10% penalty ($100) on the $1,000 may apply because this amount was not transferred to the Roth IRA.*  

*Please make your tax withholding election. Your tax withholding election will remain in effect for all distributions from this account until you revoke or change it. You may revoke or change your tax withholding election for future distributions at any time.*

So it appears I can elect to withhold taxes or chose not to? I guess I don't understand why I would want to do one vs the other. If I withhold a certain amount, I will then pay a penalty. But, I guess if I don't withhold, then I may technically be overcontributing on a past amount and still owe a penalty? So I guess I pay a penalty either way? For that matter, how do I know how much to withhold? The site allows me to choose a default 10% or select my own amount. It says *As required by federal law, Schwab will withhold 10.00% from your gross distribution for payment of federal income tax, unless you elect to increase the rate of withholding or elect not to have withholding apply.* So I guess I just use the default 10%? For my state it says *As required by state law, Schwab will withhold [My State]'s minimum withholding rate of 0.00%, as determined by the legal address of record on your account. State tax withholding is voluntary regardless of whether or not you elected to have federal tax withheld.* Again, I guess I just go with the default 0%? Are there any special tax forms I am going to need to file at tax time? There's more lingo about this in the IRS Rollovers and Distributions thing I linked above but my brain is fried trying to understand it. Wondering if I should just pay the trustee-to-trustee fees and avoid this headache.

So sorry. I feel confused.",finance
personalfinance,“Rules of thumb” for house/mortgage affordability are very interest-rate dependent. There’s more to the story than just a fixed multiple of your income.,"I often see advice on this sub that homebuyers should never spend more than three times their annual income on a house (or alternatively, on the mortgage loan amount). It’s good to be conservative and not end up house-poor with constant cash flow issues, but I wanted to show – through math! – that this guideline depends heavily on interest rates. Most people can’t pay cash for their houses, so interest rates are a valid concern for affordability and shouldn’t be ignored in sweeping “rules-of-thumb.""

There’s an older and moderately conservative, but still well-accepted guideline that your total housing payment (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance or “PITI”) shouldn’t exceed 28% of your gross monthly income. In my view, this is a good rule to try and follow whenever possible, even if going a few percentage points over probably won’t spell catastrophe.

I want to show the kind of interest rates that are implied by the blanket “maximum 3x salary” guideline I often see in comments, and you’ll see why I don’t think this rule always makes sense.

Take someone making $48,000 a year, or $4,000 monthly. The 28% rule for a housing payment would cap this homebuyer at $1,120 a month, or 0.28 times $4,000.

Now, let’s apply the “maximum 3x salary” rule-of-thumb, which puts this person’s maximum budget for a house at $144,000. I’m going to assume 1.1% of the house value annually for taxes and 0.25% annually for insurance, so 1.35% total. So we’ll estimate monthly taxes and insurance at (0.0135 * $144,000) / 12, or $162/month. Subtracting this from the $1,120 maximum housing payment leaves $958 available for monthly principal and interest (P&amp;I) payments.

I’m using the Excel RATE function to back into an implied interest rate under a few different scenarios, all assuming a maximum $958 P&amp;I payment (and ignoring monthly PMI, if any, for simplicity):

For a 30-year loan:

* 20% down payment (Loan amount $115,200): Implied rate 9.373%
* 10% down payment (Loan amount $129,600): Implied rate 8.078%
* 5% down payment (Loan amount $115,200): Implied rate 7.516%
* 0% down payment (Loan amount $144,000): Implied rate 7.000%

Yikes! Those are some pretty ****ty rates we’re assuming! Let’s try a 15-year loan instead:

* 20% down payment (Loan amount $115,200): Implied rate 5.772%
* 10% down payment (Loan amount $129,600): Implied rate 3.990%
* 5% down payment (Loan amount $115,200): Implied rate 3.201%
* 0% down payment (Loan amount $144,000): Implied rate 2.468%

These implied rates are much more reasonable, but they still assume a 15-year loan which, rightly or wrongly, simply isn’t feasible for many buyers given that house prices are increasing much faster than incomes in general.

Now, if you can afford a 15-year mortgage and want to be especially cautious with your home-buying decision (this is probably a good thing when feasible), then by all means do it. However, if you’re opting for a 30-year loan, realize this “3x income MAX” metric carries an assumption of interest rates that simply don’t make sense in the current environment. Put another way, this guideline would have made perfect sense in the early 1990s, when 30-year rates actually were in the 8% range, but may well be needlessly conservative in the present.

I know I’m going to get responses that say 28% of gross income is still too risky and a safer guideline is, say, 25% of take-home pay. Again, this is fine if you can manage it! What you end up doing for a mortgage, or even whether you buy at all, is still a personal decision that depends on both your risk tolerance and the stability of your income.

tl;dr – If you’re looking to buy a house, do the math on what you can realistically afford and the risks you’re willing to take. And try not to assume interest rates from 1992 ;)

personalfinance,Is my loan officer screwing me with his offer to buy down my interest rate?,"I'll keep this short. 

Purchase price of house: $465,000. VA loan. No money down. Interest rate set at 3.375%. Yes, I am aware of how blessed I am. 

We negotiated a deal in which the seller pays ALL closing costs. We put down an earnest money deposit at the beginning of this deal that was $2,500 paid to our lender. Our home was appraised for 5k more than the purchase price.

My understanding is that if the home is not appraised for less than the purchase price, and there is no down payment, and the seller covers the closing costs....that you get your earnest money back. Where else is there for it to go?? 

My loan officer hit me up today and asked if I wanted to buy down my rate. He said I pay an extra $1,500 now that he could drop my interest rate to 3.25%. I did the math and that would mean my mortgage goes down by about $40 per month and it would take me 3.5 years in that house to make that money back. 

The thing I don't understand is... why is it that much to buy the rate down? The decrease is half a ""point"" so 0.5% of the purchase price. Which is $2,325. So where is the money making up the difference between $1,500 and $2,325 to buy that half a point? That's $825 that I can't really figure out where it is or where it would and could go.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,How to afford my last two years of college?,"Hello! I'm in a bit of a panic mode. I was accepted to my school of choice for fall of 2020, it is a state college and the only one to offer the degree I'm pursuing in my state (Industrial Design). Spring of 2020 I'll be getting my associates from the community college I go to. Even with putting in 30 hours of work every week on top of an 18 (and this semester 19) credits I only have $2000 saved up outside of what went towards paying for my classes. My goal was to go for my bachelor's right away but I can't think of a realistic way to obtain that. The bare minimum cost for going to my school of choice is $19k a year, mainly because a grand majority of classes relating to my field at my community college were not accepted as the same classes at my college of choice- meaning I have another two years of 18 credits a semester. My parents cannot help me at all financially (both are attempting to retire as they had me quite late) and the most I can make over summer is $5000.

Unfortunately, I don't qualify for any federal aid and I'm a B average student making finding scholarships difficult (I've been applying but I don't seem to have the luck or talent for winning). I'm also worried about getting private loans, as the only co-signers I have available are my parents, who don't want to take the financial burden this close to retirement... and some of the companies I've seen offer private loans can charge the full amount if the co-signer dies, which unfortunately I can't guarantee my parents will survive to the end of my loan repayment... as morbid as that is to think about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way I could make this work without taking a gap year? Is it worth it to financially cripple myself so early into my adult life?

I'm fortunate in that my job offers tuition reimbursment- a max of $1500 a semester. If I work during the summer and include my repayments I'll be at $8,000 that I can pay out of pocket a year, still leaving me plenty into debt.",finance

business,Which is a Better Option: Business Loan vs. Personal Loan,"https://preview.redd.it/k8bu7eflrr541.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50efba7c8d37c9c265745bdc4b8cb51d21b6d296

From small business loans to credit cards to investors, there are various options to get your business funded and grow it. For some, business loan is an appropriate option, and personal loans remain a common and feasible option to fund your small business. In order to make a decision before choosing one, there are pros and cons to both financing options. This is particularly essential for new business owners, who need to think and weigh carefully while deciding on these two financing options.

It’s important to scrutinize the potential outcomes and repercussions before making a business decision. How you will use the funds, how it weighs on your credit score, the loan underwriting process and how to build a financing relationship for the future of your business.

Here is everything you need to know before deciding which loan option is more suitable for your small business—so you’ll be able to make an intelligent decision in order to get the capital to grow your small business.

**The Difference**

Primarily, let’s dive in to understand the difference **business loans** vs. personal loans. Both loan options offer multiple products including lines of credit, and term loans. However, the actual loan usage tie back to the business itself. For what reason you need a loan for and how do you plan to use it.

**The Use of a Business Loan**

You can use a business loan for almost any business purpose from buying inventory, renovation, salaries, marketing to open a new location, or even buy business equipment. With that said, you’ll need to have a detailed plan on how you will use a loan and for what purpose.

There are **different types of business loans** and some with specific purposes. For instance, equipment loans are for financing equipment purchases, lines of credit for emergencies and stalled cash flow, and invoice factoring for your accounts receivable. Other options have little or no constraints on them. So, the structure and terms of your loan will be determined by your loan usage.

**The Use of a Personal Loan**

A personal loan is lump sum money borrowed which you repay in fixed monthly installments and use as you see fit. There are different types of personal loans based on how you’ll be using the money.

Personal loans are alike **business loans** with one difference; they’re for personal use. With that said, it’s significant to have your personal and business financials separate while running a business. Personal loans are usually used for things like credit card debt consolidation, medical bills payment, home upgrades, or to finance a car purchase.

**Use of Business Loans and Personal Loans Interchangeably**

Technically, you can use them interchangeably. Money is money and as long as you’re using a loan within the terms, you can do whatever you want with it.

However, there’s a risk involved while using them interchangeably. If you default on a loan, the lender can seize collateral from you personally, rather than your business, or vice-versa. So, you need to very careful before using a loan interchangeably.

**The Approval Process**

The loan approval process is the main difference between business loans and personal loans.

In a **personal loan** underwriting, lenders consider two important factors including your personal credit history and personal income. The rest of the factors like your loan terms, interest rate and loan amount all depends on these two factors. With a strong credit profile and income, you can easily secure a personal loan.

In case of **business loans**, lenders take into account a variety of factors while making a decision. Your personal credit history serves as your financial report to lenders making the most important factor in the decision.

However, this is just one part of the puzzle. Lenders also take into account other factors like business’s profitability, time in business, debt to income ratio, cash flow, collateral and industry while decide whether to approve you funding or not. All these factors contribute to the finalization of the interest rates, terms, and amounts of a business loan.

**How to Decide Which Option to Choose?**

For many business owners, getting a business loan for business and personal loan for personal purpose rule works. While for some, it’s not quite that straightforward. Here are few tips to help you decide which option to choose:

**Get a business loan when you want:**

* To keep your business and personal finances separate
* To limit your accountability
* To improve business credit
* To apply for a higher loan amount
* To build a connection
* Something other than a term loan

There are many reasons to get a business loan rather than a personal loan. Let’s dive in to each situation to understand why getting a business loan is a better option.",finance

personalfinance,Emergency Fund Testimonial,"So a little about me. I (27M) went to college and earned a BA in math with a minor in computer science. I tried to find an entry level job as a software developer for over a year with no takers so I made the decision to pursue finance. I took a job as a receptionist ($14/hr) to get my foot in the door with the understanding that they would provide sponsorship for me to get my Series 7 and 66. After passing those my boss said I was being considered for a promotion. My research showed that the new role should pay ~ $45,000 annually, so that's nearly double what I make now. My boss reorganized my schedule to allow me to train with my new co-workers while they search for a new receptionist and I've been doing this for 2 weeks now. I was fired today. Completely unexpected, but I ran my big mouth to the wrong person about wanting to be self employed or become a Financial Rep for the same company and my boss totally slammed on the brakes because she wants someone in the role for the long-term.

My current financial situation:

$22k in private student loans at 10%.

$33k in Federal student loans at 6.5%.

$5.5k in CC debt at 22%.

$5k in auto debt at 4%.

$3k EMERGENCY FUND.

$1,400 in monthly lifestyle expenses.

I was so sure of my new role and I had a lot of big ideas about how I was going to debt avalanche this mess I'm in. $45k would have been the most I've ever made in a year and I felt for the first time like I was starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. My boss was paying for me to get my CFP and I was trying my damnedest to take the exam in July which would make me far more marketable and I could earn ~ $60k. This was a devastating hit and I just wanted to highlight the importance of an emergency fund.",finance
Bitcoin,"Forbes: U.S. cryptocurrency law expected to be launched in 2020, SEC, CFTC, FinCEN and three major institutions join forces","According to Forbes report yesterday, 2019 is coming to a perfect end just as the U.S. Congress prepares for a holiday break.  Because of the importance American lawmakers attach to Facebook's launch of the Libra project, a bill that provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets including cryptocurrencies has surfaced.
 The bill is called the 2020 Cryptocurrency Act, and its purpose is to state which federal agencies regulate digital assets and require these agencies to publicly announce whether the creation or trading of such assets (or any other use) requires a federal license, certification or  registered.
 The preliminary review of this draft includes:
 1. Assign the definition of ""Federal Digital Asset Supervisor"" or ""Federal Cryptocurrency Supervisor"" to three agencies: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  (Note: cryptocurrencies are regulated by these three institutions)
 2. Divide digital assets into three categories: cryptocurrencies, crypto commodities, and crypto securities.
 3. Federal cryptocurrency regulators are responsible for one of these types of assets and are the only government agency authorized to regulate:
 CFTC-crypto commodities
 SEC-Crypto Securities
 FinCEN-cryptocurrency
 4. Every federal cryptocurrency regulator must be open to the public and maintain a complete federal license, certification, or registration process that applies to the creation or trading of digital assets.  5. Requires the Minister of Finance, through FinCEN, to establish rules for similar financial institutions to track cryptocurrency transactions.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Selling vehicle ... What best to do with the money?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I’m looking for some advice on what to do with the money I get from selling a vehicle.

The vehicle I’m selling does not have a loan on it and I will be getting $23,500. I have no real credit card debt, a student loan with $13,600 with a variable interest rate currently at 3.5%, and a mortgage with $153,000 and a fixed interest rate at 3.75%. The student loan I believe is my oldest account.

My initial thoughts are to pay off the student loan and top up my 6 month emergency fund. I currently have $13,500 and want to bring it to $16,500. I would then put the rest in another account to save for a big purchase either a newer car or a rental property. The car I’m selling was a big diesel truck that costed too much to drive and my current daily is an '05 camry with 230,000 miles so it probably will only last another year or so.

Some of my questions or reservations about my current plan are:

* Will paying off my student loan affect how much I could be taken for child support if my ex wife decides to take me for it? I live in WV if that helps.
* How will paying off my student loan affect my credit score since it is my oldest account?
* Are there any other scenarios that would better set me up for the future?

personalfinance,"Extra money on hand. Should I increase retirement contributions, or make extra mortgage payments?","My mortgage loan is 25 years and an interest rate of 4%, and my payment every month is about $1900. What I understand (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is if I start paying more per month, over the course of the loan, I will end up paying less total interest (because the amount of interest I pay every month is based on the total remaining amount of the principal… right?). I could easily bump up my payment by a couple hundred bucks a month, and I'm all about doing that if it saves me money in the long run.

…But I'm wondering if this is a better financial move than upping my retirement contributions, since my interest rate is (relatively) low, and that rate won't change year over year to keep pace with inflation or anything like that - it's carved into stone at 4%. The stock market doesn't have guaranteed rates-of-return so I'm wondering if paying off the mortgage faster is a safer play.

Any thoughts/advice would be appreciated. The ""prime directive"" and the flowchart in the sidebar doesn't make any mention of paying off your mortgage early, so that's why I asked. Thanks for your help!",finance

investing,Initial Claims &amp; Some Weakness in Unemployment,"It's rather amazing after a full year of multiple expansion across markets how price action completely dictates sentiment on here. With that said, you wouldn't know that the economic data has been grinding lower over the past year. But the market really doesn't care about that, and hasn't all year. In fairness, nothing has fallen off a cliff by any means, and things do seem to be chugging along.

The bull argument is that it's just a temporary slowdown that will see a recovery, and this is backed by the idea that the trade war will simmer down or at least, not escalate further, and that the fed's actions have helped to prevent further stagnation. YOY corporate earnings comps also get a bit easier in 2020.  FWIW, this take could totally be the correct one for 2020, although I think a lot of arguments can be made that this has already been priced in by markets.

# Initial Unemployment Claims.... Rising? Time To Get Out?

One of the most important parts of any economy of course is employment. We've been beaten over our heads regarding how great the labor markets are. Most macro economists however will tell you that labor ***tends*** to lag a little bit, although I see it more as a coincident economic indicator. The most popular unemployment data series are reported on a lag because the information and data takes a long time to compile. Additionally, [unemployment data series are subject to major revisions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/21/jobs-u-s-employment-501-000-lower-than-believed-after-revisions/2076069001/) as data often gets revised after the fact.

As a result, I personally look to the [initial claims data series](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA). It's a noisy data series that comes out weekly, but when you smooth it, it becomes very similar to broad unemployment, except it comes out much quicker and isn't subject to revisions. Basically, it's a great indicator on the strength and **direction** of the economy. See my link below this for a visual on the signal.

[**Time to Sell?**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ICSA/8zmZV9Jo-Time-to-sell-based-off-initial-unemployment-claims/)

To track this, I take exponential moving averages of initial claims of 26 weeks and 52 weeks (6 months vs. 1 year). When the short term signal is rising faster than the long term signal, then it's a strong sign of the momentum in this index, which is very strongly subject to momentum.

This signal crossed for the first time since september 2007 this week, and it top-ticked markets during the previous two recessions. Going back further, labor market momentum IS the economy, and tends  and has a long history of indicating when things are about to head south. There are a lot of obvious economic reasons for this. Employment is reflexive... when people are gainfully employed, they can service their personal debt, they can purchase more goods, and also make more investment into their 401k's / pensions. This all feeds back into the economy and markets in a positive feedback loop. The problem is that it also works in reverse. When unemployment is rising, you start to see greater defaults, more hoarding of savings (reduced spending in the economy) and reduced investment.

There ARE a few false positives. Most notably in 1995, but also a few short term spikes as well (2005 and 2017).  It muddled around a bit in 2006 as well before things hit the fan later in 2007. The short term spikes are related to hurricanes. So obviously... you have to account for that. But right now, there are no hurricanes and nothing that would indicate anything exogenous.

**I find that using this signal works best when combined with other signals:**

* An easy one is only paying attention to initial claims after a yield curve inversion (which is where we are at now).
* I also like to look at other employment data series that aren't set on so much of a lag (such as official unrate or nonfarm payrolls). ISM employment has also dropped significantly in the last 2-3 months, and was only weaker one time in the last 10 years (Jan 2016).
* Future Capex and CEO confidence tend to have a bit of a correlation with employment. IF CEO's are not confident and are not planning to spend capex $, then they likely will not be hiring as many employees. If companies are not in growth mode and are moreso in balance sheet protection mode, this collective behavior will influence hiring and firing activity and the economy as a whole. Both of these expectations are broadly negative right now. 

# What Should I Do If this Continues to Rise?

First off, this is still a noisy signal. I wouldn't necessarily do anything drastic, but keep an eye on initial claims over the next few weeks and months. IF you were to do anything drastic in 2006 for example, you would have gotten hurt pretty significantly as markets continued to rise and inflation continued to rise before the GFC hit the fan. Currently, even though this crossed, the moving average crossover I use here as a momentum signal is somewhat arbitrary, so you will want to see rising initial claims here over the next few weeks and months (just note that the data is somewhat volatile week to week, but trends over longer time periods).

Second off, **if** this does continue to rise, I can't tell anyone here how to manage their investments. But I can say that trying to do things like short the market is a good way to be highly stressed out and emotional, and also get their face ripped off in bear market rallies (if this is what happens). I think the best advice anyone would have is to have a plan for how you will handle an inevitable bear market in advance. This will help to prevent emotional distress, which is important.     If you're extremely long-term focused, just buying and holding is a perfectly acceptable strategy. Some may want to hold a little more cash to make some purchases on the way down.

r/personal finance would tell you that you should make sure you have an emergency fund set up (job losses are the real risk during a recession or bear market). The standard play over the past 50 years is to move more $ into treasuries and low risk assets, although even those have some risk (inflation, and timing the recovery).

Overall, do your own research and try to have some rules and boundaries set up if you're actively managing your investments. Be patient, and pare down risk as you see fit.",finance
financialindependence,3 Years Deep: Path to FI for DI1K household in HCOL area.,"**TL;DR** - Family in the early stages of FI pursuit. It's cool to see progress and visualize actual savings rate in relation to projections of needed funds to retire at different ages. Here's a fun chart: https://i.imgur.com/gd7yAzB.png?1

My spouse and I have always been good about spending within our means and staying out of unnecessary debt, but we didn't start seriously saving for retirement until last year. Prior to 2018, we were putting very little towards retirement and mostly focused on paying off student loans and saving to buy a home. As we got into the FI movement, we realized that we had to make some major financial changes if we wanted to retire before 70 (we're in our early 30s now). Some changes we made:

* We dramatically increased our savings rate in retirement accounts.
* I changed jobs from an employer with no 401k option to a new one that both had a 401k and a company match.
* We bought a home this year that fits our needs at a price well below the industry ""standard"" for what households should be able to afford (monthly payments are 16% of gross household income).
* We actually reduced the rate at which we are paying off student loans. We're still paying a sizable amount, but at a fixed 3.5% interest rate, it's not as urgent to pay them off ASAP.
* Once hitting 4 months of expenses in high yield savings, we're putting additional money into our Roth IRAs. 

None of these things are earth shattering revelations, but FIRE isn't complicated. It's just a math game. You figure out what you need &amp; want, how much that will cost, and what it takes to get there. 

The chart I linked above is a visualization that shows estimated retirement savings amounts needed over the next 5 years to expect to retire at different ages. In 2017, my spouse and I were on track to retire at 70. While it was cool to know we won't be living on cat food in our extreme old age, it's still depressing to think of working a 9 to 5 for that long. Today, we've accelerated to be on track to retire at 64! Our reach goal is retirement at 50.

In case you're curious, here are the assumptions behind the chart:

* 8% nominal average annual market growth
* 2% average annual inflation rate
* We went with the 4% withdrawal rule (soooo risky, I know r/fijerk)
* For the sake of simplicity, our FIRE number is based on our current annual expenses with the assumption that we will be trading a mortgage payment for increased travel and medical costs
* Our FIRE number also has an implicit buffer that we will be moving from HCOL area to MCOL area when we retire

If you've made it this far, congratulations! May you have a great holiday season and keep at it until you can go fuck yourselves.",finance
personalfinance,Interest rate fell again (Ally) Anyone else they feel punished for saving money?,"It just seems that with the way the rates have been falling, ever since the recession, the benefits of saving money is nill vs inflation.  It sucks because as a kid we (well I) was always told and taught all the benefits of compounding interest and how saving money would pay off and be worth more than what you put in, and was financially the smart thing to do.

Now it seems if you dont put money into the market in some way its  effectively losing value.  when i opened an online savings account in like 06 i was getting 5% (etrade) and it was awesome.  I am very risk averse when it comes to my personal savings, so not putting money in the market for the last few years has effectively screwed me a bit. 

Anyone else like this? And if so how do you stay ahead of inflation without risking it?  The only way ive managed to find a way is buying a house and selling after 5-10 years for the profit and buying again, but you cant just do that forever",finance
personalfinance,$12k stolen from credit card (a decade ago). Need advice,"Hi, I would appreciate it if some of you could give me any ideas of alternatives to help my dad. Please read.

About a decade ago, my older sister was given a credit card by my dad. She was still in high school, so the credit card was linked to my dad's account with a credit limit of **$12 000 CAD.**

Her boyfriend at that time stole her credit card and spent all of the $12k on buying stuff like a PS3. When she found out, she came home crying and we decided to **report to the police**. The police office asked us to fill a form and a brief summary of the situation. They told us that they will get to it as soon as they can. Unfortunately, it seems like they won't be helping us here.

Now, my dad gets calls from the bank every now and then, but he never answers since he doesn't have the money because of his **low income**.

I am not very knowledgeable on these things, but I heard that the bank will someday come to our house and take all of our belongings. Is that true?

What can I do to help my dad in this situation?

1. I'm about a year away from graduating from a bachelor's degree in Computer science. I'm thinking of saving money after getting a job to repay the debt. Interest rates can go up to 19.9%, so I would have to pay off **over $70k**.

personalfinance,Appeal to IRS to waive penalties and fees,"Hello,

This October I received a IRS notification claiming I owed 12,000$ dollars for under reporting my 2017 taxes.  In 2017 I stepped down from ownership responsibilities from a lawn and landscape company I co-owned and while attempting to leave the company my business partner requested I stay on for another season as an hourly employee.  I received a regular weekly pay check, had normal and regular federal and state deductions, and filed a personal tax return with my wife.  My business partner filed a k-1 with the government listing me as a full partner still and receiving 1/2 of the left over money from the year.  ($66,000)  Fast forward 2 years later and my wife has a panic attack at the $12,000 bill we received.  The IRS sent us a tax bill for $9,000 with an additional $3,000 in under reporting penalties and later fees along with interest.  When I contacted my accountant who filed the 2017 taxes, he is expecting an additional 3-4 thousand in federal penalties along with state.  The good news, my former partner did fork over the $33,000.

Is there a method to reach out to the IRS to appeal all the penalties and fees.  I know it is a law they have to charge the interest, so I do not have hope to have that waived.  Is there a high or low probability of getting the penalties and interest waived.  I can document that I never received the income until early November 2019 and I was never forwarded a copy of the company K-1 when it was filed in 2018.

- FY 2018 :  Predicted Net Income = $85 - $100 million.   Actual = $13 million.  
*“To say that fiscal 2018 was a challenge would be an understatement, quite frankly anything that could go wrong, did go wrong and then some.” “[W]hile fiscal 2018 was challenging…we have many reasons to believe that we have entered fiscal 2019 poised for improved revenue growth and margins”*

- FY 2019: Predicted Net Income = $43 - $63 million.  Actual =   (-)$12.3 million (loss).
*“Clearly, 2019 was a difficult and disappointing year, but I am pleased with how we are positioned for 2020.”*

- FY 2020: : Predicted Net Income = $32 - $50 million. Actual = Lol

Most importantly to this whole thing, the stock price has completely diverged from reality.

**Legal:**

So they have some unique problems which I found in public court documents and no one else seems to have covered. These are all ALLEGATIONS only. They are not even my allegations. I will be linking to and quoting directly from court documents. Rev Group is totally innocent until proven guilty. They are still assholes tho.

- In a case Lemanski v Rev Group (anonfile.com/PfSecbH1n1/Lemanski_V_Rev_Group_pdf) a former employee alleges that he was in a meeting in November 2018 in which *“(Chief Operating Officer) Tom Philips stated Rev Group, Inc. ‘made up’ the $19,000,000 reported tariff Cost Increase impact”* because *“Rev Group, Inc. ‘needed something to tell the investors’ as a partial reason as to why Rev Group, Inc was not achieving their forecasted performance results”* Lemanski *“intended to report his concerns to the FTC”*. He was then told by a supervisor that *“If it were me, I would just focus on my commodity and move on”* Rev group then allegedly fucked with his disability leave time and he was allegedly “illegally terminated”. Allegedly. Maybe.
 
- In another case Rev Group is suing their former VP of Bus Sales (anonfile.com/p6T7ceHcn7/Rev_Group_v_Scheuler_pdf)  Mr. Scheuler, where they allege that he sent an email and resigned immediately. He then got a job at Rev Group’s competitor Forest River in the same position that he was at Rev. They allege that he took his Rev electronic devices with him, and that he *""downloaded a minimum of 1700 Rev Group Company files""*. Rev alleges that Mr. Scheuler *“intends to provide this misappropriated information to Forest River to enable them to unlawfully compete in their shared marketplace”*. Rev's bus dealerships are also *“expressing concerns (that Scheuler) will turn over their confidential information to Forest River.”* Allegedly. Maybe.

Don't forget the MULTIPLE class action lawsuits regarding their IPO claims vs. what a clusterfuck the company has turned out to be. Sign up for [Pacer](https://www.PACER.gov) and see for yourself.

**Employees:**

Let's check [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/REV-Group-Reviews-E1272198.htm) to see what it’s like to work at Rev. I read every review of Rev on Glassdoor, and you should too. I found common themes throughout the years. Basically, everyone is saying that it’s running as well as a monkey fucking a football. They keep saying that management have no idea what they’re doing and don’t listen to the guys on the floor who have actually worked in this field for years. They say that HR is a clusterfuck and fires people all the time for no reason. They are short staffed with constant turn over, and pushing exhausted and undertrained employees to work overtime to try and get shit off the line. They claim that the products are made shitty-ly with shitty parts. They say that the company only cares about stock price.

**Stock Price:**

Speaking of only caring about stock price, despite their shrinking margins and disaster of a balance sheet, Rev Group has continued to buyback assloads of shares and issue fat diviez, instead of reinvesting that money back into this shit business.

- Since March of 2018, Rev has repurchased around $61,600,000 mm worth of shares. (FY 2018 = $53.3 million @ average of $16.47. FY 2019 = 2019 $8.3 million @ average of $11.62)

- The past 3 fiscal years, they issued over $31,700,000 mm worth of dividends.

They have issued as much money in dividends alone in the past 3 years as the company has made in net income in the past 3 years. JFC.

**Debt:**

They have a absolute fuckload of debt. They have a loan and a line of credit. They’ve been robbing Peter to pay Paul for years.

- As of this last 10k, they have $175,000,000 mm due on their loan by April, 2022. On October 18, 2019, they amended the Term Loan Agreement to raise the maximum leverage ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 from 3.50 to 1.00. Cause they need more leverage. Oh goody.

- They also owe just under $125,000,000 mm on their credit. And they have an additional $77,000,000 mm of long term debt.

So the company, whose net income for the past 3 years has totaled $32 million dollars (and LOST MONEY this FY) is going to pay off that $175 million dollar loan in the next 2.5 years. Yeah, No. They’re going to have to borrow more money to pay off the money that they borrowed, all while barely turning a profit, if even at all. Rev needs Dave Ramsey

**Ratings:**

Don’t take my word for it, let’s see what [the chucklefucks on Wall Street have to say.](https://trentdailytimes.com/2019/12/19/rev-group-nyserevg-rating-lowered-to-hold-at-valuengine-updated.html)
December 10: ValuEngine cut shares of Rev Group from buy to hold. December 15: Goldman Sachs downgraded REV Group to “Sell”. December 16:  Morgan Stanley Downgrades to “Underweight”. December 18: Zacks Downgrades Rev to a “Sell”.
The company has a consensus rating of ""Hold"" and an average target price of $10.44.

**Other Shit:**

54% of Rev shares are owned by American Industrial Partners, AIP. They have them by the balls and are probably the ones playing fucky doody with the share price. They haven't sold any shares since it's IPO. It's in their interest alone that REV keeps paying out money to shareholders via fat divvy's and stonks buybacks, and don't reinvest the money into the business or have any plan to pay their mountain of debt. Members of this investment group reportedly did this fuckery with an industrial mining company they ran into the ground in the early 2000's by just boosting stock value and letting the underlying company implode. Allegedly. Maybe.

There’s also two blurbs in their 10k which I want to point out:

- *“During fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, (Rev) reimbursed its primary equity holder (AIP) for out of pocket expenses in the amount of $1.4 million, $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively.”*  I don’t understand why they reimburse AIP for expenses when they don’t reimburse any other shareholders. Also, what expenses? This is probably 100% normal and cool and I'm just a pleb.

- *“Certain production facilities and offices for two of (REV’s) subsidiaries are ****leased from related parties owned by certain members of management****. Rent expense under these arrangements during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $1.9 million, $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively.”* I don’t know what a kickback is. I’m not calling this a kickback. This isn't a kickback. I don’t understand this at all. I’m sure it’s 100% legal and normal.

I’ve look deeply at all their competitors in this space ($WGO, $THO, etc). None of them are even remotely as fucked up as REV, including their debt ratios, share buybacks, actually making fucking money, employment practices, etc.

With all that in mind. I'm tired. There's more if you go look for yourself. I'll leave you with these words of wisdom:

- *“My entire career has always been about making money, which in turn directly impacts shareholder value. Revenue is a nice metric, but there are a lot of different ways to make money other than just growing the top line. You should know that at REV, it’s all about making money”* – CEO Timmy Sullivan

Disclaimer: Everything here is just my opinion, man. Don’t believe a word I say. I’m angry and dumb. My numbers might be off, who knows. Do the fucking research for yourself. Don’t trade on this since fundamentals don’t matter anymore at this fucking company. If anyone wants to rip any of this off an claim it as their own, be my guest.",finance

personalfinance,Unsure if I should apply for a 2nd credit card before applying for car loan in Feb/March? Will it still affect my score 3 months from now?,"Hello all, this is my first post here and Im hoping someone could give me a little advice. 
I plan to apply for a car loan in the next 2 or 3 months. I currently have 2 credit cards and a credit score that fluctuates between 782-795. One of my cards is an older Capital One card I used to help repair my credit years ago and it only has a $500 limit. My 2nd (Chase) card has a $5300 limit. I'd like to apply for a 2nd one with a higher limit, similar to my chase card. I want to do that for 3 reasons: 1)More available credit to fall back on in the case of an emergency. 2)higher amount of available credit might be enough to push my score a little closer to 800. 3) Once I get a car loan, I'm assuming getting a 2nd CC card with a higher limit will be harder to get approved for.

Here's my question: Would it make more sense to apply for the card now and hope my score bounces back from the hard inquiry by Feb or March? OR, should I wait, get the car loan first and then apply for a 2nd card?  If I choose the latter, Im guessing I might end up getting a card with a lower limit. I'm leaning towards applying for a 2nd CC, im just nervous it will make it harder to get a good interest rate on a car? Is there any reason I should not apply for a 2nd card now/first?

Thanks for reading!

Edit: In case anyone reading this has a similar question... I did apply for a 2nd card today, got approved and my score only dropped 3 points. Thanks all! 👍🏻",finance

personalfinance,Sanity Check on Paying Mortgage Points - am I Crazy?,"I'll try to keep this brief!  

We own a house and we're likely to sell it and move in about three years.  We might go a little longer but no shorter.  We will need extra cash over the next three years, so we're looking at a mortgage on the house to get us by.  

We've been offered $329,000 mortgage at 3.75% interest rate, or we can pay points up to $11,679 to lower the rate all the way to 2.5%.  If my math is right, after three years, the difference in interest paid between 2.5% and 3.75% is $12,152 and we'd have paid down the principal loan amount by $4,099 more at 2.5%.  So it seems like we'd be saving money over three years by paying the points and having a 2.5% loan.  And if we end up keeping the house a couple years longer, then it just becomes more favorable. 
 
Right?  Am I nuts?  It doesn't feel right - why wouldn't anyone do this?  I did read up on several previous posts about mortgage points but I'm still stuck thinking it's the right thing to do and feeling like I must be missing something critical.",finance

Debt: Student loans= $10294.95 at a variable interest rate, steadily decreasing this past year. Most recent posted 3.81%, daily interest rate of $1.07. I have been making bi-weekly payments of $200 (increased to $260 today), and my employer pays $200/month. My monthly due os $511.xx.Car Payment= $10053.95 at 2.39%. I have been paying $245/bi-weekly (just reduced to $200 today). Monthly payment is not due until 6/27/20 for $481.41 as I am paid ahead.

I have about $24,000 between several savings accounts and 1 CD that matures in January. APY vary between 0.51% and 1.7%. The CD is 2.35%. I have $125,000 in my 401k (I'm 36 if that matters) and another $3500 in an investment account.

I pay $1400/rent (boyfriend's mortgage) and take home an average of $4100/month)

I recently started reading Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover, and per his standard I should cash out and pay off my loans. It seems to make sense, but I'm wondering how these numbers truly work out to be. I'm hesitant to cash everything in and be so low on emergency funds. I'm considering just paying off my car and keeping my student loans to continue to receive the additional benefit of $200/month from my employer. But is that smart? I feel like it's a stupid greedy move, and it really does not benefit me financially, but does it? With all the numbers worked out am I gaining or losing on that front?

personalfinance,Using 401k to pay off debt - advice requested,"Hi PF folks, 

Looking for advice or constructive thoughts about my situation. I’ve slowly fallen deeper and deeper into credit card debt. I’m paying my bills and staying afloat but I am looking at pulling money from 401k to pay for a good portion of debt off. 

I’m 40 years old with a small 401k balance. I was laid off several years ago and cashed out my old employer 401k to live off it for about 3.5 years. Started new with my current company, but at 3% contribution and 3% company match (its max) it’s only at $17,700. 

Below are the details of my income/debt.

**Income:**

Salary: $54k annually + 4K bonus $2572/bi-weekly paycheck (1480 take home)(qtrly bonus add $350 take home)

Perdiem: $100-200/mo I work from home and occasionally travel for work. I get paid for personal car usage. It’s a reimbursed expense, but most of it is pocketed

**Debt:**

CC #1: 10k balance 20k limit $250-$300/mo 21.49%

CC #2: $6,100 balance 7k limit $200-$250/mo 26.65% rate. (I reached out to company to reduce rate. Was granted temporary reduction for 7 months. That term is now over) 

Car loan: $2488 balance/ $382mo 7 more months

Student/Fed Loan: $16k balance/ $280mo

**Other bills:**

Rent/ $950 my portion (reduced by 100 to help pay phone bill)

Car insurance: $98/mo

Phone: $160 family 5 lines

Gas: $50

Electricity: $100-$300

529 savings: $11,700 balance $100/mo contribution

Gym: $40/mo for 2 memberships. 

**Option 1:**

I’m looking to pull 10K out of the retirement fund to apply it to the CC and car loan. This will free up the $600-700/month to help pay down the 10k balance of CC #1.  

**Option 2:**

I pull out $6k to pay off CC #1. This frees up $200/month to apply to CC#1. In June when the car is paid off, I’ll be able to apply more towards the card. 

In both options above, I’d also use my tax return to reduce CC# 1. It’s typically a $2k-$3k return (will probably be less as penalty for early withdrawals.)  

**My reasons:**

Home ownership: I’m looking to purchase a home in 2021. I could budget better and pay off my debt, but it would still take a significant amount of time to do that. Reducing debt to income ratio would greatly improve my chance of getting approved for a VA home loan. 

Improve credit score: I have a credit score of 720+ even with the high credit card usage. I know reducing the usage will improve it. 

Crypto: Don’t kill me for this… I will still contribute to 401k, but know there’s greater reward in the crypto space. I believe I can invest less in crypto than my 401k and earn much more towards retirement. At 40 years old and a 401k at less than 20k, I’m willing to take the risk. I have invested in a mining rig that brings in crypto. 

Lack of savings: I can usually keep a small safety net of 1k-2k in savings. But as of late, I’ve had to dip into it to pay bills; especially during summer when AC brought electricity bill to $300/mo. I want to start building up my savings account again so I have a larger emergency fund. 

Free up money: My paychecks go straight to bills and it’s a crappy feeling. 

Any positive advice would be helpful. I’m not interested in debt consolidation at this point. It’s just moving debt around and won’t help me get approved for a VA Home loan by 2021.",finance

Trading,From a traders prospective-Recession 2020/2021?,"As we enter a new year I can not help but, to notice the Federal Reserve continuing to pump money into the Repo Markets the same money that they just got done removing in the past two years with Q.T. As more money is injected into the system it raises the question.. Have we just managed to inflate one bubble after another from the .com to the housing and now could it simply just be a equities bubble maybe something in relation to the great depression? With all this cheap money that corporations have barrow'd for stock buy backs that now has the market not only on it longest bull run but, also the P\\E ratio gap on the S&amp;P continues to grow. New trends/ maybe not new but, have gained the title of normal practice have emerge as far as IPO's coming into the market which are what we call Paradise companies and their price rockets up based mainly on revenue/growth though their business model shows no ability to be profitable. Repo markets rate continue to show something under the water brewing. With everyone focused on a slowing world economy and the United States G.D.P. continuing as expected to slow this is what I see gathering most of the attention as a cause for a recession.  How has Q.E. that was once considered last resort now just a basic monetary practice around the world? I believe the real risk is not based on one thing like a slowing economy ect but a multitude current events and past events that have allowed us to put our selves in a horrible situation. Any color of swan other then a white swan is likely to bring the whole thing down. For a long time now its been damage control and propping up markets. Its like diluting orange juice with water and expecting it to taste like concentrated orange juice. We all know how this truly ends and its not good and our manipulation has only prolonged and made matters 1000x worse. We try now to avoid a recession like the black plague cause we know how bad we have made it. Its tough to imagine what the world will look like in the next 10 years but, my money is on that it will not look better then today. So given the fact that interest rates are so low those looking to retire would normally look to move their money into more stable investments such as bonds but, are now practically forced to keep their money in equities due to such low yield in bonds which further prop's the market up. Its sad to say but, people are not waiting to retire at a later age now days out of sheer boredom but, out of desperation to try to obtain some feeling of security that now eludes most people that should have retired long ago. I fear retirement will be considered a myth by the time I reach my time to retire. Maybe the solution to this problem is to have a never ending bull market, it appears that we continue to try to fool our selves into believing its possible. This so called capitalism looks far different from what it once did with to big to fail companies and banks. If the small mom and pop shop can fail then so should the big corp's and if their failure is considered to big of a risk on the economy then they should be broken up. If you feel forced to bail them out its cause you/we have allowed it to get that way. I am for capitalism just not the kind that picks winners and losers based on how disruptive it would be on society/economy if they were to fail. In the end hyperinflation or lack of confidence to pay back out debt will end this shopping spree yet we will continue to try to out smart our own human nature. The only thing I can think that has really let us get this far in debt was the housing crash becoming a world economy problem rather then just a United States problem. It is all of this that has me asking like most traders. Not if but,  when the bubble pop's..... Then what? Then what?",finance

personalfinance,Question Regarding new 529 rules and student loan interest deduction,"With the new budget passed for next year, there has been a lot of discussion of the changes to the tax code. One thing that affects me the most (although admittedly not much) is the provision allowing one to pay off up to $10K (lifetime limit) of student loans from a 529 plan. I live in Wisconsin, which allows me to deduct $3280 this year from my state income taxes for a contribution to the state's 529 plan. So over about three years, I should be able to contribute to, and pay from, a 529 to reach that $10K limit. I am in the 6.27% tax bracket, so this year's deduction would be worth $205.66 to me.


I have a substantial loan balance of ~$175K, and am pretty well locked into paying ~$9K/year, most of it interest, for the next 7 years until I qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (another whole thread altogether). As it is now, I qualify for the full student loan interest deduction on my federal taxes, which allows me to deduct up to $2500/year of interest from my federal taxes. I am in the 22% bracket, so that deduction is worth $550 to me.


So here's my question: My understanding is that under the new provision in the law, any interest paid with a 529 plan would not qualify for the student loan interest deduction. So if I withdraw $2500 from a 529 to help pay my loans in a given year, what is the status of the federal deduction? Would it be:


1. Since even assuming all of that withdrawal paid for interest, I would still have more than $2500 remaining in interest payments that year, so I can still claim the full deduction.

2. I am unable to claim any deduction at all that year.

3. Some pro-rated deduction in between.


Depending on the answer, it may be worth withdrawing $10K slowly over say three years, withdrawing the full $9K in one year and $1K the next, or not bothering with the 529 at all unless I plan to transfer it to my unborn son later.


Thanks in advance for any help.",finance

Macy’s and Fedex both reported bleak results but the mood was improved when **Micron ($MU)** posted solid first quarter results on Wednesday, delivering good profitability and positive free cash flow. The numbers were down, year on year, but CEO Sanjay Mehrotra called it the ""cyclical bottom"" and went on to say “Our significantly improved competitive position, dramatically stronger product portfolio, structurally higher profitability and investment-grade balance sheet position Micron very well to drive long-term shareholder value”.   Micron is currently valued at just under 18x trailing earnings.  If this is the cyclical bottom, then that looks very attractive.

**Growth stocks (SmileDirectClub and The RealReal)**

&amp;nbsp;

**SmileDirectClub ($SDC)**, the online start up disrupting the orthodontic industry, jumped 10% after reporting that 21 out of 22 class action plaintiffs ""have voluntarily withdrawn their claims"" against the company.  

(Please be aware that this is a HIGH RISK highly speculative stock.)

But to understand the value of the company you must balance the huge potential opportunity that faces SmileDirectClub against the pending legislation that still could impose harsher regulations on online dentistry companies.
It is estimated that there are 124 million potential orthodontic customers in the U.S. and half a billion worldwide. That's a total addressable market of $245 billion in the U.S. and $700 billion in the rest of the world. That is a global TAM of $945 billion compared to SmileDirectClub's current market cap of $3.1 billion.
The outcome of litigation processes remains extremely difficult to call. However the report this week suggests the balance of risk and reward has shifted in favour of SDC. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The RealReal ($REAL)** got a boost this week from Susan Anderson at B. Riley who said that the company is the ""the leader in the modern-day luxury consignment market whose model is disrupting traditional consignment shops""

The RealReal offers a marketplace for luxury items that has resonated with younger customers who see the value opportunity of owning luxury goods for just a short time while also appreciating the ethical aspects of recycling.

The company reported strong results last month with sales up 55% but the stock price was hit by a CNBC report on negative customer reviews and counterfeit merchandise.  The stock is still down 19% with a market capitalization of $1.6 billion.

That valuation (5.5x sales) looks cheap compared to growth and outlook. The company has responded to claims of fake merchandise.  Its processes are industry leading and, at the end of the day, it offers a guarantee for authenticity so customers should be reassured.

However the bottom line for me is that the total addressable market for luxury goods in the US is massive at $198 billion. That means the risk return still looks favourable with RealReal in the early stages of growth. The potential downside is (as always) 100% but that compares to huge potential upside given the current gross merchandise volume of just $1 billion.

It is encouraging to see analysts at B. Riley seem to agree.

&amp;nbsp;

**Value Stocks (Skechers)**

&amp;nbsp;

Skechers also got a boost after Deutsche Bank joined Barron’s and Argus in backing the stock.  Skechers' brands have also been resonating with influencers and key opinion leaders globally even if it has failed so far to resonate with investors. 

In some ways the brand lacks the macho appeal of Nike and Under Armour.  However, Skechers has grown over the past 20 years to become the third-largest global footwear brand by revenue, after Nike and Adidas. 

Analysts estimate Skechers’ to post earnings growth on pace with Nike Nike trades at about 38 times earnings compared with 20 times for Sketchers.

A discount is appropriate but 50% off looks attractive. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Pharma (Axsome)**

&amp;nbsp;

**Axsome's ($AXSM)** new clinical drug the blockbuster, AXS-05, has reported significant improvements in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  47% of patients with MDD achieve complete remission, as opposed to the 16% of patients taking the placebo.
Depression treatments are one of the largest healthcare markets in the U.S., with around 7.1% of adults -- or 17.3 million -- Americans affected each year.  Estimated at USD 15.60 Billion in 2018.

And there's not a lot of competition.

Axsome's stock has surged by almost 4,000% since the beginning of 2019, pushing the stock from a $93 million market cap into the $3.5 billion range. But it could have further upside potential due to AXS-05's success, little competition and the large addressable market.

&amp;nbsp;

**Insider Buying (IIPR)**

&amp;nbsp;

**Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. ($IIPR)** CEO continues to snap up stock, another $140,000 this week.

IIPR is a cannabis REIT acquiring and leasing medical marijuana cultivation and processing facilities. That’s lucrative because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level.  Its weighted-average lease length is 15.5 years, with an average return on invested capital of 13.6%. In other words, Innovative Industrial Properties will see a complete payback on its investments in a little over five years, but should have steady and predictable cash flow for more than a decade.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, Barron's recent ”Best Stocks of the Decade” article has some predictable names in there along with **United Rentals ($URI)** which is perhaps more of a surprise for some.  Personally I've liked URI for a long time. It's a market leader with economies of scale (network effects) but its overall market share remains low (about 13%) and the economic benefits to customers of switching from ownership to rental (less idle time, better range of appliance, lower cost, no debt on balance sheet etc) should drive growth for years to come. Despite this the stock still has a TTM PE of just 11.6.  Hard to justify a valuation so low.

MachineLearning,[D] Accuracy metric in LSTM not considers time offset for multivariate time-series classification?,"So this is a kind of complex question, so I hope I formulate it good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a human activity detection task that binary classifies if a user does a specific action or not. For me, it is enough if the system detects the action **within 3 seconds** after it initially happened.

I am using smartphone sensor data with a frequency of 50Hz, which I then combine with a windowing approach with windows of 1sec length and 0.5sec overlap (i.e. I calculate statistics such as \`mean\` or \`std\` for each sensor data for a set time of 1 sec, store these in ""windows"" and overlap these ""windows"" by 0.5sec).

For LSTM to learn longterm data I use 5 such windows as timesteps (which would represent 3sec of data) and shift each timestep by one window. So the shape of the data fed to the model is:

\[13000 instances, 5 timesteps, 21 features\]

Now let's consider the following case of a finished classification of such a model where all of the large squares in the image are labeled as an event, but only some are classified as such:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bcscy38nvz541.png?width=1976&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=034919109a9daee0d7dc6bc21ee1851c08dfdda1

As I understand it, LSTM using the \`binary\_crossentropy\` loss function and \`accuracy\` as a metric in Keras will evaluate the results in a way that the above accuracy would be 2 out of 5 correctly classified instances. However, the accuracy, in this case, should be 100% because my goal is to detect the event within 3 sec, so as long one of these 5 timesteps are labeled as the event I should get 100% accuracy.

**So my questions are:**

1. Do I understand the metric correctly and is this a problem for my current goal?
2. If yes, how could I overcome this evaluation problem?",technology

personalfinance,Question about 10 day initial funding period with Capital One savings account to receive signup bonus?,"I received an e-mail recently that offered a $200 signup bonus if you move to the Capital One 360 performance savings account by 12/31/19 and keep at least $10,000 for at least 90 days. I had/have Ally which was the same interest rate they offered, but I figured why not get the bonus. 

The terms state ""You must deposit at least $10k in new money within 10 days of enrollment, the Initial Funding Period."" I applied for the account on 12/17 and hooked it up to Ally for the transfer. On 12/20 they deposited a few cents into my Ally account to confirm the transfer, but I didn't get a chance to confirm it on Capital One's website until after work/close of business yesterday. It says Capital One takes 4 business days to transfer the money. So if I opened the account on 12/17, I have until 12/27 as the initial funding period to go through. With the holidays coming up next week, I'm not sure I have four full business days before 12/27 for the money to reach my account so I'm worried I don't qualify for the bonus. 


Does anyone know if the initial funding period means the money has to clear first as a deposit or if it's in the process of being transferred I will still qualify? Normally it would be fine, but with Christmas next week I assume normal business days are cut. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Capital One Quietly Changes Savings Rates,"**TL;DR:** Capital One is doing some sketchy things regarding interest rates on savings accounts and is not very open with customers (ex. doesn't notify customers when lowering rates, created a new account type with a higher rate leaving existing customers with old accounts and lower rates, no longer providing rate information to third-party financial software, etc.).

I'm not sure if this will be of much interest to others, but I thought I'd share something I noticed for those of you that are kind of like me and appreciate some of the finer details. I apologize if this gets kind of long, but I wanted to include all of the relevant details.

There was a post on here a while ago about how Capital One introduced new ""360 Performance"" accounts with higher rates than the previous ""360 Savings"" accounts, but they didn't automatically convert the old accounts over to new ones to get the higher rates, nor did they bother informing people with old accounts. The old accounts had (and still have) a rate of 1%, while the new ones were I believe 1.8% at the time. I had already moved over to Ally a while ago for their higher rates, but at the time when I saw this, the Capital One 360 Performance rate was slightly higher than Ally (I think 1.7% vs. 1.8%). I got a Christmas bonus earlier this month and decided since I still had my Capital One account, I'd put it in one of the new 360 Performance accounts for the slightly higher rate.

More recently, I happened to notice that the rate on my 360 Performance account had changed from 1.8% to 1.7%. I'm not overly concerned about the amount of the change, but I didn't like the fact that I never got an e-mail or anything informing me of the change (ex. if I was notified of the change and it was a lot more, I could have easily moved it over to Ally, but without a notification, who knows how long I'd leave it in an account earning a lower rate simply because I wasn't aware of the change). Ally has been pretty good about sending an e-mail whenever they change rates, and while it isn't great news that my rate is going down, it is good to at least know about it. However, I realize not all banks are this ""open"" about notifying customers of these changes, and apparently Capital One falls into this category.

However, I also have my accounts setup in Mint. When my rate changes at Ally, usually Ally sends me an e-mail ahead of time, then Mint will also send me an e-mail when it updates my accounts and detects the change. This (in theory) is helpful so even if a bank (ex. Capital One) doesn't inform me of the change, at least Mint will detect it and let me know. I was kind of curious why I never got a notification from Mint about the Capital One rate change, but figured maybe Mint didn't ""see"" the account before they lowered the rate.

Fast-forward to today, I was looking at things in Mint and happened to notice something where it shows the information on each of my accounts (account name, type, rate, etc.). For Ally, it lists my rate as 1.59% on each of my savings accounts (they lowered rates yesterday, and I did get an e-mail from Ally yesterday and from Mint today). For my *old* Capital One 360 accounts (that I no longer use, but still have open) it lists my rate as 1.00%. For my *new* Capital One 360 Performance account, it lists my rate not as 1.7%, but as 0%. Then it kind of dawned on me... the reason I didn't get an e-mail from Mint about the rate change is probably because Capital One isn't providing them with my current rate.

So why would they choose not to provide Mint with my current rate? Well, that's probably what Mint uses to determine if my rate has changed and, if so, send me an e-mail to let me know about it. Perhaps Capital One doesn't want Mint to detect this change and let me know. It's obviously not due to technical limitations, since they were (and still are) providing Mint with my current rate on my *old* account.

This isn't really meant to be a post about ""this bank is better than that bank"" or ""this bank has 0.1% higher rates"". I'm not even really suggesting that Capital One is a ""bad"" bank, but I did want to point out some of their sketchy practices that I happened to notice. While I do want a bank with high/competitive rates on savings accounts, it would also be nice if they were open about rate changes (both higher and lower) and let customers know. However, there's a difference between not openly sending out information, and hiding information that was previously available.

**EDIT:** Just to clarify, I have no problem with the fact that they have lowered rates and I realize their rates are in line with others'. My problem is that they aren't very upfront about it and have even taken measures so other services can't detect when your rate changes (whether it be lowered or raised).",finance

Anyway, they called me the other day and said I'm on their ""preferred vendor"" list (big eye roll) and they want to upgrade me into a 2019 Cherokee at a lower rate because the 2020 models are coming in and the manufacturer is offering a lot of rebates on the 2019. Okay, I know that's a thing. But he said that I'd eat up the negative equity on my current car and come out with the same (or lower) loan principal at a lower interest rate.

Edit: Quick edit before I go in there. I do understand the concept of negative equity and the fact that I'm negative on the loan (i.e. trade value &gt; current remaining loan principal). I specifically asked the guy if the principal on my loan (not monthly payment, as another user pointed out) would go up and he told me no. That's the big piece that I'm skeptical about.

Edit #2: Yeah, so it turned out to be exactly what I (and the rest of you) assumed. Guy on the phone told me my principal balance wasn't going to change, and that just wasn't true. Monthly payments would've stayed the same or close, but principal most definitely would've gone up. Had a 5 minute convo w/ the salesman telling him ""listen, I know I'm not crazy - this can't be right"" and he confirmed. We laughed about it for a bit and I left.

I already have a healthy savings going which is where the majority of the bonus will go, but I also wanted to finish maxing out my Roth IRA for the year and put down some extra cash on my car loan. 

I have $900 left to deposit in the Roth this year (already deposited $5,100 in 2019). Normally this would be a no-brainer, but my returns in this account have been at an all time high for the last few months. 

I also have an outstanding car loan for a car I recently purchased with $16K remaining at a 4.9% interest rate. The loan term is 5 years and began in October 2019 but I plan to pay it off in closer to 3 years by making some periodic added down payments. I have a spreadsheet tracking the daily interest and savings from added payments and if I put $1,100 down now, it will save me about $250 in interest over the theoretical 5 year term.

I have dual citizenship in a foreign country through my parents (I was born in the US). My wife is American. At the moment, we are in a position where if we sold our house and used the proceeds to put the money in a bank account in this foreign country (where interest rates are high, as is inflation but the rates go up and down along with inflation so I am not too worried), we should be able to live comfortably off of interest alone. Being a citizen, I and my wife would be entitled to universal health care where we are (and can buy supplemental care inexpensively if needed). Another nice thing about where we would live is that it would be very easy and quite affordable to travel in Europe (or at least it is for the time being).

We would be able to travel back to the US a couple times a year, and would stay with friends and family while back here (and take some road trips). By age 59.5, our current retirement savings should have accumulated enough to allow us to retire and live in the US if we choose to do so.

The back story. My mom decided she wanted to get a masters degree in early childhood education. She has worked for Headstart since 1993. She has gone from teacher to teachers assistant several times, because we have moved. This time she was demoted to help her daughter-in-law keep her job. I believe back in 2011 she started her bachelors, and finished her master's degree within the next year or two after getting her bachelor's degree. She found this sweet deal that made it so she didnt have to pay an ounce of interest until she completed her masters. Well, then she decided she would make payments here and there, but she wasnt obligated to make payments. She just let intrest grow into this $180,000 bill. 

Now, to further this fun predicament, she has a masters degree in iowa online, and lives in illinois. So, her degree is usless, and more expensive than it needed to be anyway. It's also a student loan through, I believe, the federal government.

Not only does she not know how to get her degree useable in illinois, she doesnt want to leave her job, and keeps talking about how money is not a problem for her, because she gets by with what she has.

I do not have the money to pay my taxes in full. 
I enrolled in a payment plan for Maryland and thought I set up reoccurring payments from one of my checking accounts . Turns out this wasn’t the case and now I got a payment plan cancellation notice from Maryland. They now want everything in full.

personalfinance,[Ontario Canada] Accepted a job with a $20k/year raise that requires a vehicle. I'm currently in a Consumer Proposal so naturally got back high interest rates. I ended up buying the car anyways. Have a couple of questions,"My logic was that if I finance a cheap car, even at a super high interest rate because of my CP, I would be net positive because buying this car means an additional 20k in income/year, far exceeding the expenses+interest, especially after two years. I would have been crazy not to take it. The 20k doesn't include mileage reimbursement, plus I'll get some additional tax deductions with a T2200. I say this to save myself a little roasting in hopes you see where I'm coming from.

So I purchased a vehicle and while talking to the rep, he said typically at 13-14 months, with perfect payment history, it can be refinanced at a lower rate (as he obviously knows that's in my interest)

I live in Ontario Canada, and my consumer proposal ends in 24 months as of last week.

I have two questions:

1. Is it typical for people to be able to refinance at a little over a year? First time financing a vehicle, always bought used.

2. At 13-14 months, I'll still be in a CP. Even if I maintain perfect payments, can I meaningfully refinance at a lower rate, or will I need to wait until its over in 24 months to see my rates actually drop a good amount?

Thanks in advance. A quick note, I can't afford to buy used because the position I'm in doesn't pay the greatest so I don't have savings, hence why I was looking for a job. An extra 20k/year for a high interest loan on a cheap car sounded worth it to me and still does. It's not what I'm asking about. Just asking about the above. Thank you!",finance

Bitcoin,BTC Adoption and BTC Traitors,"Due to the banks evil monopoly on fiat, bitcoin was created.  
Well not entirely true , however not far from it. We can just say that people today earn less than they did just 10 years ago. Further so 20 years ago, this due to the hidden tax known as inflation. FED (the federal reserve) is in control and since the gold standard was removed, the value of the dollar has been sinking... Of course, more factors are at play but the fact remains that you have less of your paycheck today than what your parents had.  
We could at least agree that the government and the FED and all banks have been working hard to steal your earnings. Then we can agree that the governments and the banks are the enemy, and are in control of the system.  
Bitcoin is not like this, and was in fact created, not to steal your money, but to give you your control back. To help you exit the slavery.  
So why then, do we act in accordance to what the government and banks want? Are they not the very enemy of which we want to fight? Do we not want them to stop with their theft? Civil disobedience should then be followed.  
To do this, start accepting bitcoin now. Ask for payments in bitcoin now. Do not fall in to the trap, do not accept exchanges that uses KYC (know your customer). Take out all your fiat and convert them to bitcoin today. Trade peer to peer if needed, and by all means, be in control of your own keys.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Does my Financial Plan sound good?,"Hi, I'm 23 and I've made some bad investments in the past, so I wanted to know what you think of my financial life plan.

I'm now at a point where I am quite content with my lifestyle spending £5000 a year (including two holidays away, clothes and more) I actually moved back in with my parents and we're all happy with that. I pay for my own things, my mum makes me dinner every day and as I'm getting older and I help around the house and have started contributing financially, I stay here because it's cheaper than rent and I can't get a mortgage

I have been saving hard to try and claw back from my mistakes and my 6 months away from travelling and I now have £18,000 savings going into 2020. Although in 2017 I did have 25K which makes me feel terrible and would have at least double what I have now if I wasn't so stupid buying bitcoin!

Anyway, my plan is to stay at home and snowball my money into a great sum to where I can buy my own house in my 30's as well as retiring comfortably at 67.

**My Investments**

1. I will invest £250 a month into a SIPP (I'm self-employed), using Vanguards calculator, if I stay consistent, I will have £1200 a month pension (including state pension) at 67 to live on (5% interest).
2. I will invest £250 a month into Vanguard 80% and may move that into 2060\~ retirement fund as I hit 40, using Compound Interest at 5% interest rate I'll have £500K by 67, this would be my emergency money and I may at that point invest it into a low-interest fund. I live in a fairly cheap &amp; poor city in the middle of England so I feel this would be enough?
3. I will also be saving £250+ a month. So by 30, I will have another £21K at least + my original £18K in savings which should be enough for my mortgage.

I have decided I won't be having kids as I have step fathered before and hate being tied down. The reason my investments are so low each month is that I have an unstable income but I think I can at least do 1 and 2 every month at the very least forever.

I also have a companion who is similarly minded to me, we're free spirits but hard workers. What do you think of my plan, have you tried this before and experienced any hardships and how do I try and compensate for inflation as I understand that 500K savings and £1200 a month maybe nothing in 2060s. Do you think I am on the right path to financial success or do you think this wouldn't be the best option? Am I wasting my time, am I being too naive, am I missing something?

I really just want to secure my future and make good choices.

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"Better to put car insurance money toward new car, or toward down payment on house/retirement account and then finance car?","I was recently involved in an accident (no major medical injuries) that totaled my car. Insurance is going to give me most of what it costs to replace my vehicle, but now I'm debating what I should do with the money. Buying a car in full and not worrying about a car payment sounds nice, but if my financing interest rate ends up say ~4%, would it be better to throw it in a retirement account where it would in theory gain more than 4%, or even towards the down payment on a house so that I can avoid PMI?

My SO and I are 29, and will be first time home buyers. Still fine tuning our savings plan, but without insurance money we hoped to have a (close to 20%) down payment saved within the next 1-2 years. Right now we have about 20k saved for a down payment. No major debts. Thanks!",finance

My mortgage is $1,640/month, and I have two kids who will be joint custody- no child support. I am going to Airbnb my downstairs again, which I'm hoping will bring in $600/month.

personalfinance,"Ineligible for IRA Contribution due to FEIE. HELP, WHAT SHOULD I DO?","In 2018 I worked overseas and qualified for the Foreign Earned Income Exemption. Early in 2018, I made a $5.5k contribution to my Roth IRA. I learned when filing my tax return that I was not eligible to make the Roth IRA contribution due to not having paid federal income tax on my income of $80,800. I will have to pay a penalty for every year that the contribution for 2018 remains in the account. 

I have two options: 

1.) Re-characterize the contribution from 2018 to make it my 2019 contribution. If I do this, I will miss out on having that $5.5k compounding until I can retire in 30 years. I'm 36.

2.) Amend the 2018 return, changing my physical presence test eligibility dates to Nov 2017-Nov 2018 instead of January 1 2018-Dec 31 2018 in order that I will have to pay income tax on one month of income. This would allow enough taxable income to make me eligible for the $5.5k Roth contribution.

I'm wondering if it's worth going through the trouble of amending my return in order to keep the contribution in my account. It seems that having tax free earnings on the $5.5k for the next 30 years is worth paying an accountant to amend my return and pay income tax on $5500 in order to be eligible to contribute the $5.5k to the Roth. But I'm wondering if anyone can tell me if there is something I'm not considering.

$5500 compounded at 10% interest for 30 years is $95,971.71. If I had the $5500 in a taxable account rather than an IRA, I would have to pay 15% capital gains tax(the 2019 CG rate for my income level) on $96k or $14,400.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm 30, never had a loan in my life. Should I buy a house and ask for a loan?","Hi,

I'm 30, have a stable job where I make 17k €/year (average for my country, Portugal) and the prospect is to keep my income growing in the coming years (next year a raise is expected, for example).

I have never had a loan in my life or even used a credit card. I have around 15k € in my savings.

At this point in my life I would like to buy a house. I just moved back to my country and my BF and I will start trying for a baby next year. The houses I have been seeing are around 200k, so I will need a loan.

I did some simulations and I would be paying \~500€ a month for 40 years, which is ok for me. But, honestly, I know ZERO about credit and all those interest rates and fees, so it's possible that I'm doing it all wrong....

There is a lot of inflation in the house prices at the moment... But at the same time, I need somewhere to live and the rents are equally inflated. I would be paying around 1k/month for a T1, which I would share with my BF, so myself I would pay 500€.

My BF also wants to buy a house and has around 90k € in savings, but he just opened his own company so he is not eligible for a loan because he does not have proof of income yet, from what he was told by the bank. The idea is that we buy a house each, live in one and rent the other.

Should I buy now, even with the ridiculous inflation? Or rent until it goes down again (if it ever goes down...)?

personalfinance,Emergency Fund And Debt Strategy,"So my monthly income is $4500. Plus another $4500 throughout the year (I get paid bi-weekly.)

My monthly expenses are: $3500 ($500 in student loans, $300 car lease) Rent is $1800 a month.


I currently have $8,800 in cash, and $3,300 in an IRA.


I plant to build up to 4 months in an emergency fund (not including student loans, so about $12,000 dollars). This should be accomplished by mid-March. After this I plan on attacking loans. Is this an appropriate threshold? Considering I still have debt.


Loans:
$35,880 @ 5.09% Private Student Loan
$42,000 @ 4.25% Federal Student Loan
$19,500 @ ???? Car financing after lease is over in 2 years

My current thinking is I will attack my student loans, my private one specifically, and pay down $500 extra a month.)

personalfinance,Employer Mealbreak Penalty Settlement Awarded - Should I counteroffer.. for less?,"Hello, r/personalfinance! Using a burner account because I have workmates on my main account. Got bumped over here from r/legaladvice so hopefully, this is a better place to pose this question.

Edit to add TL;DR at the bottom...

Let me begin by saying I have a great relationship with my employer. I'm about to hit my 5 year anniversary. I work in accounting, and a couple of months ago changed to an exempt employee. Prior to this change, I was a \~30hr/wk non-exempt employee.

At no point during that period were any employees instructed or mandated to take their mealbreaks, including myself. My HR manager, at the time, tried to implement this but the owners didn't back it up, citing inconvenience as the reason they didn't want to make the employees have to stop work (blah blah blah).

Well, fast forward to now, and an employee found out that was a no-no, and basically threatened to seek a settlement without lawyers and whatnot. So, to cover their asses, the company had waivers drawn up for each employee with calculations done, respectively for each based on payroll data from 10/18 - 10/19.

However, myself and many others have worked there for much longer (for some, more than 10 years). I think they hope that no one will come to that realization that they are technically owed for all that time.. not just 1 year.

***Now onto me and my question.***

I'm not looking for a payday. As noted, I love working for this company and don't want to wring them out for every penny I'm technically owed. My settlement was around $1k. I like getting unexpected money as much as the next guy, but I'm thinking of offering a counter-settlement that is actually *less than* the current amount.

Why? Well, I've got about 15k in debt and I'd love to see that paid off nice and quickly. Here's how I arrived at this settlement idea.

\- The company's banking runs on a ZBA/LOC system. (This basically means that our bank accounts all go to $0.00 every night. The money needed to cover cleared checks is automatically transferred from a large line of credit into the bank account; if a deposit is made during that day, the bank automatically drafts those funds back to the line of credit to pay it off). So basically, we pay interest on any money out less deposits.

\- The Line of Credit's interest rate is variable LIBOR, hovering anywhere from 3.6-4.1%.

\- I counteroffer to, instead of receiving a $1,000 settlement, receive a *$15,000 loan, to be paid off in increments of $600/paycheck.* (bi-weekly pay schedule).

\- Loan would be paid off in the course of a year. Interest expense incurred by the company would be around $325. (calculated this amount using average variable interest rate per month against decreasing balance)

This counteroffer would be around 60% less than the original offer.

To sum up, being debt-free is more important to me than just getting more money out of the company. From my perspective, this solution benefits both the company and myself.

Can I/Should I pursue this counteroffer?

TL;DR: Company owes employees for meal break penalties. My settlement is $1,000. Being debt-free is more important to me than just getting more money out of the company. Should I ask for a loan to pay off my debt that would cost the company 66% less than the original settlement?",finance

personalfinance,HSA vs student loan repayment and refinancing.,"I am a pharmacist that graduated in May and I have pretty high interest (9%) private student loans on top of federal loans. I am paying the lowest available option toward federal so I can put everything I can toward the private.

I have a base pay of 85k per year but realistically at least a little higher since I have a lot of opportunities to pick up extra shifts and I plan on getting a lot of my PTO paid out whenever possible instead of taking time off. I couldn't get approved for a credit card throughout college but last time I checked many months ago I think my credit was like low 700 so not too bad but I will soon try to get one now that I have income.

First question is what is the best way to go about refinancing a student loan? 9% seems very high and it looks like you can generally get it down to like 4 - 7%. Who are the best ones to go through and how do I get the best rate?

Second question is about an HSA. I have to sign up for health insurance in the next couple weeks and I know an HSA is a good way to fun healthcare down the line with tax free income, but my question is if you have a lot of loans, wouldn't it make more sense to take the money you would put toward an HSA (in my case 3k to hit the maximum) and put it toward student loans which I will be paying for at least the next 10 years since it will have been accruing interest the entire time, whereas an putting it toward an HSA I would only benefit the amount I would save in taxes due to a decrease in taxable income so about 1k per year? Is there a break point in how quickly I would pay off my loans where it makes one a better decision clearly better than the other?

economy,Recession?,"With the mainstream media screaming that a recession is imminent, let's have a look at how things could potentially pan out over the coming years and where we stand...

A Markets Insider article in August looked at a study by the National Association for Business Economics, showing that 72% of the economists surveyed predicted that a recession would occur by the end of 2021.

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/next-recession-trump-survey-shows-most-economists-predict-downturn-2021-2019-8-1028456445](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/next-recession-trump-survey-shows-most-economists-predict-downturn-2021-2019-8-1028456445)

This followed news in August that the yield curve had inverted - this has correctly predicted every recession since the 60s.

Are they correct?

Let's paint a picture...

First off, we can see that, after the 50% correction in the aftermath of the Great Recession in 08, the S&amp;P 500 hit roughly 750 in the first half of 09.

Since then, we have effectively seen the longest economic expansion in US history with massive rallies across the board and the S&amp;P currently sitting well above 3000.

This is because we've had REAL economic growth and the stock market is representing that real world abundance AND record corporate debt (currently around $10 trillion) has been used by companies to invest in the real world economy.

JUST KIDDING!

What has *actually* happened since 08?

Since 08, in response to the crisis in 08, the Fed has printed money.

A LOT OF MONEY. This is known as quantitative easing. In total, give or take $3.8 trillion has been printed since 08.

A couple of years back, in 2017, the Fed started to unwind its balance sheet (known as quantitative tightening).

However, that changed in dramatic fashion this year, as the Repo crisis reared it's ugly head.

Basically the Fed stepped in on an emergency (supposedly short term) basis due to a lack of liquidity in the market. However, some banks (unnamed for obvious reasons) were still struggling to find the cash they needed to hit their reserve ratios - this is a consequence of fractional reserve banking.

Very recently, this has been ramped up even more, with another $425 billion being injected into the system before year-end.

Of course, this is just an emergency measure for a few months since September, and *does not* constitute quantitative easing, even though the impact on the Fed's balance sheet is in effect the same (lol)...

Now, enough of the Fed and Repos, let's look at corporate debt:

So, as I mentioned before, corporate debt is pretty high - nearly $10 trillion and 47% of the overall economy.

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12-1028731031](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12-1028731031)

Some say that companies are using this record level of corporate debt to continue to finance the cash on their balance sheets necessary for stock buybacks, and not using this debt to invest in the REAL WORLD economy.

Hence, the vast amounts of cash corporations have had on their balance sheets has been holding up equity markets, with the **main demand for equities over the last decade coming from corporate stock buybacks**.

So, in essence, companies are using the extra cash on their balance sheets to buy their shares and keep them propped up, while recently there has been near record insider selling.

Corporations are not using this extra debt to invest in the REAL world economy, they are instead using it to supplement stock buybacks.

The best thing is that while they continue with stock buybacks to keep the share price propped up, they are selling their personal shares in the business and lining the pockets with profits.

Thus, they personally position themselves defensively and hedge - such that when the recession hits in the next 1-2 years, retail and 401k investors take the main hit.

The insiders are already out - and of course the tax payers through FED hyperinflation will bail the dead company or economy out...

Thus, profits are privatised and losses are socialised.

Some say this will lead to a major credit freeze soon, more quantitative easing and the banks will need MASSIVE capital injections along with potentially negative rates.

The bottom line is that one should be prepared.

Bearin' in mind (get it...) what I said before about the main demand for equities over the last decade coming from corporate stock buybacks, it is telling that in the **second quarter of 2019 we saw a** **significant decline**.

Some say ""just ride the wave, the Fed is printing more, equities go up"".

To me, the risk/reward is not worthwhile here. Like I said, since 08, we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history and we've had a return of \~360%. The only other period that had the same return (it was slightly higher actually) was the roaring 20s. We all know what happened after that! No, I am not being a doomer and saying we will have another Great Depression 😂

However, what is interesting is that Central Banks played a large role in the 20s which lead to problems later down the line...

So, we have painted a clear picture - the writing is on the wall...

[RegTech](https://preview.redd.it/oca3sbr5me641.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f91e996128c29ef3094b9d4a49329789ff366362)

&gt;This post [""What is RegTech? A guide to the latest trend in the fintech area""](https://djangostars.com/blog/regtech-development-guide-latest-fintech-trend/) was originally published on Django Stars blog. Written by Artur Bachynskyi - COO at [Django Stars](https://djangostars.com/)

*Here comes RegTech — a new technology field that ensures that companies, especially tech firms, act in accordance with implemented government rules and regulations.*

The first time we came across the term RegTech was when our team was delivering Python development services to [Clear Minds](https://djangostars.com/case-studies/clear-minds/) — an investment platform that acts as a digital adviser for people who want to make profitable investments in the long run. During the final stages of development, in May 2018, the [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/) came out.

If you’re lucky enough to have never dealt with GDPR, I will briefly summarize what it is. It’s a regulation created by the EU that forces companies that work with customers’ personal data — in our case, tech companies — to protect the information they capture. Namely, they cannot disclose it to third parties, and must even delete it if a customer asks them to. GDPR is the reason why your email boxes were recently bombarded with new Terms &amp; Conditions and Privacy Policies of all the services you were using or subscribed to.

Like many other companies, we faced a problem with storing personal data. Not only did we have to study the law itself; we also had to understand how it would affect Clear Minds and what we had to do to comply with the regulation. And we weren’t alone. In this article, I’ll describe RegTech and how it helps solve issues related to compliance with government regulations.

## What’s wrong with regulatory compliance?

The problem is that (1) GDPR is only one of the hundreds of other regulations that companies have to comply with. And (2) new regulations appear faster than companies can analyze them and take the corresponding action. Hiring additional legal staff and forming a compliance department isn’t something that all tech companies can afford, never mind startups.

Of course, many firms decided to ignore the regulation — but hey, GDPR fines can be up to €20m and 4% of a company’s annual revenue. I doubt that anybody who’s sane would take such a huge risk. Although non-compliance with any regulation may result in enormous fines, some companies still think, “Well, I don’t care.” That’s a big no-no. Usually, breaking government regulations or even one-time malpractice will result in huge fines, then scandals, and eventually a trial. CB insights made a terrific compilation of 2017 headlines that illustrates the problem:

&amp;#x200B;

## RegTech — an effective compliance solution

Regulatory Technology (a.k.a. RegTech) is any technology that aims to standardize regulatory processes, create unambiguous interpretations of the regulations, and, most important — automate the compliance process. To characterize the RegTech industry, Deloitte analyzed around 333 RegTech companies and identified [5 main categories of Regulatory Technology](https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/technology/articles/regtech-companies-compliance.html).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zir71giime641.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=341217500e284bc85fbdd40814dfed5cf9650375

Let’s dive deeper into these categories and consider how artificial intelligence can contribute to automating each of them. This will help us understand why excluding the human factor by using AI-based tools offered by RegTech developers is more effective than traditional manual operations.

## Compliance

The regulations landscape is extremely dynamic, which makes it nearly impossible for a human to keep up with the latest updates. Here’s exactly where AI and machine learning enter the picture, as they can perform such regulatory compliance activities as:

* Searching for new or reviewed regulations
* Analyzing the collected information
* Reporting
* Sharing the impact of changes with the stakeholders, etc.

AI algorithms can be trained to automatically perform these tasks, with appropriate reviews at key decision points made by the compliance officers.

[64% of companies](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/NAJXEKE6) that have already adopted AI tools name compliance requirements one of their main reasons for doing so. These include:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/40zm5l2nme641.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c808430a3149a52cef768d4fb403632c1ecfc39

## Identity management and control

The Know Your Customer (KYC) process covers client identity authentication and screening. It’s common to perform it the old-school way, manually working with documentation, but RegTech developers rely on advanced data aggregation and analysis tools. Again, AI and machine learning can expand the scope of the KYC process by gathering information from multiple sources that usually requires hours of searching and ultimately may never be found.

## Risk management

Some RegTech solutions can continuously monitor risks. That is, they learn to identify insecure situations based on predefined data. In the financial sector, RegTech solutions use advanced analytics and big data to predict market changes and mitigate similar risks. After all, machines are far better with numbers than people.

The adopters of [AI tools for FCRM](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/NAJXEKE6) consider them to be most effective for performing the following activities:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rg17o43rme641.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f82f6e02a6d8d92a3934d77fdfaafdc48b0e95eb

## Regulatory reporting

Few people enjoy drawing up reports, and even fewer actually create them. But this is work you have to do, whether you’re a clerk or a high-ranking executive. But people tend to make errors in reports, and this results in unclear or incorrect data. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) makes data management processes work without employees being involved. The result is correct data, reported on time.

Here are a few of the processes in regulatory reporting that can be optimized thanks to AI instruments:

* Data validation
* Analytical calculations
* Categorization and classification
* Data processing and preparation
* Regulatory change management, etc.

Automation of these activities results in significant time- and cost-savings.

## Transaction monitoring

This is the process of monitoring financial transactions that go through banks, online shops or other financial institutions to identify suspicious activity and flag it as illegal. There’s normally a separate department in a bank that performs this work. They have certain standards regarding what should be considered suspicious. Like the previous point about reporting, RPA can analyze and monitor transactions faster and more accurately than any professional.

As you can see, most solutions, regardless of the category, utilize RPA, Big Data Analysis, AI, and Machine Learning.

## Implementing RegTech

The need for RegTech solutions arises from a number of issues most companies face. Let’s consider [the most common challenges](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/regtech-trends-fintech/) and the ways RegTech industry helps to meet them:

|||
|:-|:-|
|Challenge|Solution|
|Compliance gaps because of the increasing volume of regulations. Companies struggle from a lack of resources to keep up with constantly emerging requirements.|Digitalization allows for the processing of new regulations to be automated, thus streamlining compliance procedures and regulatory reporting.|
|Increased fines for non-compliance.|RegTech companies help minimize possible human errors, reduce resources needed for regulatory data analysis, and ensures that firms don’t miss the deadlines for adjusting their workflow to the new requirements.|
|New regulations require a corresponding technical environment. Many companies have legacy code behind their infrastructure, which cannot be updated as quickly as it’s required.|RegTech development services can offer scalable software solutions that empower faster reactions to new demands from regulators. Some of these tools can even establish a predictive approach to problem-solving by matching company details, like legal entity, products and services delivered, etc. with relevant legislation, compliance requirements, and emerging regulations.|

## Stage #1: Manual operations

All these benefits are driving more and more businesses to search for RegTech experts that can optimize regulatory management. So let’s look at the stages a company can go through when implementing RegTech tools.

It’s the primary stage of managing all regulatory activities, and today it can be compared to cave painting. Well before AI and machine learning turned the industry upside down, nearly all companies used Microsoft Excel for data capturing, reporting, and auditing. Some firms still use it to collect and manage regulatory data. Obviously, this slows down the compliance processes.

## Stage #2: Workflow automation

When entrepreneurs realized that Excel cannot possibly keep up with ever-changing regulatory requirements, RegTech development started to evolve. This is when banks started using software solutions for auditing, regulatory reporting, and other compliance tasks they used to perform manually.

[MetricStream](https://www.metricstream.com/) was among the first to appear, in 1999, and remains the most popular RegTech development company. It’s a comprehensive solution for risk, quality, and compliance management. Along with MetricStream, two other pioneers of compliance workflow automation emerged: [Ripcord](https://www.ripcord.com/) and [Workfusion](https://www.workfusion.com/).

## Stage #3: Ongoing tracking and monitoring

Over the past decade, banks moved on to the next stage of RegTech implementation — ongoing monitoring. This allows them to fill in the compliance gaps caused by the large number of constantly arising regulatory requirements. Thanks to real-time tracking, companies can instantly respond to the new regulations and reduce the potential risks of non-compliance.

## Stage #4: Predictive problem-solving

After the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, RegTech engineers started using these technologies in their software. AI enables smart analytics, proactive risk estimation, and so-called compliance intelligence. Today, companies have much more powerful tools they can use to keep up with regulations and predict and eliminate potential risks.

## Examples of RegTech solutions for banking and fintech

In this section, I’ll provide you with a few concrete RegTech examples and explain how they help businesses. Despite the areas that [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/technology/articles/regtech-companies-compliance.html) has identified, most solutions are cross-industry and comprise several technologies that solve a set of problems in a particular industry. However, my list includes five companies that best fit banking and fintech companies.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ii8g2rxyme641.png?width=1768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9bcb8a98bdbc02f6d7412d5dd7b130d3dc035c9

[Provenir](https://www.provenir.com/) is a risk analytics system that integrates with, as the founders claim, “virtually any structured and instructed data source quickly” and creates risk analyses based on preset parameters. By data source, they mean that they can operate with Twitter, Facebook, Salesforce and many other tech giants. The great thing about Provenir is that it can be used in a variety of different industries, from e-commerce websites to banks. By the way, HSBC is its largest client, which makes it one of the best RegTech examples in the banking sector.

[Continuity](https://www.continuity.net/) is a US service that provides regulatory compliance services. The system monitors the US Federal Register and, depending on the client’s business area, interprets changes to the regulations that apply to the client company. So instead of hiring a huge compliance department, a company can use Continuity to save staff time. Moreover, Continuity offers a Unified Compliance Management System Model. You just schedule compliance tasks, and the compliance management process becomes automated.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yhuy5cp3ne641.png?width=1768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e8f0ba751f64b5c6a4788097a9add3ba3f54e58

[IdentityMind](https://identitymindglobal.com/) provides a platform that performs a KYC process: it finds, maintains, and analyzes digital identities, which allows companies to identify a person, perform regulatory identification, and detect and prevent identity fraud. For commercial businesses, it means fewer frauds and protection from money laundering. They also have a base of 20 partner companies that provide data, services, and technology to support larger data operations.

Luxembourg is famous for two things: it’s one of the smallest European countries, and it has an excellent economy. It’s no wonder that Luxembourg is the home to [Regis-TR](http://www.regis-tr.com/regis-tr/), a RegTech development company that offers a reporting system for all kinds of trade transactions for various assets in the EU. Their reporting system is compliant with three regulations: EMIR, FinfraG, and SFTR. The company plans to create an ecosystem that enables clients to report their data to only one entity at a time and not violate any requirements in different jurisdictions.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r0wl6xa6ne641.png?width=1768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd44ecb50aed301faf0fffecf879f91c7b5965bd

[Feedzai](https://feedzai.com/), as its founders describe it, is an “AI platform to fight financial crime.” Simply put, it detects fraud in omnichannel commerce by offering banks and commercial businesses payment processors protection. They use historical and behavioral analysis of data to identify whether a transaction is potentially suspicious or not.

As you can see, RegTech isn’t something vague and unclear. It’s just that the entire RegTech industry is B2B, so consumers are unlikely to ever come across it.

## Bottom line

RegTech is software that helps companies, primarily FinTech ones, comply with established regulations. Most solutions rely on the continuous utilization of AI and machine learning to exclude human error from regular processes like reporting and risk management.

The RegTech market isn’t stable, since governments tend to establish new regulations every year, based on technological progress. Think about the crypto market. Ten years ago, nobody attempted to regulate it. Over the last three years, governments have been trying to figure out how to control it. This clearly demonstrates that RegTech is just starting to develop — and that the more regulations that hit the books, the more solutions we’ll see.",finance

personalfinance,Are there any benefits in making additional mortgage payments if the interest rate is low?,"I recently took a 30yr mortgage with a pretty good rate - 3.25%. 
The loan is almost $600k, but the monthly payment is within the means of our family.

A lot of people I spoke to recommended to add 1-2 additional annual payments towards the principal, reducing the term and overall interest paid.
However, the more I think about it, the less it makes sense to me. The extra money will most likely go towards long-term investments, and so I ran a few simulations. 

If I make 2 extra payments a year ($2,583 x 2), I'd be shortening the term by 6.5 years and save roughly $79k in interest.

However, when I ran a bunch of simulations in a compounded interest calculator that takes into consideration inflation and taxes (I chose a high tax rate), it seems like even with a conservative estimation, I'd make a lot more:

* 5% growth - $180,479.56

* 6% growth - $197,024.84

* 7% growth - $215,341.65

* 8% growth - $235,628.23

I'm most likely going to invest the extra money in a mega backdoor Roth IRA which will make the gains even higher.

Am I missing something else here? I understand the psychological aspect of being debt-free, but I think I'm ok living with debt as long as the cashflow is good (after all, I've been doing the same thing, renting for the last 10 years or so).

stocks,Actually getting started ?,"Hi! 

I hope this is the right place for a post like this. Otherwise maybe you can point me in another direction? 

I’ve been learning about the stock market for a good few months now, reading a lot online, doing a couple online courses and watching a lot of YouTube content on the matter. I’ve also done a little paper trading, but I’ve found it hard to “act” like it’s the real deal, since I had nothing to lose. However, I do feel confident in the different buying/selling mechanisms (market order, limit order and so on). I’ve also been following up on the news regarding the financial market, trying to make sense of it all, and relate it to different stocks I’ve been following. 
So I generally feel fairly confident in my knowledge, but at the same time, I feel like I need a lot more experience.. (I promise this is going somewhere!) before I can properly begin investing. 

The thing is, besides paper trading, the only real way to get some experience is to actually started.. 

But every time I think today is the day, I get a little hesitant, and get the feeling that maybe today is not the right day, because the market is X or Y. Maybe a better day will come? 

I know that you cannot time the market (at least few do it with success), and something will always be up. We currently have the China Trade War, the rallies in Hong Kong, Brexit and so on. We also have the rates acted all weird, and the FED’s considering to change them (this is “settled” now ofc.). 

I even have an account set up, all I need is to transfer the money to the account and start buying. 

All in all I believe the issue I keep having this feeling I missed something in the news, or some stat that would have told me the trade was a bad idea? 

Also, I know I should not invest money I can’t afford to lose. And I can afford to lose the money I have sat aside, but that doesn’t mean I want to, obviously.

bigdata,Advance MapReduce,"Read More on - [www.facebook.com/seevecoding](https://www.facebook.com/seevecoding)

**Advance MapReduce** 

Hadoop MapReduce the data types when it works with user given mappers and reducers. The data is read from files into mapper and emitted by mapper to reducers.This process data is sent back by the reducer .Data emitted by reducer go to output files. **At every step data is stored into java objects.**

**Writable data types :** In the Hadoop environment object that can be put to or received from files and access the network must obey the Writable interface this help to be in Serial form for execution .

**Interfaces in Hadoop - Writable and Writable Comparable** 

**Writable interface -** A writable interface allow Hadoop to read and write the data in Serialized form for transmission . 

interface Writable {

public void readField(DataInput in);

public void write(DataOutput out);

}

**Writable Comparable interface -** A writable comparable extends the writable interface so that the data can be used as a key and not as a value. 

int compareTo(Object what)

int hashCode()

**Data Types in Hadoop :**

Data Types

Functions

Text 

Store String data

IntWritable

Stores Integer data

LongWritable

Stores Long data

FloatWritable

Stores Float data

DoubleWrirtable

Stores Double data

BooleanWritable

Stores Boolean data

ByteWritable

Stores Byte data

NullWritable

Placeholder when value is not needed

Writable

It defines a deserialisation or serialisation protocol.Every data type in Hadoop is Writable.

WritableComparable

It defines a sort order. All key must be of this type (but not value)

**Input Format in MapReduce :**

MapReduce can specify how its input is to be read by defining a InputFormat.

The Table is the lists of the classes of InputFormats provided by Hadoop Framework.

**InputFormat Classes**

**Description** 

Key Value Text Input Format

One key value pair per line.

Text Input Format

Key is the line number and value is the line.

N Line input format

Similar to TextInputFormat, but the difference is that there are N number of lines that makes an input split.

Multiple File Input Format

Input format that aggregates multiple files into one split.

Sequence File Input Formate 

The input file is a Hadoop sequence file which contains a serialised key value pair.

**Output Format in MapReduce :**

**OutputFormat Classes**

**Description** 

TextOutputFormat 

It is the default Output Format and writes  records as lines of text. Each key-value pair is separated by a TAB character.This can be customised by using the mapred.textoutputformat.separator property, The corresponding InputFormat is KeyValueTextInput Format.

SequenceFileOutputFormat

It writes sequence files to save output, it is compact and compressed.

SequenceFileAsBinaryOutputFormat

It writes key and value in raw binary format into a sequential file container.

MapFileOutputFormat

It writes MapFiles as output. The keys in MapFile must be added in an order and the reducer will emit keys in sorted order.

MultipleTextOutputFormat

It writes data to multiple files whose names are derived from output keys and values.

MultipleSequenceFileOutputFormat

It creates output in multiple files in compressed form.

**Distributed Cache :** 

Distributed cache is a Hadoop feature to cache file that are needed by the application.

The Distributed cache helps in :

1. Helps to boost efficiency when a map or reduce task need access to the common data.
2. Allow cluster nod to read the imported files from its local file system instead of retrieving the file from other cluster node.
3. Allow both single files and archived (such as zip and tar.gz).
4. Copies files only to slave nodes. If there are no slave nodes in cluster , distributed cache copies file to the master node.
5. Allow accessed to the cache file from mapper or reducer applications to make sure that the current working directory is added into application path.
6. Allow one to reference the cached files as through they are present in current working directory.

**Using Distributed Cache :**

1. Set up the cache by coping the requisites files to the FileSystem.

 $ bin/hadoop fs  -copyFromLocal   lookup.dat /my app/lookup.dat

1. Set up the application JobConf as shown below 

JobConf job = new JobConf();

DistributedCache.addCacheFile(new URL (“/my app/.lookup.dat#lookup.dat”),job);  

DistributedCache.addCacheArchive(new URL(“/myapp/map.zip”,job);

DistributedCache.addFileToClassPath(new Path(“/myapp/mylib.jar”),job);

DistributedCache.addCacheArchive(new URL (“/myapp/mytar.tar”, job);

DistributedCache.addCacheArchive(new URL (“/myapp/mytgz.tgz”, job);

DistributedCache.addCacheArchive(new URL (“/myapp/mytargz.tar.gz”, job);

1. Use Cached file in mapper or reducer 

public static class MapClass extends MapReduceBase implements Mapper&lt;K,V,K,V&gt;

{

private Path \[\] localArchives,private Path \[\] localFiles;

public void configure (JobConf job){

//Get the cache archives/files

File f = new File(“./map.zip/some/file/in/zip.txt”);

}

public void map ( K key, V value, OutputCollector&lt;K,V&gt;output, Reporter reporter)

throws IOException {

// Use data frown the cache archives/files here 

//........

//........

output.collect(k, v);

}

}

**Joins in MapReduce** **:**

Joins are relational constructs to combine relations. In MapReduce, joins are used to combine two or more datasets.A join is performed either in the map phase or in the reduce phase by taking advantage of MapReduce Sort-Merge architecture.

**The various Join pattern availability in MapReduce are** **:**

1. **Reduce side join** \- It is used for joining two or more large dataset by same foreign key using any kind of join operation.

 **Working of Reduce side join** **-**

* The mapper prepares for the join operation , it takes each input record from every dataset  and it emits a foreign key - record part.
* The reducer perform the join operation , it stores the value of each input group into temporary lists . The temporary list are then iterated over and the record from both sets are joined.

 **When to use Reduce side join -**

1. When multiple dataset are joined by a foreign key.
2. When flexibility is needed to execute any join operation.
3. When large amount of network bandwidth is available.
4. When there is no limitation on the size of dataset.

 **SQL Analogy of Reduce Side Join -**

1. **Replicated Join** \- It is a map-side join that works in situations where one of the dataset is small enough to cache .

 **Working of Replicated**  **join** **-**

* It reads all files from the distributed cache and stores them in in-memory lookup tables.The mapper processes each record and joins it with the data stored in memory.
* There is no data shuffled to the Reduce phase.The mapper gives the final output part.

 **When to use Replicated join -**

1. When all dataset except for the largest one can fit into the main memory of each map task that is limited by Java Virtual Machine (JVM) heap size.
2. When there is a need for an inner join or a left outer join , within the large input dataset being the “left” part of the operation.

1. **Composite Join** **-**  It is map side join on very large formatted input datasets sorted and partitioned by a foreign key.

 **Working of Composite join** **-**

* All dataset are divided into the same number of partitions.Each partitions  of dataset is sorted by a foreign key and all the foreign keys reside in associated partition of each dataset.
* Two values are retrieved from the input tuple associated with each dataset ,they are based on the foreign key and the output to the file system.

 **When to use Replicated join -**

1. When all dataset are sufficiently large.
2. When there is need for an inner join or a full outer join.

personalfinance,"Expected to owe ~$6,000 in taxes according to IRS calculator. What to do now?","Hello,

We got married early this year (Feb) and my wife got a job back in April.

We are pretty sure we followed the W-4 worksheet when switching, but I guess it wasn't even close.

For more information, after crunching all the numbers into the estimator:

Our net income:  $160,215 (after 401k, HSA deducted)

Expected tax withholding: $16,027\*

Anticipated tax obligation: $21,596\*\*

My question is, this is my first time owing taxes to the IRS and am not sure how I can go about paying this. We have enough money in savings to pay the full amount but **we want to make sure there are no penalties/interests and no overpayment**  (because remember, this is the result from the IRS calculator, not the actual tax filing). The IRS website recommended that I pay **Estimated Taxes** by January 15th. Should i do this? We also technically have 1 more payroll left; should we adjust both of our W-4 withholdings to 0 so we owe a little less?

I will try to keep this as short as possible and to the point. This coming year i am really trying to get rid of all my credit card and loan debt. i have done research here on reddit, read a couple of finance books and it all leads to the ""snowball"" effect to get rid of debt, which means getting rid of the smallest payment first, regardless of interest rate. However, i am open to different strategies if they have worked others. Below is the breakdown of my current debt, and i have anywhere from $300 - $400 extra a month to go towards all my debt.

I'm a big fan of FI and using 401k and IRA accounts to get favorable tax treatment in my retirement years as well as now if possible. However, I've never quite been in this position before - normally I make enough money that I can't contribute directly to an IRA since I exceed the federal income limit and therefore have to use a number of ""backdoor"" techniques to filter money into IRA accounts.

- ~$60k in a Roth IRA (all from backdoor contributions since starting work)
- ~$130k in a Traditional 401k (pretax)

personalfinance,Housing help in HCOL city,"I need some help. My husband and I live in a HCOL urban city and we want to buy a house. We are in our early 30s, been renting for years, and finally want to settle down. Due to the COL, finding a house that isn't horrible looking, in disrepair, or a ridiculous commute has been difficult. We make a combined pre-tax income of $170k, however $20k of that is part-time work my husband does and we don't want to count on that for mortgage payments. Right now we take home around 9k (around 8k without the part-time work) per month.  We don't have a lot of savings because my husband graduated from his PhD program and only recently started making a 6-figure salary.

We started looking at houses in our desired area. This area is perfect for our commutes, has good schools, is safe and is close to amenities we value. This entire area is new construction over the past 5 or so years, so there isn't much for re-sale since most people have only recently moved in. Unfortunately, the inventory is extremely low as they are in the last phase of building. We were hoping to spend around $450k, but quickly discovered that is not possible for what we want (3 bed/2 bath/garage) in this area. There is one 3-bedroom single-family house left in the entire community priced remotely close to what we could consider. It's $533k, which was definitely more than we were planning to spend.

My husband loves it and feels confident we can carry the mortgage. I was on board, but I'm getting cold feet. We got pre-qualified for a great interest rate, but we can only put a little over 5% down. With the low down payment and high taxes in the area, we would be looking at $3,100 to $3,200 payment per month (including mortgage, PMI, home insurance, HOA and taxes).

On paper, we can definitely do it. We don't have car payments, but my husband does have student loans. However, I'm feeling nervous about the sacrifices we'll have to make, like less traveling, in order to be comfortable financially. I'm also worried about any unforeseen emergencies that could impact being able to save. The positive is that since the house is new and most things in it have a two-year warranty, we hopefully wouldn't have any large housing repairs at least for the first two years.  I've heard horror stories from my friends who bought older homes, so that is something that makes this house attractive. Am I overthinking it? Would you be comfortable carrying a mortgage of that size on our income?

Another option is a 3-bed end-unit townhome in the same neighborhood. It's $485k, which would put our monthly payment closer to $2,700 or $2,800. That number feels better, but, it's a townhome and I'm worried about it holding onto its value and appreciation in case of a recession. Also, I would probably want to move in 5-10 years into a single family house with more space.

We could wait to buy in order to save more, but it will be hard to get into our desired area as all the new builds will be sold within the next few months. All the surrounding areas have abysmal schools, and we are hoping to start a family soon, so this is an important consideration. Additionally, we are spending $2,200 a month on rent and we hate that that money isn't building equity.",finance
personalfinance,Where to save money?,"Hi,

I am deciding where to save money. So I have every intention to invest in real estate (to rent out, not for my home) within 1.5 years. I imagine I will need roughly $20K-$50K for a down payment depending on the property (single family or multi family). Due to this, I only contribute enough to my roth 401K to get the company matching bonus of 6%. I have been saving the rest in my checking account and am not really sure what to do with it while I accrue more savings. Currently, I manage to save about $2500 a month after taxes, expenses, and 401k savings. I have no loans or any other debt. As it stands, I have $18k in my checking account. I intend to put $8K (5 months of expenses) into a wealthfront savings account as my emergency fund. So with the remaining $10K and future savings, should I just invest it in a normal investment account such as Robinhood to capture market gains and liquidate when I intend to buy my investment property? For reference, I just graduated undergrad recently and my job is pretty steady.

Also, are there any other recommendation for a savings account with a high interest rate besides wealthfront or brokerage besides robhinhood? Also, because I have roughly $10K to invest with currently, should I just invest all $10K into an index fund at once or buy into the funds at a rate of $2500/month so that the $10K will be fully invested in 4 months.

Anything else I should know to make the most of my money?

personalfinance,Spent today figuring out where all my money actually goes,"Inspired by the hundreds of Sankey diagrams over in /r/dataisbeautiful, and concerned about going back to school for my masters, I decided to diagram out where my monthly pay goes, the entire amount, not just what shows up in my bank account.

[Monthly money flow diagram](https://imgur.com/a/WRw4cym)

This is a very different picture of how I usually see monthly spending. Usually people zoom in entirely on that take-home pay section, but for my scenario there is so much more money other places that I rarely think about.

**Things I found interesting**:

- Contributing less to my 401k or Employee stock program would be the easiest way to get money, instead of taking out student loans (depending on the interest rates). I set this up my contributions a while ago, and forget that 30% of my money is just getting invested before I see it

- This is the first thing I've seen to make me consider getting a house instead of renting (I know there are tons of hidden costs to housing, but it's still interesting).

**Things that could be improved**:

- I'm over-contributing to taxes right now, some of that giant tax chunk probably is going to come back to me, but I really have no idea how much, may past refunds have no real pattern in the amount I get back

- The 401k and ESPP profits are just approximates. I'm assuming a 7% return on the 401K, and only a 15% return on the ESPP (subtracting out short-term capital gains tax). I wanted to include this info to remind myself why I contribute

- My net worth could be split into liquid and fixed assets. It's not really fair to put my savings in the same category as retirement money. But for this view, I think net worth makes sense.

- I just found a $3 monthly donation to wikipedia, so charity should be $153, but the thought of redoing this make me die inside

**Special Snowflake caveats**:

- I don't need to pay for health insurance, car insurance, or utilities

- I don't have consistent enough spending on food to include in the diagram. I randomly purchase $100 of groceries once after 3 months, or twice in a single month. 

- I travel for work and expense spending, so technically I make a small profit on the cash back from my credit cards. I have no idea how to include that in the diagram.

Hopefully this way of thinking about where money goes is interesting to other people. I'll add a comment with details on how I got these numbers and the tools I used.",finance

Cincinnati Bell will file a current report on Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission containing a summary of the terms and conditions of the proposed acquisition as well as a copy of the merger agreement.",finance
personalfinance,Worth refinancing if I'm only 2+ years into the loan?,"**Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone, I've determined it's best to stay the course and not refinance.** 

Would it make sense to refinance based on the below information?

I currently live in a two story house. It's 2k sq. ft, has .25 acres.  I have a few kids and a few large breed dogs.  I initially got this home as to have the room for my family, but realized it's quite a lot of work to maintain and figure I'm okay with a much smaller house.  For this reason,  I do plan on selling the house and buying a smaller house in about 2 years, sooner if it makes sense to.

With that said, I'm always looking for ways to increase cash flow.  One thought I had was refinancing.  I could take money out of my emergency fund to cover closing costs in order to increase cash flow.  One of my concerns is that tax is always increasing, and the lender keeps increasing the escrow requirements.  When I first got the loan, it was at $1,700/mo.  Now it's at $1,960/mo -- and it's sure to increase past $2k as house appraisal values around here keep increasing thereby increasing my tax obligations.  Sure, I can always fight it via protesting, but that can only do so much. If it's relevant, I live in Texas near a major city.  With it being at $1.5k, I'd be in a better position to be able to absorb future increases.

However, I'm of the mind that I'm better off simply waiting until the time comes to sell the house and buy a smaller house instead of refinancing. Perhaps I can get the seller to cover closing costs, get rid of mortgage insurance, score a better interest rate, and reduce mortgage payment considerably.  This would mean much less cash out of pocket and also mean I would be able to leave my emergency fund alone.  I like the idea of having a few months' worth of expenses saved up as a buffer, especially if I lost my job at some point.

I wanted to make sure I was making the right move in passing up on the refinance deal.  And plus I wanted to make sure I wasn't overlooking any crucial information.  So I'm posting here to pick your collective brains.

**With all of the above being said, here's the deets:**

* Current mortgage balance: $190k
* Current monthly payment: $1,960
* Current interest rate: 4.125%
* Mortgage type: FHA
* Term: 30 years fixed
* Mortgage insurance/mo: $134.25

[**Better.com**](https://Better.com) **is offering to refinance my home with the following specs:**

* New monthly payment: $1,529
* New interest rate: 3.875%
* New mortgage type: Conventional
* Term: 30 years fixed
* New mortgage insurance/mo: $27
* Closing costs: $5,078

**Other relevant financial info:**

* I have $13k in emergency funds and $7k in retirement.
* No credit debt.
* Owe $9k in student loans (interest rate: 3.4%).
* Credit score is 750.
* I make $70k before taxes.
* My current debt to income ratio is 43%.

Zillow puts my home at $234k, although I know that estimate doesn't mean much.  Appraisal of my house by government puts my home at $200k (thanks to protest, original appraised value at the start of 2019 was $225k).

personalfinance,Responsible number of credit cards?,"Hi, all. I currently have one credit card that I have almost paid off fully. It's a generic bank card, with a bad interest rate, and I carried a balance on it for quite some time. 

I have good credit (~760) that I would like to continue to build. I would like to find a card or cards that give me better rewards. In theory the interest doesn't matter since I do not plan to carry a balance moving forward. 

I am building my emergency fund. There is a possibility that I will buy property with my partner in the next year. All that considered, here are my questions:

1) I know that closing a card can be bad. If I ""upgrade"" my card with my bank, is that also a hard inquiry? Should I just leave it open the way it is now once paid off?

2) How many (if any) new credit cards is it a good idea to open to best build my credit and have rewards for the next six to nine months?

3) If I want to potentially use different cards for different purchases, what is a total reasonable number of cards to have? If it's more than one or two, how far apart should they be opened?

For clarity, I am looking at one card for grocery/everyday reward and one for Amazon/travel. But I don't know if opening two new ones at once is wise...

personalfinance,401k Allocation Sanity Check,"I'm 40, married, with an unexpected kid on the way, and I'm in the midst of having to make investment selections for my 401k, which is in process of moving from Prudential to Fidelity due to an employment change. Historically, I have done target date funds, but the new plan has what seems to be some terrible options on that front (high expense ratios). As such, I've decided to create my own allocations, which is foreign to me, and with the recent news about the kid and other variables, I'm feeling overwhelmed.

My 401k balance is quite good for my age. It's around $350k. I got a late start with it (I know, and I regret.), but I have been maxing it out for several years now (close to a decade? not totally sure) and plan to continue to do that.

Despite the 401k change, technically, I have been employed at the same company for almost 20 years (mergers, acquisitions, etc.) so my employment status is stable. I also have a healthy emergency fund (close to 8 months) in an online savings account, and other liquid assets that I'm sitting on pending a home purchase (which would ultimately become rental property) and to hedge bets against my wife's new business.

I did just open a Roth IRA a few weeks ago, which I maxed out for 2019. Currently, it's all sitting in VTSAX. I should have started that years ago as well, of course. Again, just trying to do the right things now. I plan to continue to max it out as long as I am eligible. I will probably adjust the allocations there (REITs probably), but let's set that aside for now.

We will have access to an HSA in January, which I plan to invest assuming the plan allows it. I'm hoping to max it out as well.

I do hope to retire from my day job in 10 years (would require my wife's business doing well and us having several more rental properties in place), but the kid really changes everything so I'm no longer optimistic about that outcome (although it is or was my previous #1 goal). That said, I don't plan to touch my retirement accounts until the proper ages.

My only personal debt is my condo, which is just refi'd for 30 years at 3.5% so the payment is quite low making it a profitable rental whenever we move out. My wife's debt position is a very different story and I'll set that aside for now unless I need to dig into it to answer any questions that you all may have.

Back to the 401k, our options do not seem to be great. Most of the options have high expense ratios, there's no S&amp;P 500 option, there's no real estate option, and even the remaining bond options seem to be too risky for bonds and too expensive. I've been trying to dig through each offering, and here's my first stab at my allocation mix.

Original Thoughts:

15% - VSGDX

45% - FSKAX

20% - VSMAX

20% - VIMAX

UPDATED Based on Feedback:

10% - VFSUX

70% - FSKAX

10% - VSMAX

10% - VIMAX

I'm interested in any feedback you have, and I will do my best to answer any questions that you may have.

Thank you for your time.

ETA: Before posting, I did several hours of research and read through the 401k selection guide provided by this sub. I couldn't quite follow that directly since our offerings seem  to be limited, and since it seems like the take on index funds has changed quite a bit recently (could be wrong about that).

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,"Brother has mounting CC debt, and is underwater on a car which he just got into a fender bender with. Please help with the next steps!","Hey all,

My brother is in some financial troubles. He's immature for his age, and likes to stick his head in the sand and ignore the problem rather than take steps to fix it, and he's also secretive and doesn't want to show us how bad the situation really is.

What we know is he's in several thousand dollars in credit card debt on 2 cards, we think at most $8k. He's since stopped using the cards and to our knowledge is trying to pay more than the minimum each month, but I'm afraid the interest is still out pacing him.

The next fun wrinkle is I found out he's underwater on a used car loan. Two years ago he paid $7k for a 2007 car, and then another $2400 for a protection plan they conned him and my mother into. Now the car is worth about as much as he still has to pay off over the next 3 years. 

What's even better is yesterday his brakes slipped and he rear ended my mother and I causing me to roll into the car in front of us, so now we're nervous he might have enough damage to render it a total loss.


He has an associate's degree, and then went to a 4 year program at a private school for a year before quitting. Student loans are roughly like $60 a month. He currently makes $9 an hour at his current gig. We've been urging him to look for higher paying work but beyond that, here are some options I've thought he should maybe try:

*CC debt:* Balance transfer to the lower interest card if possible, or to a new card with a apr promotion to give himself some breathing room.

Alternatively, personal loan? 

Obviously if I can sit him down and figure out how much he owes we can try and figure out how much he needs to be paying per month and for how long, that's for sure my first goal.

*Car:* Regardless of it's condition, I'm going to see if he can refinance through a credit union because I'm assuming his interest rate is way higher than it should be.

Assuming the car is totaled, can we use the proceeds to buy a new car cash and then just continue the loan as normal, or does the entire amount have to satisfy the loan first? If the former, I'll try and convince him (and my mom 😑) to buy a car for less than the check amount in order to throw money at either the car loan or the CC debt (if permissible)

Assuming the car isn't totaled, the deductible is $500. He doesn't really have that, but if it's still under loan, does he have to get it fixed or can he sit on it until he's in better shape? The car is drivable. Even if it gets fixed, should he still try to sell it and do what I said above?

worldpolitics,Will Russia implement the agreements reached by the Normandy four?,"https://preview.redd.it/f6d9qhgfuk641.jpg?width=698&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a4ed847add3b6ddeacd5c3c22cb77916f93d590

Though some inspiring results of  meeting of Russian, German, French and Ukrainian leaders in Paris on  Dec. 9, still there is a pending question, whether the parties can move  on regarding the exchange of prisoners of war, separation of forces and  ceasefire in Donbass.

The annual  conference of the Russian president held on Dec.19 has caused a deep  concern that Russia would follow the agreements, reached during the  meeting of the Normandy four. In particular, Putin stated that Minsk  agreements could not be revised, otherwise the situation âcould reach a  stalemateâ.

The situation has  been in an impasse for years, because Ukraine insists on taking control  over the border, which is prescribed by Minsk agreements. But neither  Russian Federation, nor so-called DPR/LPR are not ready for that.

One  of the targets of Normandy talks was to reach a joint position on the  border issue, but Putin strongly objects the possibility of compromise  in this case. He stated he was âgrabbed by the throatâ to force  leaders of so-called DPR/LPR to sign Minsk agreements, and now these  agreement are suggested to be reviewed.

The  position of Kremlin towards the results of Normandy talks is  illustrated by the statement of Putin that âthere are no foreign  military troops in Donbassâ and his explanation about the source of  weapons and ammunition of militants there: âin many the flashpoints  around the world there are conflicts and war actions. Besides, with use  of tanks, artillery etc. Where do they get it all from? It supposed to  be the structures and countries, sympathizing themâ.

Even  a boy scout can figure out which country sympathizes the militants of  âDPR/LPRâ. How separatist republics could receive tanks, armored  troop carriers, MLRSs, electronic warfare systems, advanced radio  transceivers, anti-aircraft missiles and many other military ammunition  which are produced only in Russia and has never been exported to any  other country. These weapons and ammunition are supplied to the  militants through the parts of Russian-Ukrainian border being out of  control of Ukrainian government. That is why the question who is a part  to the conflict becomes rhetorical one.

But  what are the âstructuresâ, sympathizing the militants? This  euphemism may mean FSB, the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the  Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, different âsupervisorsâ and  âvolunteersâ from the Russian federation, which provide  administrative support and financial assistance to âpuppet republics  DPR/LPRâ. Besides, the representatives of these âstructuresâ come  to Ukraine through the part of border being out of control of Ukraine.  At the same time, âSteinmeier formulaâ, which Russia insists to  implement, includes the requirement of full withdrawal of all illegal  military troops, their military hardware, as well as militants and  mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine. Why  Russia does not  implement what it is demanded from Ukraine?

If  Putin does not want Ukrainian border to be closed and to be under  control of Ukraine, there is only one conclusion: Russia is going to  âsympathizeâ militants, providing them with weapons, money and  military advisers to continue aggression against Ukraine.

That  is why the Russian leaderâs statement about the need for Kiev to  âkeep up dialogue with Donbassâ sounds extremely cynical. Taking  into account the provided arguments it becomes absolutely clear that  such negotiations have no sense at all, because militants and leader of  âDPR/LPRâ are under full control of Kremlin. It seems that Russia  has no plans to implement even those agreements, that were reached  during the Normandy format meeting.",technology

gaming,The Unpopular Rant.,"I know I know. I didn't post last week. Holidays and work and crazy happened. But this week, I got a doozy for you all.


Flakk Meter- 5/5. I **KNOW** I'm gonna catch hell for this one.


Witcher 3. Bad.


Your not seeing shit. That's my legitimate opinion.


Let's get the history out of the way. Back a few years ago, I saw Witcher 1 released. I thought nothing of it and heard next to nothing about it. Much like so many games before it, and so many after, under the radar.


Then apparently the second one came out. It had some reception. Mixed at first. Then I started to hear more and more bad. From friends, over the mic in games, in the chat boxes, etc. I figured it was gonna die, and never gave it another thought. It quickly dropped on price on steam. I repeatedly saw it for under $5 USD. A few times both 1&amp;2 for less than $10. Then I logged in one day and saw both, bundled for 3.99 and thought, ""Why the hell not?"" And I bought them.


I sat down and struggled to understand some of the abysmal decisions made for multiple mechanics in the first game, but it was a bearable experience. I finished the game and got into the story. Geralt, and his interesting Witcher powers piqued my interest. The whole amnesia plot was a little weak, but whatever. I enjoyed the idea of the character and the plot and wanted to know more.


So I booted up the second game. That's when I realized my mistake. The combat in the game was...there isn't words in the human language that can properly express how bad it was. I felt like Geralt had went from a badass monster Hunter with literal decades of experience in the field, to a drunken ballerina with a pair of swords and pantaloons. I couldn't even fend off drowners properly. And don't get me wrong, I understood what needed to be done. Silver weapons for monsters and undead, steel for beasts and humans. Quen for defense. Aard to stun. Ignis to burn. Sparrow and Rook potions, rest often to reduce toxicity. I know the basics. It didn't help.


The combat was the killer. I got to the first town. I met and killed some people. I got blamed for killing someone. But the first real boss fight...I couldn't get past. I watched videos, read guides, everything. The combat with either M+K or controller. Nothing worked. I fought this thing at least 40 times. Always killed. Never beat it. After a week of pushing against a wall with a coked out baby, I gave up. I started watching playthrough videos to get the story. Because I didn't experience it, I don't really remember it. Thus killed my interest in the game. I remembered all the bad press it got and realized why. Bad reviews abroad made sense. Wrote my less than $5 as a loss and moved on.


Then, suddenly, to my complete surprise, at an e3 event, out of no where, they announced a third installment. I was floored. How can they make a third after the first was messy at best and the second was practically unplayable? It boggled my mind, but I figured it would be the same thing as the first and second. It would release, there would be a little hubbub about it, then it too would die. And I would be no less for it. But it didn't. It didn't die like I expected. It shot like a fucking rocket into orbit. I could not believe my ears when people everywhere bragged about how good it was. And I always asked, ""Did you even play the first 2?"" And almost like clockwork, the nearly identical answer every time "" No, but this one is good!"" To which I scoffed.


I call bullshit. No way it could be *good*. Playable maybe, if the devs learned something, but good? No fucking way. So I asked around, what improvements did they make from the last one? How have they made the game better in terms of combat? But I was always met with stone face idiocy. Continued declines of them ever playing 1&amp;2 and I couldn't understand it. A few had similar experiences to me, and said they tried the first ones to catch up on the story before 3, but couldn't really play them. They sucked.


So what do I do with this information? Dig my heels in. I gave CDProjektRed 2 tries already. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I'm not going to play a game from a company who fucked up two games simply because everyone swears by this one. Now, don't get me wrong. I recognize this game is a successful game for whatever reason. But for me, this company has a current track record of 1/ 3 successes. That's a 67% fail rate, and that's a rate I can't trust. So I won't be playing it. Period. How am i supposed to trust a game from a company that their previous games were such massive pieces of trash?


Other companies get the benefit of the doubt. I gave the benefit of the doubt to Bethesda since their track record up till recent history has been good. I will continue to give them the benefit for another few games at least. I gave it to bungie since the Halo series was such a massive success. But Destiny 1&amp;2 being such turds, I can't do that anymore. Maybe if they actually fix some shit, I would consider it again. But CDProjektRed has almost never given me a reason to trust them. So I wait for their next chance with Cyberpunk.


To round it all up, I hate Witcher series in general and won't play 3 since 1&amp;2 were both not good. 2 was too bad for me to try 3.


Join me next week when I attack more of your beloved games and companies with incoherent rambles.",technology

personalfinance,Refinancing Our Home,"Hey PF!

It's Christmas eve, and I have to work so I figured I would do something worthwhile. We began setting up a budget and debt paydown plan for 2020 and beyond. So far, that's going great but the largest expense is our mortgage. I'm trying to look at creative ways to decrease what that payment is.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Mortgage:**

* 4.65% Interest Rate
* $1,714 Monthly Payment (includes escrow &amp; MIP)
* $230k owed, $243k purchase price, rough estimate of current value is $280 - 290k.
* Approx 25% of our take-home (post-tax) income goes to our mortgage.
* 3% conventional Mortgage

**Payment Breakdown:**

* 322.68 - Principal
* 889.20 - Interest
* 315.87 - Taxes/Insurance
* 186.60 - MIP/PMI

**Current Debt:**

* Student Loans - 4.6% - 45k - $360/mo
* Car - 2.5% - 11k - $320.04/mo
* Plus the house.

**Current Cash:**

* 1k Emergency Savings
* 3k floating bank balance
* 11k traditional 401k

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is either to reduce the monthly payment to free up additional funds to pay down other debts faster. I'm looking at a local credit union and a few of the online companies like rocket mortgage.

**My question(s) for you are:**

1. What insight on a refinance can you provide?
2. Should we focus on debt paydown or a 15-year mortgage?
3. What is the ideal interest rate? 4.65% seems to still be competitive in today's market.

personalfinance,"Budgeting $3,300 a month while living in NYC?","I am starting a new job in January which will require me to work in the city. I live about a 2 hour commute, both ways, and have to be on site at 6:30 am. Needless to say, I can't see myself waking up at 4:45 am and driving to Queens for an extended period of time. So, I am trying to figure out a budget to see much rent I  can afford along with the average living expenses to take into consideration. 

I have $20,000 in federal loans with an average rate of 4.7%. My mom is taking care of my private so I wont need to worry about those. The monthly minimum payment will be around $210. I plan on trying to live at home with my parents for at least a few months- 4+. I want to live there as long as possible before moving out to save up money, pay a decent amount toward my loan, and be able to prove income when I apply for apartments. I want to pay at least $1200 a month while I am at home.

My salary is said to be $60,000 annualized, but they said my biweekly pay will be $2,307 which equals to roughly $55,000 a year. What the missing $5,000 a year is I'm assuming bonuses. I am going to stay on my parents insurance until I am 26, 24 now. I want to put 7% into my 401k. Leaving me with $1,957 before taxes. Since my paycheck will be addressed to my parents house, I wont have city tax. 

After taxes and 401k, I'm estimating about  $3,300 a month- maybe a little less. Once I move out and I hopefully paid off $4800 I will probably try to pay off $500 a month for my loans. I don't pay for car insurance and we have no payments on it or cell phone. I figured if I pay off that much of my loan I will be was ahead of schedule and if, for whatever reason, I need to not pay a loan for a month or two it wont kill me. 

So, as of yet, I know  I will have when I move out: 

$350 for 401k

I just graduated from college in May, and I make around $35,500 a year (entry, in a low cost city) in the Clinical Research Field.

I bring in around $2300 a month from my full time job, so I have been doing Doordash approx 20 hours a week (part time) in order to pay this debt (Approx $500.00 a week).

I currently have around $73,151.80 in credit card debt, listed below.  I also have $18,800 in Auto Debt, and $32,500 in Student Loan Debt. So, altogether I have around $124,000 in debt. I am working with a debt management agency and give them $840.00 a month to manage 5 of the accounts.

Please help me come up with a plan. Currently, I am watching the balance of my total debt decrease by around $2,000 a month, but I feel like I am working to pay debt.  

I don't want to be criticized for my mistakes, I just want help.  I feel like I am drowning and it will never end. I am single, have no kids, no girlfriend, and just want to have my finances under control.

Your thoughts on this one? Also posting to r/tax. 

Last year we moved abroad for work within the same company. But I still get paid in my US bank account, and am given a W-4. So it is as if my company sees me as a US employee in the system. Each paycheck, the company deducts taxes too (Fed and CA State), just like before we moved.

Since I have lived in a foreign country now for all of 2019, does that mean I don't have to pay California State taxes now? 

Thanks in advance.

Bitcoin,2020 Will Bring Record Highs for Crypto Assets Despite Pessimism,"The  emotions in the crypto community are in the range from mild boredom on  the positive side to apathy and depression on the other extreme. Despite  the gloomy background, I believe 2020 will be one of the best years in  the history of crypto assets bringing record highs.

Here are the reasons why…

**The broader economy**

We  live in extraordinary times. Central banks are determined to avoid a  recession at all costs by providing liquidity and cutting rates which  creates a speculative investment environment. The low interest rate are  pumping the valuations of almost any asset class and are also making  money managers climb up the risk ladder in search of a meaningful  return. Since government bonds don’t yield anything, investors need to  buy corporate debt, the ones who previously bought corporate bonds are  now into stocks, the stocks loving investors have moved capital to  private equity and venture capital etc.

The  FED balance sheet jumped $370 billion since September in a new program  which is “not QE”. They also cut the rates 3 times this year fighting  against a falling stock market and a “potential global slowdown” due to  the trade wars and Brexit. As a result we have fresh all time highs in  all major US stock indices.

Germany  is hovering around a recession, avoiding it technically with a dismal  0.1% growth in the 3rd quarter of 2019. At the same time the DAX index  was only 1.3% short of making a new all time high this month.

Even  Greece that was on the verge of dropping out of the eurozone four years  ago, managed to issue government debt at a negative rate this year.

The  cost for avoiding a recession creates a distortion in the valuation of  all assets. How do you value anything when interest rates are negative?  For great insights on the topic read Howard Marks’ memo on the [“mysterious” negative interest rates.](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/mysterious.pdf)

This  search for return will drive more people towards riskier asset classes  like growth stocks, venture capital and eventually the luring asymmetric  bet of crypto assets. ""Risk on"" state of mind is what crypto needs as  the whole asset class (even bitcoin) is perceived as very risky.

**US election year**

Trump will do anything to keep the stock market and the economy going in 2020. The argument is short but compelling.

He has been very [vocal](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1190269494788263936?s=20)  about the new highs and didn’t miss the chance to praise himself for  the huge 2019 stock returns. He will likely not do anything that will  blow the positive investor sentiment.

This is another tail wind for risk prone investor behaviour in 2020 which will favour crypto assets.

**The halving narrative**

Bitcoin’s  block reward halving is scheduled to occur in mid May 2020. It will  bring the daily production from 1800 down to 900 coins per day. This  will also cut its annual inflation in half to less than 1.8%. While  being twice less powerful than the previous having in 2016, this  production cut is still going to influence the price. As a self  fulfilling prophecy or a supply-demand result, both previous halvings  were followed by an upward price spiral that resulted in a bubble and a  blow off top. This is relationship is difficult to ignore and if there  is a favourable ""risk on” environment in 2020 there is a good chance it  will happen again. It may also come faster as investors will try to  front run it.

Also, this time we  have halving events in the two major forks of bitcoin which did not  exist back in 2016 - BCH and BSV. Despite being controversial, they are  still among the top 10 largest crypto asset. Their supply cut and  potential price rise may help feed the whole “bitcoin halving” narrative  and create an upward price spiral for the whole sector.

The latest example of a halving was in litecoin this year and it had a very distinct price effect.

**It’s been a while since the last bubble**

It’s  been exactly 2 years after the top of the previous bubble. Most alts  are over 90% down from their all time highs. That is a lot of damage   for the speculative investor who came in 2017 and 2018.

Also  the lows in most coins were set one year ago and have not been broken  down despite prevalent pessimism. This has been a painful environment  for anybody looking for a quick buck.

There  is also a widespread apathy and pessimism among the crypto community  with even hardcore believers changing their forecasts to [mediocre](https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/1209457337393647617?s=20) 2020.

After  2 years and lots of assets down more than 90% from ATH it seems that  most of the coins are held by very strong hands. Therefore downward  pressure is limited and if it occurs it would be mainly driven by short  term speculators.

**Tech development**

The hot word of 2016 was “blockchain”. The whole world got excited about it in 2017. 2019 is the year of DeFi.

In  case bitcoin gets close to $20 000 again the “late"" money will flood  once again to smaller crypto assets seeking higher returns. If/when  bitcoin’s blocks get full and transactions become expensive the old  narrative of “bitcoin doesn’t scale” would become valid again and this  would spread money to BCH, BSV, ETH and others.

Another  potential narrative that exists today is the “decentralised finance”  -  exchanges, derivatives, stablecoins, borrowing, lending all that  infrastructure got far more sophisticated since the last bubble. Apart  from DeFi projects tokens, Ethereum is also poised to be one of the top  beneficiaries of this trend as it hosts most of the DeFI activities.  However the ""Ethereum doesn’t scale"" narrative is also valid so a lot of  money could spill over to the competition in the smart contract space.

It’s  been more than 2 years since the scaling problems became obvious and a  lot of projects that specialised in that domain are up and running.  Others are at the final stages of being launched. What would be a better  test than a real world influx of new users and apps that will try to  fill the capacity. The process of finding a proper scaling pathway will  be pushed forward in case of another bubble.

**Conclusion**

That  scenario will change in case of a global recession that brings the  “risk off” attitude. Then assets will fall into a negative price spiral  and investors will be looking to preserve their capital by fleeing to  “safer” assets. Although such a recession is inevitable at some point,  it seems that central banks have been very good at avoiding it by  kicking the can down the road. If they succeed again in 2020, get ready  for an explosive crypto year. However, do not assume this run will be  the same as 2017. It depends much on the global economy and investors’  risk appetite and it may be cut off earlier and not result in a full  blown bubble like the one from 2017. The sensible investor needs to be  cautious and plan for the short run in this environment.",cryptocurrency

worldpolitics,The Changing Face of Immigration In the U.S.,"In the U.S., illegal immigration surged in the latter part of the decade, and there was a big change in who was trying to enter the country from the Southern border.

As the Mexican economy improved and deportations soared during President Obama’s first term, the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico declined significantly, and in their place came families and children traveling alone, most from the Central American nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

By 2014, Mexican nationals for the first time in modern history made up a minority of border arrests. Nearly 140,000 people traveling as families and children traveling alone made up the new majority. Most asked for asylum, saying they were fleeing violence and corruption in their home countries.

{snip}

Until recently, the families and children seeking asylum were allowed to remain in the U.S. until their claims were decided. Hundreds of thousands are still waiting for that process to play out amid a backlog of more than one million cases pending in immigration court.

In the federal fiscal year ended in September, 65% of those arrested crossing the Mexican border—about 550,000 people—were either traveling as families or were unaccompanied minors. That figure, on the rise since 2017, set off its own crisis as the Trump administration tried to deter migrants through tougher detention policies.

{snip}

In Europe, meanwhile, a steep surge in the number of asylum seekers reaching Europe in 2015 was one of the most momentous political developments on the continent since the eurozone debt crisis broke out five years earlier.

The influx of nearly two million people, mostly from the Middle East, Africa and Afghanistan, bolstered anti-immigration parties from Greece to Sweden, Germany, Spain and Denmark. It also opened a deep rift between Eastern- and Western-European countries over how to spread the burden of caring for the newcomers.

{snip}

By the end of 2016, the U.N. estimated that about 5.2 million refugees had fled to Europe.

personalfinance,Things to consider making the switch from Private sector to Public (Federal Govt),"I have worked the past 5 years out of college as a Mechanical Engineer working in the Private Sector making  between 78-82k. I couldn’t be more thankful for the experience and mentorship I have received at my current company, but lately I have been having doubts about the future. We have struggled the past year landing work, and 4 people have quit within this timeframe. I work in the DC/MD area in an employee owned company with ~30 people. There has been talk of me becoming an associate some time soon, but this would require an investment on my end (which be substantial) to buy in to the company. 

I am currently saving for a down payment on a house and have additional expenses planned in the near future with my girlfriend. I don’t see how I could reasonably afford to buy in to my company and still be able to afford property. I have near 30k saved and houses in this area range from 400-600k, so even 20% down is going to be a struggle to save for. Sensing the uncertainty in my company I began applying to Federal positions half a year ago, and finally landed one recently.

The Engineering position I landed in the Federal Gov’t actually resulted in a decent raise. A GS-11 position Step 9 making ~88k. This money is guaranteed and rated at only working 40 hours a week compared to my current 46ish for my current salary. The job would be COMPLETELY different from what I do now, and there is a big part of me that has always wanted to try something new and not feel stuck doing what I do now forever. 

I am really curious what anyone else would do in my shoes, am I crazy for considering swapping out of the Private industry? I want to put myself in the best position financially in the next couple of years, and everything I read points to the Federal government for stability. I would love any insight or unforeseen perks of joining the federal workforce. 

TLDR: Currently make 78-82k (after overtime/bonuses) with ~46 hour workweeks, offered a 88k federal job with 40 hour work weeks expected. Limited upwards mobility at current job, expected company stock buy-in to become an associate, company forecast not looking great for the coming years with multiple higher ups having left the past year. Saving for a house and potential engagement on the horizon.

Bitcoin,History time: Tell us how you found about Bitcoin and how has it changed your life,"I found BTC in 2011 when Creepypastas where a thing all over YouTube, I watched some dude's video about the deep web and how you could find everything you couldn't find on the ""surface web"".

I downloaded TOR, went through some sites out of curiosity (mostly fake ID sellers) and noticed this weird symbol ₿ I had never seen before.

I did some research of what it meant and I found some sellers accepting PayPal so I bought $30 worth of BTC (close to 15 BTC at that time) and continued browsing the deep web, then I forgot about the whole thing for the next 6 years...

In June 2017, I saw a local news article on how well Bitcoin had been performing throughout 2017, then it hit me: HOLY SHT I HAD SOME OF THOSE COINS, luckily I was able to find my keys and move those coins to an upgraded wallet.

When BTC hit $18,000 I sold 3 coins to help my parents remodel their restaurant, and paid their mortgage (a big ""F*** you"" to the bank in behalf of Satoshi lol).. Now we have a bigger, more beautiful and successful restaurant, no mortgage debt and I still have 12 coins left which I won't sell in the short term, not even to buy a new car.

personalfinance,SECURE Act and 529 State Income Tax,"So I'm been following the recent changes to the 529 tax advantaged savings program in relation to paying back one's own tuition. 

I'm in NY, and just saw [this](https://www.nysaves.org/home.html) banner message that says:

&gt;On December 20, 2019, the federal Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 was signed into law. It includes new provisions that allow 529 Plan account owners to withdraw assets to pay for certain apprenticeship programs and to pay principal and interest on qualified higher education loans for the beneficiary or any of the beneficiary’s siblings. The loan repayment provisions apply to repayments up to $10,000 per individual. These withdrawals will have no federal tax impact. It has not yet been determined whether these types of withdrawals will have New York State income tax consequences.

&gt;This Act is effective for distributions made after December 31, 2018. The new federal law continues to be evaluated as does the tax impact in New York. Additional updates will be posted on this website. Account owners are encouraged to consult a qualified tax advisor about their personal situations.

I thought the SECURE Act as written was pretty straightforward, but each state can decide to do tax deductions as it wants. Feels kind of bad in NY not knowing if the deduction will be available for me (it should, as it's not a federal qualified withdrawal).

financialindependence,Windfall: To landlord or not to landlord,"Hi there. I really don't know what to do and am hoping for your advice.

We are 35 yo married couple with two young kids. We have been steadily moving up in our careers and now make $365k/year combined. We have $275k saved in retirement/education/savings and a $150,000 balance on our condo. We are moving out of the condo into the suburbs into a house where we can grow our family (we want 1-2 more kids). The house is $625,000 and we put 5% down, so the mortgage principal is $595,000 at a 30 year loan @ 3.375% fixed interest rate.

We have only been on our FIRE journey for just a few years now, and its the main reason that we were able to pay down $200k on our $350k condo in just a few years. We were also able to eliminate my wife's debt ($60k) and pay for her masters degree. Our savings rate is about 50%. We have a paid-off cheap car, no debt besides the mortgages on the condo and the new house.

With this move to the burbs, our expenses are going to rapidly decrease. Our current $2,500 monthly daycare bill will become $900/month, for example. We will no longer pay for commute or parking (we will both be working remote). We estimate that every month, after all the bills are paid, we've contributed to retirement and the kids college funds, and pay handsome taxes, we will have $8000 leftover to invest and save. In addition, we will have a $150,000 windfall this upcoming year.

We don't know what to do with this additional monthly savings and windfall. We originally thought we would sell the condo and put the profit into the mortgage. Here's the breakdown:

Original condo price: $350k

Current principal: $150k

Listing price: $410k

Real estate fees: $30k

Profit: $230,000

If we put this $230k into our new mortgage via a recast (not a refinance), then it will lower our monthly payment to $2300, instead of $3500. Then our new mortgage balance will be $365k.

However, we have been wondering if we should actually just pay off our condo mortgage and start renting it out. We can rent it out for $2,400 (identical units in our building are going for that rent). Then we would own it outright and it would make us profit. We would use a property management company since we're not interested in engaging directly with tenants and we're not particularly handy with tools or home repair.

I believe that the FIRE movement is all about low debt and simplicity. I worry that we are complicating things by trying to have two properties and keep a large mortgage on our new home. But then I worry that I'm being shortsighted about the income potential of our city condo. 

We both like working and are more interested in the ""FI"" part of FIRE. Our long term goal is to have more kids, contribute to our community, and build our wealth. The build our wealth part is the part that feels like new territory, and risky. What should we do?

TLDR: Do we sell our condo and put the profit towards our new mortgage, or should we pay off our condo and rent it out for profit?",finance
personalfinance,Taxable brokerage vs. 403(b)?,"In addition to my pension, I also have a Roth IRA I plan to fully max out every year. Once I max it out for 2019, I'm wondering if I should invest using a taxable brokerage account OVER a 403(b) with my employer or if it is more advantageous to max out a 403(b) before making any type of taxable investment. I understand that there are tax advantages with either choosing a 403(b) or a Roth 403(b) that the taxable brokerage does not have, while with the taxable brokerage account, I have more options (so I'd actually be able to select index funds, individual stocks, etc.), whereas if I went with my employer's 403(b) I would have very few options, as well as fewer options for taking the money out at any time (not that I plan to, but certainly the flexibility of a taxable brokerage account is something to consider). I'm really interested in hearing from anyone who could explain the thought process they'd take in determining which of these to invest in first and how you'd approach this decision. I do not plan to max out a 403(b) and feel that I can definitely be riskier with my investments (and therefore go all or mostly stocks on the taxable brokerage) given that I have a pension and plan to max out a Roth IRA every year.

\*\*I've made multiple edits now for clarification, but I should also add that I'm a 32-year-old who is both a W-2 employee but also self-employed with a small business in which I am able to work the number of hours I want to work and will be able to for the foreseeable future (choosing to increase and make additional income once I retire from my W-2 employment). No kids, no current mortgage, no credit card debt, federal loans that should conceivably be forgiven in 7.5 years from PSLF. Just trying to figure out the wisest way to look at where to invest additional money beyond my Roth IRA. Thanks!",finance

I am in a hard self improvement phase of my life because I went through a breakup and want to now buckle down and get some stuff done.

So I’m am in the military and I joined purely on the fact I didn’t want to go to college. My mom was struggling so I had a plan to get a credit card and help her out. I went to the bank and they approved me for 13,000 dollars! Me being young and dumb 19 year old I let her use it and I was buying stuff left and right. Now I’m 13k in the hole. Then on top of that I got hit with fraud and someone applied for a 10k loan in my name where the bank could only help me pay half of so I got another 5k on top of that. I’ve been paying it but went I was in deployment I wasn’t able to keep up with the payments and my credit score tanked. 

Now I’m here needing a car in order to live my life because it’s impossible to live where I live where the closest thing is an hour a way from base. I need to try and gain control of this debt so I can build my credit score back up and get a car. Ima try and put all the relevant information below but feel free to ask questions.

Credit Card
Amount Owed: $12,986
Interest Rate: 11.15%

Account 2:
Personal Loan (Fraud)
Amount Owed: $2,771
Interest Rate: 17.45%

Monthly Income:
Biweekly: $900-$1,000

This is all the debt I have in my name and my credit score gets worse by the day. I don’t know if I should just knock out the small debt real quick or focus paying both. I need to get a car so I don’t know if I should just borrow a family member car and just get added to the insurance or get one co-signed. A car might be out of my reach for now and that’s fine if I need to focus on bringing my credit score up. Any help is appreciated.

personalfinance,Credit inquiries fell off one but not the other.,"Sorry in advance I’m on mobile and haven’t slept.

I’m not sure if this is the right place for this question but I’ll ask away, (back story) my credit used to be like in the low 300s high 200s due to some debt falling to me from my parents when I turned 18, around 1500-2000 not a lot but I haven’t made over the federal minimum wage until this last year so I hadn’t been able to do anything about it and over the last three years they’ve been taking all of my tax refund (only a few hundred each time). I moved to a new state and started to contact the collection agencies and have sort of got the ball rolling (they removed the collection from what I can see but I haven’t made a payment other than a $5 commitment to setting up a payment plan) currently my credit is sitting high 500s all across the board and two months ago 6+ hard inquiries fell off my equifax (mostly apartment hunting last year and a car loan check which I didn’t take in the end) but my transunion still has 7 hard inquiries which were the same ones that were removed from equifax which is resulting in a 40+ point difference in the two. 

Is there a way I can get transunion to drop the hard inquires or do I have to wait until they sort it out? 

Also any other tips for helping my credit get better would be of great help.",finance

personalfinance,2020 Money Planning,"Hello PF,

I was looking for some help or opinions on the financial plan that the Wife and I plan on working on in 2020. Some of this stuff is very confusing and even after several days of research I am not quite sure I have all the answers I need to make a informed decision so I am coming here for some possible clarification.

Some general background for 2020. Wife and I, no kids and in our late 20's. We own a home and owe around 167k @ 4.375% that was purchased in 2017 via VA loan. Our income for 2020 is going to be roughly 200-210k with around 180k of that income falling under the foreign earned income exclusion as we are both DOD contractors outside the states. The rest will either be interest or tax exempt income from veterans affairs compensation. Wife has 35k worth of student loans with around 15k being private and 20k being federal. The student loans are at around 7.5% if I am not mistaken. Between the two of us I expect our total expenses to be around 25-28k with mortgage included. Other than the mortgage and student loans we have no other debt. We have two vehicles but both are completely paid for. We are both Texas residents.  With that out of the way let us begin.

&amp;#x200B;

1. With the FEIE what sort of options do we have for investing for retirement? Our company offers a 401k but no match and unfortunately my wife opted out of hers and is unable to opt back in. They do have options for post tax contributions but I am not sure how that works with our income exclusion. Originally I was going to try and max out the 401k on my end and roll it over to a traditional IRA, but it looks as if that is not an option until we leave the company. We will most likely be leaving in December 2020 but a lot can change in a year.
2. We are looking to refinance our mortgage and were looking into doing a VA IRRRL to hopefully get enough of a reduction to warrant the refinance. Our financial situation was much different when we originally purchased the home so I do think we can get a competitive rate, and with a VA disability % it is my understanding that we would be exempt from the funding fee on the refinance. This I feel pretty understanding on but it will just take time to shop around for rates. Does this look like it would be worth pursuing or is there other options out there I might benefit more from?
3. Kind of similar to #1 but a coworker of mine explained that he was able to essentially turn off his FEIE for a few months to have taxable income in case he did not complete a whole year and ended up owing taxes. Is this legitimate and if so would this be a way to meet the requirements for a contribution into a Roth IRA as long as we do not pass the income threshold? It sounded a little sketch but I am new to contracting and FEIE.

For now that is all the questions I have. I also think I will look into contacting a CPA to assist with tax planning and taxes in general, but going in with a little more knowledge would be helpful. The internet here is not the greatest so I do not know how well I will be able to reply back to responses so I will thank you all ahead of time for reading and responding. I will also try to update with any more pertinent information if it comes up in the comments.",finance

personalfinance,Where do I start with finance savings accounts or 401k?,"I'm looking for where to start being better with my money. 

No one in my family has ever actually had enough money to save for retirement and most of them are in alot. Of credit card debt and horrible credit. That being the case, I've never been taught about 401k or  a savings account. I read the wiki but allot of it is over my head as I've never had any experience with this side of money, so was hoping a post would get a bit better advice. 

My finance break down right now:

Income:


I currently make about 52k a year after a bonus I make 55k. 


Student loans:


I have 60k in student debt federal with average interest of 4.8%

15 k in state at an interest rate of 1%

Total monthly is about 800. 


Transportation:
I own my car and motorcycle out right. My insurance for both is only $100 and I have renters insurance it's about 25 a month.  Maintenance is really light as I do my oil changes myself and both are reliable. I go through a tank of gas about every 2 weeks with my car which is only 25 - 30. And my bike lasts about a week and half for less than 10 bucks. So gas isn't killing me. 


Housing:
I rent a nice place with a roommate. Rents 1200 a month for my end. I will not find something better as a cost to location, cost to size, cost to quality. It's just the best deal I will find in my area.

Bills are about 140 at on my end. 


Credit card debt:

I have about 400 dollars on my 1 credit card.



End of the month after all bills and expenses, I bring home enough to cover everything  but I help significant other who has health issues where I wind up  having $300-$500 left at the end of the month more if I don't have unexpected costs pop up which is hardly ever. 



401k:
My job does 6% matching and vesting as 25% at 2 years, 50% at 3, 75% at 4 and 100% at 5 years 

Im already eligible to participate in the 401k but have not started it. 



Bank:
I have just a checking that I use for all of my bills and it's where I keep my money.




Should I get a savings? What's the difference between it and checking? Should I start a 401k instead of savings?

Honestly any help would be greatly appreciated.

2. Also, with interest rates *so low* right now, it doesn't seem like debt is going to get any cheaper (I guess in theory, we could go to zero or negative Fed rates).  Is the relationship of corporate bond principal value and interest rates the same as government bonds?  That is, as interest rates go up, the value of the bond principal that you're holding goes down?

I'm assuming that maybe one of those got transferred or something. Can they really keep putting more accounts on my credit? 



The loan is a Direct Stafford Subsidized

Literally any advice or insight about any of this would be extremely helpful and if you need more relevant information, I'll be happy to provide it.",finance

The e-commerce company said that ""billions of items were purchased"" along with ""tens of millions of Amazon devices"" worldwide during the holiday season. As many as 5 million people signed up for a Prime membership, and independent third-party sellers also surpassed a billion items sold, the company said in a press release. Amazon didn't give further details about holiday sales. 

Even though the holiday season was shorter than usual this year, online sales overall hit fresh highs, according to a Thursday report from Mastercard. E-commerce sales made up 15% of all holiday revenue, giving retailers a needed end-of-year boost - the holiday season accounts for about a fifth of US retailers' yearly revenue, Bloomberg reported, citing the National Retail Federation. 

Online sales were also a win for department stores that have struggled to drive traffic to brick-and-mortar locations this year. While in-store sales dipped 1.8% from a year ago, online sales at department stores surged nearly 7% this holiday season. Shares of department stores such as Macy's, Nordstrom, and JCPenney advanced in trading Thursday.

Two of Amazon's biggest competitors, big-box chains Target and Walmart, were down slightly in early trading Thursday.

personalfinance,Closing a bank account/credit card in Canada?,"So my situation has changed a bit this year. I have always had a bank account ever since I was a little kid with a certain bank [bank A]. After high school, I opened a MasterCard with bank A, and the limit has always been 500 dollars. I've had the pleasure of paying 10 dollars a month to the bank for letting them hold my money, 30 dollars from time to time without warning for a ""maintenance fee"", and 45 dollars every time I go over 500 on my MasterCard (happens sometimes, it used to just say ""declined"" at the store, but now it goes through and I owe money).

This year, I finally got into medical school. Money is *no longer a big worry*, as long as I don't pretend I'm a fake rich guy and go into debt too fast. I have access to a big ol' line of credit with a low interest rate, and student loans with an even lower interest rate. I have a better ""big swingin' dick"" Visa card with a limit of 10,000 dollars, and an account to match with NO FEES AT ALL, except an overdraft fee of less than 10 dollars if I use overdraft protection of up to 5000 dollars. Put simply, as long as I keep spending like a student, I don't have to be nearly as careful with how much is in my account.

Now, the question. I've got my free ""right this way, sir"" account which waives fees because they want to hold my doctor money for me in 8 or 10 years or whatever, but I still have my little kid account which isn't very useful and drains about 200 dollars from me every year for no great reason. 

Also, from my understanding, I can build credit faster when I use a card with a higher limit, when I keep the amount used under 30% of the total credit, and pay it off properly. So it's a good reason to use the Platinum Diamond-Encrusted Visa over the smelly old Mastercard.

Is there any reason why I should not cancel the Mastercard and close my account with bank A? Will it screw up my credit at all, for example? I've already transferred everything direct withdraw over to the new account.",finance

personalfinance,What are the Implications of Redeeming US Savings Bonds on my Taxes,"Hello everyone! So today, at long last, my parents founds my savings bonds originally for college only a few years after I had graduated (lol). Anyways, since I can’t use them towards school for tax free usage, I know there is some taxation in here. I am confused as I see sources say it’ll only be at the federal level but I can’t discern if it is an addition to total taxable income or if the interest is going to go through an excise tax (or both). It seems a little ridiculous that my income from these would be taxed as part of income given it came from a US security, but the US does love taxing everything it sees. Could anyone tell me if its just an addition to federal taxable income, a separate excise tax (of 2.5% I believe), or a combination thereof? Or if I am missing something.

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Used Car Loan Interest Rates?,I've never had a car loan before. I have credit over 800 and may be interested in financing up to $15k for a used car. What's a good rate?

personalfinance,Tax return question,"Refund question

Obviously I know that you can’t file until the end of January, but I was doing some calculations. Last year my refund was around $1500 and then this year my refund is around $300. Obviously this can change, but from my last check I was able to come up with some numbers and someone may be able to better assist. My taxable wages were $67,061. Federal tax taken out was $8243 and my state was $4201. I used some of the calculators online and it was around $300 as my refund. I work for the government so I’m paying into a pension as well as a 457B, healthcare, and Dental taken out as well. I’m 29. Single filing and not head of household. Should I up my dedications for federal? Any thought soils be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Looking to purchase a car for the first time by myself,"Hello! Thank you to anyone who reads this and also I apologize for formatting. I am on mobile. I currently drive a 2002 Honda Accord with over 200k miles that most likely has transmission issues. I have been looking at possibly getting a new car. I used to want a brand new car, but from what I’ve read, purchasing used is typically better. 

The car I am looking at is a 2018 Mazda CX 5 with 40k miles on it. The final cost would be 24,335 and I am looking at giving a 4,000 down payment. I was informed by the car dealership I would have an interest rate in the 6%, but was unable to specify the exact interest rate. I have one line of credit and this would be the first time I am getting a loan for anything. I have 17,000 saved up right now and plan on making more than the minimal monthly payment, which was estimated at 380$. I have minimal car knowledge and am not sure if this is a good deal or not. I like the car itself and still have to speak with my insurance regarding price, but wanted to know if the prices I’m looking at are reasonable. The car has a few minimal scratches I didn’t notice but my brother did. There is some light stains inside the car, but I’m not worried about them. If I’m missing any information let me know. I just want any advice or to be made aware if I’m missing anything 

Thank you very much.

Edit: Forgot to add that I make roughly 1200 biweekly, and the only other expense I have is my credit card which I owe 2,000 on. I pay 70$ monthly as well for my phone. Other than that I spend my money on groceries and things of that nature.",finance

personalfinance,What would give you 0% or negative interest rate?,"What kind of deal that will give you capital in advance without charging interest rate?

Ironically, the first thing I thought of is credit card. If one uses credit card wisely by paying the full amount on time every month, there will be no interest fee. And if you have 1% cash back, that’s actually a loan that gives you negative interest. 

I know many people make use of the credit card this way, just wonder if there are any other things as well.",finance
btc,How they fleece you,"I like the credit card debt. The interest is from 20% to 80%, reflecting the real cost of risk and, the time preference, and the money devaluation (but see below for money unit creation). Some people don't pay back, some do. It increases in volume slightly, but it is not galloping, so some pay back, and the issuer can have an average profit. They lend money and hope that the debtor can and wants to pay back. 

Most loans are regulated some way. Like student loans - the debtor has not shown any capacity to pay back, still they are given to everybody. Clearly, the risk is paid for by someone else, and that could be you! The same with mortgages, the state is heavily involved. The low interest rate is the result of money creation, and it distorts all calculations, to their benefit, not yours.

All interest today can be regarded as usury - because it is not earned money they lend out, the lender does not defer their spending of rightfully earned money. Most is created by fractional reserve banking, a practise that was made legal a couple of hundred years ago, before that, it was regarded as a crime. When it came to light among the bankers in Venezia, the depositors got furious and broke the bankers bench, they literally went bankrupt, their bank/bench was left in pieces in the agora. This is all hidden, and the initial scam is the central bank: A broke banker colluded with the broke state, the broke banker lent nonexisting money to the state on the condition that the state deposited the same nonexisting money in the bank. Now the bank had reserves, and could start taking deposits, and lending out to the public. From nothing.

Now the state/bankers depend on perpetuating this. The money unit number has to increase all the time. It is not to your advantage, it is for the purpose of the bankers. They need the ability to create more units, by writing a higher number on their own account and  multiplying it with fractional reserve. Bitcoin puts a stop to this, because you can not write that higher number into your own account.

But they have gold! Well do they huh? With every failed state we see that there is no gold. The only reason for a state to have gold, is for the fallen leaders to run away with a bar or two when they are chased out of the place.

Do they facilitate payments in an efficient way to the benefit of the customers? Well they have clumsy systems, and since there are infighting, we have different fiats. It is almost impossible for the user to see all the hidden costs. The spread in exchange for instance. One way to look at it, is the size of the world profits that is in banking. It is somewhere between 20% and 30% of all value creation. We have miniscule city states that do nothing more than finance, and they are the most prosperous places.

gaming,Just finished my second RDR2 play through. What do you think would be a good RDR3?,"I've got 2 ideas. Just rough.

I'd like to see about the Australian outback and it's outlaw culture. It was pretty rich, and the armour from the RDRo mission ""Kill Them, Each and Every One"" is actually inspired by a famous Australian outlaws bank robbing attire. I really like this idea if they wanted to keep the RDR feel without fucking up the awesome RDR we already have. It'd be super cool, new, and still fully familiar.

My second idea is 1920s England. Think Peaky Blinders. It wouldn't be quite the same but tech wasn't much more than it is in RDR2 at that point, and the most you'd see of motor vehicles is an extremely expensive, extremely rare, extremely slow moving car. If you watch Peaky Blinders, you know that the plot could he as weaving and interesting as RDR2 as there are hundreds of variables weighing on the environment. They could do a big city 4 or 5 times the size of saint Denis and then have outskirts and wild-ish lands beyond that. With RDR2 being so dense and large it's not a stretch to think a bigger world stuffed with all variety of cool shit could be possible. I think this one is best to keep the amazing story and stuffed world of RDR2 while not ruining the RDR vibe.

Edit: Probably too late for anyone to see this but I had a third idea. A game following Sadie in her story after RDR2, assuming she went to south America like she said. Argentina could be a hella cool setting. Gauchos, the wild life, wide open planes and mountains that are unfamiliar yet well different from the American western ones. This is the best I think they could do to stick to familiar character(s) without trivializing RDR 1 and 2.",technology
personalfinance,"(MX) First time Debt Consolidation Just turned 27, Where do I go from here?","Hello,

I just turned 27 last week and I've made some good (and very bad) decisions along the way. I opened many credit lines, helped friends, lost control of my budget, went along with lifestyle creep and found myself in the following situation:

**Brief:**

Currently working as a small time business owner earning ~$63,350.00 MXN/month, this is going to change in 2020 to ~ **$58,850 MXN /month**, I have made adjustments to offset the lack of income with the corresponding decrease in expenditures

This is more money than I've made my entire life, more than most of my family has made and they all have college degrees, master's and some even PhDs. I am the college dropout 

**Here's where I dropped the ball:**

Lifestyle creep came by swiftly and I sunk all my savings, since I am independent I have invested everything into the business and then some, made horrible personal decisions along the way

I am now $160,000 MXN in debt which has been eating away at my cash flow tremendously due to the high interest Credit Card debt that is as follows:

* AMEX 1 | $50,000.00 MXN | 65% Interest
* Mastercard 1 | $45,000 MXN | 41% Interest
* AMEX 2 | $19,000.00 MXN | 58% Interest
* VISA | $31,000 MXN | 33% Interest
* Mastercard 2 | $4,000 MXN | 58% Interest

**Total CC Debt due Dec 31 to not generate further interest:**
**$149,000**


Reviewing all my Credit Card Statements that came due this means that I am due to pay **$6,084.38 MXN** just in interest alone, and since interest carries 16% VAT tax the real amount is: **$7,057.88** which is over 10% of my income and would make it my second biggest expense after rent (at least it will be tax deductible)


**Advice needed**

I took out my largest loan ever at **$180,000 MXN** loan that is structured the following way (this is the best offer I could find in short notice to be deposited by year's end):

* Credit Amount: $180,000
* Opening Fee: $10,440 (5.8% of total - includes VAT)
* Express Deposit Fee: (2.32% of total - includes VAT)
* Net payment to be deposited: $165,384.00
* Total payment at end of term: $275,086.22 (includes VAT over interest payments)
* Term length: 36 months
* Monthly payment: $7,641.28 (includes principal, interest and VAT)
* Annualized interest rate: 25.90%

I intend to fully pay off all CC debts but I do not know where to go from here,
Making a budget for all the following months and considering this expenditure I can realistically hit a goal to save **10,000 MXN/mo** all things considered.

**Things to note**:

* I am big on insurance, currently have a $4,000,000 MXN life and invalidation policy and just purchased an additional savings package that you pay into for 10yrs and yields lifetime growth that gives inflation + capital growth % (don't know what they're called in the US), this in addition to health, robbery, fraud, damages, and broad car insurance.
* I pay into these in a yearly fashion. They are around ~$64,000 MXN/year which would average about to ~$5,000/month

personalfinance,2019 Federal Income Tax question.,"**TL:DR** Can the standard deduction count against short-term capital gains?

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to click on this post and read my question.

This year, 2019, I graduated from college and tried to find a job. I didn't succeed until recently and start on the 30th. So, in terms of wage-related income taxes, there probably won't be much of anything for this year.

However, I made some money trading options contracts over the summer and was dumb enough to realize the profits. Now, the Treasury is going to want a bunch of money from me in April. I have a sizable amount of carried-forward losses from 2018, but they aren't enough to completely eliminate my gain in 2019.

Since I won't have much in the way of wage income this year, can I use the standard deduction to count against my short-term capital gains?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

In the past decade $25 trillion in stock market value was added, with especially tech stocks being great performers. The next decade is expected to continue the tech revolution. Another sector that is expected to see high growth is the renewable energy sector and industries related to it.

Analysts expect more cheap money from central banks ahead, and other government stimuli to delay an inevitable recession.

The halt to further globalization and inflated stock prices due to low interest rates would predict that average returns in the next decade will be lower.

personalfinance,Daunted by student loan debt and struggling with a poor credit score. What is my best course of action?,"Personal pre-tax income: $98,000/yr

Total savings: $20,000 (6 months expenses, emergency fund)

Total debt remaining: $104k: $50k in Federal Direct Loans, $54k in NJCLASS Family loans.

A little backstory to how I got here:

I graduated in May 2018 from a 5 year BS/MS program. Since June 2018 I have been working full-time.

My dad lost his job in early 2018, and when I graduated he and I discussed my student loan situation. He told me that he would be able to pay my NJCLASS family loans if I could take on the Federal Direct loans. I was making enough money that I could handle both if need be, however.

Unbeknownst to me, my dad never made the payments for Jan and Feb 2019 for the NJCLASS loans. I guess either he forgot, or didn't have the money for it. For whatever reason, he never told me or asked me to take over the payments. I was contacted in March by the loan service telling me of the situation, and I have since payed all of the late payments and have been making the minimum monthly payments on both loans for this year.

Unfortunately those late payments really tanked my credit score. My score was 667 before this all happened. At its worst, it had dropped to 509 in March. Since then my score has climbed back slowly to 579.

I made the minimum payments (~$1100/mo, pretty equal between the two at $550 each) on my loans all year while I built up a 6 month savings fund. My budget, now that I am not putting anything into savings anymore, can allow me to put $1750-$2000 towards paying off my loans each month.

All of my federal direct loans have interest rates somewhere in the range of 3.8%-6%, and the NJCLASS loans have interest rates somewhere in the range of 5.1%-8.6%.

What is my best option to handle this situation? I have been trying to raise my credit score as much as possible this year by making all of my payments on time, spending &lt;30% of my credit card limit and always paying off the total amount each month. But I think my score is still way too low to qualify for any refinancing options.

I'm really concerned that if my credit score doesn't improve I won't really be able to improve my loan situation much, and I also won't be able to qualify for just about any housing/apartment applications. At the rate I'm paying loans currently it could take 12+ years before I'm finished with them and I'd like to try to get that done much faster so I can save for retirement. I am putting 6% into my 401k since my employer matches up to 6%, but nothing else is being saved for retirement.

I have a 6 figure income and they have 6-figure debts.,"TLDR: My intransigent step-father doesn't understand basic personal finance - has incurred a tremendous amount of debt and on average was cashflow negative ~20k/year over the last 15 years; Mother has cancer and can't work; I don't want to be a piggy bank.                 


I'm going to preface this with ""I'm not the guy with the problem"" at least in terms of habbits.
I'm in my 20s with - 


Personal income: 200+k pre-tax; it will likely grow as I get promotions and more stock-equity                   
Personal living expenses are around 22k (post tax) and I do a good job of ""fun on the cheap"" - think travel all over the US, 1-2 week vacations overseas on the cheap, etc. I still have roommates, I eat free food from work when I can. I don't have cable TV. I wear clothes until they're worn. I try to do my own haircuts every so often, etc. Most of my hobbies are cheap/free/profitable. I don't have a car and bicycle to work (partially for health, partially for savings).  
Personal Assets: 200k 401k; 120k liquid and have around 200k worth of stocks/RSUs from work that'll vest years later.
Education: BS + MS from 2 elite schools, mostly covered by scholarships and working 30+ hours a week during HS + college + grad school
Debts: CC auto-paid, $50ish of low interest student loans/month

Here's the problem: my mother married a guy whose habits have caused a financial burden. He runs his own company which may or may not make money. My mother is the type of person who doesn't use HVAC, doesn't bother spending money to get the dogs treated for fleas, etc. to save on funds.            
She's refinanced her house a number of times and I get the feeling that between the 2 of them they have around 100k in credit card debt, WACG is around 15%.            
My mother also has incurable (but treatable) cancer and I've been replacing her income (not included in personal expenses) for a bit now while she's regaining the ability to do things like walk.            
My best guess is that they'd be cashflow negative by around 5-6k a year IF what I have for their expenses is accurate. I suspect that there's a bit more waste (an additional-5k?)           
House has ~400k equity and a 400k 30 year 3.8% note on it. It's also in a state of disrepair(not good, not terrible) and their roommate is paying ~70% of what other rooms would go for in the area. In theory I inherit half the house and the other half when my step-father dies. 100% of 0 is 0 though, should the equity be drained down.   
My mother is trying to get SSDI and will be eligible for regular social security mid-next year. Most of her cancer treatments
My step-father's father will pass and will leave SOME funds that could help. I don't expect a miracle.
My mother HAD inherited 120k 2 years ago. This mostly went towards ill-advised business ventures. Here and now, my business advice(same as my mother's, basically common sense) is being listened to more and it DOES seem to be helping a lot. I don't want to expect miracles with any future cash transfers though.          


Biggest quasi-discretionary expenses on their end:           
Trucks - there's 2 newish trucks for the business with notes at ~$450/month  (not sure how to socially engineer change here)              
Motorcycles - 2 motorcycles with notes of ~$200/month (not sure how to socially engineer change here)                 
Cable TV - $120ish (I'm going to assume I can cut the cord here)                  
There's also some modest gains from being more efficient with electricity/heat but they'd be marginal.           


Goal: I want sustainability; I don't want to be a piggy bank. I don't want to ""throw good money after bad"".         
Some additional constraints - step father has multiple felonies, dyslexia(?), no HS diploma/GED, etc. and couldn't be expected to get a normal job. His business requires space (a garage, a room, etc.) and if he didn't have a house to use, he'd be 100% unemployed.            


Things I'm thinking about:
1. Having a ""come to Jesus"" talk where I outline the situation in layman's terms. I'm going to have the step father locate costs to cut. I have made charts in excel.
2. Offering a loan that would help cover some of the higher interest rate loans. This would be backed by... the fact that I'm giving them around 45k a year (after tax) that I could simply withhold. 
3. Is there some point where I should say ""enough is enough?"" I don't want my mother to die a slow, painful death from cancer but... should I outline the terms and conditions under which I'll help?",finance

personalfinance,Paying off student loans may harm my credit score. Should I hold off long enough to get a mortgage first?,"I’ve built up an ‘excellent’ credit score (just shy of 800), but all my oldest accounts are student loans. I’d really like to pay those loans off and could easily do so without depleting my emergency fund or savings in less than 1 year. It’s probably silly, but I’ve been hesitating to take the leap out of concern for my credit score.


I’ve heard that paying off loans can tank credit score. Closing out these loans would reduce my credit variety and account age (from about 10 years down to 3). I’m not sure what kind of score this would leave me with and haven’t been able to find a calculator which can give me an estimate of the ‘damage’. That scares me and I worry that paying off this debt will shoot me in the foot when it comes to buying a home.


I’ve been saving up for a down-payment on a house and would like to take out a mortgage in the next 2 to 2.5 years. Right now, I have about 14k left in fixed rate student loans with an average interest rate of 4.37%. I’m paid ahead on all the loans even though not actually pushing for payoff (yet). I have no other debt.


Should I bite the bullet and pay this debt off or is it wiser to wait until I have a mortgage to take advantage of the lower interest rate eligibility? I see that it is not recommended to stretch loans to build credit score, but I'm not sure if the same applies to maintaining a score in this circumstance.",finance
personalfinance,New Job: W2 vs 1099,"Hi all,

A company headhunted my wife for a new federal contracting job. She currently makes 88k/yr as a w-2 employee. She gets 401k matching up to 5%, 18 days PTO per year, and 10 paid holidays. She doesn't use health benefits as I am a federal employee so we use mine. 

The other contract company offering either 120k/yr as a W-2 employee with 10 days PTO and 4% 401k matching OR a 1099 employee at $78 per hour (roughly 150k after factoring in non paid days). I know the hourly rate is much higher but after all the days off, taxes, etc are factored in, is it worth the move to 1099? I'm worried about having to create and maintain the LLC, paperwork involved, and any other costs that are involved in maintaining an LLC that I'm not aware of. Even looked in to the S Corp route for further tax breaks but that seems even more overwhelming.

personalfinance,Which Balance Transfer should you Pay Off First (or does it not matter)?,"So, I recently got two balance transfers (Chase Slate and AMEX EveryDay) for about $5000 each ($10,000, in total) - Both are 0 interest, as well as have 0 BT fees for 15 months...I paid off my credit card debt this past year from about $20,000 to $10,000 (where it is now). This was mostly all older debt, from when I was struggling and couldn't find a job. Once I got a job, I got serious about finally paying down my debts.

I had previously been following the Avalanche method of paying down the highest interest rate credit card, so I'm wondering now if I should pay both of these off equally, or if I should focus on one (while making minimums on the other). The APR's for the Balance Transfer's are obviously both high after the 15-month intro rates (22% for Chase, 23.5% for AMEX).

I plan on paying them both off within the intro rate period, however, if anything should remain, I would probably just take another balance transfer for the remaining amount. My FICO is around 736 right now (UTIL is sub 30%), and I project it to continue to rise as continue to chip off more and more of my debt. I haven't used my credit cards at all throughout this time of re-paying my debt.",finance
personalfinance,Pay Off $70k in Student Loans with 2 hour one-way commute over 2 years (with WFH options) or move and increase loan period (and interest)?,"I'm a 25 year old male working in NYC as a management consultant. I've been living in the NYC/surrounding area for the past year and a half. After paying roughly $30k in my student loans over the past 2.5 years, only roughly $20k of which was applied to the principle, I still have about $70k left to pay off. For further context, I make $90k in gross income, and get to keep roughly 70% of that. Bonus might be like 10% before taxes, not exactly sure yet. I pay about $1k in loans every month (the minimum payments for both private and federal add up to roughly $770. It will take me *years* to make progress like this.

My current living situation is $1200/month outside of the city but still close, with about $100 in utilities/internet, etc. Its a two bedroom, 1.5 bath in which I got really lucky, as my roommate pays much more than I do. I travel a lot for work, so i am close to the airport, which is nice. I am typically gone 1 week/month, and in the busy season maybe 2 weeks/month. My current commute, including a 15 min walk, is about 35 minutes, which is great because in my first job i commuted 1 hour 20 min each way. My lease terms are about to expire in mid-to-late February, and I'm facing a dilemma in which i need some more perspectives on. I also have a girlfriend, though my social life has been compressed with this current living situation because of roommate and neighbors. Below are what I believe to be my options:

Option A) - move in with a stranger in a 2 bedroom apartment. After (hopefully) appropriate vetting, I can find someone to live with in a still decent area. I work from home maybe once a week, though i have the option to WFH more/less depending on the week and projects. With this situation, I can have my own place, freedom, living room, etc. without feeling like I live in a typical NYC cage apartment. This however, will probably cost around $1500 minimum (rough estimate). Though living in this sort of situation would be comfortable and commute would theoretically be similar/easy. 

Option B) is to live in a flex. This means having two roommates in a 2 bedroom apartment, effectively transforming the living room into a bedroom. I can also be close to the city area/airport in this sort of situation, and still have nice amenities with a larger building. I would estimate that living like this would be around $1100-$1200, which is where I am now but with less living space. The non-financial cost here is privacy: I fear living with random people (poor experience in past), I want to be able to have my girlfriend over from time to time, and maybe have a friend sleep over once every 6-8 weeks (don't go out too often but need to let off steam from time to time). I also fear that with such limited space, I won't WFH much.

My final option, which I've been leaning on heavily, is to move home with my parents, like I did in my first job. In this situation, I will not pay any rent, so I can turn that $1200 in current rent towards my student loans, upping the ante to $2200. When I reach my desired liquid safety net of ~$15-16k cash (6 months worth of bills!) by around October 2020, I can stop throwing $1k into my savings account per month and move that into my student loan payments, increasing those payments to roughly $3,300 by October 2020. In doing this, I've roughly calculated that I can pay off almost all of my student loans in roughly 2.5 years. This math only makes sense if i hold my current pay, payments, and assumed bonus constant over the next couple of years. In this situation, I would probably WFH 2-3x/week and go into the office for the rest. Since my family does not live close to an airport, I would predict staying in an AirBnB the night before flights, possibly the night after flights. This would be an outofpocket expense as neither my employer nor clients would expense this. In 2019, I traveled on average 1.5x/month, and if i assume an Airbnb per night near the airport are about $200 after all fees, that would be an average of $350 in ""rent"" and then I would commute back home. Cost of food, etc. would also go down.

My concerns are as follows: 

I want to pay off my student loans as fast as possible so I can have financial freedom. 

I don't necessarily want to sacrifice the entirety of my mid-20s social life. So i may airbnb ore than just before work flights and sometimes on the weekends for fun. This would fall into that once every 6-8 week schedule. 

I don't want to limit my career or my health by commuting so much. My number one fear actually is finding time to workout, which I'm rationalizing in my head I can do on WFH days if i live with my parents, but i don't know how consistent that will end up being. 

The kicker, however, is that I can live at home with my parents for any amount of time, and then decide to move back into the NYC area - at any time. 

My question is, do you think its worth it to sacrifice the remainder of my mid-20s in order to be financially free by age ~27? I know on paper it makes sense, again, i just fear the impact on my health, career, and social life.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Crypto.com: Any thoughts?,"I decided to put some thoughts together after my experience using Crypto dot com (CDC). I didn't really manage to find many reviews and breakdowns before joining the platform myself, so thought it might be helpful to those considering joining to be able to see all their offerings in one go since they also don't have a lot of this info easily accessible.

If you have experience using them and have your own thoughts, feel free to chime in.

Review Link: [HERE](https://medium.com/@cryptobuffett/pros-cons-my-experience-using-crypto-com-143566336bf9?sk=8dc1030c185ac5291ea415b606caea2c)

I'll summarize most of my thoughts - I think they have a great product, one of the best app UXs I've had the pleasure of using that trumps the competition (like Celsius). The In-App Support feature is also unrivaled, and blows me away that you can speak to a live-human in app within minutes. The Cashback on the debit card is a nice feature, and tho, I'd personally prefer receiving cash or btc directly as opposed to MCO, it is a great way to increase your exposure passively as you go about your day especially if you believe in CDC and their future. I do wish they had an auto-top up feature allowing us to auto-convert our crypto when we spend. It takes an adjustment using basically a prepaid debit card and loading up funds before purchase, making sure you don't go over available balance.

As far as an all in one ecosystem goes, they've largely succeeded in creating a seamless user experience and having industry-leading interest rates in their Earn program doesn't hurt. I'm a big fan of lending out crypto and earning interest, I'd like to know more about what they do with our crypto since earning 12% on stablecoins is unheard of (with MCO staked) - the closest being blockfi at 8.6% - I can't imagine these rates will last much longer as it can't be sustainable. Adding the new crypto exchange was definitely a surprise and I have concerns they maybe spreading themselves too thin a bit. There are many other milestones and promises that need to be met, so I hope this doesn't cause them to fall behind even more.

The MCO staking requirements for various services, especially the Debit Card maybe a hard pill to swallow for more casual users who aren't as crypto inclined (minor speed bump to adoption - and yes I know the free midnight blue is an option). I think the idea of putting a couple hundred dollars on the line with a largely unknown company like CDC in return for $50 might be stretch especially when some make it seem like it's free money. I know it sounds fine for those who were already planning on getting the MCO card anyways - but it just feels like an additional step that won't necessarily make sense to many when they can simply apply for an account/debit card at a globally recognized bank without the collateral risk...overall a hard-sell for the masses, I don't see regular folks joining up anytime soon unless they're a true crypto fan or just really want free netflix and spotify. That being said, in due time, if CDC continues its domination and expansion into new global markets with no issues, I'm sure their reputation will grow with it.

They've also done this thing where users can purchase coins that aren't fully integrated into their system...which I just don't understand...why would anyone want to buy a coin they can't deposit or withdraw from the app. I find this a bit puzzling.

Kris has mentioned they will be fully profitable by 2020, which is good news as many were curious how they were able to afford many of the perks they provide their users - again, no figures/data to backup his claim so we'll have to take his word for it. I do hope they become more transparent with their platform performance and figures, but we'll see if they ever do.

Kris has also mentioned developing DEFI solutions for many of their products that would allow users to retain keys to their crypto which would be a fantastic step forward and could be a turning point if it does come to fruition for many other platforms to follow suit.

The addition of the native currency CRO in addition to the original MCO mucks up the waters a bit for me and has been a divisive topic for many early adopters. I don't personally see why it was necessary to create a new coin as opposed adding new features to MCO's token utility and developing both coins in tandem seems like a monumental task - hopefully the team is up for the challenge.

But all in all a solid product that is bringing the heat to legacy banking (albeit piggybacking on Visa's infrastructure and reach ironically) - I hope to continue seeing improvements with their products in the months to come.

If mass adoption is to become a reality, this is how it happens.

For those considering CDC or already using their product whether it's their card or app. What are your thoughts? Positive or negative?",cryptocurrency

investing,My personal opinion on the trend of US stocks and Hong Kong stocks in 2020,"Why do US stocks experience a plunge？ What are the reasons？The short answer is that markets have been on a “sugar high” from quantitative easing， and sugar highs inevitably end with a crash. Because the stock market is unstable， it is extremely vulnerable to shocks. There are any number of specific reasons –Turkey， Argentina， trade tensions， geopolitical uncertainty， rising interest rates， you name it – but none by itself would be enough to cause a crash were it not for underlying instability. A tiny feather or flap of a butterfly’s wing would be enough to topple such a market built on air.

Some of the “Trump bump” rise in stock prices came from temporary stimulus from the tax cut that Congress approved nearly a year ago. Companies have used their earnings for record buybacks of their shares， driving prices higher. Many also took advantage of new， lower rates to repatriate profits to the United States.

But this can’t last. Trump claimed that companies would use the tax cuts to raise wages， but that didn’t happen， and that’s bad for the economy. The lower wages are， the more likely people are to spend extra money when they get it. That boosts economic activity， which in turn helps corporate profits and grows the economy. Instead， companies just put the tax cuts back into the stock market， inflating the speculative bubble even more and failing to invest in the real economy.

 Looking at the recent decline in Hong Kong stocks caused by the social riots in Hong Kong, the riots will not last long and can be effectively controlled. On the contrary, the Hong Kong stock market will be a good bargaining opportunity from the end of 2019 to 2020.  
The international trade situation that started last year has caused the volatility of Hong Kong stocks to intensify. At the beginning of this year, with the development of trade consultations, the sentiment has begun to pick up again. Hong Kong stocks are now returning to 50% of this year's rising market. I am optimistic about the market in 2020, and there will be very good returns in keeping with the market hotspots.

Acct 1 checking-where my direct deposit goes, where my bills get auto-drafted from, and linked to my debit card for everyday stuff

Acct 2 savings with the same bank as #1- very low interest rate but I can transfer money over to #1 instantly for emergencies.

Acct 3 savings with another bank (discover)-harder to get to, but high interest rate...this one is the rainy day/new car/vacation fund...just stuff that might come up that doesn't require money immediately

Does this arrangement make sense? Anyone else do anything similar to this?",finance
personalfinance,Cut my losses or stick it out?,"I would love some assistance. I'm trying to determine if I should sell my condo (at pretty big loss) or hunker down.

Backstory:

I'm 30 y/o. Currently, I own a condo. Sale price 356k. Loan was for 320k. Down to about 308k. Got a 2/2 ARM (I know its a weird one). Interest rate 2.85%. My currently monthly payment is $1850 (Principal, Interest, Escrow). In addition, I also pay $430 in HOA fees.

Dilemma:

About 6 months ago, the other owners in the building were faced with the reality that our building is very, very old and the pipes (water, sewer, heat) need to be replaced. In addition, the HOA reserve fund is in quite poor condition and therefore it cannot cover the payment for the upgrades. The total cost for the building upgrade was estimated at around $4,000,000. There are 39 units in the building so we are each on the hook for around 100k (price differs according to sq ft). In addition to staring at a 100k bill, the HOA dues are scheduled to increase by 60% (!). The issue with the HOA reserves being so low, we cannot qualify for a loan of that size so we have to pay more to get more money to then take out a loan. 

Choices:

A) Try and sell the condo, I would probably have to reduce the price significantly and even then its a gamble. In addition, is some grey area as because there has been no special assessment against me, divulging the scheduled fixes may not be necessary? (I know karma says don't do this)

B) Sit tight and hope that my condo gains its value back post repair or rent it out to recoup some of my losses

stocks,Some interesting news in the stock market this week,"Apart from a couple of management shakeups that the relevant boards seemed to believe needed resolving before Christmas, it was a fairly quiet week.   

&amp;nbsp;

**Boeing** $BA fired its CEO Dennis Mullenburg after he failed to contain the fall out from the 737 Max airline crashes and **Uber’s** $UBER co-founder, Travis Kalanick, stepped down from the board after selling his remaining stake in the company.  Both moves were popular and were initially well received although stock price gains were largely returned by Friday.  
  

&amp;nbsp;

Elsewhere, shares of **Intra-Cellular Therapies** $ITCI soared after the company reported FDA approval on Monday for Caplyta (lumateperone) for treating schizophrenia.  The stock is now up 200% with a market capitalization of $2 billion but still looks reasonable compared to a TAM of $15 billion that is expected to grow to $20.5 billion by 2026. 


Intra-Cellular Therapies expects to launch Caplyta at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and investors are clearly excited by the news of marketing approval. It will become the first commercialized asset of Intra-Cellular Therapies.   
  


&amp;nbsp;  


**Innovative Industrial Properties** $IIPR reported on Monday that it had purchased two properties in Pennsylvania and North Dakota comprising 105,000 square feet of industrial space. 
It’s the second purchase in two months for Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. ($IIPR) and will increase total industrial space by 7.5%. It also follows some insider buying last week as the CEO bought $140,000 of stock.  


IIPR is a cannabis REIT acquiring and leasing medical marijuana cultivation and processing facilities. That’s lucrative because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Its weighted-average lease length is 15.5 years, with an average return on invested capital of 13.6%. In other words, Innovative Industrial Properties will see a complete payback on its investments in a little over five years, but should have steady and predictable cash flow for more than a decade.


Growing rapidly with a dividend of over 5% and insider buying.  It is probably a stock that you should have a look at.

Forex,The Danger of the Carry Trade,"It's noticeable that more and more people in r/Forex are talking about the so-called Carry Trade or Cary Trade strategy - some know nothing about it, some advice them to use it... I've commented on the matter elsewhere but think it's worth a separate post, thus I do it:

The Carry Trade (Strategy) was very profitable prior to the Financial crisis - I could buy a small new car only on swaps every year from a 20K deposit! Since around 2008/9 it's being squeezed out as the interest rates are gradually reduced globally - this is due to the global economy is cooling down. This alone hit the most all the Currency Hedge Funds... My records show that for example Oanda's combined for all the currencies positive swap dropped 2.5 times in the last three month!!! For you as a novice fx trader the main danger of this carry strategy is that countries with high interest rates will inevitably cut their interest rate rather sooner than later. Thus, for example, if you sell USD/TRY to capitalize on an attractive positive swap it may soon mean for you that you are left with a huge minus generated by your sell-positions and a tiny plus swap (in relation to the minus). And you can't close those sell-positions with profit for god know how long - and imagine some economic turmoil during that time with volatility shooting up 10 times, or a flash crash etc... Buy the way Turkey cut its interest rate in September and brokers cut their positive swaps 2 times in response (!)... Nowadays the Carry Trade has lost its shine for most pro traders as there are other strategies generating superior returns, but for a novice it is useful to learn about it.

P.S. Those currency pairs with the better positive swap are the most volatile.",finance

personalfinance,Gold vs Index Funds,"I was having a discussion with a family member about where we are investing our respective nest eggs. I have mine in index funds targeted for my retirement date, and they have theirs in gold. As we were discussing the merits of our strategies they referred to this graph [Fed Balance Sheet vs S&amp;P](https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Fed-Balance-Sheet-SP500-2-020619.png?itok=owqvKpeE) that shows that whenever the Fed finances a lot of debt, the stock market goes up. According to them this shows that companies are merely taking loans and then using that money to buy their own stocks to increase their stock prices, so when stock prices rise it’s not an indication that the companies have actually become more valuable. So even though my returns look good now, they aren’t sustainable and QED stocks are not sound investments.

My gut reaction is that their argument is oversimplifying a complex dynamic because won’t those companies eventually have to pay back those loans with money that they generate by being a valuable business and the Fed wouldn’t loan money to a risky business right? I know that ZeroHedge is a very inflammatory site, so please don’t discredit their argument by discrediting the source of the chart (but if there is something misleading about the chart please point it out!).

I'm not saying one should use this strategy or *only* this strategy. Especially now, where stocks are at ath pretty much all around. By all means, diversify, never put in more than you can afford to lose. It's an unprecedented disruptive technology, volatile as fuck and nobody knows where it will go. It could go to zero.

But then, bonds seem to be going to deep shit aka negative yields and with stocks, it's hard to tell how much of it is really a thriving economy and how much of it is inflated debt funded corporate share buybacks. At least for me as an average layperson it seems impossible to tell:

&gt;""Central bank intervention came to a fever pitch 11 years ago. The 2007/8 financial crisis was so bad that the Fed went beyond its usual measures. It drastically upped its purchase of US Treasuries (debt) and started buying things like mortgage-backed securities. [...]

&gt; The tricky part about central bank intervention is that it’s a discretionary process driven by a relatively small group of people. How much intervention is too much? In 2008, the answer seemed to be “almost no amount is too much.”

&gt; As you can see above, this resulted in the supply of base money roughly quintupling. Why we didn’t see crippling inflation is another story for a different blog. Even though we didn’t see traditional (and I would argue deceptive) measures of inflation like CPI and PCE spike, all this extra “liquidity” has led to systemic bubbles in important asset markets like real estate.

&gt; So now the housing market is more overbought than before the crash in 2007 and the stock market is… well, almost two and a half times more overbought than ever.

&gt; The root of this being that well-intended central banks are trying to protect us from the volatility that comes with the natural ebbs and flows of the business cycle. [...]

&gt; Injecting trillions of dollars into the money supply isn’t something we can easily walk back from, since the resulting availability of credit has allowed our economy to stave off slowdowns by increasing “leverage,” or using debt to fund expansion.

&gt; **One way this cheap credit is used is for leveraged share buybacks, a term you’ve probably heard recently. In a nutshell, this is when a company takes advantage of favorably low interest rates (enabled by the central bank’s intervention) to take out a loan. Using the loan, the company buys back its own shares which (definitionally) reduces the number of shares outstanding and artificially boosts earnings-per-share, sending share prices higher. This has the genial side effect of making executive-owned stock options way more valuable.""**

A Druckenmiller video just mentioned the 10y tends to track with GDP, what other indicators can be watched and studied to infer future rate movement?

personalfinance,Explanation of how unsubsidized student loans work?,"Hi, I am currently receiveing a tuition scholarship from the NYS STEM HESC program. Basically, if I go to a SUNY and work in New York for 5 years, I get my college tuituion for free.

However, I don't think I want to stay in New York for 5 years and therefore I will have to pay back around 4 semesters of tuition.

How will this payment work? They say the interest accrues daily from the time the tuition was paid out, not from when I decide I don't want to receive the scholarship anymore.

* All award monies received shall convert to a 10-year student loan plus interest.
* Interest rate for the life of the loan shall be fixed and equal to that published annually by the U.S. Department of Education for Undergraduate Unsubsidized Stafford loans at the time the Service Contract is signed.
* Interest accrues from the day each award payment is disbursed.
* Interest is capitalized on the day the award recipient violates the Service Contract or on the date HESC deems the recipient was no longer able or willing to perform the terms of the Service Contract.

So a 10 year student loan plus interest, for say $20,000 worth of tuition wouldn't become like $100,000 within a year would it?

I have about 80K in my 401K and until recently I contributed the minimum to get the max company matching (usually around 5%).  I recently read that is low and that i should be double my yearly gross by now.  Can someone confirm?  I now contribute 10% and get 5% matched.


I bought a house 10 years ago for around 190K and we refinanced to a 15 year note 4 years ago.  We owe about 130K on our house still. The house is in a great school district and has enough space for our two kids to each have their own room.  This was our starter house. I feel like we are in a good spot here. But both my wife and I want something bigger and nicer.  We figure we could get 215K for our house if we sold it without updates, so we have about 80K equity.


For the last 10 years we really didnt have good saving habits and lived paycheck to paycheck cuz we would just blow the rest of our buffer...we still made sure we could do nice things for our kids lo like ballet and shit though.  Over the last 6 months we've been able to save about 20K as an emergency fund however, so I feel like we have turned the corner on our savings habits.


Also, my wife is about to go back to school to finish her degree in account so she can get a job making more than 45K.  But to do this I think we will have to take out student loans so we dont touch our emergency fund.  Is there a better plan for us here?

We both have 800+ credit scores. And we both bought new cars about a year ago and pay around 950 a month in car payments.  We generally drive our cars untill they fall apart, and our notes have a really low interest rate, so we plan to pay them off and squeeze what we can out them.


Now, my question is, is it financially smart for us to buy a new nicer house now given that we can afford it, or try to double up payments on our current house and buy something later?  I know it's probably smarter to buy something later, but would it be a colossal mistake to buy a new house within the next year?


What would be a better decision in our position?  I tend to make rash decisions so I'm really trying to be smart here.  What would set our family up for a nice cushy life in the future?  I'm thinking we should wait until my wife finishes her degree to do anything.  Also, is my retirement way behind?  Should we take out loans to get her degree?  Or adjust to a lower standard of living and try to pay cash for her degree?  I have quite a few options and I'm just not sure what the best option is.


Edit for requested more info.

Monthly breakdown:

This is off my income alone, if my wife works, she brings in an extra 1500 or so a month, which is why we think finishing her degree will be a huge help.

I have an income property with a 3.875% mortgage interest rate. The property has appreciated 22% per year, although it is estimated to appreciate (per Zillow) only 3% next year. (I bought it for $300k in 2012 and it just appraised for $850k--so sort of a post recession windfall.) It's in a HCOL area. The rental income covers 140% of the PITI. 

I was going to refi in order to get \~$100k cash for a down payment on a family home. The refi would be a slightly lower interest rate and the rental income would cover 110% of the PITI (so not much for maintenance but it's a pretty low maintenance building). However, it seems it makes more sense for us to rent for at least the next 3 years. Should I cancel the refi and keep the equity in the income property growing, or should I get the cashout and put the proceeds to my husband's loans?

GOAL: We would like to move and buy a house in another state within 5 years and would like to have about $50,000 to put as a down payment. 

What would be our best bet for investing the money we have saved for our goal of buying a house, and how much of it would be reasonable to invest at this point so that we still have money accessible in case of an emergency?",finance

worldpolitics,World Solutions 101,"unification and abolishment of the value of money:

Simple the world leaders come together, put aside their differences and lay down their arms. Realize that the world is comprised of humans, each different, each unique yes but not enough that one is better than the other. No one human deserves to live in poverty, starving hungry alone. Stealing their next meal or sleeping in the dirt. as no one person should have greed, to stand above the others and flash their wealth to the lower people. Wealth is what you make of it, wealth could be the satisfaction of helping an injured human or helping someone out of a mental breakdown. Things only have cash value because someone somewhere someday made coins and decided that these pieces of metal or paper were going to be a currency that for years torn humans apart. Its made us want more of it because with out it we can’t have the things we need or want. Its time we Unite and stand! innovate together share technology and no we don’t have to choose one language to speak. Let the first innovation project be a universal translator. make it available to everyone not just the rich and greedy, in fact make everything available to everyone! Why put value on things that in reality only have value when someone wants it to be valued. 

We need to push currency out of our brains forever and share, I don’t mean in a petty way either. “Oh great so now I have to share my home with a stranger I don’t know” no! That’s not what unifying and sharing resources would mean at all. We assign people housing, one house big enough for a small family (4 bed 2 bath + basement and garage would be more than ideal) and make food available in moderation, make monthly  or weekly care packages and even include recipes on how to utilize the food within. All it would take is a form, similar to food stamps, you declare your household number with your housing unit that it is for. Include allergies and dislikes, then each month or week swing by a food distribution center a large warehouse in which humans work with each other not working for a paycheck but for the work, for the hobby or the passion for helping people. Swing by give your housing unit number and pick up your food, this system would be ideal to cut down waste overall then food can be harvested and grown and there be no over stock no over abundance of food going into the garbage it can all be regulated and truly be from farm to table.

Why we must abolish the need for paychecks and money is simply because we are letting this one thing rule our lives to the point where people are getting into careers simply for the money. Too many CNA’s doctors plumbers mechanics are getting into their career simply to survive and have extra money. They don’t care, they ignore patients, scam people out of money for shitty work, sabotage something so that they have to come back and get it fixed. The bar is lowering more and more, we are already so low maybe we can’t dig ourselves out. But just because its that way doesn’t mean we can’t try. We can do these things with the snap of our fingers but we choose not to because the world has been this way for years that its all anyone has known. But its time to snap our fingers to say no more currency to unify and work with each other not for each other. There should be no cost of living, we evolved or got put here or whatever you want to believe happened to work as one why do we determine that anyone should be with out food or shelter without water. Who chooses that a piece of paper is what the world relies on. Why can’t we rely on each other? Innovate and conquer or differences and make a stand solve world hunger and overpopulation. Solve overall unhappiness and unfufilment in live. Why must there be so many different hierachies political or not. There is a need for leadership but its just to make sure that no bad cookies try and enslave us again. Us as humans can live in harmony without greed, this certainly can’t be done with out government the people can get away with the obviously morally wrong.

In conclusion we must have the world leaders unite and share and work to solve the worlds problems. Not let greed and a made up number stand in their way. To just give humans what they deserve to live, a house, food, water, shelter, heat and cooling, power, even technology. Humans are no longer in the stone ages but we have nothing because we made a wrong turn and let one little devil of an object justify what has value and that you must have money in order to live, in order to be alive you have to have money. Life is a birthright and it shouldn’t have a price tag. A BREAKDOWN OF 

PROBLEMS AND SIMPLE SOLUTIONS:

Problem: Greed and wealth

Solution: take away the made up value of money, let supplies and resources be free to everyone just have regulations on amounts, etc.

Problem: Overpopulation. Solution: Euthanize Elderly people when they choose and or can no longer give back to society. Turn nursing homes into rehab facilities, if an old person cannot recover or chooses not to recover and wants to just lay around pissing themselves, put them to sleep then administer a lethal injection and cremate them then spread their ashes for fertilization. Yes this may seem inhumane but if you think about it they are sitting on their asses doing nothing for years until they die, they need to move on sooner so the newer generation can move on and this would significantly shift the balance and then overpopulation would probably significantly decrease. To even further help, regulate births allow each family two kids then sterilize the parents. what if one kid dies later on? Adopt.

Problem: Homeless solution: Preassigned housing units. give people fully furnished prebuilt houses and when the kiddos are ready to move out at 18 assign the kid a house, the housings will circulate as people move in together and people die and the furniture can be maintained and cleaned or replaced. With no value and no money this would be no problem, materials can be recycled. 

Problem: hunger and starvation

Solution: Meal Packages assigned and designed for each household. This will cut down food waste and unnecessary harvesting for unreasonable demands, true farm to table.

Problem: Education

Solution: no money therefore free access to materials and education. You can learn your passions without restrictions.

Problems: Well What good are jobs for?

Solution: its now a hobby, its something you want to do you do it for your passions of it, its something that makes you happy and isn’t a burden or just because you need money. Want to help the sick? Be a doctor or a nurse go to your now free education classes and learn. Want to build or paint or make movies or act or work on cars to educate, ETC. go learn to do it and just go do it. People now work with each other not for each other. No managers to sit on their asses, you can now tell a customer fuck you I’m fixing this or doing this because I want to not because I need your money you have no hold over me. No more customer is always right bullshit cause you gain nothing or lose nothing because supplies are just made and given to you. And there’s no currency just the satisfaction on a job well done.

Problem: pollution

Solution: switch everyone to solar powered cars (looking at you Musk), get our energy from sun and wind, stop the burning of coal and fossil fuels. Get off our asses and clean the earth, innovate ways to burn our trash and filter the fumes into a safer emission. find ways to break down trash consumption like using glass and recyclable materials to hold foodstuffs. Actually fucking recycle!

Overall solution: STOP THE GREED AND WORK WITH EACH OTHER FOR THE BETTER! WHY MUST WE BE HORRIBLE ANIMALS! WE CAN MAKE THIS CHANGE NO PROBLEM ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS ABOLISH CURRENCY AND JUST MAKE EVERYTHING AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE! UNITE AND LIVE IN HARMONY LIKE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO! NOT SAYING ABOLISH GOVERNMENT BUT BECOME LIKE THE UNITED FEDERATION IN STAR TREK WHERE REALLY CURRENCY AND GREED WERE PUT TO AN END AND EVERYONE CAN LIVE!

personalfinance,"$50k in the hole, seeking advice","I could use some help please to see if I'm on the right path for tackling these student loans. The loan used to be $40k (yay interest!). 

 I'm on an income based repayment plan, and according to a repayment calculator, I'll be done paying it off in 66 years when I'm 96 years old (the loan would actually be forgiven after 25 years. I've got 17 years to go until forgiveness, but then I'd owe the interest on the whole loan immediately). I'd prefer to get this off my back in less than 5 years, if possible. I paid off my car early, so I am planning on using the monthly car payment ($180) towards getting rid of my credit card debt ($1,500). I recently got a raise (an additional $5k/year), so I was planning on using this towards the student loan on top of the monthly payment. 

\-Should I get rid of the credit card first with the increased income or just start hacking away at the student loan?   
\-Because they both have the same interest rate, does it matter which one I pay down first?   
\-Do spare change apps really help reduce the duration of a loan?   
\-Am I screwing myself over by throwing all extra money at the loan instead of progressing my savings account or saving for a down payment on a house?

economy,Implications of History Repeating,"The same four things have been in play the last ten years that were in play during the 1920's and ultimately lead to the great depression.

1. Trying to resist money coming to u.s. from foreign countries who had lower interest rates than the u.s.

2. Supporting other countries currency valuations which were valued unreasonably by their central banks.

3. Attempting to prevent a major downturn like the one we had several years back.

4. The central government talking up the stock market and cajoling the central bank to lower interest rates.

Then, like now, we thought these actions would prolong the expansion or prevent a major downturn. Inevitably these actions amplified the downturn when it did finally arrive.

The outcome, then as now, was and is the same. Plotting S&amp;P corporate earnings over a twenty year period between 1910 and 1930, as well as between 2000 and 2019, the graphs look almost the same. In fact, when plotting the earnings on a logarithmic scale, they are almost the same graph. Then as now, corporate earnings and stock  prices were driven by low interest rates and excessive debt. The implication is that the 2020's may rhyme with the 1930, economically and financially.",finance

Since our MAGI will hit the phase out range (and possibly over 206K), we're thinking about backdooring all of our contributions starting in 2020.

So we just opened Traditional IRA accounts in Vanguard. Plan is:

1. Stop automatic investments going to Roth IRA for 2020.
2. Setup automatic investments going to Traditional IRA for 2020. (same amount that was going into Roth ($250), twice monthly into Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund)
3. Wait sometime...or not.
4. Use Vanguard option to ""Convert to Roth IRA""

My two questions are: 

* How often can we ""Convert to Roth IRA""? Should we do it immediately after each automatic investment (twice monthly)? 
* How much should we convert? There is an option to ""Convert part of the account in shares."". If the Trad IRA account balance is all in ""Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund"" should we only convert the exact dollar amount of contributions and leave any interest gained inside the Trad IRA?

Both get their rate from the fed of course. So there won’t be substantial difference that I can foresee unless someone can correct that. So, it would be more liquid and potentially higher rate.

CryptoCurrency,Settlement of Cross-Border Transactions using Central Bank Digital Currency,"A digest follows of the excellent 100+ page thesis by Van Ginneken, C.L. (Casper): [Settlement of Cross-Border Transactions through Central Bank Digital Currency](https://essay.utwente.nl/78027/1/Ginneken_MA_BMS.pdf). Recommended pre-reading: [https://gendal.me/2013/11/24/a-simple-explanation-of-how-money-moves-around-the-banking-system/](https://gendal.me/2013/11/24/a-simple-explanation-of-how-money-moves-around-the-banking-system/)

**Settlement of Cross-Border Transactions using Central Bank Digital Currency**

For a bank to arrange a cross-border transaction, it must either have both parties’ currencies in its possession or else have a means of buying the foreign currency required to execute the transaction. Whereas some of the larger international banks might have the banking license and liquidity required in the respective currency, viability decreases rapidly as the number of currencies at hand increases at a given time. Furthermore, complexity and costs are added because of differing regulatory standards across jurisdictions combined with varying technical requirements.

Most banks set up correspondent banking channels to still be able to host any trade. These are relationships with strategically selected foreign banks that are capable of handling the desired payment. The reason why such networks exist is both the extensive process of acquiring a banking licence in another jurisdiction and the respective cost burden. Since maintaining and leveraging these connections is not feasible for everyone, smaller, local banks tend to rely completely on larger banks to host cross-currency transactions on their behalf. As a result, more financial institutions and other intermediaries are involved than expected at first sight, thus increasing transaction fees and clarity. Few banks actually have the scale required to maintain a global network of settlement accounts in multiple jurisdictions.

Besides the reliance on correspondent banking channels, dependence on the operating hours of RTGS systems obstructs the desired flexibility in transferring high-value funds across the globe on a daily basis. A consequence is that there are only very small windows of time when the systems across different countries are open simultaneously. This results in cross-border payments getting trapped in a country, waiting for the respective RTGS system to open, and thus drive the time lag in cross-border transactions reaching their final destination.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2.1: Mono-currency payment in the current model.](https://preview.redd.it/tib4f6tn4n741.jpg?width=784&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d5eaba8d8067ecac7b55963674983119170048)

Figure 2.1 provides an example of a transaction in the current model. The transaction considered is a mono-currency single payment, which means that there is no exchange (of goods) involved. This example clearly shows the presence of intermediaries. It may take multiple days, and in some cases even over a week for a transaction to arrive at the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) due to the existence of correspondent banking channels. Once Shell initiates a transaction, its balance at ING is adjusted through an internal business portal. Then ING sends a SWIFT message to the European Central Bank (ECB) with the transaction details. The RTGS system of the ECB adjusts the balances of both ING and Deutsche Bank (DB) at the ECB. Consequently, DB receives a SWIFT message with the details of the transaction, and forwards it to BNY Mellon. Once BNY Mellon receives the payment, it adjusts US Steel’s balance in the internal business portal.

For cross-currency payments, the model looks a bit different. Now ING must find a correspondent bank that is willing to exchange the EUR amount to a USD amount. An example of such a situation with Bank of America (BOA) as a correspondent bank is displayed in Figure 2.2. The third payment type we consider a a payment-versus-payment transaction. In this situation, ING does not only pay a EUR amount (on behalf of a client), but receives a USD amount in return. In the current situation, a simple contract for a Foreign Exchange (FX) swap is signed to cover potential FX risk, obviously against a fee. Figure 2.3 displays an example of such a transaction.

What stands out from the correspondent banking analysis is that the cut taken in a given cross-border trade is determined by the number of financial institutions that engage in and the complexity of the network in the transaction process. This opposes the view that the nations or currencies involved are most decisive in the percentage forfeited. The lack of payment status and visibility, delays in payment processing, and lack of round-the-clock service availability result in significant issues for international corporate transactions. Consequently, settlement times for cross-border payments can take up to five days even for most common currency pairings, generally with limited clarity regarding the total amount of fees to be charged and the timing of settlement. Nevertheless, a mono-currency payment is close to instant, as local RTGS systems (e.g. TARGET2) are very efficient.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2.7: Mono-currency payment in the future model.](https://preview.redd.it/u7a4avuu4n741.jpg?width=771&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821db8566d1e641c5afc9a6be1fc8d9010492f8b)

Whereas in the current model it can take multiple days and in some cases even over a week for a transaction to settle, the future model offers a transaction to be settled in a matter of seconds. Figure 2.7 displays the future situation for a mono-currency payment, in this case a EUR transaction. Like in the current model, a bank would still send a SWIFT message to the settling party.  However, instead of using an entire network of correspondent banks, only one operation is performed now.  A distributed ledger is established for each currency at which each bank holds an account.  The balances of ING in their own account and in the account at the central bank are adjusted based on the SWIFT message.  Subsequently, the transaction value is converted to an equivalent amount of tokens and ownership transfers to the counterparty, via the distributed ledger. Within a matter of seconds, BNY Mellon sees the transaction value added to is own wallet at the ledger.

If BNY Mellon were to withdraw money from its account, again a SWIFT message is created and balances are adjusted accordingly.  The value of these CBDC tokens is backed one-to-one to its respective fiat currency to prevent for introducing additional FX risk during conversion. The CBDC tokens are liquid to such an extent that they are pre-funded by fiat.  They are merely used as tools for transacting fiat amounts, backed by the central bank.

Depending on legal restrictions and reciprocal agreements between jurisdictions, any bank can have an account at the central bank that manages the distributed ledger of the currency it issues.  For instance, the ECB manages the EUR ledger, the FederalReserve System (FED) manages the USD ledger, and so on. Another possibility is that some independent financial institution or governance authority is appointed to manage the new payment system. Legal risks arise when central banks in different jurisdictions are to gear to one another. Once the technology matures and sufficient experience with the new payment system has been gained, the SWIFT connection could be upgraded to a more direct message system.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2.8: Cross-currency payment-versus-payment in the future model.](https://preview.redd.it/xnm6iykw4n741.jpg?width=624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d78420d953925d4a295c9e9579ba8b8b4fe004ff)

Contrasting to the current model, the cross-currency payment does not exist in the future model. The main reason for this is the fact that banks can also have accounts at central banks outside their own jurisdiction in a foreign currency. Imagine a bank -here ING - being required to pay BNY Mellon some amount in USD, then it may use its account in the dollar-denominated wallet to execute the payment. If this balance does not suffice, a bank could decide to perform a currency swap, which automatically is the third scenario, i.e. a cross-currency PvP. Thus, we conclude that the cross-currency payment scenario is a combination of the mono-currency payment and cross-currency PvP scenario.

In the cross-currency PvP scenario, a currency swap takes place. Figure 2.8 depicts this situation, using the EUR to USD transaction example. The commercial bank still needs to find a counterparty, here BNY Mellon, that is willing to swap a particular EUR amount to a USD amount. When both parties have agreed to the transaction (via SWIFT messaging), settlement occurs through an atomic swap, which means that the transfer of USD tokens from BNY Mellon’s USD account to ING’s USD account and EUR tokens from ING’s EUR account to BNY Mellon’s EUR account happens at exactly the same time. This prevents the possibility of double-spending. ING would not need a counterparty such as BNY Mellon in this case. A major challenge for all affiliating parties, especially those who will have to design the technology, is interoperability.

There are three dimensions to interoperability: between two currencies on the same ledger, between different ledgers and between the ledger and legacy infrastructure.

* First, different currencies within a ledger must be connected to each other for a swap to succeed between two currencies.
* Second, interoperability between different ledgers could present an issue if each currency is on another ledger. Other financial products, such as securities and derivatives, would generally have to be settled on alternative ledgers or platforms as well. These must be linked, however, if Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) transactions are to be included.
* The third dimension relates to the interoperability between the ledger(s) and legacy infrastructure, which will have to be accommodated for in any case. These are operational risks that must be considered elaborately prior to constructing the platforms.

The future model addresses all drawbacks of the current system. First of all, transactions in the current system are expensive due to fees and FX margins being accumulated at every step in the process. With the elimination of correspondent banks and only one settlement system in the future model, these costs should diminish. Obviously, the technology needs to be built, maintained, regulated and kept secure. Second, the speed of a transaction increases significantly. Whereas cross-border interbank transactions take several days to arrive at the counterparty, the future model offers settlement in the blink of an eye. On top of this, transparency and predictability increase due to the removal of intermediaries and rapid settlement. Lastly, the proposed system offers near real-time and round-the-clock availability of cross-border payment services.

All in all, we expect the future model to be far more efficient than the current model. The main difference lies in the way central banks provide access to their balance sheets i.e. in the form of a digital version of ordinary fiat without participating banks having to obtain a banking license in the respective jurisdiction to access the actual currency.

Ultimately, risk can be defined as the exposure of an asset to loss, generally due to a change in its value as time progresses. With time no longer being a factor in cross-border interbank payments, most risk vanishes as well. The analysis on financial risks of cross-border interbank transactions in a system with CBDC has marked five risk factors as relevant. First, liquidity risk is expected to decrease, as both cash pools at correspondent banking nostro accounts and separate central bank accounts (e.g. TARGET2, T2S and EBA) can be centralised in one account on the ledger in a new system, which leads to optimisation of LSM. We have quantified liquidity management advantages at a reduction in liquidity requirements of 21%.

Replacing correspondent banking structures by a peer-to-peer network with 24/7 access and instant settlement of payments reduces the time factor in cross-border interbank transactions to near zero. This significantly affects interest rate risk, since banks do no longer miss out on interest garnered by correspondent banks during a transaction’s processing period. Foreign exchange rate risk vanishes as well due to a replacement in price volatility between two currencies by an instant current-market rate. As banks will no longer be exposed to the possibility that both intermediaries and counterparties might default on their payment obligations, counterparty credit risk can be disregarded entirely. Additionally, atomic swaps (i.e. cryptographic hash functions stipulated in smart contracts) reduce settlement risk in PvP transactions.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How much do I take home: salary vs guaranteed payments (x-post /r/tax),"Hello all, I hope this is the right place to ask. TL;DR at bottom. I also want to preface this with: I am a social worker. Math, taxes, legal stuff, and finances are not my forte. So please be gentle. I am trying my best to learn this for myself, but I really need your help!

I am a social worker who has been running a private for-profit agency that provides care to seniors. I am essentially Director of Operations, and have a counterpart who is essentially head of marketing. We have both agreed that we are underpaid for what we bring to the agency. He put in his two weeks, and it freaked the owner out.

So she ended up making us the following offer:

We form a new LLC (her, her husband, my counterpart and I), and run the business under that new LLC. The old LLC (her and her husband) would front us a loan to cover working capital until we (new LLC) are on our feet. We will repay that loan over a year or two. The previous owner and her husband will each own 40% of the company, and my counterpart and myself will each own 10%. I will have a tiny buy-in of $2000. If we are fired without cause we get 100% of our equity paid out. If we walk we only get 25% of the equity paid out. Obviously at first that is only $500 (of the $2000), but ideally it will grow.

We would each get a check cut from the business at the end of the year to cover the flow-through taxes on our 10% of profit. We were also originally going to register (or whatever the right word is) as an S-Corp, so we can take a salary. I will be going from a 55K to a 70K salary this way and bringing home 54,236 (AZ, 1.3%, claiming 1 on federal withholding). The taxes on my salary would obviously be taken out as regular wages through pay-roll. And then the check cut at the end of the year will cover my taxes on my profit. I will keep the rest of the profit in the business for the first few years to continue to grow the business.

This all seemed great. Then we met with a lawyer, who ended up really being HER lawyer, and not the lawyer for “the new company”.

The offer changed to the following:

We will remain a Partnership, instead of the S-Corp. If we sell to a 3rd party- the owner and her husband want 1.5mil (which is what they paid for the original business 8 years ago) and THEN we do the 40/40/10/10 cut. On one hand I understand wanting the 1.5mil back. On the other, I think the additional 40/40/10/10 seems a bit greedy. Example: If we sell the company for 2mil, my counterpart and I walk away with 50k, and they walk away with 1.9mil. My counterpart and I are responsible for growing and running this business and have done a good job so far. I was willing to roll my eyes at that, and deal- but then the curveball of “guaranteed payments” came out.

So now my 70K will come out as guaranteed payments, with no taxes removed. And now it will be held to Self Employment tax on top of Income tax. So my understanding is that I will owe 15.3% of the 70K ($10,710) plus the income tax which I attempted to understand the brackets to mean I will owe an additional $10,202,50 (for income tax). For a total of $20,912.50 out of the 70k. Which means my actual take home is $49,087.50. I read that I can deduct 1/2 of the SE tax ($5355) from my taxes, but that is not the same thing as a credit.. I do not get that back.

Am I understanding this all correctly? Does it actually behoove me to fight for it to remain a salary? If I am wrong in my calculations, could someone help me out? I am a single social worker, with medical bills, etc- and am trying to figure out the budget and what the best course of action is for myself financially before I sign anything.

Thank you!

TL;DR: Got a great offer to be a minority owner in the business I work at. At first the offer meant a salary of 70K, but now it is guaranteed payments of 70K. I bring home more with the salary- correct?

In November I noticed an erroneous charge on my banking account from Fedloan Services. Essentially, they had added an extra ""0"" to the payment (i.e. $8000 instead of $800). I spoke to a rep and he was able to adjust the payment to be $800, telling me that the $7,200 would be refunded to my account. 

Now, I've read horror stories about this process taking upwards of 3 months to a year. What if anything can I do to expedite this? I'm flat out broke and frustrated, and the money is just...missing.

personalfinance,"Becoming a Fed, how can I start out on the ‘right’ financial foot?","I will become a federal employee soon and have a few questions. 

I am 27y/o and will be making $63k once I enter, which is nearly double my current salary. So I want to make sure I am starting this journey on the right foot. 

I currently have $8k in a split 401k (my contributions are Roth, the 3% company match in Trad). I will be rolling this over into the TSP, but am not 100% which direction to go. Do I stick it all in a L fund and forget it, or do I start hard in the C Fund. Or do I allocate amongst the L, C and S funds. I assume it’s best for me to continue my contributions as Roth since I intend to retire at a higher salary. 

Next question is banking. I currently have Capital One and enjoy it, but was considering Navy Federal Credit Union, although I’m not seeing a major reason to switch. Except for their support during furloughs. The Capital One 360 Performance Savings is nearly two percent in interest, and I have several small(ish) savings accounts benefitting from that. I don’t see anything like that nearly competitive at NFCU. Also, I don’t want to have my checking at one, and savings at another again. Been there done that and waiting 2-4 days for my money to come from the checking and get deposited into the savings is annoying. I rather have it all the same bank because I am constantly moving things around. So am I missing any major benefits from a Credit Union by staying with Capital One? 

I will be doubling my drive from 35miles to 65 miles one way. Luckily it’s only a 15 minute difference so it doesn’t bother me too much, especially since I’m doubling my pay. I will need a car probably within a year or two because my car runs okay currently but KBB is $2k or under, and it’s 14 years old. We know it’s only a matter of time before the major issues start appearing. I plan on driving it for as long as I can (and getting AAA membership), but I need to start saving/prepping for a car payment to get something new and under warranty with way better gas mileage (I’m currently in low 20s). I will be doing about 31k miles yearly just in commute alone. So I think just putting a savings account to the side and contributing monthly to it will be okay, unless there are better ways to prepare for a new vehicle to maximize savings?

I don’t even know where to begin on health plans, but I assume that’s not as much of a PF question. 

I think that’s about it for questions. Advice appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Re-financing Personal Loan (Not Home/Auto/Student),"Hello! I'm hoping someone has been in a similar situation and can give me some advice.

Over the course of a couple years, I got into some pretty significant credit card debt. More than a year ago, I took out a personal loan (via Lending Club) for the amount of the credit card debt, completely paid off the credit cards, and stopped using them entirely. **I have no credit card debt now. Just to be clear.** 

My monthly payment on my Lending Club loan is $696.08 for a period of 5 years. With my current income and other bills, I have NO ISSUES paying this amount every month, but now that my credit score is in the upper 700s, I'm trying to see if I can re-finance that loan to a smaller monthly payment/lower interest rate. 

Mostly the smaller payment because I have things I'm trying to save for, and an extra $100-200 in my budget every month would be great. 

The problem I seem to be coming up against, though, is in applications for the ""new"" loan. So far, I've done a couple of online applications, and been denied for all of them. Granted, none of the ""Purpose of Loan"" options have been ""Re-Finance a Current Loan"", so I'm thinking that whatever automated system reviews applications is interpreting the situation to be \[Current Loan\]+\[Application Amount\] = DOUBLE AMOUNT instead of refinancing \[Current Loan\] to be replaced in full by \[New Loan\].

I admittedly wasted a bit when I could've saved, but I wanted to spend on myself, as I never been able too before, and I wasn't sure if my contract would be renewed.

Thankfully, my contracted was renewed as a container and at-least for the next 6 months, I'll be making $3200.  However, I'm not sure what to do with this, but I do have goals, just not sure how to go about those goals and how I can invest this so I can change my life.

3. I was hired as a web developer. I been learning how to do this with small time jobs for about 6 years, remotely.
4. I've never had this much money before, never.
5. My credit score is at 517 (Equifax, Trans is at 0, via creditkarma) with two derogatory marks that are $384 and $406 that are medical related. Years are 2015 and 2018.
6. I do not have a credit card.
7. I have a bank account at Navy Federal (that's currently $170 negative due to overdraft), and Ally bank account.
8. I'm probably going to be paying taxes for the first time next year.
9. I say the next 6 months as that's the deadline on the contract. I'm not sure what happens after.

My major personal goal is to rent my own place and have a nice house for myself. I looked up some places here and there are houses from $950-$1200 that I may or may not be able to afford. I'm just not 100% sure on how much utility is, or how I can better use my money to meet that goal?

I just want to use this money I'll be getting for the next 6 months wisely. I want to be able to use it so I could get out of this situation I'm in and be able to live by myself, so I can start my life.

# 13% less supply for a constant demand

The end of the year 2019 also marks the end of the [Philiposburg 2 nuclear power station](https://www.achgut.com/artikel/haferburgs_rueckblick_2019_der_energie_harakiri)  in South-Western Germany. This comes after 35 years of delivering a  lion's share of the much needed electricity for Germany's South-Western  state of Baden-Württemberg, a heavily industrialized region and home to  Mercedes, Porsche, Bosch, SAP and countless midsized engineering  companies relying on cheap electricity.

Overall, Philippsburg 2  will leave a 13% gab in the electricity demand. As the state and federal  governments insist, this ""will not leave a gap"" in the market.  According to their plans, in the short-term electricity from France and  Eastern Europe will compensate, while in the long-run both regaional  solar power in the sunny region as well as windpower transmitted from  windy Northern Germany will fill the gap...

personalfinance,advice on investing with windfall...,"tl;dr : received windfall. want to invest about $100K with minimal effort. VOO or VFIAX? 

I’m a mid-30s/M. I received $300K in a windfall. I have a family, no debt whatsoever (credit, student, auto, whatever). I already have $90K in a 529 for our little one. Unfortunately, I started off late with a ROTH IRA a few years ago but have been maxing it out since and dont plan to stop until I retire. I work for a small private business that provides no 401K whatsoever. Wife has separate 401K through her own company. I have saved around $200K for a downpayment on a home but with the extra $300K that puts me around 500K, all of which is in a MMA. We plan on purchasing a home sometime in 2021. That being said, i dont have much use having all that money in a low yield account, so I want to take some out and invest it somewhere where i can basically set it and forget it (is that even possible?). 

I want to take around 100K, transfer it to my vanguard account and either do VOO or VFIAX.. which would be the better option when it comes to low maintenance? whatever gains i get i want to reinvest it automatically. im assuming VFIAX considering its a mutual fund? or is my understanding of ETF vs MF incorrect? 

Also, why only 100K? well im planning on the home purchase with a 300K downpayment and leaving 100K for emergency use. Sure, house purchase wont be for another 18 months or longer but I’d like the flexibility (if something comes up in the market sooner and we’re prepared to purchase early) and will eventually put it in either a HYS or CD depending on interest rates. 

Any thoughts? advice?",finance

personalfinance,Are my wife (31) and I (32) doing ok for retirement?,"Long story short, my wife and I both made career changes in our late 20's which wiped us out financially (for moderately expensive graduate degrees) and left us with about $57k of debt. We are now making good money in a moderate COL area and I like to think we're gotten a good hold on our finances, but I keep feeling like we should be doing something more. 

Right now we have:

* $25k in a HYSA
* $12k in Roth IRAs invested in index funds
* $20k in a rollover IRA invested in index funds
* $3k in a HSA
* $57k student loans with an average interest rate of 4.1%

&amp;#x200B;

We are taking in roughly $185k a year (varies depending on per diem hours we put in) and with our average spending rate over the past six months (which is spending comfortably but somewhat frugally), we would be able to save $27,250 per year in tax advantaged accounts (max Roth IRA + SIMPLE IRA through work + 3% employer match) plus $48,000 in the HYSA. Our goal is to buy a house in the next 2-3 years and would need about $100k for the down payment, meaning if we stay on track, we should be able to get that in just over two years while still maxing retirement and keeping a healthy emergency fund. 

I guess my question is, if we are putting that $27,250 into retirement every year, and increasing as the maximums go up, is that going to be enough for us to retire comfortably? When I put it in retirement calculators it seems like we should be fine as long as we stick with it, but I feel like we came to things pretty late, so it worries me. Should we be diverting more of our income into a taxed investment account to set aside for retirement as well, or are we on the right track?",finance

personalfinance,Selling a House with a large equity gain,"Hi r/personalfinance!

I am in the process of selling my home in Southwestern Colorado. We expect to have a net proceeds of approximately $190,000 after closing. I am in the unique position of being a veteran, and therefore I have access to the VA home loan program, which allows me to put zero down on a new home. With the new VA loan rules in 2020, I would have access to this for my new home.

We are under contract on a home that is contingent on the sale of our current one, with a cost of $585,000.

I would like to take some of the net proceeds, and do some basic work to the new house (carpet, paint, furniture), and increase our liquid savings to the 6 month emergency fund mark. That means I would have approximately $120k left over.

We have automobile debt, but the interest rates are pretty low, and we are close to paying them off anyways. No other debt. I make approximately $130K a year as a nurse practitioner. My spouse stays home and raises our children.

My interest rate on the new home is 3.2% through the VA.

So my question to the fine minds here would be, do I put 20% down (117k) and lower my monthly mortgage, or should I invest the $120k and allow it to work for me, and potentially use that to cover the difference in the mortgage (probably around $500/mo extra between putting 20% down and not.)",finance

worldpolitics,A Change Is Gonna Come,"Imagine you are a young boy in the midst of a bitter divorce. Your Mother believes she deserves you because she never punishes you, she gives whatever you want and will love you openly no matter what. Your Father believes he deserves you because, he disciplines you, challenges you and will turn you into a young chivalrous soul. Your parents are having a day to day ego war, and each parenting strategy from one leads the other to put forth an extreme opposing strategy. Although your parents may have some diminutive victories, there will be no winner in this war. Only one loser… you. However, you being the intuitive boy you are, you see where your future is going and know you deserve better. But do you have the courage to do what is best for you? 
    The Father of Democracy, George Washington, states in his farewell address in regards to partisan fighting “It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it.”
People of America, The United Kingdon and All Other Potent Nations with bipartisan leadership. Our countries are falling quicker than a landslide. In the past, we have depended on our politicians to maintain our nations in the lanes for the greater good. We are deceived that our politicians hope to work in our best interests. As modern companies begin to grow even larger, such as Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, Congress’s pockets begin to grow larger on both sides of the political spectrum.  These pockets don’t only keep corporate tax rates down (In turn creating high public taxes) but also keep antitrust lawsuits at a minimum. Lobbying money also keeps the corrupt senators in office due to their enormous campaign budget. This squashes any notable opposition that is of nonbipartisan nature. However, lobbyists are not the only problems.  politicians have ruined our nation’s by having extremists views run our state policies in places like California and Texas, letting bipartisanship radicals ruin the U.K.’s ability to receive an adequate Brexit deal, and allowing bipartisan bickering to pause lawmakers from ratifying the constitution to protect our communities with gun regulations. They allow increasing public credit in the college education system, which will lead to our next economic collapse. They continue to grow our armed forces, which is a serious threat to our inherent liberty. The budget is overridden with large military budgets which could be used to create productive education programs, build infrastructure, combat climate change, invest in exciting fresh technologies, assist in colonizing space and change public opinion about underage sex/ adoption. Instead, our governments have yet to solve the issues of the last decade as we stare into the future. We are still debating immigration reform, gun control, drug reform, gender rights, homosexual rights, military budgets, lobbyists, police brutality, and the education system. These are not just the issues of the last decade but the issues of the past 30 years. It is in human nature to be tribal. At the end of the cold war, we had no one to throw our animosity toward except each other. Sparks of hate have turned into wildfires and blinded our country with misconceived malignity. We have to achieve political peace in order to move forward. However, allowing the current political system to live will kill us. It is the publics’ responsibility to maintain a healthy democracy and we must take responsibility for our imperceptions and learn to move forward. 
However, you all know these problems exist. I wouldn’t be writing this if I did not have answers. Just as the two political extremes balance each other out. The aim of government is not to lean toward one political extreme but instead to be impartial. This impartiality can be achieved with a centrist focused government. Did you know that a fourth of the United States population is registered as an independent voter? I am also convinced by observing the world around me that everyone is fed up with the bigotry from both sides of the political spectrum. We still have a presidential election a year ahead of us and in democracy, change starts with the person staring at you in the mirror. Step outside of our current political matrix and look at the bigger perspective. Do you see where we are heading? If we are unable to come to an agreement with gun violence how will we deal with issues such as A.I., genetic mutation and climate change? In our fast lane world, our politicians are slowing down to make an exit. 
But we cannot overcome this without your support, spread this post on all forms of social media. This is our future, our kids’ futures, and humanity’s future, it is all in our hands. Don’t be afraid to post it, look back at the bigger perspective, if you don’t do this that destiny is now in your hands. I have formed a team of economists, political scientists, and lawyers to assist in policy formation for this new system. We will post-revolutionary ideas every five days. These posts will discuss how we will deal with issues of the past, present, and future. We will also post lists of adequate senators, representatives, governors, and presidents that will help build a respectable world. The first post will discuss how the United States government is failing us in education reform, by keeping us in industrial era standards. However, all of this work will be in vain if we do not have popular support. It is your democratic responsibility to spread the word. Do you have the courage? 

P.S. We do not have enough karma on this platform to form our own community, so we have to post in other subreddits as of now(Sorry we are new to this platform.) We will update you on this thread when we have enough support to carry on.",technology

Although I've worked for the past few years, this is the first job I've had both as an 18 year old, and where I earned more than $1.5k. I also did a little Postmates work at the beginning of the year where I earned about $300, although I never paid taxes on that money. I've never filed before but since this seems like a more significant amount than the amount I normally make, and I'm now legally an adult, I'm wondering if this is something I should be considering.

It is important to note that despite my age, I'm still technically a dependent because my mom claims me on her tax returns and I fill out the FAFSA as her dependent. I receive about $3500 in federal subsidized student loans each year. In October she lost her job, if that's important.

personalfinance,Building a gaming PC...financially responsible or no?,"Figured I would post here because I'm generally very frugal and this seemed like the best place. 

I'm 17 and am going to college in roughly 8-9 months. I have about $2,300-2,400 saved up and spend very little. The only major purchases I've made in the past year is new phone for $500 (had old phone for years) and a preorder for a game I've anticipated for some time ($80). I buy coffee every now and then but I generally avoid spending money when possible. I plan on working this summer and, if I'm lucky, I can make about $2,100. If i were to spend a quarter of it, I'd have about $4,000 saved up. That'd give me maybe $500 in spending money over the summer which is realistic for my spending habits.

As of now, federal loans will cover most of my tuition &amp; fees at my schools of choice. One of the more expensive (private) schools will cost me an additional $2500 per year which I'd need a private loan for (if my parents will cosign...which they probably wont) or pay out of pocket with savings. Parent PLUS loans arent an option because my parents refuse.

Gaming is one of my biggest hobbies, which I invest a decent amount of time into. Currently I use Xbox and Playstation exclusively. Games for those consoles are usually $60 for new releases, but can be on sale for $20-40 some time after release. I tend to find PC sales are much more drastic, with PC games costing half that of console games. So there'd be savings in the games themselves. Plus I wouldnt have to buy online services (xbox live and playstation plus) which would save me $10/month or $120 per year. 

My PC could also be used for school, something consoles cant do.

The issue is that its turning out to be a bigger investment than I initially planned. I'd have to buy...

- Parts for a new desk I have to build because my current one is literally falling apart and is a corner desk which is awkward for my room, 

- A new chair, 

- A monitor or two because my current one is 720p 60Hz so it's more outdated than I'm willing to handle, especially for gaming,

- A wall mount for my tv because it's taking up the space I'd build my dest to put my PC, 

- The actual PC. 

- Keyboard and mouse at some point (willing to replace later than the other stuff), 

- Speakers because I dont have working ones right now. 

- HDMI extenders and other various cables.

In total that'd cost me like $2,000-$2,500...meaning basically my entire savings.  I do plan on getting a part time job in college but I dont have my drivers license and transportation to my summer job is free, so theres no way to realistically get a job other than my summer one until I can get my license in late spring.

personalfinance,Borrow money to pay of more expensive debt,"I own an apartment with my girlfriend, and we currently have a mortgage for about 1.000.000 dkk where we pay 1% interest, which is good. On the side we have a bank loan for about 210.000 dkk, where we pay 3.95% variable interest. We are currently paying off 1350 dkk to the bank loan per month, and will be done with the loan in 19,8 years or so with our current payments.

Since my girlfriend is a student she has an option to get a student loan from the government. The interest calculation is a bit weird, it goes as follows.

She can borrow 3.194 dkk per month

While she is a student (she has 3 years remaining) the interest rate is 4% fixed

When she graduates she only pays 1% interest rate per year, and can be payed backed over 12 years.

So by my calculations we would be losing out by 0.05% interest as long as she is studying, and afterwards we would be ""saving"" 2.95´% in interest per year.

By my calculations we would be saving at least 40.000 kr. in interest.

Forex,"How did I took 3500 pips out of the market since April 2018 using only fundamentals. And you can do it, too.","Since 2018, I opened 3 positional trades on GBPUSD and banked around 3,500 pips within a year and a half, using only fundamentals. Barely looked at a price chart.

Now that I got your attention, let's analyze a few tricks that can potentially change the way you view the markets, and dramatically increase your profitability. But first check if you haven't done already an earlier post of mine in this sub, ""A peek into how Financial Institutions play this game"", as we are going to build concepts based on what is discused there. Go there first, I can wait :).

**Building an macro model for GBPUSD**

So, we wanna trade  divergences between inflationary and deflationary currencies, right? At least, that's one of the core ideas you should have grasped from the mentioned post.. Interest rates relationships are key, as they determine the cost of borrowing and the potential returns on our investments. An asset manager normally will seek to buy currencies from countries with high interest rates , and will fund it with currencies with a low interest rate. High interest rates mean higher yields - returns on our investment, while low interest rates mean lower funding costs. Inflationary currencies will experience interest rate hikes, and deflationary currencies will experience interest rate cuts. We look to profit from this.

Wouldn't it be cool if we could have an idea on whether interest rates are going to be raised or not? So we could anticipate if capital flows to a certain economy or not? Lucky for us, we got some macro indicators for that . To me, 2y bonds yield spread is the king when it comes to identify markets expectations on future rates. Bond markets will anticipate in advance what Central Banks might do in the future. Lets look into how this works. If the GBP 2y bond yield is 1%, and the USD 2y bond yield is 3%, where would you put your money? Now, if the GBP yield moves to 0,7, and the USD yield moves to 3,3? The USD bond market is increasing its yield , while GBP bond market is actually going lower. Think about it. What does it mean in terms of the GBPUSD pair? Obviously, I'd want to sell my GBP to get dollars, because I want to get US bonds as the ROI is better, isn't it?. So what happens when this differential increases during the span of months? Currencies move. A lot. Knowing when this is going to happen, and when it stops is critical to make some money.

**A GBPUSD fair price value model**

[https://imgur.com/a/Wu5jgCu](https://imgur.com/a/Wu5jgCu)

Lets see part of my model. It is based on the aforementioned 2y spreads, a COT commercial Index, the COT-  PCT of OI of dealers, and a few more macro indicators. With the 2y spread and the other macro indicators, I have built a regression model that generates the fair value of the pair. COT data works like an oscillator on the fair value. Entries are mainly considered when the price moves 1 z-score away from the fair value, and the COT data points to extreme conditions.

Is the regression model statistically robust? It is good enough. Adjusted R square is around 0.90, and the p-values of the variables are way lower than 0.05. The aproximation is good enough. Because you don't need a perfect prediction anyway. What the model needs to tell you is if current prices are higher than the fair value or not. Because the data set and the model says that eventually, price will correct to that fair value. And it always does, sooner or later. The idea is simple, if 2y spreads are negatively increasing over the span of months , GBPUSD will fall at some point. And that is what happened back in 2018. FED was raising interest rates at a higher rate than the BOE, hence the differential moved agaisnt the Pound. So for months you had the price moving higher, while the spreads were going against the pound (Don't forget Brexit). This divergence is powerful, and can carry huge gains when unleashed. Now look at the model.

You can see the price moving out of the ""Bollinger Bands"" of the fair price estimation. I was stalking the prey for weeks. Look how the price/fair price value inverted in November 2017. Look for the 2y spread moving agaisnt the pound. The right moment came when the oscillator gave the signal, and that is pretty straighforward, as it is based in the commercial positions. On April 2018, Dealers barely had a 3% of Open Interest on long positions (meaning they have a lot more of short positions), and the Commercial Long index was basically saying the same ( do your research on Larry Williams COT indicators :) ). At that point, is when I took a look on the charts, and opened a short at 1,41. I closed it at 1,2850, 3 months later. Technicals took me literally 5 mins of my time everyday, till the right time came. The work was done to anticipate the drop, for months. Pure fundamental factors.

And the same happened in March 2019, when the COT again says that no long interest is present on the market, and the price is above the fair value. And the opposite happened in August, with price well below the fair value and the bands, along with a lot of long interest.

You see? A pure technical analyst hardly has a chance to be constantly profitable on the markets. Without a clear view of the underlying reasons for price to move - a narrative, such a trader is going to easily get lost within the always changing shorter trends. He will buy a rally , when actually price has already started to move towards a lower fair value. He should have taken the chance to sell into the rally, but he did not know where or what or when to look. The fact is that pros know what is going on on the market, they know the direction and flow, they have the patience to wait for divergences to form and evolve, and act when the right time comes. A retail trader hardly has the patience to wait even a couple hours to open a position with his technical strategy. A professional will stalk for weeks and months , looking for the right hints into the big moves that can bank him huge profits with low risk. You see the divergence at 2018? It started to form at October, and was unleashed..... 6 months later!!

Most of your time is spent thinking that a certain price level is too high, cannot go higher, if the currency is overbought or not, if it actually is going to dump after a rally... and the fact is that the market does not care about your technical voodoo. You need to watch for the the underlying factors that are driving price on the market,you need to infer what the market is actually doing today as a result of future expectactions. We do not work with our beliefs, with our greed or fear. We work understanding that the fundamental info of today  will get repriced tomorrow, and we should look for hints in the market that points us in that direction. Where are the capital flows going and why? If the largest funds are moving money into a market, they have a reason to do so. Your job is to discover where, and trade in that direction.

Most of retails traders trade based on technicals. '80% of retail investors accounts lose money when trading CFD's with this provider' . Can you be profitable using only technicals? Sure, but 4/5 guys trying will lose everything. Markets are moved by fundamentals, this is how it works, so there is little to lose from learning them. My point is, follow the industry standards if you found yourself consistently losing. You can keep trying to make your trading based solely on technicals. But remember that the market is filled with guys like me in the other side. Good luck and good trade.",finance

* I've determined the total interest just adds what I've paid all year. It makes me cringe, pre-thanks for your input on any lectures that I don't need.
* Contract payment for the first year was supposed to be $90 EVEN not 90.34, then it went up to 135.25 per contract, although they have only been withdrawing 135 even every month.
* After year two I got the interest rate lowered 3% due to my credit shooting up. I shopped around to see if refinancing elsewhere would be a good idea, but no keeping the loan in house was still cheaper by the interest rate.

What are my questions?

* How do I calculate my payment calendar properly?

personalfinance,"Home loan approved, can I buy a car? Or wait till after closing?","So, I'd to first thank this subreddit. I asked a home finance related question a few months ago and got great advice. Because if it, I ended up using a portion of our house sale proceeds to pay off high interest debt instead of putting it all towards our new house. This raised my credit substantially which scored me a great rate for the home loan on the new house. As of today, the loan is officially approved.

Current situation is my wife has been wanting to trade in her car and upgrade from a 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander to a new Tahoe. We shopped around and got an awesome end of year deal on a 2020 tahoe (saving almost 7k). The problem is we dont close for another 30 days and some limited research results has said that days prior to closing, the lender will basically do another check and any additional debt may not only jack up our rate but the lender could actually pull the loan altogether. The dealership already pulled credit.

My question now is: is this true? If not, is it worth chancing the interest rate/home loan to take advantage on the car deal? 

For reference, household income is 150k, home loan is approved at 152k at 2.8%, total debt now is 80k (that includes 15k that we still owe on her outlander) tahoe would add 68k in debt.

Edit: So it looks pretty unanimous already. Well go ahead and wait (and look into something more economical AFTER we close). Thank you everyone for your input, it was appreciated. I guess looking back, the answer was pretty clear but it was good be reassured that maybe my eyes were a little bigger than my stomach in this case.",finance

personalfinance,High Yield Savings Account + Citibank Support,"Hey everyone, 

I've learned a lot lurking on this subreddit so thank you for that. I had a quick question about high yield savings accounts. I've recently opened one with Citibank because I've been sitting on a good chunk of savings in my local bank and wanted to get better interest rates with the high yield savings account.

I know that the big online banks are safe because they're FDIC insured, but I guess I just find it a little uncomfortable still since I've been used to using a local bank with face-to-face support. My concern has kind of grown because after calling Citibank, I realized that their customer support seems pretty awful. I wanted them to explain to me what were to happen if I were locked out of my account for some reason and although they kept telling me that they have ways to verify my identity, they never explained the process they go through. And the person on the phone's English was pretty sub-par. Not exactly reassuring. 

I also found it odd that they don't get a photo ID of you on file? But I guess this isn't something online banks do like local banks?

Anyway, I was just curious if you guys recommend a decent high yield bank that has really good customer support because it's something that typically makes me feel better when dealing with money. How is Discover or Ally?

Anyone else feel the same way when switching to a bank that's all online and not local? :)",finance
personalfinance,Help with self-employment taxes,"Some background:

I have worked a few jobs this year that I will get W2s for. Total of around $5000 for the year, I believe.

In the past, I have not filed federal taxes as I have always made below the $12,000 limit. I have done my state and local for a few years, though -- I live in PA.

However, this year I have made some ""side-gig"" income on Rover (dogsitting app) and CourseHero (tutoring site). Total of $382 via Rover, and $28 on CH. From what I've read, I will need to file a Schedule C to report this income. My questions:

1. Since I now have SE income, I will need to file a federal tax return even though I am under the 12k limit, correct?
2. I would prefer to file the Schedule C-EZ as nothing about my situation is particularly complicated and I don't plan to deduct anything. BUT -- you can only file the EZ if you have ""one business."" Since I have done two side-gigs, would this count as two businesses? Or am I just a sole proprieter/freelancer that does multiple things (but still only counts as one ""business"")?
3. I've heard that I can deduct (half of?) my SE taxes from my normal income tax. How does this work?

For the next tax year, I plan to make much more side income from these sources as I got into them late this year. I also hope to sell handmade items as an additional source of some income. I plan to make enough in SE income to need to submit quarterly, and I had some questions about that as well.

1. When would the first quarterly payment be due for next year -- is it the April 15 date? The difference between years and tax years is confusing to me.
2. What would be the safest way to estimate payment? I am not sure as of now how much I will make, and I don't completely understand the bit about paying 100% of last year's taxes as estimated payments considering this is the first full year of my ""business""...Should the payments be equal, or can they vary based on how much I make in those months? Should (or can) I pay them all early to get it out of the way? I totally don't understand this estimated quarterly stuff at all, but I want to avoid penalties.

personalfinance,Can you help me calculate interest owed on a decade+ debt?,"I know this is stupid, but I don't know where else to post this.  

This question has pretty much been on my mind for over 10 years. It's just one of those little things that eats at me from time to time and I thought I'd explore it for once.  

When I was 12 years old, on my 12th birthday, I started my first job working for my uncle at the family grocery store. Almost immediately after being hired, I worked up the courage to ask my uncle if he would front the cost of a computer and let me pay him back over the course of the upcoming year. Surprisingly he agreed to do this.  

Quick back story: My family was/is poor, he was not. We didn't have a computer that could do anything beyond basic web browsing. I wanted to play games.  

I am 31 years old now, but I still remember the exact cost of the computer. It was $1,198.38. I paid $100 per month for 12 months towards this computer. I remember quite clearly the day I gave my final payment, which I provided to him in exact change. I must have thought I was being really cool or something. I handed him the final payment, and he said ""And interest?"" to which I replied ""Interest?"" because I'm an idiot.  

He explained the concept to me and I said ""well I didn't know about that"" but he said ""Nevermind, I'll write you a receipt""  

Ever since that day, I always felt like I owed this man still. I never knew what interest was until he explained it.  

My question now is, what would I owe him today considering the situation? What is a fair way to calculate my debt to him at this exact moment?  

I'm not very good with money, and I'm not smart enough to figure out how to calculate this. I also understand this is not a super appropriate sub for this question, but at the same time if I intend to pay this back it is technically a personal finance issue of mine.  

Thank you for helping me approach this problem, and I should probably seek therapy if this kind of thing keeps me up at night.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,Is it a bad move for me to put a large down payment in this low interest rate market?,"Background:

\- We are in late 30s

\- We max out my 401k contributions

\- I net about 8K a month (after contributions)

\- My wife nets about 4k a month

I want to buy a starter home for about $850k (in LA, this is a small home in a relatively safe neighborhood). I plan to live in it for about 12 years until my newborn has to go to high school (high school in the area is ranked in the bottom of the state).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of putting down a very high down payment (\~$550k+). Payment would come out to like $2500.

I like this for a few reasons:

1. Dislike high payments. Increase my ability to save what I earn.
2. Pay off the mortgage sooner (maybe in 5-7 years, but I'm aiming for a 30 year mortgage @ **3.5%**)

I dislike this for these reasons:

1. Colleagues are very adamant this is a bad idea. Opportunity cost on investing in the market is missed. Of course, this is not a sure win
2. Emergency funds are diminished

 I have only had this car a couple months And have already paid over $1,000 in interest. FUCK. ME.

I'll have it paid off in March. 

This means I'll have a year of history with my CU and then they'll let me take out an auto loan for a little lower interest rate. It's probably still pretty high seeing as I don't have a cosigner and am still a first time buyer.

personalfinance,Need help to restart my life,"Here’s my financial situation:

Brief backstory: I have bipolar disorder, not only is it hard for me to keep a job but during manic periods I spend like a fiend. I’m talking about maxing out a credit card and going to Dubai for a week – type of mania. I’m 35, I live at home, have no savings, no 401k, am $64k in debt and my credit score is 600.

I started a job 4 months ago in NYC, and for the first time ever, I’ve been living on a budget. I make $100k a year. With this new job, I have the following monthly budget (roughly):

* $600 savings
* $400 to 401k (w/ employer matching it comes out to $750)
* $360 for transit/healthcare benefits
* $0 emergency fund
* $0 rent
* $200 utilities
* $900 disposable income
* $110 phone
* $36 Subscriptions
* $1240 min payments to credit cards
* $2000 extra to pay down debt

Since I started this new budget, as of today I have $3300 in savings, $4100 in 401k, and reduced my debt to $57,000. I have paid off 4 credit cards ($1k, $1.1K, $3k &amp; $3.5k)

My outstanding credit card balances are $19k, $14.5k, &amp; $5k. I also maxed out a Line of Credit of $18k. I’m now paying off by highest interest rate. 

With paying off the 4 accounts, I now have an extra $320 per month. I decided to cap my debt payments at $2k and to keep the additional income for myself as it’s been really tight (again this is my first budget and it’s been super hard, plus I live in NYC).

This month I’m anticipating a tax return of at least $3600. I plan on splitting it in 3rds and putting $1.2k in savings, $1.2k in an emergency fund and $1.2k towards credit card debt.

By March, I will have paid off the $5k credit card balance, and I then plan to use that saved monthly payment to start an emergency fund of $100 per month. As well as increase my monthly savings to $800 per month.

In April, I will most likely be getting a $10k bonus (I already hit my targets). I plan on putting all of it towards my credit card debt.

My plan is to get a consolidation loan once I’ve reduced my debt by half – exactly a year from now. Figuring a $30k loan at 10% over 60 months, comes out to $550 a month. The savings will all go toward an emergency fund (checking account), savings account, and an additional account so I’m not living paycheck to paycheck. 

By April 2021, I plan on moving to Atlanta  (I can relocate for work). I’ll have roughly $25k in savings, $15k in my 401k and $3k in an emergency fund.

**Here are my questions:**

* When should I start my emergency fund?
* Is waiting a year from now too late for a consolidation loan? Should I get a consolidation loan ASAP to immediately save on interest? My concern is being locked into a high monthly payment which would eat into my savings (I want to move out in 16 months but won’t be able to do that if I’m paying &gt;$1000k month in loans). Would it make sense to get another consolidation loan a year later with a lower monthly payment once I’ve paid off enough of the balance and have a higher credit score?
* I’ve read on here that I should also have an IRA. Can I afford that? How would that work? Wouldn’t dividing contributions between two accounts reduce compound interest compared to having one single account?

personalfinance,Bank offering Accidental Death and Dismemberment Coverage,"I don't understand what this is.

""$1,000 credit union paid Accidental Death and Dismemberment coverage made available through Federal Insurance Company.  Remember, you pay nothing for this coverage.  It's our way of saying thanks.""

""Plus you can add up to $300,000 more coverage at a group rate of $1.10 a month per $10,000 of insurance protection for you.""",finance
personalfinance,"Extra 401k/IRA contributions, or pay off student debt","I have a 401k through Fidelity with a very low expense ratio. I take advantage of my employer's full match. If this is my only retirement contribution, then I'm not saving at a rate of 15%, which is my goal.

I have student debt at a fixed 5.625% interest rate. ($46k)

I'm 28 and have 8 years left until the debt is paid off if making minimum payments. Where would you be putting extra money? Towards retirement to get up to a 15% contribution rate, or towards the debt? My spouse and I have been making good contributions to retirement up to this point and are on track with the ""100% of your income at age 30"" heuristic.

I try to follow the prime directive exactly, but when interest rates are close to the expected return in the stock market, it seems to leave some room for making financial decisions based on individual philosophy. I'm just curious to hear your opinions on what you would do. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,"Help! Can I finance a new car, even if I still owe money for a different auto loan?","Here’s what happened: I totaled my car on December 13th. I still owed the bank $2,500 for it. My insurance will be paying me out for the total loss, after paying the bank first.

The problem is, I don’t have a car, and insurance is taking their sweet time to pay me. 

I can go put a down payment on a new one today, but will a dealer finance the car if it’s still showing I owe $2,500 on a different auto loan? Would that affect my chances of getting a good interest rate? 
Or should I just keep being patient and wait for insurance to pay the loan off first?

Thank you!!",finance
personalfinance,Not sure if I should follow my parents advice/request?,"Just graduated university and will start work next year. My before tax income is around 78k; after tax is 61k. I will be moving away from home and rent is 20% of weekly income. My living costs are low as I rarely eat out/travel. My student loan is at 17k as I paid most of it off whilst in university. Student loan is at a 5% interest rate. 

My parents have asked me to consider paying ~$100/wk for mortgage repayments on a property they bought for 300k in my home country a few years back. The valuation would probably be a bit more now. The mortgage repayments will be low as it’s mortgage minus the rent the property is generating. They intend to develop the property into multiple units. I will not be paying for the developmental costs - just the mortgage (100/wk) + insurance (~1.5k/year). The benefit is that my parents said they can give the property to me under my name as long as I agree to make the payments. 

What do you think? Should I go for it?

I feel like I should pay off my student loan ASAP before taking anything else onboard. I feel like I can pay 70% of the 17k in my first year of working. And definitely pay it off easily by early/mid 2020.",finance
financialindependence,Hedging against interest rate increases,[removed],finance
personalfinance,Hedging against interest rate rises,I am buying new construction condo in NYC which won't be finished until 6 months from now. I am financing via mortgage but the rate is only locked in for 4 months. I can pay up in points or rate to lock in for a longer period of time but I think it may be cheaper if I do it myself. What product/security would you recommend to buy via retail brokerage to hedge against rate increases over the next 6 months? I can short or go long but the underlying notional is fairly large so I'm thinking using options/futures. Does anyone have any recommendations for a hedging transaction that I can buy via interactive brokers?,finance
personalfinance,What happened to the Capital One 360 Money Market?,"I have this as my savings account which was getting me 1.9%. Now it shows it's 1.5% (never got a notification that this reduced) and when I try to look up the product, it doesn't show up on the CO website. Instead, it's the Performance Savings or some such at 1.7%.

Should I switch? Can I just convert so I can get the 1.7%?

EDIT: The drop overall makes sense given the federal cuts, I'm just wondering what happened to the product in general.",finance
personalfinance,Managing Debt and Pay-off Schedule,"I wanted to discuss my specific financial situation and solicit input. My wife (24F) and I (25M) are currently in stable jobs with manageable debts that we intend to pay-off as quickly as possible, while still enjoying life with yearly trips, budgeted nights out, and saving for retirement. My question is regarding which debts to pay first. Below is a financial summary:

\- Combined gross family income of $189,750

\- Maximizing retirement saving with $39,000/yr pre-tax in 401(k) + $12,000/yr IRA

\- Student loan $95,000 @ 3.55%

\- Mortgage $204,000 @ 4.625%

\- Car note $22,000 @ 2.99%

Anything we aren't saving or budgeting for monthly expenses is being thrown to pay down the above. My question is should we be paying the mortgage down since it is the highest interest rate? My thought was since it is such a large amount and long term loan, it would be more prudent to pay them in order of smallest the largest (interest rates are \~equivalent around 3%). Another thought that has struck me is to continue paying minimum monthly payments to each and invest the remainder in the market as I would likely earn more than the ""guaranteed"" ROR from paying down the loans above.",finance
Banking,Bank lending constraints,"Hi, I'm trying to clarify the idea of fractional lending. I get the standard example. Joe deposits $1000, the bank can then lend out $900 if the reserve requirement is 10%. The money supply expands, etc.

But this seems like it can cause a constraint on the bank's ability to lend. If a bank only has $1,000,000 total deposits, does that mean that it can only lend up to $900,000? What if that 900k is lent out and someone comes wanting to borrow another $50,000?

I've never heard of a bank say they can't lend money because they hit their lending limit. Is this because the bank is still able to lend that extra $50k? They do this by going to the repo market and borrow $5k so they meet the FED's reserve requirement of 10%, which is $5k on the $50k lent out? As long as they can borrow the $5k at 1.5% and lend out the $50k at 4%, they capture a tidy interest profit.

Essentially, what I am asking is ... **do bank's borrow from the FED/repo market at a discounted rate (say 1.5%) so they can continue to lend money commercially at a higher rate (say 4%)? Thereby not being constrained simply by fractional reserve system and the actual deposits on hand?**",finance

personalfinance,Reasonable Timeline/Budget for Student Loans?,"Hi Reddit! I am about to graduate from a master’s program and me and my SO have a metric f*ton of student loans between us, especially given our fields: 210K w/ interest rates ranging from a low of 3% to a high of 9%. All of my loans are federal ($110K) and SO’s are about 50/50 private/federal ($100K). SO’s private loan is also the big interest rate, and sadly the biggest loan. 


We both qualify for some loan forgiveness programs, namely PSLF, but since we’re both young and making decent money I’m hoping to knock it out as quickly as possible.


For reference: SO makes $60K a year with ~$2K increases per year. I am anticipating making $50-60K a year (likely closer to $50K when I graduate and then a sizable increase + some loan repayment help after year 2. Unless I win the lottery I doubt I’ll make more than $60K at year 5 after graduating). 


Our idea is to try to live off of my salary, whatever that is, and throw his entire salary + whatever is lost to taxes at our loans every year (to equal an even $60K). We would be building a reasonable e-savings account simultaneously. We would attack private loans and high interest loans first. 


Expenses:
- Apartment, utilities: $1500/mo
- Food: $400/mo
- Car insurance, upkeep, and gas (SO drives d/t work): $300/mo
- Spending: $200/ea/mo
- Transit: Free now for me, but $110/mo after graduation in June
- Holiday Travel Fund (both families are out of state): $50/mo


Does this seem like a reasonable approach? Any advice for two young folks just starting out on their financial journey?? 


Also, my math seems to be working out...too easily. People really struggle to repay debt - am I missing a huge expense or something? It seems like we should be rid of this monster in 5 years paying $60K/year...am I completely off track? I’m pretty concerned that I have not done a good job of anticipating how much is going to be taken out of our paychecks for healthcare, retirement, etc.

personalfinance,Cash out refi on a rental property...,"I'm 28, single, employed and have a rental property in CA. My credit score is 770. 

Surpassing the details, I ran into some unexpected (and very costly) expenses earlier this year, basically one right after another. I had some funds in savings but not nearly enough - multiple lessons learned there. Most of the bleeding has stopped now, so-to-speak, but I'm now sitting on about $30k in new debts. Most of this is on a personal loan, some of the more recent debt is on a CC. I'm actively paying on both, although it's been slow so far. 

The rental property I mentioned was purchased in 2011, and last refinanced in 2015 for a lower interest rate, and I was living in the house up until 2018. In early 2018, I relocated and started renting it out. There is $203k on the current mortgage, and approximate value today is somewhere between $490-530k. 

My thought is to do a cash-out refi to clean the slate on the immediate debts. The thing I don't like is that I would have to refi as an investment property, which means higher interest rates. After researching and watching rates for a couple of months, I was able to find a couple of reputable lenders that have close to my current interest rate in a 20yr option, which fits into my budget and would still allow me to start saving again. 

Why I'm thinking this way...well, I'm going to be changing jobs around the middle of the new year, and relocating yet again to somewhere around 800 miles away...I plan to keep the rental but don't want to tow the debt (and potentially a lower credit score) with me when I'm looking for a new place, whether that ends up being renting or buying. I'd rather try to build up savings between now and then, while I can, and maintain my good credit. 

Is a refi a wise decision here? Just looking for some general thoughts and input, maybe from others that have gone through a similar situation as well...

Thanks!",finance
investing,Fed Reserve Repo's,"So the Fed had a reverse repo operation on the market worth 64 billion today (unusually high in short term comparison). The way I understand it is this means the Fed sold treasury securities in a short term repo operation (temporarily unload some of it's balance sheet). I could be wrong about this so please correct me here.

Can someone explain to me how this will impact the precious metals and bond markets if at all?

personalfinance,What to do with extra income?,"So, for graduation/Christmas I received a decent amount of money and I'm not sure what I should do with it. I am starting a new job on the first week of January and I currently have like 5 dollars to my name. I'm not sure if I should save this money and start up a fund for an apartment or if I should pay off a small federal loan with it ($1,000). After taxes, I should be making a little over $3,000 a month. I plan on putting $350 a month into a 401k as soon as I can (3 months from now), paying $1,200 towards my student loans while I'm still at home (\~20,000), putting $700 a month into a savings account, and the remainder for gas/food/fun or anything else. If I had a job where my commute was close and I was going to be living at home for a while, I would just put this money towards a loan. However, my commute into NYC for my job is almost 2 hours (potentially more depending on what location I am sent to) there AND back and I have to be on site at 6:30 am meaning I will be waking up at like 4:45 am. I do not know how long I can sustain that, so I am considering living at home for as long as I possibly can and then when the commute takes its inevitable toll on me, rent an apartment in the city. The city is hella expensive though and I will need to save up probably $4,000 to move if an apartment at $1500 per month needs the first month, last month, security deposits, etc.  I just graduated in the start of December and my loans don't even have me listed in my grace period yet so I have some time on the loan I was going to put it towards before it even starts to collect interest. I'm just not sure if I should save this money and start a savings account, start saving for an apartment, or put it towards a loan.",finance
personalfinance,Best investing website for beginner with Index Funds,"Hi everyone, so I am finally looking to get into investing (29 years old) and am wondering what the best investing website/app may be for getting into investments with index funds.  I have been watching some videos on youtube and it seems that may be a safe bet with low annual fees and the safe nature of that type of investing.  I am very new at this and have just about no experience.  I do have a 403b through my work but that is it.  Not sure if it is wise to do additional investing outside of that account or what.  
Based on my beginning research, it seems some of my options are etrade, TDAmeritrade, Fedality, Vanguard, etc.  Do all of these sites do index funds?  Any recommendations for someone who is new?",finance

personalfinance,What's a good credit score to aim for when it comes to possible private student loans and their interest rates?,"I may (emphasis on may) go to college, and in doing so I may go abroad just because I can. Obviously I want the highest credit score I can make, and I know this takes time and effort. That all being said, I don't want to starting planning for UBC or something until I have the kind of credit score to where any debt is at a ludicrous interest rate. 

Thanks in advance",finance
