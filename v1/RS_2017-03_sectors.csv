personalfinance,Confused about federal witholding!,"Hi Personal Finance! Here is some back story: my husband is out of work since April 2016, and is receiving very small Workman's Comp checks bimonthly. I can't remember exactly when, but I increased the amount of federal AND state witholding because I got in a panic that we would somehow owe money back at tax time. 

   Well we got our taxes done today and we are getting back about 5 grand between fed and state. Now we don't necessarily want back*quite* that much, but do I need to repeat the process of changing how much is taken out every year? Or does the amount I chose carry over from year to year? 

   Thank you in advance for the advice.",finance
personalfinance,I'm helping a 39 year old doctor friend of mine invest in a 401k for the very first time. These funds look expensive and as a Boglehead I'd like to help him find index funds or target-date type funds. Are there any in this prospectus?,"As the title says.  These seem like typical, expensive funds.  He gets a 100 percent match up to 5 percent though, so I definitely feel like he should participate.  I told him I'd help him look for low-cost index funds, but I'm not sure if there are any in this prospectus:

Are there any in there that fit the bill?  He is absolutely lost in this stuff and his ""gut told him"" that he should do:

25% - BlackRock Health Sciences Opportunities Portfolio - Investor A Class  
15% - Federated Kaufmann Fund - Class A  
20% - Nuveen Inflation Protected Securities Fund - Class A  
15% - The Oakmark International Fund - Service Class  
15% - Virtus Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund - Class A

personalfinance,"Rent/Buy housing decision for single software engineer in Las Vegas, NV","I'm on the path towards financial independence. I'm saving over 50% of my take home pay. I currently live in Las Vegas and I'm trying to decide if I should buy a home again as an investment. Right now I'm really biased as I did it once before and it worked out tremendously for me. 

I make $125k/year as a software engineer in Las Vegas. I'm single with no family. I have no debts, net worth is $75k, I'm maxing out 401k and my Roth IRA and taxable left over. I'm able to put away about $60k a year going forward now. I qualify as a first time home buyer with a 3% conventional loan program through Chase or 5% down payment with any other conventional loan + PMI. I'm not sure what the rates are available for any piggyback loans to avoid PMI or if that is still an option in this market. I have the cash today for a down payment. 

I bought a home in 2012 at the bottom of the Vegas housing market and became an accidental landlord after layoffs that happened 9 months later. I bought the home for $185k with a 3% down payment and had a mortgage with an APR of 3%. I had tenants in it paying $1,500 a month until I was able to sell it at the peak of $275k. Talking to a realtor now my old home would comp in at $268k in this market. I used the proceeds of that to start a company but wasn't successful. The market is still really strong with 6,000 inventory (3 months worth), with great expected outlook. Prices have been flat the past year mostly due to rising interest rates putting pressure on home prices. 

Right now I'm renting a smaller home for $1,500 a month - a 3 bed 2.5 bath 1,600 sq ft. A home like that would go for about $200k and its a lot smaller than my 4 bed 2.5 ba 2,200 sq ft home I used to own. Mortgage rates are about 4.25% APR now. If I went up to my budget range of $275k after tax &amp; insurance the monthly payment on a 30 year loan would be $1,520/mo of $950/mo going to interest and $280/mo going to taxes and home insurance with about $290/mo going to equity. 

Assuming the Vegas market corrects and gets historical 3% real returns, 6% seller paid worst case closing costs (commissions/etc.), and 7% stock real returns and I sell after five years of ownership here is my personal rent/buy table for a $275k house that will have the same exact monthly payment vs renting but be a standard of living upgrade:    
&amp;nbsp;    
       
Year|$8.5k down payment invested instead (100% stocks) | House Value | Loan Balance | Net profit after 6% closing costs | Amount gained if I sold at buy price after 6% closing costs|   
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--    
1|$8,848.13|$283,374.65|$261,175.65|$5,196.52|$-2,675.65   
2|$9,489.63|$292,004.33|$256,518.84|$17,965.23|$1981.16

5|$11,706.91|$319,502.45|$241,286.77|$53,748.743|$17,213.23   
&amp;nbsp;    
   
If I move down to a $200k purchase comparing apples to apples of the exact home I'm renting I'd save $330 a month and so the raw savings would look like invested:    
&amp;nbsp;     

Year|$6k down payment invested|Raw monthly payment savings (100% stocks) | House Value | Loan Balance | Net profit (6% closing costs) | net profit + rent savings | Sold @ buy price | break even price + rent savings

&amp;nbsp;     

So it seems like in a break even market I'd have a holding period of 4 years before the rent saved would out perform just investing the 3% down payment, and if the market continues up even at a modest pace the huge leverage would pay off. Of course any major repair like a heater or air conditioner going out would wipe out the break even gains. Of course if the market goes negative then it would be bad for me but as long as you don't refinance in Nevada first mortgages are non recourse so the hugest risk is a bad credit mark if it goes underwater and I decide to not pay the difference.

Stress wise I don't know if I can handle being a landlord again should I ever be in that situation even if its cash flow positive. I had a two year property management agreement with someone I vetted well (as I rented a property from her and loved her responsiveness as a manager) but to to her declining health I got stuck with dealing a lot more as a landlord then I should of ever had. After I gave written notice ending the contract the brokerage threatened to sue me without basis. It ended quickly when they got investigated based on the real estate board complaint I then filed in response to their threats and they dropped it. It was also a real stressor at the time as when I last owned a house I only had an income of $60k. I ended up moving to SF on a $90k salary with not much savings. Now I've really turned my financial situation around making 125k in Vegas or 145k in SF and could handle occupancy if I ever have to rent out a home again.

Short term holdings obviously a house won't work out at all no matter how you cut it. I'd have to hold at least 3 years either as my home or as a rental. At current Las Vegas market outlooks the $200k home will win at the end with slightly more ongoing compounding rent savings, with the $275k not doing bad and having a much higher leverage effect if real returns go past 3% in the Vegas housing market. Anything below $200k has too many issues on the Vegas market for my quality of life. Of course Vegas could have another growth spurt like I caught the first time.

Job wise I'm in the game industry at my old employer who had the layoffs that happened the first time I had a home. Even though my salary has now more than doubled (60k to 125k) since returning there, it being the video games industry always brings uncertainty. I could very well find myself in the Bay Area or another place again should things not work out in a year. 

Long term Vegas is on my list for retirement places (assuming Lake Mead water levels get addressed/sorted out.) among other places such as Florida/etc. I wouldn't say its my number one place to retire either but I have a feeling that I want to be hedged a bit too by ensuring I have at least one nice property I can retire too if land ever becomes increasingly in demand. Maybe its just a bit of the Bay Area leaking out of me as there I couldn't afford to save up a house as the house costs and down payment requirements were going higher than I could afford maxing out all my savings. It is definitely appealing to see if I can repeat the extreme success riding a $180k home to $275k brought me the first time.

As the title says, I have a huge amount of student debt that I want/need to start paying off. I am about to start a job and will be making $83,500 yearly before taxes in VA. I am moving in with my brother to save on costs of living. I have free internet, as contracted with the company, but need to pay for everything else (rent, utilities, car insurance, phone, food, etc.) My brother and I haven't chosen a place to live yet, and I was hoping I could get advice on the amount of rent I should try to aim for (we will be splitting it evenly, so I was hoping to pay maybe 600 tops on my end for just rent.) My debt is pretty much 210,000 on the dot with an interest rate of 6%. I've never lived on my own, or managed my finances entirely. I know I need to put money in a 401k, but I'm not really sure what it even does. For all intents and purposes, I am a noob when it comes to finances.

personalfinance,Help with our snowball strategy,"My SO and I are working on our debt snowball. We keep finding ourselves lost as to how to mush everything together.
We both have decent jobs and make a fair wage.

We currently have planned a destination wedding this October and have a budget somewhere between $5k-8k (depending on which options we select) and we have already sent the Save the Dates out.

We're trying to decide if we should spend $10k on a long honeymoon or put off the honeymoon for several years and use it to pay off student loans.

I am currently going to school and am getting my current federal student loans at 3.76% (consolidated government existing loans are at 5.25% and 5.69 % for private).

Things that are up for debate:
Use all extra monthly income to pay off all student loan debt first (based on our calculations this would pay off the student loan debt by end of 2019)

Save money for honeymoon and then pay off student loan debt . We plan on using my decent tax return as the start of the honeymoon savings account ($5k)(the budget for the wedding is already accounted for separately and sitting in savings $8k)

Save money for aging furnace and central a/c (22 years old each) and then start paying off student loan debt (We guess between $5k-8k to replace both)

Using my current school to get loans at 3.76% and use that to pay off the higher interest loan at 5.69% and then pay this off at the end of the snowball.

Here are the specifics:

My student loans:
Government Loan- $8600 @ 5.25% and has 141 payments left at a consolidated monthly payment of $85

Private Loan - $13,600 @5.69% and has 114 payments left @ $173 a month

Engagement Ring- $8719 @ 10% and has 48 payments left of $214 a month

SO's student loan:

Government Loan $33,240 with average interest rate of 5.75% and has 96 payments left at $329 (based on minimum payment). In May she is starting to pay an extra $1000 a month on her loan.

Including the extra $1000 she is putting on her student loans we have an extra $2000 total to put towards debt or saving for the honeymoon or eventual replacement of the furnace and a/c.

I recently lost my job and got a severance package and was able to find a job within a timely manner. We plan on using the severance package to pay off the engagement ring since it has the highest interest rate (and giving us the extra $214 for snowball).

 Stopped paying in April, account went into collections in August. 

As of Feb 1, it hit her credit as officially in collections. She's worked extremely hard to bring her credit up from the low 500s to nearly 800 over the past 2 years, so this is extremely disheartening to her. 

What are her options? Obviously paying it off is the best bet, but she has no cash to pay it off with. She's been working on paying off her other debt and doesn't have much in reserves. We're working on that.

What else can she do? She is currently considering opening another credit card with 0% interest and paying it off with that. Then paying on that while it's still in that no interest rate. Advisable?",finance

financialindependence,"Well, it looks like the thing that got me into FIRE might happen again soon - government shutdown","I'm a federal employee.  In 2013, two things happened.  In April, the [Washington Post profiled Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/meet-mr-money-mustache-the-man-who-retired-at-30/2013/04/26/71e3e6a8-acf3-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story.html?utm_term=.4a16f1e4ed56).  That was my introduction for FI principals (and MMM himself).  My significant other and I were already saving a decent amount of our income, around 15%.  Since I planned on working till normal federal retirement age, I thought the article was interesting, but not relevant to us.

Fast forward to October.  [The federal government shut down for 16 days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2013).  We had enough saved so that we were fine.  I cleaned the garage and worked in the yard, but I was completely preoccupied with the shutdown.  I surfed the news hour after hour every day to see when the hell I could go back to work.  It took awhile, but I eventually realized that in the current political atmosphere, my federal job was a lot less secure than federal jobs used to be.  We got on the FIRE train.

Well what do you know, [here we are again](https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2017-02-21/in-trumps-future-looms-a-familiar-shutdown-threat).  If congress can't agree on a federal funding authorization, there might be a shutdown when the current funding authority expires on April 28.  Furthermore, I think that risks to federal employment might increase in other ways as well - budget cuts to agencies, changes in employment status, things like that.

I am not a FIRE superhero.  We don't have the best savings rate, don't make the most frugal decisions, and aren't planning to retire super early.  But we have used FIRE principles to be in a position where a shutdown (or worse) would be more of an inconvenience than an existential threat to our wellbeing.

Currently 26 and in december made a rash decision to buy a house (or more acurately I paid a small deposit - 2k - to lock in a house and land package that gets titled in December of this year).

The total cost of the package is 350k (a little less I think actually 341k but dont have to documents on me). in november I apply for my mortgage and need to have 21k saved (acording to my pre aproval) I also had to clear my debts and thats where the thank you comes from.

&amp;nbsp;


I have always lived paycheck to paycheck and using your advice since december I have managed to clear:

&amp;nbsp;


Credit card (AMEX): $2.5k
Personal loan (not fully cleared yet): down from 7k to 2.2k
Education loan (for a cert 4 in training and assessment/ this wasn't needed but I like to learn): 2.2k

She works part time from home making $15/hr but works inconsistent hours (usually less than 15 a week). She is a pre-med student who is also graduating this semester, and will be taking a gap year to apply to medical schools this year. She also will hopefully work a more consistent job during that year. Neither of us has really kept track of our money as we basically share and plan on marrying eventually. We both know this is bad practice and want to get better about it and start keeping track/budgetting, but it's something we have yet to do.

One manager even told me to take it up with FedEX. I had to explain to her that it's impossible as the seller has insurance on the package not me and he's the only one that can get the money. If I can help stop 1 person from getting a Capital One this post will be worth it.

Also, any experts know what I can do to fight my case and get my money back. Even the manager agreed I never signed for all the packages but their dispute department is looking at only the 1 master package I signed for even though I only did that because they told me too. How do I get my money back or is Capital One this shitty of a company.

TLDR.
I purchase items
Seller doesn't send with signature
I dispute transaction when left at door as I wasn't home
Capital One sided with Merchant
I lose dispute yet I proved and sent proof of only signing for 1 package and not the other 3.",finance

27 yrs old

Renting apartment for $775/mo in midatlantic US

Not married but living with long term girlfriend

Credit Score 784

Annual income ~$60k


**Assets:**
$500 in emergency fund (working to build this back up to ~$3000)

$17,000 in VGHCX

$13,000 in new 401k (see notes below)


**Credit Cards:**
I have a few credit cards. I never carry a balance. Typically use them for purchases larger than my weekly balances in my checking accounts. Basically if I’m waiting on a paycheck to come through so I don’t dip into my savings.

**Student Loans:**

**1)	Loan A:**

a.	Balance - $59,994.87

b.	Interest Rate – 5.24%

c.	Monthly Payment - $448.65

**2)	Loan B:** 

a.	Balance - $11,954.10

b.	Interest Rate – 3.5%

c.	Monthly Payment - $158.86

**3)	Loan C:** 

a.	Balance - $3,053.87

** **Strategy:** I split my monthly loan payments with my parents who have graciously agreed to pay half of my loans. The current total monthly payment is $718.88 and we pay an extra $581.12 each month for a total monthly payment of $1300.  I used to use the avalanche method to put the extra $$ towards my highest interest loan but I have since changed my mind and switched to the snowball method. 


**Notes:**
1)	The company I work for was acquired by another company in 2016. We have changed names and we have a different 401k plan. I just rolled my old 401k funds into the new 401k.

a.	10% contribution entirely to the Fidelity Freedom 2060 fund (1.27% expense ratio?)

b.	**Company does not match.**

**Questions:**

1)	Should I be contributing to my 401k with my loans at the rates they are at? 

a.	If I stop contributing, aren’t I missing out on valuable years of compounding interest?

b.	Any benefit to rolling my 401k (or part of it) into an IRA or Roth IRA? I already did my taxes this year but I could file an amendment if it makes sense.

2)	The VGHCX funds were a gift from family almost 13years ago. Is it a decent idea to pay off some loans with this? Its 3yr, 5yr, &amp; 10yr average annual returns are more than twice the highest interest rate loan I have. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,"30-Day Challenge #3: Prepare your Tax Return Accurately and File Early (March, 2017)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Prepare your Tax Return Accurately, and File Early**. 

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've filed your US federal income tax return by March 31st.

Recommended Steps:

###Plan
1. **Learn how US income taxes work:**
* Watch [Basics of US income tax rate schedule](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/basics-of-us-income-tax-rate-schedule)
* Watch [Tax deductions introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/tax-deductions-introduction)
* Read /r/personalfinances's very own [wiki page on income tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes)
* *Understand* what exactly your tax return is: A form you fill out, telling the government how much money you made, calculating how much taxes you owe on that money (your ""tax liability""), and ""squaring-up"" with the government: Figuring out if you already paid more than your actual tax liability throughout the year with paycheck withholdings (in which case you will get a tax *refund*), or if you haven't paid enough throughout the year, and owe a balance to the government.
2. [Determine your filing status](https://www.irs.gov/uac/what-is-my-filing-status) and determine whether you can be claimed as a dependent by anyone (for example, your parents), or can claim any dependents. ([IRS Dependent Tool](https://www.irs.gov/uac/who-can-i-claim-as-a-dependent))
3. **Prepare a ""map"" for what documentation you will need to fill out your tax return**, then go through the list and make sure you have the documentation for each. **Don't worry if you forget something.** The software you use to fill out your tax return (or the tax return form itself) will remind you of things you might have forgotten.
* Jot down every possible way you made money this year (remember, even if you don't get a form, you still need to report it):
    * paycheck from my job (W-2 form)
    * interest on my bank account (personal records like your December account statement, or a 1099 form)
    * dividends from my stock (1099-Div)
    * income from my small business or self employment (personal records, or 1099 form)
* Make a list of all the possible deductions you might think you are eligible for, and make sure you have documentation:
    * mortgage interest you paid (1098)
    * student loan interest you paid (1098-E)
    * education expenses (1098-T)
    * state or local income taxes (W-2)
    * charitable contributions (personal records)

### Prepare and file your Tax Return
**Using one of the following methods**

1. See if you are eligible for [completely free tax return preparation software](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) sponsored by the IRS
2. Use paid (or free) tax return preparation software. Examples: TaxAct, TurboTax, CreditKarma, AARP, FreeTaxUSA, TaxSlayer. [See our megathread for discussion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ohy01/tax_filing_software_megathread_a_comprehensive/)
3. ""Manually"" fill out the tax return form online using [IRS Free Fillable Forms](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)

By starting early, it allows you more time to deal with unanticipated questions about your tax return. ""Wait, can I claim my girlfriend as a dependent""? ""Do I have to report income from renting out the spare room in my house to a friend?"". When these come up, feel free to create [a new post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/submit?selftext=true) asking for help with as much details as you can provide.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan help request,"Hello, so I recently graduated college but now find myself in a huge mountain of debt ($100,000) and it's all in private loans through Sallie Mae. I honestly regret doing this and should have gone to community college and worked during college but whatever, I can't change the past. I landed a job for a six month contract where I am making $42,000 a year (so $21,000 over these six months). I'm living at home, bought a used car I almost have paid off and basically doing everything I can to save money at this point.

My question is, I want to start paying off my loans but need help in determining how much I should be paying on them until they are actually due (i'm in grace period but don't want interest to build up and also just want to take them out asap) I understand that just paying as much as I can is the best option but i'm wondering if there is a calculator or maybe someone could help me out on how much I have to pay per month. It's a little tricky because it is 8 separate loans all with varying interest rates. 

If anyone could help me out or guide me on how to calculate this that would be great.

Thanks!

personalfinance,Shopping for mortgage with potential fed rate hike coming,"My spouse and I are starting the process of getting pre-qualified (then pre-approved) for a mortgage and buying a house (this spring, hopefully).

My question is, is there anything that I need to do, look out for, ask about, etc. knowing that this could be coming while we're looking for a house? Or just don't worry about it because it's out of our control? Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,Help!!! This middle aged lady needs some advice!,"I will try to make this quick and to the point.
1. I live in a home that is 30% underwater and no sign that will change in the next ten years. Value today $70,000 on a good day. I owe $104,000.
2. I have $26,000 in credit cards and I'm using Greenpath to make payments $300 bi weekly.

4. I make a good salary over $85,000.
5. I have about $6,000 medical bills.
6. Single and get no child support (17/25 he old sons live with me) cuz I'm technically married but living apart for years cuz I can't afford a divorce either!

Problems:
- my current bills exceed my income; as I also have two loans from 401k so my take home is like $2100 after insurance and taxes.
- my house loan is thru a credit union and they are not federally backed so even if I go bankrupt the credit union would fight back and win (so says bankruptcy attorney)that house not be included in my bankruptcy.

personalfinance,Small Personal Loan Lenders for Bad Credit,"Hello PF! 

I am one of the many who suffers from the curse of a wayward youth. I have been making significant progress, but another bump (garnishment) has just come up from 4 years ago I knew nothing about.

Long story short with all the progress I have made (paying around $900 per month) it doesn't do any real good as making those payments doesn't help out my credit at all and with a baby on the way in a couple years the lady and I would like to buy a house. 

I have about $4k in the bank, and some things, like my school loans, are rehabilitated and on time, have a credit builder credit card, and a credit advance through my bank, all of which are low balance. 

My goal is to pay off through a personal loan all the extraneous things on my credit report. This totals out to about $11,000 which I applied for through my bank and was turned down. The joy of knowing how much easier those consolidated payments would be rather than all the separate ones would be amazing.

My request for advice is for high risk lenders, (Credit score 629,639, 655, I have it monitored) who wouldn't ding me too bad on the interest rate but I have a better chance of getting approved through. Or any other advice in general in my situation would be most welcome!

personalfinance,Pay off 2nd home loan or increase 401k Contributions?,"Wondering the best route.  Here is my current situation:

* Me: Single, 28 yo
* Salary at approx. $75k
* Maxing out Roth IRA every year.
* Contributing 6% of paycheck to meet company match (of 30%) in Roth 401k
* Own a home and have 2 roommates - they are effectively paying off my main mortgage (I cover utilities).
* I have a 2nd loan that was used in getting the home (80/15/5)- interest rate of 6%.  The second loan is approx. $195 but I have been making contributions of $300 since I purchased the home.

Goals:

* Max out 401k
* Pay off 2nd loan
* Get capital to get 2nd rental property (hoping to achieve this in the next 2-4 years).
 
My options:

1. Increase my contributions to my 401k - would like to make the max contributions sooner than later (obvious life adjustment will have to happen).
2. Increase my 2nd loan contributions - thinking of $500 or $600 to pay it off in the next 3-4 years.


Questions:

* Considering I'd like to invest in more real estate, would having a 2nd loan be troublesome in getting a new mortgage (hence my desire to pay it off sooner than later)?
* If I do plan to increase my contributions in my 401k, would it make sense to open up a Traditional 401k instead?  I'd then roll the tax savings into my Roth IRA. Or perhaps a 50/50 split in my 401k (roth and trad.).
* Best option for financing the second home? Considering HELOC, Home Equity loan, or cash out refi. 

Note: I plan to remodel the 2nd home as I did with my primary residence but am patient in getting the right investment (ie. no rush but want to be ready to get it when the opportunity opens).",finance

personalfinance,The awful economics of day care OR that moment when you realize your marginal tax rate is 40%,"I have a good problem. Gorgeous wife, baby. Healthy people.  Healthy income, albeit in a high-cost area of the US. 

After a small raise, it became quite clear hat my marginal tax rate is about 40%. So let's say my wife wants to work. Day care runs $2,000/month, realistically. Like I said high cost area. So she needs to make $2000 to pay for it. Actually she needs to make $3300/month pre tax. $40k/ year. Which means it's really not worth it unless she can earn $60k so we would get some benefit out of it. 

Granted there are some benefits that reduce the net cost. Still the second income to pay for child care makes no sense for us unless she can walk into a $60k/ year job tomorrow, which nets us $1000/month in spending money/ savings. 

ETA: Just to be clear, I'm not a 1% percenter looking to complain. Excellent middle class salary in a high cost area of a high cost state, federal+state+social security taxes take up about 40 cents of each extra dollar I earn.",finance

personalfinance,What to do with a US Treasury I-Bond inheritance?,"My grandfather recently passed and he left me about $150k in US Treasury I-Bonds. Face value of the bonds is $102k and interest earned so far is ~$46k. The bonds were all issued between 2004 and 2008 and are currently earning between 3.88% and 4.18%. They mature after 30 years from the issue date.

I don't have an immediate need for this money, but am wondering if these bonds are the best vehicle to invest this money in. The interest rate looks good now, but they were only earning about 1.10%-1.40% just a few short months ago since the rate is variable and tied to inflation. Moving the money to stocks has the potential to yield a much higher return over the long term.

A) I immediately get pre-approved for a home loan on my own, and buy a house in my name only.  Once her credit improves, we refinance to include both our salaries (this would qualify us for a larger loan, the difference could be put toward renovations)

B) We immediately get pre-approved for a home loan together, and buy a house in both our names (for a larger loan than above, but with a higher interest rate).  Once her credit improves, we refinance for a lower interest rate.

C) We wait for her credit to improve (crossing our fingers that it improves FAST), get pre-approved together, and buy a home.

Which strategy do you recommend, PF?  Is there a 4th strategy I'm not considering?

Strategy A and B seems risky in the refinancing part... is it expensive/difficult to refinance?

Strategy C seems risky in that we have no idea when her credit will improve, and it might take too long (as house prices rise, and we get closer to August)

personalfinance,Eye-Catching Title About Private Student Loan Debt Consolidation Help Needed Here,"Hello all. I don't want to get too much into the specifics about my financial situation here, but I am looking for some solid, potentially out-of-the-box solutions. I have federal and private loans from my time at a private college and an expensive graduate program. I have the federal loans essentially taken care of at this point. What troubles me is the 6 figures of private student loan debt that is coming close to repayment at the end of the month. I've looked into consolidation but honestly the figures i've seen do not bring down my monthly payments to sustainable levels. What I am realistically looking for is a way to consolidate my two large private loans into one private loan over a time period of 25-30 years. I've only seen lending entities offer consolidation over a period of 20 years max. 

So my question would be: Are there any private consolidation entities that offer longer-term loan deals or is there potentially another way to elongate the repayment period of my private loans - maybe like trying to pay them off with a personal loan? (idk) Thanks!",finance
Bitcoin,Something to think about vis-a-vis segwit vs. on-chain HF scaling,"I'm still so naive I think we all want the same thing.  I think we all want bitcoin to scale to everyone in the world and we just differ about the right technical way to get there.  

However, there is a reality here.

There are two major kinds of bitcoin users.  People who treat bitcoin as an investment/commodity/digital-gold-like asset and the people who want to use it as a payment network.

The thing to understand here is that the people who want to use bitcoin as an investment vehicle, for it's unique properties as a currency (21 million coins, fixed inflation schedule, etc. etc) do not need on-chain scaling.

Frankly, most of the people will **prefer** 3rd party custodial accounts.  They are going to want to use Etrade, Fidelity, Schwabb over meeting some stranger at localbitcoins or otherwise navigating the backwaters of trying to acquire bitcoin in the real world.

If an ETF launches, and I realize that is a really big if, it will allow bitcion to scale to many tens of millions of new users over night.  Sure, they will all be on 3rd party custodial accounts but, frankly, these people will prefer that.  They will feel far safer having their COIN shares sitting on an exchange they are familiar with, with all of their existing trading tools.

The point here is that the investor class does not need any on-chain scaling, including segwit.

If someone wants to pay $10 to perform an actual on-chain transaction to control their own personal wealth, they will happily do so.  (A good example here is the difference between buying physical gold and paper gold.  There's a huge price premium to buy and sell actual physical gold; which is why almost no one does it any more).

What segwit offers is a way to get some on-chain scaling today and, most importantly, accelerate layer-2 technologies which in theory all true bitcoiners really care about and want to see happen.

But, it's important to note.  It's not needed for this use case. 

If segwit never activates and the network continues to function exactly as it does today, with the same transaction capacity, the digital-gold use case is not blocked.  Also, federated sidechains, which obviously are not fully decentralized but at least limit custodial control, can and do still work, as they are working today.

So, if the on-chain scaling crowd thinks the digital-gold folks are somehow going to 'fold' at some point.  That's really not going to happen.

So, perhaps people just start flowing value into some alt-coin which is more focused on low-fee, low-value, fast confirmation payment transactions, maybe that's where things end up.

Everyone likes to say bitcoin is useless if you can't use it for payments.  But it's not.  Because you can still use it for payments.  People are moving money on it all of the time; arguably with ever higher and higher fees pricing out low-value use cases; but to the digital gold crowd that's not a problem.

Personally, I want the best of both worlds.  I want my digital gold, and I also want my layer-2 networks.  That's what segwit offers as a path forward, but don't think that the digital-gold use case somehow 'needs' the low-fee, low-value payment network use case.

If wealthy people can send $10,000 around the world in 10 minutes for a couple of bucks, that's plenty functional enough for their needs.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Regarding large personal loans,"So my wife and I bring in ~$70k a year, (combined income) and we are currently stable career wise, (wife looking at a ~$3k/yr raise in the next 6mos). We are ~$28k in debt from various reasons.. The majority being the purchase of a new house and renovation projects and such. We are not in any sort of major financial trouble currently, (actually, we have no EFund and it bothers me) but I have a question about an idea we've been discussing.

We currently have a very strict budget and are projected to be paid off in roughly twenty (20) months at our current rate, (not including her pending raise or any potential promotions on my end, etc).

We are paying on various debt at various interest rates, the highest of which is at 22% I think, (not a default or late payment - just a bad choice) to give an example. We've recently been entertaining the idea of taking out a personal loan for the amount of the debt (Exact) and paying all our accounts. Of course, we would then just pay on the loan amount monthly.

Ive looked at a couple loans and an example would be looking at 17.83% for 36 months(~$1083/mo) as the best of the examples Ive seen and 32% for 36 months (somehow close @ $1160/mo) of the worst.

This *should* save us money compared to the situation we are in currently. We wouldn't be closing any of the accounts, (just paying them to 0). As well, we would be paying off two accounts that are specifically on ""special financing"" whereby paying them off sooner would be dramatically better financially. Also, it would simplify the monthly payment scheme for my wife and I, (although I suppose it's a poor reason to hedge this on but still) and allow us to start our EFund... Ideally with the money we will be saving right off the top AS WELL AS interest as we move forward.

personalfinance,How does a balance transfer affect my credit?,First post but I can't seem to find a direct answer anywhere. I know it's smart because it will lower my interest rate and there are a couple other perks with this promotion too but will a balance transfer hurt my credit rating?

personalfinance,28 and ready to get rid of my student loans. Which to pay off first?,"First, yes I've read other posts like this, but they usually deal with 1-3 loans. I've got 7.

I've gamified saving money (thanks to this sub) on a 5mo job I've been working, putting money aside for some big attacks to my student loans. My guess is to pay off loans with the highest interest rates first, then allocate what I was paying for those into the subsidized loans. If that's the case and if my tax return looks bueno, I could have all my unsubsidized loans payed off by the end of this job.

Checking with this sub to make sure I'm not crazy in my assumptions.

**I have 4 subsidized loans:**

* 1) $3,525.76	6.550%
* 2) $4,430.92	5.750%
* 3) $5,300.06	5.350%

personalfinance,Mortgage options advice,"I won't get into the long story of my awful mortgage company (avoid HSBC at all costs is all I will say), but due to their incompetence, I'm going to refinance my mortgage to get away from them. I have a few options, and wanted to solicit any advice on which is best. Pretty sure these are all 30 year loans.

FHA
Fixed rate 1st 3 years, 1.75%-2.875%, 1.75% = $785, tax/insurance $361, mortgage insurance $150, total payment $1296.

Fixed rate 1st 5 years, 2.99%-3.625%, 2.99% = $925, 361, 150, $1436.

30 year fixed, 3.25-4.25%, 3.25% = 960, 361, 150, $1470.

Conventional
Waive PMI, 4.5%, $1114, total payment of $1475.

Interest rate is going to vary based on the appraisal and how much I have to pay for closing. I guess my main question is how good or bad is mortgage insurance? I'm leaning towards one of the variable/ARM rates, because I'm not planning on being in the house longer than 5 years (current girlfriend and I are planning to move in together in 2-3 years), but I've pretty much always done conventional rate loans without PMI.

personalfinance,Can you assess and give advice as to my current financial situation. Trying to be debt free as soon as possible so I that can start saving for retirement!,"Long time lurker and first time poster. My real question is, ""Am I doing this right?"" I have been trying to get out of debt for the better part of the last 12 months. I read Dave Ramsey's book TMM maybe 6 years ago and it was very eye opening but I did not put the practices to use because I was making squat then, as I am now but want start a plan so that I don't continue in this debt spiral. 
SO here's my current situation. I have my $1,000 emergency fund set up in my local credit union savings account at .095 interest so that was a relief and my biggest goal to get started. I am 32 years old with a Bachelors degree in Communication studies and working a call center job at $12 an hour as a 1099 independent contractor. So my annual gross income from my full time employment is roughly 25k-27k with small commissions paid out that I really don't count on. In addition to my full time employment, I also work various side jobs and recently started a business of my own. These side jobs equate to roughly another 10k per year netting me around 35k-36k per year. I also recently was blessed to move into a situation where I don't have to pay rent for the next 4 or so months and my current debt profile is as follows:

* Navient $39,632 5.625% (Just recently started Income based repayment plan)

* Chase Freedom Total balance $4,143 ($681.41 cash advance being charged at 25.49%) ($3,461 purchases being charged at 23.49%)

* Chase Slate $470 Into no interest offer expires 01/16/18 and then 23.49%
* Best Buy 430.88 No interest offer until 06/14/17 and unsure of interest rate as I was unable to pull up my statement
* Chase Amazon Prime $120.70 (Just got this card recently for my business and pay it in full every month.) 23.49%
* Discover IT $142.13 at 23.49% (Also pay this card in full every month, and just this morning found a balance transfer offer at 4.99% with $0 transfer fee that I used to transfer $3,000 from my Chase Freedom card, so that was a huge help)

My Fico score currently sits at 720 (Huge jump from the 485 it used to be 6 years ago) and my expenses are as follows:

*Rent: $0 (Just released from a lease in which i was paying $1200 a month for the last year and a half)

*Utilities $25 a month 

*Phone: $103 per month 

*Gas: $80 per month 

*Navient: $119.00 per month

 *Food: $250 (very light and smart eater)

 *Entertainment: $200

My ultimate question is what is the best way to tackle this debt? I got paid today and plan on paying $681 towards my Chase Freedom and end the interest of the cash advance potion of my debt. And then aggressively tackle any debt that's not in the interest free promo period. Am I on the right track here? And should I immediately look to fund a Roth IRA once I'm debt free?

personalfinance,Youngsters of PF (17-22 mostly)! Stop the madness! Don't finance a car!,"Hello friends.

::DISCLAIMER:: I'm only 25, so I'm really not too far removed from this group that I'm yelling at, and I would have said all of this with equal vigor as a 20 year old.

There are always a ton of posts in here by people asking for help affording a thing that they can't afford, but it has seemed especially prevalent the past week, and specifically with young posters. I wanted to throw out a little PSA.
PLEASE DON'T FINANCE A CAR. PLEASE. I know you think you have to, but you DON'T. Your interest rate is going to be shit, and your insurance premium is going to be extra shit, and you don't need to kick off your adulthood with a gross debt over a depreciating asset!

The alternative is simple, and this is how I know. When I was 18, I financed a $6k car for 29.9% interest. I was the fool of fools, and literally no one told me it was insanity, wtf did I know. Fortunately for me, that car was totaled 8 months later, and paid off, and I had learned enough to know that I didn't want to cough up a shit ton of my income towards interest and insurance anymore.

I bought a 1992 Toyota Paseo with 220k miles for $800. It was aqua blue, and an absolute wreck. The clutch was shot, so I found one of those on craigslist too, and got it installed for $500 all-in, which I saved up for by limping the car around for a few months. 6 months later I posted the car up for $1400 without being in a rush to sell it, and found a buyer after a month for $1300 and sold it.

I bought a 1987 Alfa Romeo with 130k miles with that $1300. It was AWESOME. Seriously, I was obsessed with that car. It had some weird air intake issue in the cold, and I found a guy to fix it for $400, which I again saved up for by limping the car around as-is for 2 months.

After about 10 months, I sold that car for $1700, and had some other cash to throw in on a 1995 Mitsubishi Diamante with 90k miles for $2100. It was awesome. Looked nice, drove so smooth. Owned it for 2 years, got a better job. It needed a starter and alternator in this time period, about $500 total. I bought a 2007 Kia Rio5 hatchback for $5k after that, drove that for 2 years, and bought a 2013 Chevy Traverse with 50k miles for 20k and a 2013 Chevy Cruz with 40k miles for 9k, both cash, 2 months ago. (I got a good job.)

Used cars don't depreciate like newer cars. People down in that price range want them to go. Financing a depreciating asset is the worst thing that you can do with your money, especially when your young credit qualifies for crappy interest and your under 25 driving record qualifies for expensive insurance. With a cheap ass car, you can get liability-only insurance, which is usually less than half what full coverage costs (which you have to get when you finance).

BE SMART. You're here on PF, your mind is in the right place. Be. Smart.

Edit/Addition: I want to add one note. The problem with financing any depreciating asset is that you can't get on top. When you finance a new car, not only are you paying majority interest at the beginning of the loan, but the car's value is TANKING. Because of this, if you lose your income somehow, or have another financial emergency, it is impossible to get out from under it. This makes it a huge risk.

Another Edit: This is a truly interesting experience. Can PF really not even agree on this basic money-management advice? I'm not one of those ""all debt is evil"" guys, debt can be great if it increases your cash flow or net worth, but a financed care NEVER DOES. Maybe some rich people will get in here and back me up on this. It's simple, guys. This is a poor use of money.

The ONLY argument I could hear is if someone got a CRAZY low interest rate, and used the cash they would have spent to invest and out-perform their interest rate. But come on. When kids are financing cars, that's not what's happening.

Final Edit: Okay. I understand that a lot of people finance vehicles under decent terms (certainly better terms than mine), and didn't break their banks. I, again, understand that a large chunk of cash CAN be better applied elsewhere by a savvy investor, but will restate that this isn't generally what happens with someone in this category.

I'll make just one more point. A person in this age group is experiencing wild rapid life change constantly. They generally don't know what they're going to do long term, where they'll live, what they'll make, etc. Any financial liability therefore has an increased risk. Even if they financed at 0%, if they have a $300/mo car payment for 7 years on a car that they're thousands upside-down on, their options are limited and their risk of defaulting is high. Sometimes it works out, and clearly it worked out for a lot of people here, but that doesn't make it the best decision. Wait to make long-term financial commitments until you know what you're life is going to look like long-term.

There were some factors I didn't think about, and I appreciate this discussion, but I'm sticking to my guns on this one. Debt + depreciating asset = wasted money, as are unnecessarily high insurance premiums.",finance
Banking,[QUESTION]How long can a bank withhold access to accounts?,"Sorry it's a long post. 

On the 16th of February someone gained access to my checking account changed my password and debit card pin. That same night they transferred in $1280 from an unknown source (someone else’s fraud account) in LA and withdrew $600 from an ATM in Atlanta, GA. On Fri the 17th I called my bank (Navy Federal) notified them those were both fraudulent actions and I still had possession of my debit card. They were helpful and completed the normal fraud procedures by sending me a new debit card and opening a new checking account and told me that an investigation will begin. On the 21st I went online to see my account status and it prevented me from logging on so I called them back. They said since it involved multiple accounts it was procedure to place the old and new checking and savings accounts into a credits only status and that I would have to wait ten business days from the day the unknown person filed their fraud claim (he did on the 23). I tried calling again to get some funds because I have a two month old who needs formula and I have bills coming due they said there was nothing they could do and I would have to wait ten business days from the day an investigator was assigned to my case(the 24th). My question is, how long can they keep my account and funds in a credit only status? Am I just in limbo until they finish their investigation?

I have six different student loans that I owe varying amounts on, and these loans have varying interest rates.

personalfinance,Pay off truck or contribute to Roth?,"So last year I made the mistake of purchasing a $21k truck. Luckily, I got it for a low interest rate of ""only"" 2.75%. I am now working to pay off the truck as soon as possible so that ideally I will be free of debt as soon as possible and not have to pay much interest (the interest over 4 years is only about $1200). Sadly, I don't make much, and I'm debating if I should skip contributing to my Roth this year in order to pay off the truck faster. 

I realize this might not make much sense given my low interest rate, however: in about a year's time I may be transitioning into a career with the potential to make a high salary, but the first few years would likely be rough, financially speaking, if I made it through at all. It certainly would be easier to survive if I didn't have to make any more truck payments. Thus I'm again wondering if it would be best to pay off the truck ASAP vs funding my Roth. 

I know the value of compound interest is so great that I really shouldn't skip yearly IRA contributions if I can help it. How much better would it be, finance-wise, to avoid skipping this yearly contribution? Would you recommend perhaps only contributing half the yearly max to my Roth and then use the rest of what I've saved for the truck payments?",finance

I was told I needed to file another and have them no another hard credit check. I started with a 720 by the tike they have done the checks I was down to a 695. I got a terrible interest rate in hindsight at 14%. What I don't understand is how my credit score has further declined when I have never missed a payment in fact I paid it off earlier to get out from under the loan. I was informed that by doing so I wouldn't be hurt on my credit score. I am currently sitting at a 645 and a 655. Does anyone have any idea as to why this could be happening? Do I have any standing for a rebuttal to the credit scoring companies?

investing,"With a P/E of 26 the market may be overvalued, but here's an interesting alternative perspective","http://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2017/02/13/should-stocks-be-worth-more-now-than-they-used-to-be/

**From the article:**

Allow me to give a few possible explanations for why valuations have been drifting higher for the last thirty years. I can already hear the eyeballs rolling, “oh, I guess this time is different.” Hold on, I am not suggesting that valuations and stocks can’t get cut in half. I am also not suggesting that this will continue indefinitely, I’m just trying to bring some balance to the “stocks are expensive, sell everything” crowd. Also, I will feel no shame if this post marks the top. Alright, here we go.

1. We’re using data going back to 1881. Should $1 of earnings generated by Facebook be worth as much as $1 generated by Standard Oil, or Edison General Electric?
2. America’s first billion dollar corporation was U.S. Steel. In 1902 they employed 168,000 people and had sales of $561 million or $3,340 in revenue per employee ($90,000 in today’s dollars.) Today, U.S. Steel’s revenue is $493,000 per employee, 5.5.x the amount it was in 1902.
3. Companies are so much more productive and efficient than they used to be. Of the 52 S&amp;P 500 companies that make this metric readily available, only one has sales per employee less than $90,000.Facebook is doing $2 million in revenue per employee, 22x the biggest company at the turn of the twentieth century.
4. How much would you pay for $1 of suspected earnings when accounting laws didn’t exist?
5. Reg FD, which mandates that all publicly traded companies must disclose material information to all investors at the same time, did not exist until 2000! Investors like transparency and are willing to pay a higher price for it.
6. Interest rates are extremely low. People would rather accept volatility in stocks than low returns from bonds.
7. In 1996 there were over 8,000 publicly listed companies. Today there are just 4,500. Perhaps people are putting a higher valuation on a shrinking number of public stocks.
8. The 401(K) was’t created until 1981. Millions of Americans are buying stocks every two weeks in their 401(k) and these buyers are mostly price-agnostic, driving up the demand for stocks.
9. The costs for trading have come down enormously over time. Schwab just cut their commissions to $7 per trade!
10. In 1870 just 3% of the population was above sixty-five, and 94.5% of males were working. Retirement didn’t exist. Today, 13% of the population is over 65 and 60% of them are employed. These people are living longer and need to grow their wealth. The higher demand for stocks might be pushing multiples higher.",finance
personalfinance,Medical Debt - Doctors Office Charging $250 Admin fee ever 6 months......,"Sorry, long story...  I tried to keep it short and I've removed some paragraphs as I sort of just vented...  Also, this is in Upstate NY

My wife and I went through infertility treatments, a few rounds of IUI's (cheaper, non-invasive), followed a round of IVF (EXPENSIVE) and we are now pregnant with our second child.  After insurance, we owe about $6000, this includes all preceding and follow-up visits months prior and after the IUI's/IVF.   This is pretty good considering the cost of infertility treatment, the costs of the drugs, and the insurance coverage usually offered for these things.

When I received the finally tally of everything from the IVF office, I called them to arrange payments.  I explained that for now I just wanted to pay 50 to $100 a month until the pregnancy is over, then I could re-evaluate and try to pay more.  The lady on the phone balked at my offer and then said they charge a $250 administration fee every 6 months!  That's $500 a year in fees!   I've heard people mention monthly charges of $5 or $10, but not amounts that are that sky high.  Is that even on the scale of normal?!?!?!   
  
At the moment I have about $2000 in our HSA left and I'm holding on to it as much as I can to cover things like Labcorp which won't let you do lab tests if you owe them money and my wife still needs basic tests as the pregnancy continues.  I work for a very very large company that has carried a better than average health plan.  My job gives me about $1200 a year towards my HSA and I dump about $1000 to $2000 a year into it based on how my finances are working out.  Along the way, I've worked with our OB to set up monthly payments and I plan to do the same with Labcorp.

Prior to the actual IVF procedure, we see the doctor to talk about some of the decisions involved.  I ask about the costs and he literally stops me right there and says he doesn't talk about money its between me and my insurance blah blah... to which I showed my displeasure and that he needs to get with reality because the health care system has become so fucked over the last 4 years and employer insurance, even from fortune 500 companies, has gone to high deductible only plans and it has all gone straight into the toilet.  I find it incredibly frustrating that doctors refuse to talk about costs up front... and I plan to beat them over the head with it if I try to talk to these billing people some more. Considering the out of pocket cost is $4000 for IVF and my explanation of benefits show they billed $15,000 of which it was negotiated down by almost half by the insurance company of which about $1000 is my responsibility, so they already made double than a couple walking in off the street with nothing would give them... granted that balances out the ""good"" they do by offering such a low price for out of pocket patients, I get that and it's admirable.

I wrote the preceding paragraph because the billing lady says to me, ""I have to get authorization to allow such a small payment of $50 to $100, it would take years and years to pay it off!"" To which I agree, but I need to horde cash for a bit and I explain that to which she gets it.  She says, ""I have to contact the doctors and get their approval..."" I hit the floor... OH the doctors want to talk about money now!!?!?!?!?!?!! (I didn't say that, I was polite and pleasant the whole time since this was the first call).  At this point, I seriously want to just stick them with the bill, but we have two embryo's frozen with them and I really don't want to welch on a debt with these guys.  Despite the billing people, the actual nurses and doctors (except for the IVF one that was a dick about discussing costs) are GREAT people... before this debt nightmare I loved this group and it's so upsetting and sad.

So here's the rub on the bad idea of sticking them on the bill..... everything is billed to my wife.  Her credit was destroyed in her 20's, she has 5 brothers and sisters and she did stupid things like go the cell phone store and per her name down for her siblings who then welched on their bills.   She also failed to pay things back then.  Her credit is now just finally recovering though there are still old medical bills and what not on her credit.  She has a couple of accounts she was able to get and she pays on them to help boost her credit as much as it can be.  She's a stay at home mom and prior to that she never really had a significant income.  My credit is excellent, our house, both cars are on my credit, and I have a good debt to income ratio.  With a $500 a year admin fee, I've considered telling them that I wasn't going to pay the bill at those terms and they could send it to collections if they didn't modify them (hoping they would).  There it could rot for a few years, yes it would go on my wife's credit.  The other thing is that I get legal representation things like debt, wills, trusts, basic advice on certain legal topics  as a benefit from my job. One of the services that is 100% free is debt letters/negotiation.  I've considered contacting them now or even perhaps letting it go to collections and asking the lawyer to try and negotiate a significant discount after the debts been sold off about three or for times.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.  I understand letting something go to collections is pretty much a crazy no-no idea, I almost consider it a nuclear option... but we bought our house with just my credit and no one has ever tried to come after me for her debts except for her college debt which we paid back to NY HESC as it was deducted from our Joint State tax return for two years after we got married.  In fact, we never paid the hospital our portion after the insurance for the delivery and NICU stay for our first child which was billed to just my wife.   No one has ever come after me.  The billing lady there was not helpful either.  They wouldn't auto deduct or run a card every month.  It was my responsibility to mail them a check and that they wouldn't send me any kind of regular statements.  I said, ""Really? You won't just charge my FSA (now HSA) card a set amount every month? Your computer systems can't do that?""  They said no and I never called them back and ignored their letters.  My daughter is 4, my credit has always been in the 700's and we bought our house and cars when she was 1-2 years old with no issue at interest rates of like 2-3% for the cars and 3.something for the house.  Every once in a while, I see a new sucker has bought the dept from the last suckers... I know it's a bad attitude, but they don't want to help me pay them, seems self-defeating.  It's almost like they'd rather sell the debt off quickly.

I contacted their support for this, and they confirmed that they can only do one state filing and will probably support multiple states next year.

Background: I moved to Europe after living in the US for over 15 years. I do not plan on moving back to the US, and I am currently saving to buy an apartment in France. I have 4000 USD in a money market account getting about 1% interest. There is no savings plan in France that gives that much interest without locking up your money for a while, other than the ""livret jeune"". The livret jeune is basically a regular savings account that gets better interest rates than other savings account. The catch is that you have to be under 25, and the cap for that account is about 1700 euros. I have already maxed this out. 

Given my circumstances, would it make sense to hang on to those dollars or should I convert to euros while the exchange rate is favorable?",finance
personalfinance,Question regarding tax on an investment account,"Hi All - I've been posting a few questions here and getting some great feedback, thank you all for your help. 

Here's my latest question:

I had an account with Alliance Bernstein that my parents created for my college expenses and after graduating my parents gave me access to. Last year I liquidated the account to pay for some home renovations. I am now trying to figure the tax implications of this withdrawal.

Round numbers, I withdrew about $5,000 and the paperwork from AB said something like $5,000 withdrawn, $500 in cost and Taxact calculated the Gain/Loss as $5,000 - $500 = $4,500 and the tax man now wants his cut, which works out to about $1,400 between federal and state tax per Taxact.

Two questions - on the same paperwork from AB it has another summary section that says Gains = $1,600, Losses = ($100) = Gain of $1,500.  Not sure if I should be using this to calculate the gains in Taxact but the $4,500 cell is locked as math from the $5,000 and $500 from earlier. What's that about?

Second question is, assuming the money put into the account was post-tax in the first place, should I only be paying tax on the interest? I've been filing the BA tax forms every year since I got control of the account so I'd think I've already paid tax on the interest? 

It feels like I'm paying double tax here, can anyone explain what my actual obligations are here?",finance

Is it better for your credit score to put the full $10k on one loan to pay it off, leaving a $5k loan? Or is it better to split the $10k so that you have two loans of $2-$3k remaining of the original amount of $12k per loan?",finance

To top it off, their dashboard showed that all things were warm and fuzzy for quite some time. The official word was,  that the outage is due to “high error rates with S3 in US-EAST-1,”. By ""high error rates"", they meant all hell was breaking loose somewhere. This prompted a lot of fun on the Twitters as folks weren't so happy about things being up in flames around them.

**Do You Know What Your Cyber Insurance Really Covers?**


This is just a reminder to be aware of what is and isn't covered by your cyber insurance. I highly recommend that you speak with an agent and do a review of the coverages BEFORE it hits the fan. I recently learned that while notification can be the most expensive part of a breach, it's often not covered by default in the policy. To add to that, cyber insurance is still in its infancy, so coverage is rarely standardized. Don't blame the insurance companies for this as it's a very new type of risk, it's your job to know, with their help, what you are paying for.


[Take for example the P.F. Chang's breach](http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/a-close-look-at-policy-wording-is-60827/). The $1.7 million cost of defense against customer lawsuits were covered, but the roughly $2 million in fees and fines imposed by credit card issuers to pay for notifications to cardholders, reissuance of credit cards, and other costs was not. It really pays to know what coverage you have.

personalfinance,Pay off my motorcycle,"Hi there!

So Im stuck in a bit if a toss up. Ive recently received an extension of my credit line. My motorcycle, because of its niche market value, has depreciated much faster than I anticipated. As a result, I am currently $1380 or so in the red in terms of trade in value versus owed. Here's my dilemma: Do I use some of the credit line to put the bike into positive equity and flip it for something that will retain value better over time or do I just let it be. Currently, that credit card rests with a 24% interest rate on that months spent amount. It was my first credit card and they never readdresses the interest rate. Anyways, all advice would be welcome.

Thanks in advance.

Edit: 
Thank you for the advice. Just to be clear though, my bike actually rests at about 17% interest monthly, where as the accrual of 24% would only occur once on the finite amount spent, equating to a one time interest charge in the 300 range. Would you reconsider based on these parameters?

P.S. This is my daily driver. I own no other vehicles.

Wouldn’t a personal Vanguard account be the best assuming it can have the lowest fees? I lean towards tax-deferred IRA but not that strongly, so Roth would be fine too. So what’s the point of Roth IRA in comparison to a Vanguard brokerage account?


Question:

I Need to buy a house for ~275k. 
I can handle a monthly payment of ~$1,200 (which is what I’m paying now) in P&amp;I, tax and insurance for the house. 

My thought:

Put down about 180k in a down payment for a 275k mortgage, which will allow me the target monthly payment with a 15 year loan with 3.5% interest rate. Keep $20k cash for emergency, and invest $20k towards retirement. 

I understand I should have a lot more in retirement savings at this point. I would love to lower the down payment so I could put more towards retirement, but I don’t see how else I could afford a house big enough for the kids. It may not be financially most reasonable, but I want to own and not rent because I want my kids to grow up in a place that is our own. Also, I live in an area where the housing market is booming.",finance

Should we pull the $9355 out of the stock purchase program and pay down the student loans first?

My thought was to put the $9355 out of stock to the student loans.  Get those paid off asap, then roll the $500 I've been paying on those into my car loan, making that payment $750 and paying that off, then rolling the $750 into her car loan making her car payment $1070.

I have created a budget of my spending for each month, which comes out to about $1800 (this includes rent, utilities, groceries, gas, insurance, etc, with an extra $400 included for anything unexpected that comes up).  

I already have about 4 months worth of an emergency fund saved up, so the rest of my monthly earnings ($1700) can go towards loans, 401k, etc. I have a total of $26000 in student loans, with interest rates from 3.86% to 5%, which most of the $1700 will go to. 

My company offers a 401k plan where they will match 50% of the first 8% I contribute, but only after I have been enrolled in the plan for a year. The minimum I can contribute is 1%. They also offer an HSA that I can contribute to. I plan to contribute the minimum 1% to my 401k to start, as I am assuming it wouldn't be beneficial to contribute any more until I can get the matching amount from my employer. Would it be worth it to contribute any more? Is it worth it to contribute anything to the HSA, or should I hold off on that? Is there anything else I need to take into account?

I feel like the crazy low interest rates have inflated the housing prices, but I also see what appears to be a lot of houses for sale and a lot of places for rent. It reminds me a bit of ten years or so ago before everything came down.

Now, housing in SoCal didn't drop drastically, but it did drop back in the crash. I am trying to decide whether this is a terrible time to buy or not. I know it's long-term and, ultimately, the house will become worth far more than my purchase price. I am just trying to get opinions on whether waiting for interest to go up and see if the prices come down is a good idea. Is it just a gamble? If housing prices fall 15% and the prime rate goes up 3%, in my head, I'll win. If rates ever fall again, I could always refinance.

I PCS'd 6 months ago and he stayed behind to try and live on his own. I found out that recently that he missed 3 payments and the car got repossessed and they will be auctioning the car off soon. I talked to finance on base and my legal attorney. The car is worth only about 18k but the loan that is still owed is 29K because he traded in a old truck that wasn't payed off to get the car. It seems like my only options are:

A. Somehow get a loan or the money to show up to the auction and buy the car dirt cheap and than try and sell it for some profit. (not going to happen)

B. Since the car is repo my brother in law will still need to make payments which with the new high interest rate will probably be more than what he was paying before. And it seems like he will be in a cycle of never being able to pay the car off or it taking a really long time. Im also worried about him in the future missing more payments and them coming after me who is married and has a 3 year old and no other income besides military pay (E4).

C. File bankruptcy after speaking with the military attorney. It might be in my best interest to start over and make this one of those life lessons.

Credit card ($2000, 0% APR till 8/20/17)

So obviously I am going to pay off the $2000 credit card in full before the 18.99% APR kicks in in late August, but should I feel super extra motivated to pay off the other debts early?

We have 25k in an liquid emergency fund. I have less than 20k in a Roth IRA that I am now fully funding, and plan to enroll in a 401k with small employer match this spring; spouse has no retirement but intends to start this year. 

I have federal student loans sitting around $19k at 6.12% that I've been paying minimums on for 7 years. No other debt right now.

Would love your thoughts and opinions on my financial priorities over the next 3 years:

First goal is to save 18k in cash to pay for a late model, low mileage used SUV (Chevy Equinox or similar), which should take about a year.

Background: I work from home and my partner works 30 minutes away. We share one car, an (inherited) 1998 Oldsmobile with 60k miles. We keep current on repairs, but end up paying around $1000 a year for maintenance since she's so old.

We live in a semi-walkable neighborhood (CVS, 7/11, some restaurants), but I'm getting antsy without access to a car when partner is working (10am to 8pm most weekdays, plus Saturdays). On Saturdays I drive him to and from work so I can use the car for groceries, errands and, if I'm lucky, some time with friends.

New car would be our future family car (likely to have kids within 3 to 5 years, hence why we are looking at an SUV), and we plan to keep both it and the Olds until the wheels fall off.

During this time, I would refinance my student loan (likely taking the rate from 6.12 down to 5 - 5.5). We also found an old, parent-funded state education fund we didn't know we had; after taxes and penalties, this will give us about $5000 more toward the loans right now. 

While saving for the car, I would continue paying the loan minimum. Post car purchase, I would snowball the car fund money toward the loan and knock it out in a matter of months.

From there, we would prioritize a downpayment for a house and, post house buying, focus aggressively on retirement.

Is it stupid to wait a year to really tackle the loan debt in favor of paying outright for a second car? The math tells me that I pay around $1162/yr in student loan interest (if I'm calculating correctly), but if I can refinance and pay down $5000 more in the next month, that number will go down.

The luxury of having a second car sooner would cost me somewhere around $1000 in loan interest on top of the actual cost of the car. Worth it? Not worth it?

Are we being stupid to wait so long to address retirement in a more aggressive way, given our ages?

I have about $140k in student loan debt and $6k in credit card debt.  I expect my next job to pay a fair bit better, but for now, I'm hoping to get some advice about where to put some of the money I'm making.

-My student loan debt is made up of several loans of varying interest rates between 5.3-6.8%.  I cannot consolidate them all together (total is too large).  I haven't checked to see if I can consolidate them into 2+ smaller chunks with better rates.

-My credit card APR is ~16%.

-I'm married, my wife is still in school and makes about $700/month working part time.

-MONTHLY COSTS:  Rent $1080, Utilities $180, Car Insurance $90, Misc. costs associated with owning pets $100

-I have access to a 403(b) through my employer.  I put in the obligatory minimum of 6.2%, which my employer matches.  I can optionally put in more, but my employer will not match further contributions.

My current plan is to live as frugally as possible without making myself miserable, pay as much as possible on the credit card, pay the minimum on the student loans.  Once the CC is paid off, start pumping money into the student loans.

The one big question I'd like answered is this:  lots of resources suggest that in the long term, investment in the stock market yields about 7% annually.  That's more than the student loan interest rate, so should I consider investing some of that money, rather than pushing it all toward the student loans?

**How and Why I Retired at 38 without Couponing**: A Waldenesque Account 11.5 Years in the Making


When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone with my wife, in the woods, a quarter mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built to a certain extent by myself, in the proximity of a nameless pond, in Readyville, Tennessee, and earned my living by the labor of my hands counting pills for revoltingly irresponsible and unappreciative individuals. I have lived there 5 years and 11 months. At present I aspire to be a sojourner in civilized life again.


It has been said that retirement is merely a decision to stop trading time for money. Since I no longer need more of the latter to sustain my standard of living, and since I do not enjoy and never have enjoyed the primary method at my disposal to acquire the latter, I have decided that the former is of more value to me going forward in life. I will say little about my 11.5 years of experience as a retail pharmacist, other than to confirm what I already knew from the beginning to a much lesser extent: people are stupid, ignorant, obese, hateful, difficult, obnoxious, bigoted, misinformed, irresponsible, and intellectually lazy. Instead of dwelling on that horrible industry any longer, it is my hope that the following financial information might be of some use to members of a younger generation who are planning their own future independence. Be forewarned however that early retirement might also be a financial bubble in its own right. I discovered and strived on this principle beginning in 2005, but it seems to have exploded in popularity around the time of the market rebound of 2013-2014. The philosophy of financial independence only provides practical outcomes for the potential retiree as long as there are others who will keep obliviously running on their self-imposed treadmills. Productivity must be high (Americans work themselves too death), and the cost of goods must be low (Americans exploit slave labor overseas). This would not have been possible fifty years ago, and it may very well end up impossible fifty years from now. If you believe that our parents and grandparents had an easier financial adventure to navigate than the one we currently have, you seriously need to take a step back and compare what each generation would consider a decent standard of living.


Throughout my life, there have been a variety of circumstances that have aided me in my goal to retire before the age of forty as well as a few unforeseen (and perhaps, unforeseeable) obstacles that have set me back. I will now share several instances of both, including how much each has saved or cost me (including opportunity costs of subsequent investments). I would be wise to begin with the favorable circumstances that were primed before my life even began. I was born a healthy white male in the United States during the 20th Century. Essentially, I won at life on easy mode. Few other countries and time periods would allow a set of financial rules in which a person could become so financially solvent by doing so little, and I can think of no other country in which so many people have self-imposed financial treadmills that will keep raking income for me long after I decide to step off of my own. Granted that being a white male in this country does not provide the full array of unfair advantages that it once did, I can still say with little doubt that there were countless unknown instances in which my identity made my pursuit of early financial independence much more attainable.


I was also born intelligent. It is nothing to brag about. I say it merely because it is relevant, and because it is true. I did nothing to deserve or acquire this quality. In fact, I could have very easily squandered what advantages my genetic makeup provided me. Despite having an IQ that places me in the top two percent of the population, I scarcely managed to graduate in the top fifteen percent of my high school. I satisfied only the bare minimums for a full scholarship to MTSU. I freely admit that I completely mailed it in on my education from seventh through twelfth grade. I rarely took a book home. I did not try. Video games, music, and the opposite sex were far more important to me than keeping a 4.0. I was, however, responsible enough to know what I had to do to when the time arrived. I knew when I had to cease goofing off and become a more responsible individual. The complete independence of college made me try once more. With high school behind me, my analytical mind was awoken. I started seeing many aspects of life in a different way. Most importantly, I remember the need to craft a long-term plan. In short, my current state of financial independence would be impossible if I lacked the mental capacity to obtain it.

*Bipartisan political rant redacted* At the time of writing this announcement, I have benefited from $20 Trillion in national debt that I will likely never have to pay back. I was essentially gifted my share of trillions of dollars in services at no cost. Rates of taxation are currently way too low to sustain the country’s bloated standard of living. The bill will doubtlessly be passed onto future generations. But not my future generations. I have no future generations. (Savings: $60,000). This is my fair share of the national debt.

As I previously stated, I did only what was necessary to earn a full ride to MTSU (Savings: $13,000). I was also granted a second scholarship during my sophomore year just by taking the time to complete a two-page form (Savings: $2,000). My parents also allowed me live at home while attending college (Savings: $20,000), bought me a car in high school that lasted throughout college (Savings: $20,000), bought me another car for graduating college, which I drove until it died fourteen years later (Savings: $30,000). My parents also provided me with enough money to get our initial home repairs started (Savings: $10,000) and assumed the debt of the majority of my pharmacy school education and living expenses out of a sense of parental obligation (Savings: $100,000). My parents are also financially responsible people who emerged from dirt-floor shotgun shacks in rural Tennessee before amassing a net worth of $500,000 that will one day be an inheritance for my sister and me (Savings: $250,000). I truly had not realized how much my parents helped me financially until I typed this paragraph. I also fully appreciate now why it has been said with much despondency that inheritance is the true way of earning money in America.


The story of how I ended up as a highly compensated pharmacist is not an exciting one, but it is a necessary detail of how I arrived at my current state. I think it is fair to say that I was semi-indoctrinated as a child with the notion that I was smart enough to go to college and become a physician one day. American parents in the late 20th century had an unhealthy obsession that doctors and lawyers were what all intelligent children should become. So that is the path I obliviously started pursuing, and two years into college, I was dreading where was I headed. Since I wanted out of medicine but didn’t want to waste all of my science credits, I had to choose between optometry, which required Calculus III, or pharmacy. Fortunately, the contemporaneous job market was working strongly to the advantage of my decision to avoid Calculus III. At the time I had switched my career plans, pharmacists were making $50,000 yearly and were projected to be making $75,000 by the time that I would be graduating in six more years. Due to additional unforeseen shortages, that figure ended up exploding to over $125,000 (growing to $150,000 by the time of my retirement). Upon graduating, we all had dozens of job offers due to those shortages. A six-figure job fell right into my lap. I even negotiated a rate $3.50/hr higher than their opening offer (Savings: $125,000). That pharmacy window is now closed due the eminent bubble burst from an abundance of graduates marching out of the abundance of recently opened schools.


This brings me to an important point: I did not pick the career that I wanted to pursue. Reflecting back, I would much rather have tried astronomy, cartography, paleontology, cryptography, or meteorology. I picked what the market demanded. I will leave it to the philosophers to debate if this is truly what one should do in practice, but it benefited me greatly in financial matters. Over the past 11.5 years, I merely had to show up, look semi-presentable, count pills, answer questions that could have easily been Googled, listen to left wing complaints that big pharmaceutical companies are robbing the consumers yet never hear anyone consider other avenues to resolve their health problems, and listen to right wing complaints about how Obama is trying to kill them by raising the copay of their $500 morbid-obesity-fighting Crestor prescriptions from $20 to $30. Ironic rants coming from intellectually and physically lazy individuals belonging to the party of so-called personal responsibility were as common as any other aspect of the job. But I digress.


Nothing could have been more important than my having stumbled into this single epiphany early in life: Happiness does not come from material possessions. Americans tend to buy things that they don’t need to impress people that they don’t like with money that they don’t have. I do not buy things just because I can. I have lived well below my means by saving 70-75% of every paycheck. I have made investments early in life and witnessed the miracle of compounded interest. As far as my investments choices are concerned, I went with small-cap indexed mutual funds with a low expense ratio (VSCIX). The single mistake of choosing an actively-managed fund over an indexed fund would have cost me $100,000 or more over the past 11.5 years alone. What benefit would I have received to beat the market by 1% if the person actively managing my finances was charging me 3%? For the love of all that is holy, avoid financial advisors, particularly those without legal fiduciary responsibilities to their clients! And those doomsday warnings from conservatives about how the market will soon and inevitably collapse? Nothing but sour grapes from those who missed the bullish bandwagons, opting instead for the illusory security of gold and bonds. In fact, I could have very easily reaped even bigger rewards by treading on the riskier grounds of buying individual company stocks, but Warren Buffet, I am not.


So upon graduating, I accepted the overnight position at CVS in Ohio from 2005-2010 for two reasons: it minimized interaction with the intolerable general public, and it paid 5-10% more than the dayshift (Savings: $60,000). I could scarcely let this point pass without mentioning that one-third of that additional income was entirely unearned or unwarranted. I say this because it was company policy that an overnight pharmacist be paid the bonus differential only from midnight to 8am (not from 8pm to 8am as they were doing in Ohio). I neglected to ever point out the mistake to my supervisor. I also received a $1/hr raise in 2013 for taking over as pharmacy manager for six months. The raise was intended to be temporary, but someone forgot to take it away once I reverted back to my regular staff position. I neglected to draw attention to this little tidbit as well (Savings: $10,000).


No purchase regularly has a larger financial impact than a primary dwelling, and I say with much pride that our first home was a very simple one. There is much debate among investing communities whether a house should be considered an investment or an expense, but I tend to agree with the latter camp. I cannot claim that I have a Waldenesque receipt of every expense that went into the process, but I bought what we needed. I did not buy what we could afford. Lenders will tirelessly provide calculations of how much house a person can afford; how much house a person actually needs does not make its way into the equation. These quotes are based on mortgages that financially enslave a person to the bank for 15-30 years. Typically, this means working until very late in life, especially if homeowners elect for refinancing at some point down the road. The purchase price for our house in 2005 was $120,000, but I also invested $40,000 in rehabilitation to bring the total cost to $160,000. Bear in mind that I made this sensible purchase during a troublesome era in which financial institutions were carelessly pawning off McMansions onto people scarcely earning minimum wages. Such individuals who would have acquired a house priced similarly to ours via the 30-year mortgage plan would have ended up paying in excess of $400,000 for that house, including $250,000 in interest alone. I paid ours off in less than three years, including about $10,000 in interest.


Our next house was even more sensible than the first. I exercised great patience and found a 28-acre tract currently worth $150,000 for only $85,000 (Savings: $65,000). I also contracted the house myself with the help of my father. Members of the family did what we could to keep costs down (design, permits, clearing, site prep, outdoor utilities, roofing, flooring, trim, cabinetry installation, painting, and cleanup). Subcontractors were hired for the balance. A well-insulated, energy efficient $200,000 house ended up costing only $120,000. It should be of note that the final cost was artificially low due in part to cheaper labor from the contemporaneous weak construction market of 2010-2011 (Savings: $80,000). The most important savings on the house came from the purchase of the Japanese roofing tiles. A domestic company acting as a middleman quoted me $30,000 as the cost to import the roofing material. For some inexplicable reason, they opted to include the Japanese business card of their supplier in the information packet that they sent. Taking just two minutes of my time, I emailed the contact myself and asked if I could purchase from them directly. The price she quoted me was $15,000 (Savings: $15,000). It never hurts to try.


We decided to build our home in the income-tax-free State of Tennessee. Conservatives here are too dense to appreciate that a shift from consumption-based taxes to income-based taxes would benefit the overwhelming majority of them immensely. I profit from their stupidity (Savings: $50,000). On a related note, knowing the tax code makes an enormous financial difference. Among other shady decisions in the legal gray area, I have turned hobbies into small businesses, taken vacations in the interests of running those businesses, and even claimed a single $7,000 reforestation credit for simply improving and planting on my property (Savings: $20,000). In the 1% chance that I get audited, I can reasonably defend every deduction I have ever made because the tax code is needlessly complicated and nuanced. In essence, it is designed to benefit only the rich and knowledgeable. “I don’t understand all of that tax stuff” is not a good reason for any taxpayer to remain ignorant about it. One can spend a single weekend learning the system like I did and easily save $20,000 over the course of a lifetime. I know most people have wasted far more time than that by binge watching something irrelevant on television. I will leave it for the reader to compare the potential savings versus the time spent. My advice is to relocate as much of your spending to the before-tax column as is legally permissible. I should also say that relying solely on those tax preparation programs to maximize your savings is not a wise move. They do not teach a person how to think critically. Such a quality is not innate; it must be learned and practiced.


Timing has played an indispensable role as well, but it has been far from perfect. I consolidated my federal student loans for my parents in 2005 at a ridiculously low interest rate (2.3%). Interest rates on student loans are currently north of 6% (Savings: $125,000). The financial crashes of 2008 and 2011 happened when I had little invested in the markets, but I kept investing and soaking up index funds at artificially deflated prices. Then came the inevitable rebound of 2013-2014, thanks largely to partisan politics and the Republican gift of corporate corruption that allowed no real regulations against Wall Street in the wake of the recent financial crisis. I was also fortunate that I was born heterosexual. Why? For the first eight years of my marriage (2007-2015), I would have paid 5% more in income taxes if I felt biologically compelled to share my life with someone who had matching genitals (Savings: $50,000). Somehow that would not have seemed fair. And while I am on the subject of marriage, allow me to proudly declare that I married a great woman who is neither shallow nor materialistic. Two months salary on a diamond ring? Not trying to impress anyone. She much preferred an antique birthstone that defies conventional customs and looks way more spectacular (Savings: $20,000). $15,000 Wedding? No inadequacies in need of compensation. Got married, honeymooned in Vegas, and loved it (Savings: $14,000). Will I ever buy a fancy $10,000 box to bury someone in the ground? I am not an idiot, nor do I want anyone in my family to be buried in an idiot box. Life is not a competition to acquire status symbols. Break out of this mentality of doing things that you think you are supposed to do! The primary reason a person cannot retire early is because that person spends far too much. The open secret to creating wealth is to spend less, be content with less, and worry less about financial matters that you cannot control. Adapting is easy; complaining wears you down. But if you remain determined to compete with your coworkers, go ahead and do so while I apoplectically rue the times when I had some.


I lead a simple life and maintain no expensive hobbies. A lot of men in this region look forward to the point in their lives where they can become overweight so that they look proper while fishing in a $20,000 boat. More power to them. Each person has a right to carry his existence how he chooses, but the worst I have ever done with my hobbies is to drop $2,000 on a bicycle that loses barely 5% of its value on an annual basis. But even this decision was much later in my career, and the hobby has the benefit of helping me keep healthy. Staying healthy also keeps doctor bills lower and/or nonexistent. There are no outrageously expensive professionals to allow me access to outrageously priced prescriptions to control my health. There is no need to purchase material things to compensate for the depression of not being healthy and feeling good about oneself. Even being able to keep the thermostat higher in the summer is a benefit. One can easily add more clothes in the winter, but one cannot easily remove insulating adipose in more temperate conditions.


Every purchase I make is on credit card, which earns 1-5% in amazon credit (Savings: $20,000). I then purchase the things that I need on amazon via my own 5% off click-thru links (Savings: $5,000). The savings were even greater before amazon started collecting sales tax. I may have neglected to report all of those purchases in years prior, just as all of the readers may have made similar mistakes. We dropped the worthless cable television subscription in 2013 (Savings: $5,000). We dropped our cell phone plans in 2006 (Savings: $15,000). We dropped the services of the home telephone company and purchased a $200 ooma in 2008 (Savings: $6,000). We maintain smaller wardrobes. We rarely purchase alcohol. We never buy tobacco or other drugs. We make smaller charitable contributions in life and are smart enough not to belong to a religion that often suggests you consistently contribute to their maintenance. Tithing would have yielded a potential loss of $250,000, and I am enlightened enough to know that religion does more harm than good to humanity. Instead, we will be leaving everything to worthy charities when it is our time. While there is no real sacrifice or benevolence on our part, I doubt that it will make any difference to the people who will be receiving it. And then there are the smaller things in life: stretching oil changes to 7500 miles, avoiding a daily coffee habit, rarely paying $1-$2 for bottled water and sodas, leaning toward the dollar menus at fast food restaurants, reflecting before purchasing, making good use of the library, etc. It all adds up.


Perhaps the greatest savings arrives from fighting the indoctrinated societal pressures of having children. Let’s be honest: everyone loves their children but very few people are truly happier by having them. I need not argue my point. Studies show support for my position. I would go so far as to suggest that people simply have them out of ritual or expectation, only to wish later that they had waited until further down the road, had fewer children, or had never reproduced at all. Of course no one is going to wish his children away once they have become attached to them, but it is my position that most people would be happier without an enormous responsibility that they have never known. No one seems to appreciate the true opportunity cost of children: $250,000 each not including college. I will be just fine with our dog.


With all of these benefits, you might be wondering what circumstances did not work in my favor. To start, I will have to return oddly to the summer of 1992 when my father was religiously engaged in raising cattle for show competitions. In an attempt to engage me in his interests, I was given one of his prized heifers in exchange for grooming and showing her at county fairs. She sold several months later for $1,700, which was an abundance of wealth for an eighth grader to come into. I was very much into collecting comic books at that point and tried to convince my dad to co-invest with me in a copy of Actions Comics #1 in Good condition for $4,000. (For you non-collectors, Good condition is an evaluation to conclude that a book is sufficiently damaged enough to be worth only 10% of its Mint condition price). My father wasn’t going for my idea. Today, that book would be worth around $250,000. I should have tried harder. Deliberate understatement.


I also failed to gain admission into the pharmacy school at UT Memphis. At the time, it was the only program in the State; now there are six (part of that pharmacy school bubble that I mentioned earlier). So why did I fail to gain admission? First, I did not focus on the interview as much as I should have because I had already been granted acceptance to the school that I ideally preferred (but which was way more expensive due to being privately funded). I did not hit a home-run like I did with the first interview, but I am certain that I performed well enough to be offered a position. Second, I feel that I was passed over for being a white male. UT Memphis made it a point to advertise that they had the largest female and minority body of any pharmacy school in the country. I do not point this out to cry discrimination or to argue points against diversification. I do not even wish to dispute its fairness. I have already stated that my gender and race have served me in ways I cannot begin to appreciate, but after learning of the qualifications with which some of my classmates were accepted, I can safely say that this was one instance in which who I am did not serve me well (Cost: $40,000). I should have tried harder. Deliberate understatement.


While I am on the topic of education, allow me strongly emphasize that private schools are no better than public schools merely because they are privately funded. Most people do not realize that the cost difference is purely the amount of the bill that the taxpayers carry; it is not due to the quality of education. Private schools might seem like better atmospheres to certain types of people, but I strongly urge the reader to not be a fool. Attend public university.


If I were to define insurance, I would say that it is a form of quasi-voluntary socialism in which the healthy give to the unhealthy, the responsible give to the irresponsible, the careful give to the careless, and the lucky give to the unlucky. My employer has spent $70,000 on my medical policy over the past 11.5 years. I have personally spent $30,000 on my part of that policy. I have used no more than $5,000 (Cost: $25,000; or $95,000 if CVS had just given the money directly to me instead). It is simply not fair that I do what I can to stay healthy and save money, only to have the vast majority of my premiums given to people who do not take care of themselves physically and mentally. Yet I must recognize my inability to do anything constructive about it. I must maintain a policy to protect against disaster, especially with the ACA now mandating it. Without a medical insurance policy, I could easily be hit by a bus and get wiped out financially (and perhaps literally) in the blink of an eye. Or I could get cancer. Or I could lose an arm. I even purchased life insurance, as well as accidental death and dismemberment insurance, because my duty to protect the narcotic supply was not without its hazards (Cost: $10,000). I also carried homeowners insurance and full vehicle coverage for far too long (Cost: $10,000). This is a game we all play, and we tend to play it with a surplus of caution. But I must be mindful that in a parallel universe, I could have very easily lost everything. This brings me to the worst insurance policy that I bought, which I call Ted Cruz insurance. It appeared to me that his influence was going to drive the country to default on its loans and crash the financial markets in 2014. I moved my money into safer investments for a short period and missed out on a small portion of the surging market (Cost: $25,000). Cruz either blinked, or he is not as stupid as his political positions indicate. Lessons learned. Do not try to time the market.


I paid off our mortgage way too early. This looked like a smart move in 2008 when the financial markets were crashing and burning around us, but that perspective was based on a short term view. The $120,000 loan offered at 5% annual interest now seems reasonable compared to the 10% annual interest that the market has earned since 2005. The smart move would have been to carry the loan and invest my extra finances in the market (Cost: $100,000). Lesson learned, but I could have just as easily been wrong. We also bought our first house at the height of the housing bubble. I watched enough house flipping shows on television to know something suspicious was upon us, but the timing of my graduation ensured that I could do nothing about it. We only received $125,000 back out of the house in which we had invested $160,000, but these losses were carried back over into gains by building during the weak construction market that I mentioned earlier. However, my hatred of humanity also drove me to acquire more land than was necessary for our second house. Twenty-eight acres of privacy in this area cost $85,000. We are almost ten minutes from civilization. Granted that this real estate purchase could be considered an investment, and quite an intelligent one as I mentioned earlier, but we do not plan on ever selling the property. Improper exterior construction planning on my part also led to more backfill, fencing, replanting, and yard maintenance (Cost: $10,000). I do not wish to delve further into that. There is also the matter of additional fuel costs from being so far removed from civilization, and I drove a very fuel-unfriendly car for fourteen years that I chose when I was only twenty-three and not thinking of such matters (Cost: $5,000). But as it was, we spent too much time in the high income-tax State of Ohio and paid greatly for the decision (Cost: $30,000). Relocating back to Tennessee was the smart move financially.


I should have accepted more of the overtime offered to me when I was much younger and the job was much easier. The earnings from each shift would have been worth double what each shift would be worth now if the money were properly invested. I should have accepted the $2/hr raise offer to make the move to dayshift six months earlier than when I did, at which point the offer had passed (Cost: $30,000). I also held too much emergency savings in municipal bonds from 2012-2016. Municipal bonds are terrific at avoiding federal taxes, but there were many better investments to be made in a surging market. Put simply, I was not sure how much longer I would be able to survive my job when it started becoming very difficult from 2011-2013. I felt that I had to keep a certain amount of liquidity, and I let those investments sit around for far too long. Such a decision is easy to second-guess but difficult on which to place a cost. Social security will likely be only 75% solvent when I elect to receive it, but the lost earning potential from the tax-free loan that I have paid into the system will end up being the far greater blow (Cost: $100,000). If only people were responsible enough to save on their own instead of the government doing it for them.


There were also the two big vacations that we took to Japan and Europe (Cost: $10,000). We waited until later in my career to visit these wonderful places, a decision which helped prevent greater opportunity costs, but I would have held no regrets either way. They were worth every dime. Eating out at casual dining restaurants is a killer for me. It is my weakness. I love food. We do not often dine at expensive places, but paying $25-$30 three or four times per week certainly adds up (Cost: $100,000). I also tip 22% on average because I find it distasteful and highly unethical to be frugal at the cost of others.


While I can never be entirely certain of future outcomes, conservative retirement models based on historical market performance suggest that a 38-year-old individual with an asset allocation of 80% in equities and 20% in bonds should be able to earn an average annual return of 6% after-inflation and safely execute an annual withdrawal of 3% from said portfolio with far less than a 1% chance of market volatility causing him to go broke before dying. In terms of real numbers, I will begin my first year of retirement with $1.001M, should on average earn $60,000 in interest, withdraw on average $30,000 in living costs (with subsequent increases for inflation), and end my first year of retirement on average with $1.031M. Simulations suggest that the average principle balance should be around $10M after sixty years if spending an inflation-adjusted $30,000 per year. If one analyzes the simulations from the perspective of maximizing spending, a withdrawal of $34,000/yr would still have failed to deplete the portfolio over any sixty-year span.


The seemingly large discrepancy between the 6% return and 3% withdrawal is not to ensure a growing principle, but rather it is an implemented failsafe that has been designed to offset the costly effects of potential downturns in the volatile market during the critical early phases of retirement (known as sequence risk), as well as the known hidden costs of inflation. In the overwhelming majority of scenarios, however, the principle amount remains untouched and does indeed grow exponentially. The ultraconservative model I have followed also makes a few catastrophic assumptions: no social security income, no supplemental income, no inheritances, no national healthcare plan, no disability payments, no spending adjustments for recessions, no spending reallocation for hyperinflating sectors, no observance of the known reduction in spending with age, no liquidation of our excess land, and no ability to downsize or tap into home equity. The only risky assumption I have provided the model is that the ACA subsidies (or some form of them), which I will cover shortly, remain intact until Medicare eligibility. In other words, the likelihood of me ever having to earn another dime for as long as I live is still substantially lower than the likelihood of an event catastrophic enough to reshape the global financial culture beyond the point of recognition.


Pre-retirement annual expenses for my wife and I were $38,000 and can be broken down in the following manner: Food $10,000 (Grocery $5,000 / Dining $5,000), Medical $4,000 (Insurance $3,000 / Costs $1,000), Transportation $5,000 (Vehicles $2,000 / Gasoline $2,000 / Insurance $1,000), House $5,000 (Utilities $1,000 / Internet $1,000 / Taxes $1,000 / Insurance $1,000 / Maintenance $1,000), Other $14,000 (Supplies $4,000 / Vacations $3,000 / Entertainment $3,000 / Miscellaneous $4,000). I have assumed the following cost adjustments to our expenses going forward: an increase of $1,000 to fight the inevitable fits of boredom with more complex entertainment, a decrease of $2,000 for having more time to prepare food at home, a decrease of $2,000 for lower fuel consumption, a decrease of $1,000 from dropping the homeowners insurance policy, a decrease of $1,000 to due to increased flexibility in scheduling vacations, and a decrease of $3,000 due to gaming a quasi-loophole in Affordable Care Act tax credit policy. Allow me to elaborate on that last point.


Citizens with incomes below the Federal Poverty Level are ineligible for these Federal credits because these individuals are supposed to be covered under State (not Federal) Medicaid programs. However, State Medicaid programs disqualify people who have a high net worth through means testing. An individual claiming an income just above the Federal Poverty Line, whether the income is real or not (e.g. Roth conversions), qualifies for ACA credits because the determination process for ACA credits does not take net worth into consideration. ACA credits for individuals just above the Federal Poverty Line pay for the monthly premiums in their entirety, or about $6,000 per year. Furthermore, there is no increase in income taxation for claiming an annual income of $16,000 because the income on which this credit qualification is based is calculated prior to deductions and exemptions that would convert a Gross Income of $16,000 into a Taxable Income of $0. In other words, an individual with an annual income of $0 has the same tax burden as an individual with an annual income of $16,000 (due to standard deductions and exemptions), but a high net worth individual with an income of $16,000 qualifies for a $6,000 tax credit while a high net worth individual with an income of $0 qualifies for nothing. Due in large part to the questionable structure of the process for determining ACA subsidies (and tax policies in general), our annual expenses post-retirement will decrease from $38,000 to $30,000 (adjusted annually for inflation). I have even budgeted conservatively and expect our living expenses to be closer to $27,000 for the first year. This gives us a higher standard of living than 99% of human beings who have ever existed. Let it be known that any similar couple who cannot live on $30,000 per year has serious emotional issues in need of resolution. I must also say that I do not feel the least bit guilty for taking free healthcare coverage. I have paid far more into the system than I will ever get out, and I actually take care of myself unlike the majority of Americans.


So what am I going to do with myself going forward? Instead of waking up and going to a job every day that I loathe, I will spend time doing things that will better serve myself and humanity as a whole: cycling, running, swimming, exercising, weightlifting, bowling, golfing, kayaking, collecting things, socializing, visiting my parents, spending more time with my own family, mentoring students, volunteering, deconverting religious adherents, learning Rubik’s cube algorithms, writing, painting, warning anyone who will listen about the danger of pain clinics, reading, studying, listening to music, watching movies and television, playing video games, housekeeping, organizing, cooking, picking up litter, looking at the stars, metal detecting, going to yard sales, improving my Spanish and Japanese, monitoring investments, building a treehouse and a cabin, traveling, retreating into nature, sleeping, and relaxing. I might even try my hand at opening a business, writing a novel, making a movie, or recording an album. I can finally do whatever I want, whenever I want, wherever I want. Life is an opportunity to navigate existence in the most meaningful way possible. In the end, I may not have chosen the safest and smartest path at each fork in the road, but I fully intend on being content with the decisions I have made. I will also come to appreciate fully that financial stability is not the sole measure of my worth.",finance
personalfinance,Which Credit Card is best to use (for the situation laid out in the comment)?,"For normal everyday spending (mostly food and groceries) I have the following two credit cards I'm a little torn on which to use more:-

 

A) Credit Union credit card gives the following cashback bonuses:-
3% Groceries/Convenience Store
2% Gas
1% Other

 

B) Citibank Double Cash Credit Card which gives effective 2% cashback on everything

 

On the surface it seems clear to use the Credit Union card for groceries (which currently total about 300 per month), while using the Citibank card for regular food purchases at restaurants etc. My total food expenditure (including groceries) per month is about 1000, which means approx 700 non-groceries food expenditure.

 

What complicates the picture for me is I have my Emergency Fund (approx 10k) in the credit union that gives the following interest rates:-

 

3.09% APY - with 12 nos. of credit union debit card transactions in a month

Got a call from former employer today, oopsie, they fucked up. Paid me at twice the hourly rate for the final check.

I don't mind paying them back, but now that I've looked at my pay statement more carefully, I was taxed at a huge rate for the overpayment - federal, state, Medicare, ect. So the overpayment did not look as large as it was because of the large with holdings on the overpayment.

Finally, I used the figures on the pay stub to file for unemployment, so now those are wrong.

What are my rights here? In order to do this properly, they should reverse the whole transaction and re-enter it correctly. But, they may just ask for a check for the overpayment.

This is what I suspect most of his taxes will look like for the years of 2011-15 as well. I'm sure he's going to be hit with penalties. Last night when I made him call the IRS they told him that his 2010 returns were ""sub of return"" and that he needed to file those first whenever he got his transcripts in the mail. Despite my best efforts, I have not been able to get his information (or mine for that matter) off of the IRS's website. So, we're having to wait for them to be mailed, 5 to 10 days. I feel like I'm about to have a stroke at any second. My blood pressure is insanely high. I'm stressed out. With making nearly $100k last year you'd think that we'd have plenty of money in our bank account. Nope. I'm so terrified I went this morning and pulled what we had out so that it wouldn't be seized. (Don't they attempt to notify you or warn you?) Regardless, I took out our rent money $1025 and the rest except $300. So in all I took out $2325. I wasn't finished paying bills so I at least wanted to have money to pay the bills. We don't own anything except a 2004 truck. Everything else is being paid on. It's not that I have a problem paying back the IRS, but we at least need some  payments. I'm most worried they're about to seize his paychecks or garnish his wages to the point that we will be homeless because we cannot afford our rent, or to the point that I'll lose my car because we can't pay for it (which I need to get to the dr's office). Some of my doctors are an hour or two away, and I don't have a choice as to whether I use them or not because they're specialists.

Yes, I am angry with my boyfriend, but not mad at him. He's not a bad person, he just sucks when it coming to handle things outside of work. Anyway, I have been with him since 2011. I was a FT student up until I graduated last year (Aug 2016). I do have student loans but they're being put on hold at the moment because I can't work. Trust me, I'm dying to, but can't. I have some very, very serious health problems that are keeping me from doing so. My point in saying that is that I'm sure he can claim me for those years...*but*...isn't there always a but? He's legally married. He's not seen or talked to his ""wife"" since 6 months after they were married. She ran off with some guy in 2001 and he's not seen her since. Yes, he should've filed for divorce, but like I said, he doesn't think about things sometimes. 

-

So, *now* you know what kind of situation we are in. What do we do? Are we going to go to jail? Are we going to lose everything we have? What is going to happen? I'm trying to get these papers, file taxes asap, but even when I do get the papers, one lady told me ""We will have to file some of those in the off season."" Wth does that mean????? Won't that put us in an even worse position if we wait? We're going to have to pay $2k-5k according to one guy to have them done. If he finds that he owes in 2011-13, for example, but doesn't in 14-16, will that offset what he owes? I suppose I take some responsibility as well for his not filing taxes until now. I should've stayed on his ass about it. But I can't fix the past. Basically I just need to know what to do first and if they're going to take what little we have. Between crying and heart paliptations I swear my already poor body just can't take much more.

personalfinance,Help with student loans in default,"So I've lurked here and always see sound advice so hoping to get some help. My student loans are currently in default. The total amount owed of the loan is 23k. I tried to go the rehabilitation route through the fed loan people but after 5 months they took 1 payment of $400 and never got back to me in order to set it up. I recently called, about the 10th call, and was informed my loan was given to a debt collector now for collection. I got in touch with them and the only options I was given was to pay in full now, set up a payment plan which will be near $400/month for 15 years!!!! ($60,000 for the $23k debt) or rehab through them which they take my spouses income into account and will be a monthly payment over $1500/month with 25% going to ""fees"". Upon ending the call with them they did mention that I could call back with an offer and they may be able to get fees down. I'm thinking now to get them as low as I can and just take out a personal loan for that amount and pay it off in 3 years. Currently I make between $75-100k and my spouse $135k. I plan on calling the fed loan department about consolidation tomorrow to see of that's an option. I want to eliminate this debt asap but obviously don't want to pay double the amount over 15 years or $1500 with a qrt going to fees.

personalfinance,Texas - How to surrender stock?,"Good evening everyone,

TLDR: Relative invested large sum of money in a company that is going nowhere, how does he/she go about legally/officially surrendering the stock to take the $3,000 capital loss every year until it runs out? It's a private company in Texas.

Sadly 9 years ago one of my relatives invested a very large sum of money in a terribly crappy company. They used religious affiliation, targeted elderly's &amp; their retirements, and pressure tactics to get a handful of people to invest.

I contacted the SEC, FBI, and other federal governments. The SEC told me they've received numerous reports but do not have enough proof to do anything at this time despite him selling stock to non-accredited investors.

Long story short I'm certain it's a scam as the CEO has no experience in technology and just got the company kicked out of it's corporate office for failure to pay rent. They've also been sued numerous times for failure to pay. I've convinced my relative to surrender the stock as the money is lost already. This way my relative can at least take the $3,000 deduction each year.

My issue is that as much as I search I cannot find any information regarding HOW to actually surrender stock legally/officially so we can finally take the $3,000 capital loss on income tax year after year.

Please advise.

Thank you,

personalfinance,How To Buy a Second Home With Bad Credit And Small Down Payment,"I'm aware of what a bad idea that sounds like, but hear me out. 

I live in one of the fastest-growing cities in the US. I bought my house in 2013 for 90k with a 5% down payment through the FHA. I now rent out three bedrooms in the main house and live in a small mother-in-law suite attached the the house. 

I want to make this home my first rental property, and move into a second home to have for myself (and keep as an investment). My own home appreciates about 1.5-2% in value per month, and my neighborhood has JUST started taking off, so I expect mush higher appreciation over the next five years. For the four years that I've been here, I already have about 80k in equity. 
With the three tenants/roommates that I currently have, I make $1400/month. If I were to move out and rent out my mother-in-law suite, I would gross $2050/month. My mortgage/insurance/taxes/PMI is a total of $ 675/month. 

Other homes in this city are rising FAST. If I buy now (or within the next six months), I can still nab a fixer-upper for about 120k. I've worked construction and have the know-how to do most of the work myself, as I did on this house. 

The problem is this: for the past two years, I held a job at a start-up as an investment, thinking that I could grow with the company. Well, the company is now a multi-million dollar multi-national business, but I was squeezed out due to unrelated circumstances. 
During that time, I was barely making enough to survive, and was unable to pay off any of the debts that I had acquired previously during a period of unemployment. 

I now hold a decent-paying job in a related field as well as a part-time IC gig that holds promise of high commission in the near future. I make double what I had been previously, and I've paid off all of my debts save for my exorbitant student loans. I've been able to put over 2k per month toward paying off old debts and have now paid off all of my old credit cards, microloans, and medical bills. 

Because of those student loans and my recently-acquired car payment, my debt-to-income ratio is questionable. Because I'm still recovering from holding those debts for so long, my credit score is climbing but still not great. Now that most of my debts are eliminated, I should be able to stash at least 2k per month into savings, but that still will not make for a large downpayment unless I wait for a year or more. 

With the appreciation rate of homes in my area, I expect any house that I'm interested in to appreciate at least 15k over the next 6 months. Because of this, I'd like to buy as soon as possible. 

I've considered a cash-out refi in hopes that a significant down payment would offset my less-than-favorable credit, but I'm hesitant to go that route. 

I guess my question is: Is it possible to acquire a second home at this time, and what would you all suggest would be the best way to go about doing that?

Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Getting good credit is easier than you might think: one Redditor's quick guide,"Here's how it breaks down:

-First, understand that getting a higher credit score is something that will take time. If you want to make a SERIOUS jump, be prepared to give it 1-2 years to see the full results of these tips.
-Second, we need to be able to do recon. There are an ungodly number of services and websites out there that claim to give you a free peek at your credit report. Most of them are bunk. I use www.creditkarma.com. The interface is clean, and it's the real deal. Use it, or something like it, to monitor all the things I'll be covering below.
-The biggest factor is making sure you don't miss payments. This means on credit cards, car payments, mortgages, and the dreaded student loans. missing even one payment can result on a black mark on your record that will have a substantial effect for a good chunk of time.

-Next, you want to have as long of a credit history as you can. The best way to do this, is to get yourself any old credit card, and just use it to buy the things you would normally buy every month, then just pay it off. That way, you won't incur any interest, and you'll be showing the credit bureaus that you can be responsible with borrowed money.
This also means you shouldn't close old accounts just because you don't really use them anymore. Keeping that account open won't have any adverse effect on you, but it WILL increase the average age of your accounts, which is good. As we continue on, you'll also notice a few other good things this practice will do for you.

-Another thing to be conscious of is how much credit you have, versus how much you are using. For example, let's say you only have one credit card, and it has a $2000 credit limit. If you have a $1000 balance on that card, you are using 50% of your total credit. You want to get this number as low as you can. What this means is not carrying large balances on your credit cards. Ideally, you shouldn't carry any balance from month to month, because interest sucks. Once again, keeping old cards open will help with this, because if you have a credit card you never use anymore with a $1000 limit, that's just more credit you're NOT using.

-Going hand in hand with your total credit amount, the number of accounts you have open is also a factor. In most cases, the more you have, the better. Accounts, in this case, means credit cards, loans of any kind, lines of credit, and basically anything else where you're making use of money that isn't yours. Having multiple accounts open shows that you are able to responsibly manage a large portfolio. Once again, this means that you shouldn't close out old credit cards. I understand that loans will come and go over the years; that's unavoidable. Don't worry about it.

-The last major factor that we'll cover is inquiries. When a potential lender makes an inquiry for your credit score and history, that shows up on your account. Too many inquiries can hurt your credit score, and they can stay on your record for up to two years. What that means is that you want to get your inquiries out of the way all at once, if you can help it. For example, if you're thinking about getting a few new credit cards, apply for them back to back, that way the hit to your credit will go away as fast as possible.

Now that we've covered the guts of a credit score, I'll give a few extra tips for people starting on this journey who don't have great credit at the moment:

-if you have someone, perhaps a family member, who has a better credit score, and is willing to help, have them co-sign with you if you need to get a loan. Not only will this increase your chances of getting approved, but it will also lower your interest rate, which means you're saving money.

-I know I mentioned this above, but I'm going to stress it again here. Using a credit card doesn't have to mean paying interest. If you pay off your balance at the end of every billing cycle (about once a month) you'll never pay interest. This means that you don't have to be scared by the suuuuper high interest rates that beginner credit cards often come with. So long as you use your card responsibly, you'll never need to worry about it.

-Lastly, be patient! Notice that some of these things take time to come to fruition. Just keep your wits about you and things will go well :)

personalfinance,Student Loan Care LLC Scam,"Hey PF!  Long time lurker here and I just want to say thank you for all the advice and knowledge over the years.  However, today, I come to you with a question.  Prior to reading the story, please keep in mind that I had absolutely no knowledge of any of this until tonight.  Also please be aware that I am recounting all of this from what I was told and I didn't actually see any of the actual documents.  

Recently my girlfriend got a letter in the mail from a company called Student Loan Care LLC saying that a new law had passed that allowed for all of her federal student loans to be consolidated and thus somehow saving her money in the future.  Well, long story short, she calls today trying to sign up and spills all the beans... I'm talking SSN, address, bank routing numbers, FAFSA info, the whole ball of wax and only god knows what else.  All while she thinks that she is getting a good deal.  When she was telling me this, I thought something sounded fishy and I looked up the company.  While I am not 100% sure, based off of what I read on other sites and various other resources I really think that it is a scam of some sort.  I didn't take to much time to look into it because I wanted to ask you guys before time was up.  Apparently, there is a form that says she can cancel by March, 6th which is convenient because that's Monday and I doubt it will get there by then.  Anyway, I really need to know what she can do to protect herself now that all of her info is out in the air to these people.  

I first advised her to change her FAFSA info so they could no longer access that.  I think calling this Student Loan Care LLC first thing in the morning and talking to them and expressing that she is no longer interested is the next step. Next I told her to go to the bank tomorrow and close her checking account so they couldn't withdrawal anything.  My real question is... how can she protect herself now that they know her SSN?  Can't they now basically apply for credit cards loans, and other things in her name?  How should we monitor or prevent this???

personalfinance,Should I Invest in a Broken Down House in the Ghetto in Hopes that it Will Gain Value?,"Hi there. I just maxed out my 401k and I'm wondering what I should do with my money. I can't really play the stock market because of work regulations(Vanguard is fine), but I was thinking about investing in a house in Newark, NJ.

Newark is a pretty bad neighborhood, but downtown is going through a gentrification phase. I was wondering if it would be smart to buy a house for nearly cash(may get a small mortgage and pay it off in 5 years) and hold onto it in hopes that it will gain value.

Home prices in the tri-state area have been sky rocketing and even my owner occupied place has gained 12% value in the two years I have been holding. It's just too expensive to live right next to NYC.

Is it smart to buy property in the ghetto where it is still semi-convenient to get to NYC? I'm thinking a big investor will want to buy in a few years or I could fix it up over time and rent it out.

The company paid the difference between selling price and what I owed, which was $25k and was told it would be grossed up to not ruin me in taxes. They didn't gross it up. I ended up owing $8k that year. 

In 2010, before I even get payments going, I lost my job and was given a rather decent severance package, which I thought was best used on paying off high interest debt and living expenses until I found another job. Turns out, that money was coded in a way that caused me to owe an additional $25k. 

Through claiming 0 and allowing extra deductions from the wages at my new job, the debt nearly stayed the same, but they did apply it to the older debt first. Taxes and penalties are eating us alive. I had a severe medical emergency that took nearly a year to recover from and I am hoping I get this job I've been interviewing for this week. 

We have a lein on our credit because the debt is over $25k. They have threatened us with tax evasion several times, but I don't know what they want? They want us to be homeless, yet have jobs, stay healthy, and crap thousands of dollars when we barely get by now. We have 2 kids and 2 roommates in a rental house. We have a car with a high interest rate due to the lein. 

My thoughts are to take my earnings and hide away as much as possible until I get to $5- $7k, then began then to take that as a settlement, before I give up on life and decide prison is better than homelessness. 

Please, I am pleading, if anyone has any better idea, please share. I'm broke and scared, not a lazy criminal.

personalfinance,Could I have done anything?,"**EDIT:    So after hearing the first few comments, this makes more sense now. There really was nothing to be done. Thanks for the replies



So this happened a while ago, but every tax season it burns me up thinking about this. I'll be as brief as i can with what happened. 

A few years ago, I was promoted at work in July and got a raise. Come February of the following year I start to do my taxes and find out that I owe a total of $4200 between state and federal. My W2 showed I pretty much didn't pay any taxes for 6 months and I cant understand how this could be. I check up on it with my company's finance department and they say that the computer is telling them in July of the last year I changed my dependants to 10 from 0. I've never done this and when I asked to see my W4 showing that I changed it, they couldn't find one. The only one on file was from when I was initially hired that said my dependants were 0. 

They told me they would check with the HR department since they are required to keep duplicate copies of this kind of stuff. HR  didn't even have a copy of the W4 from my initial hire. So there was no proof I changed my dependants yet somehow it was changed in the system. I told them this is their fault and all they said was that I had 2 options. Either they reissue all my checks from the date of the mistake and pay the company back for the amount they over paid me, or pay the taxes and have them fix the error now. I just paid the taxes, but the whole thing pissed me off. 

So, I know this was partially my fault for not looking at my pay stub more carefully. The thing was I was supposed to be getting more money and didn't think anything of the increase. I'll definitely accept responsibility for my part in this. 

Really, my question is could I have done anything at all to lessen the cost to me of this whole thing? Could I have gotten my company to cover half the cost due to their error and poor record keeping? Like I said before, this happened a few years ago and is really a moot point.

personalfinance,"People who have Navient loans! And are making monthly minimum payments that only goes 100% towards interest, but not capitalizing on that interest. Can you check something for me?","Hi! Do you have multiple student loans with Navient? Are any of these loans on an Income Driven Repayment (IDR) plan? 

Are your monthly payments only covering 100% interest and you are not capitalizing on that interest? You can help me out!

Example:

You have a loan of $9,271.32. Your interest only, minimum monthly payment is $44.34. Your payment goes 100% towards interest, 0% towards principal. Your new principal after monthly interest payment remains $9,271.32.

Now the assumption is your loan is only accruing $44.34/month. Your minimum monthly payment goes 100% towards interest, and your monthly ending principal doesn't change each month. That makes sense, right?

However, I am finding a weird trend in my loan accrual. I am actually underpaying in interest with my minimum payments! My interest accrual every month for the example loan above should be either be $43.81 for 28 days, $46.94 for 30 days, $48.51 for 31 days (assuming I am only paying off the interest accrual every month, and the principal remains at $9,271.32 month over month). Assuming a normal year, this interest accrual would be $571.19. Using Navient's interest accrual from above at $44.34 every month, I am only paying $532.08 in interest. Awesome! I am somehow not paying Navient $39.10 a year in interest, and my principal is not increasing or showing capitalized interest. I am coming out ahead, right?

Not quite. So one month, I decide I am going to pay extra on top of that loan. Paid an extra $100 towards that bad boy, meaning my total payments towards the loan for that month was $100.00 and $44.34. We would think $100 would go towards principal and knock that principal down a bit... but it quite doesn't. Instead, it calculates how much I underpaid in interest for the previous months, and then subtracts that from the payment before applying to principal.

Example: I paid the monthly minimum of $44.34 for 5 months. Principal stays at $9,271.32 after each month's payment. I paid $221.70 total in interest. I should have been charged $239.42. I underpaid in interest by $17.73 total during those 5 months. Mid month, I paid an extra $100. Navient subtracted the not paid interest of $17.73 from the $100 as interest, and then subtracted the accurate amount of interest  that has accrued so far that month ($25.04), thus applying only $57.23 to principal. However, now everything is Even Steven. When the normal $44.34 is paid at the end of the month, everything calculates as it should and some more of the principal is paid off, and I start next month with a clean slate. However, if I go back to just paying the minimum every month, I go back to underpaying in interest and the cycle continues.

This... this isn't how interest accrual is supposed to work, correct? Is this behavior associated with IDR loans? Someone correct me if I am being crazy or stupid.

However, if this is not how the interest accrual works, is this behavior harmful? My principal stays unaffected. I am not capitalizing on interest.

Why would Navient do this behavior?

One theory I have is this behavior I explained above only applies to the highest interest rate loans. The lowest interest loan accrues interest like it should, and a small amount of the payment actually goes to principal every month. The highest interest loans never had a minimum monthly payment go towards the principal. The odd behavior above makes sure I am not applying any money towards the principal of my highest interest rate loans, unless if I pay a lot extra one month. Not only do I have to pay the normal interest accrual for that month, but I also have to pay back the interest I was undercharged for. This makes it more difficult to actually pay down the principal for highest interest loans. I don't know exactly how much this benefits Navient, but it is weird. But I might be giving Navient too much credit with this theory. Maybe it is for supposed ease of use, or purposefully just making your loans some nebulous, confusing number trap to scare people away from understanding their loans.

**TL;DR: So my question is... Am I glitch in the system of funky interest accrual? Where I am underpaying in interest every month when I am only paying the minimum payment that only covers 100% interest, until I pay an extra amount on top of the minimum payment, then you are​ charged for that interest you didn't pay in the previous months? Or has anyone else noticed this behavior?**

Easiest way to check. You may need multiple loans with different interest rates under Navient, but it is good to check anyways. Pull up a loan that is not your lowest interest loan, and which your minimum monthly payment is 100% going towards interest, 0% to principal, and your principal remains the same month over month. Use this formula (from Navient's website) to calculate what your interest should be: 
_________

Your current principal balance

x The number of days since your last payment

x Interest rate factor (interest rate / 365.25)

= Your daily interest rate

_________

Example using above numbers:

$9,271.32

x (6/28/2016 - 5/28/2016 = 31 days)

x ((interest rate = 6.165% )/ 365.25)

= $48.51
_________

Compare that to the interest you are supposedly being charged and paying 100% off every month with your interest only payment. Is it noticeably higher or lower, or pretty close to the same?

I don't know if this is normal, nefarious, or I just don't understand interest accrual. It's all a mystery to me!

Thanks!!

I had originally written this out with my whole situation but decided against it. Basically, I am in desperate need of a ~$5000 personal/debt consolidation loan. $5000 would allow me to erase all my debt and help me get my life back together over the next few months, as I've basically hit rock bottom. But after getting here I've realized that I still have a lot ahead of me, as long as I can focus on the future as well as the present. 

It would have to be an unsecured loan, unless there is a place that accepts electronics as collateral. It would also need to be a loan with a longer repayment date, as the payments would need to be fairly low in the short term. My credit score stands around 575 I believe, and I have no one who can co-sign for me. There is also zero chance of me getting a loan from someone I know. 

Does anyone know of a place where I can get $5000 and pay it back on a 3 or 5 year monthly basis? Thank you.

*Edit: I removed a lot of it because this really is my final option before I get to the point that I have to break my lease and move into some form of public housing. I've exhausted all other options. Basically, I'm trying to focus on getting medical help because of some very serious mental issues that are preventing me from living a normal life. I've left 4 jobs in the past year and all for the same reason that I am currently trying to work out in therapy. I've done all the math, $5000 would give me five months to get my life back on track, and during that time all expenses, including the loan repayment, would be covered by the loan. Basically if I got $5000 right now, I would have 5 months where I wouldn't have to worry about finances at all.

**Edit2: I'm hoping to find something online possibly, with higher interest rates but less requirements. The simplest answer for all that, for anyone who reads this, is my ineffective way of coping with childhood trauma has led to me being a suicidal mess of an adult. I have a degree and once I get back into the workforce I'll be making more than enough to sustain my financial needs. Until then, I'm trying to fix the stuff in my head. I'm basically a giant blob of apathy, and every job I find seems to exacerbate it.

***Edit3: I'm currently waiting to hear back from the department of economic security about unemployment insurance and nutritional assistance.

They also rarely recognize depression as a condition that qualifies for anything besides government healthcare.

**Here's my question**: How much should I be spending on the card? I've done my time on this subreddit and gathered enough information to get this far. I don't recall the *exact* amount of money that I should be spending, but I think it was about 5-10%?


Also, how do I go about paying off the balance on the credit card? I'd hate to have it go past the due date because I didn't know how to pay it.


Side note: The credit card is through my bank, Navy Federal. Any other information that is requested will be added here.",finance
Forex,Usd? (Fundamental noob),"So I've been following the dollar for the past few days as last month I was told I should focus more on fundamentals as I trade d1 trends. 

So I've bought usdcad after the dollar spiked up the other day Feb 28th and I have been trying to work out why I know interest rates are thought to be hiking but on the 28th the only major event bullish for the dollar was consumer confidence- is this enough to warrant such a hike

I also wanted to ask why the dollar dropped quiet suddenly today (march 3rd) after Yellen spoke more less confining interest rate hikes surely this should mean the opposite (that the dollar would spike upwards)

Can anyone give explanations behind these events and perhaps tell me where I am going wrong with my analysis.",finance
personalfinance,Pension allocation...take it or leave it at 39 years old,"I was somewhat pleasantly surprised to see what my pension benefits were worth after I terminated my employment after only 5 years with a company that offered this now-a-days rare plan.

Current value is **$11,000**

I have the option to keep the money where it is until I'm forced to take it out at 72 years old.

Estimated cash balance Single Life Annuity (SLA, monthly payout) at retirement age is **$103**.

Cash balance SLA now: **$45**

If I take a lump sum check right now, the Fed takes 30% off the top. The State takes it's share too.  So, I'd be lucky to take home **$7,000.**  And I imagine I'd have to pay taxes on this as income next tax season. 

Another option is rolling it into an existing IRA - which would avoid the 20-30% penalty.

I'm leaning towards the $45 annuity now.  I mean... I'm 39, and if someone wants to pay for a dinner or some groceries once per month for the rest of my life, why not take it? I did the math and the breakeven point for taking the $45 annuity would only be about 15 years (assuming the lump sum check today would be $7,000).  So if I make it to 55, everything is gravy, right?

Final thoughts
- Perhaps this annuity at 39yo and up will be taxed at 30% too 
- I'm not desperate for the $7k right now

personalfinance,Transferring Credit Balances To Obtain Personal Loan (is this a good strategy?),"Hi - 
Have been a fairly responsible credit card user for last few years. Last few months ""got away"" and I've managed to pile up some significant debt with a cross country move, some rather expensive Christmas gifts for family and two vacations within three months. 

In short, I currently have $26,000 in credit card debt. Almost all of that is retained on three cards. I'm around 35% utilization on each one. My other cards are all almost zero. My total utilization across all of the cards is 22%.

Current FICO is around the 725 mark. It's sunk a bit as the debt increased. No late payments. No derogatory marks. 4.5 average account age. 11 accounts. Only 2 current inquiries. 

I applied for a $10k debt consolidation loan last evening through Lending Club and was denied fairly quickly. Guessing it has to do with my high utilization and balances over those three cards? I want to clean things up a bit and try again with another loan company. 

I am in the process of transferring some of the larger balances to an under utilized card (took advantage of a 0% APR offer for Discover). So hopefully in about a weeks time, I'll only have one card above 20% utilization. 

At that point, I would like to apply for a Citi Simplicity card , transfer some of that high balance from the remaining card and hopefully be under 20% for all of my cards. 

In theory, would a profile of having under 20% utilization (as opposed to the 35% balances) make me more attractive as a borrower? Or would the total amount ($26k) still work against me? Idea is to be able to get that 10k loan to pay off the cards with the interest rates and then pay the balance transfer cards (at 0% APR) over the following year. 

Any insight or comments would be greatly appreciated!",finance

I have the choice to either pay $46.96 a month for 15 years or I can pay $6792 right now and be done with it.  So by my math this is basically a loan with a 3.02% interest rate.  Most of the time people say here if it is less than 4% it is better not pay it off and to instead invest the money.  Also if we move in less than 15 years the next owners would then have to pay the remaining, although if it becomes a buyers market they could put something in their offer about seller paying it off or giving them a discount for the remainder. 

1. Is my math correct?  Is this basically like paying of a loan with 3.02% APR?

personalfinance,Open Roth IRA/Increase TSP contribution/Pay down student loans?,"Hello all, I found out about this subreddit recently and I see lots of good advise. I apologize for the wall of text and appreciate any advice.

I am trying to figure out if I should open a Roth IRA, increase my TSP contribution or pay down student loans.

I am a federal employee and contribute 5% to my TSP account which covers what the government matches. I am 30 years old and have 28k in there. My wife is 34 and has about 12k in her 401k. We probably are behind for our age. My only debts are mortgage, 2x car loans and student loans. I am currently doing my masters and will be done May of next year. Currently my student loan debt is 55k and if I were to just pay interest only until I graduate next year I'll be graduating with about 63k in student loans. Currently I am putting $300 monthly towards that. I owe about 2k in one of my car loans at 3.14% and doing $200 payments on it. Once that is done by the end of the year I'll be moving the $200 to my student loan payments making it $500 monthly. I expect to have about $200 more in liquid income by the time my student loans enter repayment so I'll be doing about $700 monthly which just about covers he required repayment amount.

After all bills are done and all the things in my budget are taken care of, I have about $700 left over every month. I am saving $100 weekly that go towards an emergency fund in which I currently have about $4000. So I am left with about $300 monthly.

Should I be putting the $300 towards student loans, increase TSP contributions or open a Roth IRA??",finance
personalfinance,Buying a second home. Should I get a mortgage or HELOC,"So I am buying a second home for $250k. I want to borrow $100k to make the purchase happen.

I hate the fact that I have to pay all of the closing fees related to getting a typical mortgage loan. Instead, I was considering using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) from my credit union. They are offering .50% discount on prime, so at this time I am getting 3.25%. The term is a 10 year draw, on a 30yr amoritization.

But there is a chance of rate hikes, quite possible this month, and maybe few more this year.

Another option that I was considering a 5/1yr ARM for a 3.25% rate.

One key question I had. Does the interest work the same if I borrow via a mortgage or eloc, and the rate hypothetically is the same for the term if I make extra payments?

For example, if I pay $10k each year toward my mortage loan or my HELOC, will the total interest paid be the same (assuming the same monthly payment)?

I had this, perhaps fall understanding, that when you get a mortage the interest is amortized over 30yrs, and that the payment each month is so heavily skewed toward the interest that needs to be payed over 30 yrs.

But then I played in excel and made a calculation of monthly interest on a HELOC and seems like it is the same thing regarding the amount of interest you pay. But for HELOC, it is intuitive to me that if I pay say $70k toward the principal, the daily and monthly interest would be acrued on a small amount ~30k.

Does the same concept work if I prepay $70k toward my mortgage on the house?

I get it that HELOC and interest rate there is variable. But I also avoid closing cost about $3,000 which costs me about 5 years of paying an interest of 4% in my HELOC compared to a fixed rate of 3.25% on an 5 year arm. There is a risk that the prime may go much higher as well.

So, main question, prepaying the same amount toward HELOC or toward a mortgage  has the same effect regarding the total interest paid toward over the life of the loan?

Also, any advice what I am thinking of doing and what is a better option?

personalfinance,Private Student Loan in Collections,"Hello everyone! I defaulted on my private student loan through Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) after they refused to work with me to lower my payments or offer a forbearance during a period of time I was unemployed and it is now placed in collections through some weird ""Law Firm"" (Weltman, Weinberg &amp; Reis Co) / collections agency a year and a half later for the amount of $26,000. The letter stated ""they were through with collections efforts and invite me to settle this matter.""

After talking to a woman who seemed decent enough, she offered to have this settled for around 13k (I recorded the conversation also). She said I can either pay the entire amount (which I don't have at all) or place a down payment of 2k, and make payments up to 48 months and then proceeded to pressure to pay anything I could that night which I didn't. While settling it for 13k sounds great, I'm obviously a little weary and need advice on how to approach this since I have read horror stories of others who agreed on a settlement repayment plan and have had the balance returned in full after payments have been made. So with that noted I have not yet agreed or have requested validation of the debt. I'm going to list some things that I have questions about to make it easier:

1.Should I request a validation of debt letter to buy some time in regards to deciding to settle the debt? I've read there are pro/cons to this. While I am certain it is my debt, I'm a little confused because a) the balance remains on my Navient profile online b) it is not appearing on my credit report as in collections. It is under a section called ""account review inquiries"" and then has their name listed. Does anyone know what this means exactly? I looked it up, and it appears to be some kind of review of my credit report on their behalf. Is this legal?

2.I was told I can't release the co-signer after agreeing to settle. She said that with Navient he'd have to agree to pay 30% of the original balance in order to be released. My question is why would it matter what Navient's policies are if this is a collection agency? Doesn't that mean Navient sold the debt to them? So why would it apply at this point.
Should I consult with an attorney for advice on a settlement agreement so I don't get screwed over in the long run and I am protected in writing? Or Should I seek bankruptcy (my credit is awful (rating 420's), mostly due to identity theft a couple years back but after somewhat restoring it myself it has plummeted due to unemployment 1 year ago. I have about 4-5k in debt in credit cards and other collections not due to fall off the report until 2023, also getting collection calls/letters from these places; a fresh start doesn't seem like a bad idea! I'm in my late 20's).

3.How would bankruptcy affect my co-signer? He is on social security benefits and is now living another country. From what I've read, a loan can be solely transferred to a co-signer after the other borrower files bankruptcy, however from my understanding private loans are not protected federally therefore potentially being released on bankruptcy and/or unable to garnish social security wages. I'm not sure whether or not him living outside the country is beneficial or not but crossing my fingers it is as I feel totally awful for putting him this position in the first place.

Also, how would bankruptcy affect my federal loans? I know they are nearly impossible to discharge, the majority of my college loans are federal (about 80k: I received an MA also) they are for the most part in good standing, but I missed a couple payments recently and it hit my credit report further damaging it. Will those bad remarks be erased in bankruptcy ch.7? Which is my main concern, because if I do bankruptcy I want a good start! I'm currently on forbearance until the summer and then I will be choosing an income-based repayment plan (which is an entire other conversation in itself, but one stepping stone at a time!). I don't intend to have those loans discharged (I wish) but just wondering if it would cause further issues if I did do a bankruptcy and if negative remarks/reporting would be removed. 

Is there anyone who has/or is currently dealing with this? (I know there is but is anyone willing to talk about their stories on how they approached, succeeded or are just flat out worried like me!) I've been feeling extremely stressed out about all of this and seeking some support.

Sorry for the long post, but hopefully I can seek some relief!

personalfinance,Survivors benefits?,"So over the years we've lived in WA, MN, and TX if that helps, although I think this is a more federal issue.

Anyways, here's the story. When I was about 2 my biological mother passed away and my dad married my adoptive mother (I don't consider her my stepmother because she legally adopted me as her son and has raised me for most of my life).

After my biological mother died I received survivor's benefits, however I was never aware of it until I was about 18. From the time I was two until I turned 18, the checks were made out to my parents and they used them to supplement their incomes from work and what not. 

My folks finally told me about the benefits shortly before I turned 18. I was informed that the checks would be in my name from then until I graduated high school which is when they were to end. 

The time from when I turned 18 till when I graduated high school was about 10 months. For those 10 months what would happen is the checks would be deposited into my bank account that was attached to my parent's account. They would let me have $100 of it each month and they would take the rest and use it towards our living expenses. 

At the time I didn't really question it, I figured an extra $100 a month was better than nothing. I made pretty good money from the part time job I had, so even if I didn't get any of the money it wasn't that big of a deal. So when my folks said they'd be keeping most of the money, I was pretty ok with it. 

I've told other people I know about this situation after the fact, and most of them have told that what my folks did was actually illegal. Supposedly, all the money was supposed to go to me as soon as I turned 18. If that's the case then I missed out on over at least a few thousand dollars. 

Now heres the thing, I just want to know if what happened was legal. I'm not gonna try and get the money back from my folks considering they spent it as soon as they got it, and theres no sense in trying to get blood from a stone. Since I never objected to them taking most of the money, it may be legal since I gave them permission.",finance
investing,"Investing in Workhorse (WKHS), thoughts?","They're producing the first electric pickup truck for 2018, and they will be presenting the truck this May which may draw investors, (http://workhorse.com/pickup) and it seems highly promising at a mere ~$3 a share. 

(For reference: https://www.google.com/finance?cid=11201464)

Thoughts? I don't have a crap ton of money (a few thousand that I'm able to use), and I really would like to buy while the price remains low. I think the company is currently undervalued, and I think it is reasonable to expect the price to pick up around May (preferably $4+) when they present the truck, as right now we don't really know too much about what it looks like completely, how it performs, its entire specs from top to bottom, etc.  

Would it be a silly move to buy 350 shares at $2.80 - $3.00? ($980 - $1050) My thinking is, I sell half around May and keep the rest until it releases next yearish. I do realize that I'm probably not going to make much of a profit, but I'm fairly new to investing and I really want to start with a company I understand, and something I believe in. 

For the last three to four years I've been making predictions and speculations on stock and commodities, and for the last two years I've been right on an overwhelming amount of things. For instance, I would make a list of every single thing I thought was bound to increase in price, and I'd write down the company name, the price I'd buy in (if I hypothetically had the money), and would jot down my reasoning all in a small journal. I was correct on virtually everything, without sounding like a braggart. 

Here are some things I guessed correctly on: NRP, which is a diversified American fossil fuel company with a focus on coal (National Resource Partners), Nintendo (a week before Pokemon Go was released), and I also predicted crude oil would rebound (for several reasons), and a lot more as well. Boy do I wish I had money last January when crude was still hovering around the $30 mark. Damnit.  

I should also note that I am huge on economics and politics, particularly global affairs, and like George Soros, I also believe that you have to look at most things from a global lens and realize that the statuses of both the economy and politics are directly correlated with the performance of markets. Of course there are many other factors too when it comes to what influences the price of something, but generally speaking, basic things such as interest rates, political uncertainty/instability, a weakening dollar (and so on, and so forth- many other factors too) will undoubtedly (in my opinion) have a strong influence.

As interest rates increase, demand for short-term bonds, such as the 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year Treasury bonds increases. In turn, this has the effect of driving down prices for these instruments and increasing associated yields.*

So when there is a rate hike, prices from treasury bonds drop (to get a bigger difference between: current price -&gt; money payed on expiration, which gives you a better return).

But since the price drops, this also means that it is not a good investment product to own when there is a rate hike?

And wouldn't the demand for treasury bonds rise, because the return is bigger (the difference between the money you get on expiration and the money you bond the treasury bond for, increases).",finance

The mortgage has a 3.675% interest rate, car has a 1.9% interest rate, and the loan has a 4.375 % interest rate. If I sold all of my shares today, I would have enough to pay off the loan or the car pretty easily. The ESPP shares are still in the short term tax period.

In a monthly breakdown:

$160 goes toward the 4.375% loan (~6500 left over)
$500 goes toward the car payment (~4000 left over)
$1400 goes toward the mortgage

So I was thinking, should I sell the shares and invest them in a Vanguard Mutual Fund, pay off one of the loans, or do nothing?

If I do nothing, there's a chance that the stock will go up and give me a better return. 

If I invest in a Mutual Fund, it looks like I can potentially get 8-10% annual returns, but I'm assuming this is or could be taxed (I'm planning to reinvest so I don't know if that is still taxed). But I also like the idea of getting started in these investments at this time and incorporating it into my budget. I never had enough free cash to get started in a Mutual Fund until now.

Typically I hate holding debt, but since I'm stuck with it at the moment and interest rates are low, should I be investing instead of trying to pay it down faster? Are there any gotchas with this strategy?

personalfinance,$20k credit card debt spread across two cards. What should I do?,"Hello, this is my first post in this forum, so apologies in advance if this is the wrong subforum to ask a question like this.

Long story short, I came out of college with a low-paying job and didn't manage my living situation very well, so I ended up signing a lease on a place I couldn't quite afford and began digging into my credit cards over the span of a few months for help. I'm now at the point where I'm making $36k (still not great, but more than I was before), and I can afford my rent (with utilities etc. it is about $1k/month), but I want to also begin paying down my debt, and I often feel like I'm just treading water if not drowning because life tends to happen and some other unexpected bill pops up. I have health insurance but had to get a catscan last month and even after the insurance I'll be paying a few hundred for that. Just little things here and there make it tough to make progress.

I was planning to try to consolidate the debt into some kind of loan, and just begin making payments each month. Perhaps just automatically direct $400/month towards the credit card debt and begin to really map out a budget for everything else and only use cash for things like groceries or restaurants so that I'm not getting carried away swiping cards and losing track.

I realize the folk here are probably in a much better situation than I am to offer advice on this kind of predicament, so please do share any input as I'd greatly appreciate it. And in retrospect I realize how I went about incurring this debt was rather stupid and I made plenty of mistakes, but hindsight is 20/20 and rather than let myself get bogged down with feeling helpless and depressed over it (as I did for a while), I'm trying to learn from my mistakes and set myself on a path for financial success.

As a sidenote, I'd also like to start learning more about investing, and putting aside money each month into a savings account. If anyone has opinions on this (given my financial situation) please feel free to share!

Thanks in advance. 

EDIT: Might be worth mentioning that despite the $20k debt, I have excellent credit. My first card was through NFCU 8 years ago as a teenager, and they have increased my max amount to $25k because I've always been on time with payments and paid more than the minimum. I have $15k balance on that card right now, and $5k on a Citi Visa card with higher interest rates, so originally I was thinking I'd pay the Citi down first and make that one the priority, but not sure if that's a better alternative to consolidating into a single loan.",finance
personalfinance,Grad student working in retail and my W2 says my federal income taxes are tax blocked and have no federal income taxes withheld.

personalfinance,Self-Employed. Never filed taxes before. I could use some help.,"Hey r/personalfinance!

As the title mentions, this will be my first year filing taxes. I've been looking all around the internet for help, this subreddit in particular, and I feel like i've found a lot of great answers! But just when I feel comfortable with something, i'll stumble across something new that seems to contradict things, mostly thanks to my self-employed status.

I know I could just go to a tax professional for help, but I earn a very modest income and seemingly every price i've seen listed has Self-Employment filing at nearly double the standard! In fact, i'm pretty sure i'm eligible for the IRS Free File program, so i'd like to exhaust all my options before paying for professional help. I probably will end up utilizing the Free File program, I just wanted to ask you guys for some pointers to make sure I don't miss any forms or improperly file, something like that :)

It feels as though my circumstances are fairly simple and straight forward, so i'll just tell you guys the details and perhaps you could lead me in the right direction....

I've been working as a hairstylist since January 2016, and my total income for the year was $10,000. I was given a 1099-Misc from my salon that reflects that. I have no expenses to speak of, with the exception of my commuting costs, which I believe are non-deductable?... That's one of the major points i've read conflicting material on, but for the most part it seems as if I can not deduct commuting expenses from home to workplace, which is fine I suppose.

Now some questions: Am I allowed to claim the $6,300 standard deduction and/or the $4,050 personal exemption, or are those exclusive to standard employees?..... If I can in fact deduct those, what does that mean for me where those amount to more than my $10,000 income?

I know I am responsible for paying Self-Employment tax, which will be 15.3% of my income.... but is that 15.3% calculated before or after my standard deduction and/or personal exemption?

Finally, I have a savings account with a few thousand dollars i've had since I was a kid. Every year they send me a letter with my interest accrued for the year(1099-INT). I have never bothered filing this interest.... I certainly plan on filing it this year, but will I be responsible to pay back-taxes for the years where I failed to file this interest?.... and in either case, will I need a special additional form to file my interest earned?

Am I eligible for the ""Earned Income Tax Credit""? If so, how do I go about requesting it/filing with that in mind/etc?.... Is it automatically calculated somewhere/somehow? Is that exclusive to standard employees rather than the self-employed?

Which forms will I need in order to file? Schedule SE? Schedule SE-EZ?... 1040? 1040-EZ? an additional form for my interest(1099-INT)?.... any others that i'm unaware of?

Do any of these cases change between Federal and State taxes?

If this information helps: I am 26. Single. Live in Massachusetts. I made no other income of any kind. I have no dependents, I am no else's dependent. I made no major purchases, I have no special disabilities or allowances or anything else that i'm aware of.

Thanks so much for reading this guys, and thanks in advance for any help or direction you can offer :)",finance
personalfinance,"Are bonuses taxed at a higher rate, and if so, if there a tax advantage to contributing money from a bonus directly to a 401(k), as opposed to contributing the same amount from my bank account?

Since the traditional 401(k) and HSA Savings accounts are pretax contributions, think about adding more from this bonus check to lower your taxable income."" 

Let's assume my effective federal tax liability is 25%, and what my company has said above is true and the bonus is taxed at 30%. Does that mean there would be a difference in how much I pay in taxes in the two following scenarios: 

A.) I receive the bonus as a post-tax deposit to my bank account. I then contribute $1000 into my 401(k) and then note that contribution the next time I do my taxes to reduce my total taxable income. 

B.) I have my employer directly contribute $1000 into my 401(k) from that bonus.

Sole earner for family, wife, 3 kids. I have a little bit of runway to look for another job but I am looking for sound advice because I can't think straight right now and my wife is more hysterical than me.

I have 150k mortgage on a 350k home, payments $1360/month.  

0 credit card debt, cars are paid off (older one worth ~3k and newer one worth ~25k), but I have 19k on a home equity loan with variable interest rate 4.25%.  Min payment is interest only ~$70/month which is what I'm going to start paying now.

What I've been averaging:
$600/month groceries
$300/month preschool fee (ends in May)
$190/month car insurance for 2 cars
$100/month phones
$150/month utilities
$100/month internet/TV/Netflix
$80/month gas
Another 200-300 miscellaneous (but will cut back on this stuff now)

I have $14.5k cash and could burn through that money if I can't find a job in several months.  I also have 90k in 401k that I can withdraw with the penalty if it gets really bad.  So how crazy is it?  I need phone/internet to look for a job.  But do I pull my kid from preschool and go into hermit mode?  Cancel TV and Netflix (which is only $10/month).  Think about selling a car?  Let the mortgage bank know and talk about changing terms?  

Also, thinking about next job, do I hold out for six figure job or just take whatever (which I really don't want to do but will if I have no choice and if that's what makes sense).  What's the best way to think about this?  Do I take a job ASAP that pays way less, how much less makes sense?  Just need sound reasoning.  Thanks!

Edit/update: Wow, thanks everyone for all the awesome feedback.  Definitely makes me feel better.  So major take away is 1) relax (thanks for this again, I really needed to hear this) 2) apply for unemployment which will extend my runway 3) hold out for maybe a month for somewhat equal paying job, then start to scale back expectations.

- Roth 401k is taxed going in and not coming out.  Mutual funds are taxed coming out and occasionally during the life.  Is the tax rate higher than Roth 401k?

personalfinance,Time to invest or should we just keep saving and paying down debt?,"Hi, /r/personalfinance!

I've lurked around this sub for a while and it's been really helpful to read the advice and information that's been provided. I was hoping to get some more specific input on where my spouse and I should go from our current situation, because we think it might be time to start seriously thinking about investing, but are not really sure. We're both pretty young and I handle our finances. I grew up fairly poor and busted my ass to get through college and grad school, so I never really imagined being in the position I'm in now and I don't know what to do next. 

Some general background:

We are late 20s/early 30s. My spouse is a high earner, making about $180k/year, whereas I make around $65k/year, both before tax. We are maxing out my spouse's 401k and getting the full match on mine, which comes out to 8% between me and the employer. We also have $30k in savings as our ""emergency fund."" We have a mortgage and one car note along with student loan debt, but no credit card debt or medical bills. The outstanding balance on the car note is ~$18,000 (5 yr term, 2.25% interest) and on the student loans it is ~$114,000. (Terms and interest rates vary from 8-20 years, and 7.65%-5.15%.) 

We're trying to be fairly aggressive with our loan repayment strategy, but we also live comfortably and don't deny ourselves much. Right now, our monthly bills look something like this:

* Mortgage - $2000
* Car note - $330
* Student loans - $1650
* Other bills, including groceries - $2,000

We are planning on the following for extra debt payments/savings, on top of the minimum payments:

* Car note - $500/mo
* Student loans - $2,000/mo, targeting highest interest loans first
* Savings/Investment - $500/mo

We are trying to gather an extra little nest egg before we try for a kid (in the next 12-18 months), and there's a possibility my spouse may leave the high-paying job for something closer to the $90k range, in the interest of work-life balance. If that happens, it won't be for another year or so. Ideally, we will be able to pay off the highest interest student loans, which would cut the monthly minimum payment to around $1,000, before anyone switches jobs. (One major goal is to make sure my spouse doesn't feel stuck in a job with insane hours because we became dependent on that high salary.)

Now, I hope that's enough information (if it's not, I can edit to add more) for someone to help me out with the real question that I have:

We are comfortable with our emergency fund and retirement funding. We'd like to have another relatively accessible $10-15k, in anticipation for a kid and, also, large vacations. (We like to travel internationally at least once every year or two.) I'm not sure if we should just keep throwing money into a high-yield savings account, or if we should open an account somewhere like Betterment and start investing. Or! Maybe there are other options I haven't thought of? A 529 plan? Increase my 401k contributions? Reduce the extra student loan payments and save more money? Any and all input is appreciated. I know that these are good problems to have, but I also know that we're young and in a position to make smart choices that will pay dividends well into the future. I don't want to blow it because I didn't research enough or ask the right questions.",finance

I am currently in my freshmen year of college. I paid my first semester costs from my checking account, and the rest was covered by finiancial aid loans and grants.

personalfinance,Account prepared tax refund seems odd in comparison to 2015...thoughts?,"UPDATE: mystery solved! Answered by ""simplytaxing"". The addition of a small business sale of $18K in 2015 made my taxable income much higher--HOWEVER--that amount was taxed a 0%/refers to a different tax rate table. Deceiving, very deceiving. Thank you everyone!

Hi everyone, our expected refund for 2016 seems rather light in comparison to 2015. Although I will be working with our accountant next week to review, does this seem odd to anyone else?  First up, numbers from 2015:  
* AGI: $77458  
* Taxable Income: $54,845  
* Federal: $7920 withheld / $1605 refund  
* State: $4918 withheld / $1533 refund  

Here's a look at our 2016 numbers (note we continued to have a ""0"" allowance):  
* AGI: $66260  
* Taxable Income: $40879  
* Federal: $7434 withheld / $848 refund  
* State: $4044 withheld / $1614 refund  

Now my assumption this year, despite withholding slightly less for taxes (I bumped it up in 2015 due to the sale of a small business--I did this by paying more in, not modifying our allowances) was that we'd get more back--our taxable income is $14,000 less! However you'll notice that although we got more in state refunds, despite holding back almost $900 less, we got about half of our 2015 Federal refund. This seems quite odd due to the much lower taxable income.  

Am I losing it or does this look a bit odd? Thoughts?

personalfinance,Loan payoff question,"I think I have a good plan regarding the payoff of some loans but I keep having the feeling that I'm missing something.

My mortgage on my ""starter home"" (thank you 2006 and naïveté) is underwater between $20-$40,000. I have two kids, boy and girl, sharing a room. I'm going to need to sell and move someplace bigger within 3-5 years. 

Other than my mortgage I've got a student loan and a car loan that are about the same amount. The car loan is at 1% and the student loan is at 6% but the car loan is $350 per month and the student loan is $120. 

I'm putting about double the monthly cost of those loans into savings each month and have been for a while. My total savings aren't quite at the 6 months of bills level but they are at a comfortable amount for me. 

My current plan is to build up the savings until I've got my preferred buffer plus the amount of one of the loans and then pay it off starting with the car loan. Then I rinse and repeat for the next loan. 

I know the interest rate on the student loan is higher but since I'm planning on paying both off within a year I think the increased cash in my pocket each month from eliminating the larger car payment makes up for what's lost in interest on the student loan.

Here's the part where I think I'm right but I'm a little unsure: It was mentioned to me once or twice about paying down the principal of my mortgage to help pay it down faster. While I see where that could be beneficial I know I'm going to lose a significant amount of money on my house. I'm estimating that I'm going to need to pay at least $20,000 to be able to walk away from the mortgage even after the sale and then at least $20,000 more for a down payment on a larger place. So that cash is basically already gone and I've accepted that in the hope that I'll be pleasantly surprised or at least prepared for it.

I think getting the cash in the bank by paying off the other loans and increasing my savings is my best option instead of trying to pay down the principal. That way I can have the money on hand for anything that may arise before the sale either for necessary repairs or other incidentals. I think if I was going to live in the house forever then paying down the principal to reduce interest payments would make sense. Since I want to sell in five years I think the amount of money I'd need to put into the principal to make a difference in that time is better in a liquid form rather than tied up in a mortgage I'll need to pay to get out of anyway. I figure the cash will do more good in my pocket than with the mortgage lender, at least until closing time if anyone actually decides to buy my jumbo sized but much less fashionable ""tiny house.""

Does that seem right or am I missing something that would be better? Thanks!

btc,Lighting network tx fees breakdown,"Lighting network is assumed to have ~0 tx fees by the people on both sides (even developers who obviously know nothing about economics) so I will try to model LN fees.

With on-chain transactions it's pretty simple, fees are calculated per transaction bytes, if user submits 100KB of transactions he will pay 10 times more then making 10KB txs.

With LN it's a bit different. User will pay same fees weather he makes 0 or million tx-s. What do matter is maximum amount for his payment channel and lifetime of that channel. So if user opens channel that he can receive up to 100 btc it will cost him 10 times more then if he opens channel for up to 10 btc.

LN network is composed from:

1. LN nodes

2. LN users

So LN users will have to lock their funds, pay fees for 2 on-chain transactions (open channel and close channel) and second fee they pay is to LN node.

To determine how much fees users will have to pay their LN nodes we need to asses what are LN node operation costs.
LN node operation cost breakdown:

1. Nodes have to allocate and lock their own funds for each user (that is maximum amount user can receive before closing channel).

2. Nodes have to allocate funds to form payment channels with other nodes. Smaller nodes will also have to pay bigger nodes but let's ignore that for now...

3. Nodes have to move all funds from cold wallets, those funds must be online 24/7 and all private keys must be sitting on server in order to sign transactions at any moment for their users.

Ok so going trough these 3 points question is how much does nodes expect to earn in interest per year. They need to lock down funds, it is similar as when users hold money in the bank so some interest is expected for that maybe 1% but they also need to invest money to secure node (it must hold all private keys) and calculate in risk of theft. I personally would not move private keys from cold wallet to online server no matter how ""secure"" it is but let's say some ppl choose to act as nodes. They would have to invest in their own data centers with armed guards and other safety protocols as that would be big money (nodes by definition will have to put more funds then all users combined)

Given those points interest rate per year that nodes expect could be let's say 24% annually or 2% per month. Lets say that on-chain transaction fee is 1$.

So if user joins LN and opens channel for 1 month to send/receive up to 10000$ it will cost him:

1. 2$ for 2 on-chain transactions

2. 200$ for LN node interest rate (2% of 10000$)

That means in this fictional scenario if user has more than 202 txs it will payoff to be part of LN network and if user has less than 202 txs he is better off with on-chain txs.

I purposely avoided some additional factors just to make things simple and I don't claim these number would be even remotely accurate but rough formula is correct.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How to best pay off a 0% interest debt (46k),"I have a loan of 46k with 0% interest, fixed for the next 5 years. In 5 years the interest rate will be set again - but it could just stay at 0%. Yes, it's a pretty good deal. 


I have minimum payment of 300/month, so that is what I do now. However, I have the financial bandwith to contribute 500/month more to paying off the loan. 


My thinking is now: it is more sensible to put that 500/month into a savings/investing account to get 1-4% return on the money, versus putting it directly towards the loan. Does it make sense to do this, at least for the 5 years where my interest is 0%? I can just build the 500/month fund for 5 years, get some returns on it through savings/investing and then pay off the 46k at once (leaving me the 5-years of profit from the 1-4% return).

I just want some other opinions on the long-term outlook from people who are probably much more experienced than I am.

Where my optimism comes from, besides the two points mentioned above, is the future earnings potential banks have due to the hefty cost cutting that's taken place for the last 6 years. If banks can increase their revenue after some deregulation happens, I can see solid earnings coming for the next few years. But then again I'm still quite inexperienced so I may be completely wrong.

Do you guys think this sounds reasonable for long term growth, or do you think the markets have already priced it in completely?

personalfinance,Saving for a downpayment - what could we be doing better?,"My fiancé and I are currently living together for going on 2 years and are getting married this October. We are hoping to buy a house in spring of 2018, as our lease will end June 1st (we're renewing our lease here for another year).

Here's a breakdown of our income and spending:

He makes 55k, I make 45k. I also have unlimited overtime I can take advantage of, and I have been doing so. His paychecks are roughly 1500 and mine are roughly 1300. We both contribute to our 401Ks. I contribute 5% and he does 10%.

Our rent is $1040 per month (2 bed townhouse plus pet rent for 3 pets). Our expenses are around $1500 per month (gas, electric, groceries, car/renters insurance, cell phones, cable+internet, eating out, gas, etc). 

My student loans are $250 per month. I'm currently refinancing from a 5.7% interest rate to 3.5%. I do not have a car payment as I own my 2006 Sonata outright. His student loans are $500 a month and he pays $350 for his car. He just refinanced his car loan down to 10%, but should we look into refinancing that again with me cosigning? His credit score is around 695 or so, and mine is somewhere around 760.

We currently have about $6000 in our joint savings, $5000 in a betterment account, and about $1000 between us in personal savings accounts.

We also currently put all expenses on our credit cards for the miles/cash back. We have $0 credit card debt between us and pay our balances in full every month.

We are trying to save for a down payment for a house. Does anyone have any thoughts as to what we could be doing better? I know I included a lot of info here, but please let me know if I missed anything important or if more detail is needed somewhere. We are cutting out cable and switching to sling once our contract is up. We are also limiting how much we each out per month and we don't generally make too many frivolous purchases (We've bought ourselves a new doormat and shower curtain in 2017, that's about it). 

We think we can probably save about $15,000 by the time we are looking to buy. We were considering borrowing money from my parents (about 15k) so we have about a 20% down for a $150,000 house. Is borrowing money from them and paying them interest (Edit-roughly 3%) a better idea than paying mortgage insurance?

Edit- Rough breakdown of expenses. Thanks for the ideas everyone!

Electric-$75 

Phone-$180 (I pay $60, he pays $120-could combine)

personalfinance,[19F] I want to attend college in the US. Advice?,"I’m a high school graduate in South Korea, looking to go to university in the US.

Relevant info about me:

Born in America, moved to Korea in 2011, dual citizenship Female Didn’t apply to Korean universities last year. (If I do stay in Korea for uni, I would be applying this summer.) Shit high school grades

If I go to America, location is very important. LA sounds good but expensive. I’m like super adjusted to city life like Seoul. I wouldn’t want to live in the suburbs but I guess going to the suburbs there is better than staying in Korea. If my financial situation won’t allow me to live in a city then it’s fine.

Interested into going into IT. Wouldn’t really be able to go into Korean college for IT stuff because Korea’s system is weird.

My tentative plan is to go to community college and then transfer to a 4 year University once I get enough credits. I’ll get a part time job while attending community college (not like everyday though, gotta focus on studies too). I’m thinking LA is good for part time jobs because of Korea Town, but not sure if the cons outweigh the benefits.

Parents can’t afford to financially support me going to America. Korea will be significantly cheaper because I wouldn’t have to pay for rent and most food. If I work part-time until the Feb/March intake of 2018, I’d be able to save about 4000USD. Also, I calculated the amount of aid I can get using the FAFSA 4Caster and the results are: 
Federal Pell Grant : $5,920 
Federal work study : $1,465 
Direct Stafford Loan : $5,500 
Total : $12,885

I’m not sure how accurate it is since I got the parental income details from my dad, but he said he hasn’t reported/filed(?) it for three years. He had a business but they filed for bankruptcy and he hasn’t had a steady job since then so he’s been doing part time jobs and he just told me to enter $14k.

Questions I have:

 1. Are there other forms of financial aid, grants and loans outside of the FAFSA 4Caster that would help fund my education/living in the US?

 2. Alternatives to LA based on my preferences of a city lifestyle, universities with Computer Science/Federal Work-Study, cost of living

personalfinance,Car Loan Advice?,"First post here!

Okay so I have a loan on my car. 14.9% interest. I'm 21 and it's my first loan ever. Originally it started at $7,500 and I've got it down to $1,800 in only 20 months. (5yr loan).

personalfinance,Should I apply for a new credit card or a loan?,"My situation: 
I'm planning to make a relatively large purchase (10% of annual income) that I'm not used to, and I'm not sure on what road I should take to save some money AND increase my credit score. I've been considering applying for 1) a ""preselected"" 0% intro APR Cash Rewards credit card (CC) with my banking institution or 2) financing with whoever I end up buying the product from. To my understanding, the CC would save me the most money (because of cash rewards, 0% APR for 15mo, $100 bonus cash reward after $500 spent within 90 days, and 10% reward bonus if I put my cash rewards into my checking or savings account). However, different types of credit (like financing/loans?) would increase my credit score in the long run and I havn't taken out a loan besides my student loans. The things that are preventing me from getting the new credit card outright is that I'm not sure my new credit limit would be enough to completely cover the expense of the product (if I'm even approved) and I'm not sure I can responsibly pay it off within a single month (which would hurt my credit score because of the large outstanding balance on the card). I don't get the loan outright because the CC rewards intrigue me and the potential loan Interest rate scares me. 


My Credit History: 
700+ FICO based on Discover credit check. Never missed a payment and never been late. Balance carried over month to month on both of my cards is below 10%. Current student loan balance is about the same as my current annual income, but I'm not expected to pay until a year from now. 


My income is below average, but I own two credit cards; my most recent is from 3 months ago. I have a 3 year history with my other one. Both CC limits are above what I expect to spend on the product I have in mind. The 3 month-old card is a department store card with 14-16% APR that I rarely use. The 3 year-old card is the Discover, which I use for literally everything I can. I make multiple payments throughout the month to keep the balance % low on both and I don't spend more than I have in the bank.


Last things to consider:
1)This next purchase is necessary. I wouldn't consider it if it wasn't. 
2)This next purchase is more than what I have in the bank, so I don't believe I can pay it off within a month or even 6 months. It's possible, but risky, to say I can pay it off within 12 months. 
3) I am open to any other suggestions or advice.

personalfinance,Did I Screw Up My Salary Negotiation,"So, as I mentioned in another post I just accepted working at a new position. It's my first ""real"" job. I know it's dumb to worry about know, but I can't help wondering if I underbid during salary negotiations.

Here's the context: A few weeks ago I applied for a position at another company as a software developer. I would have been a contractor at NIH. The interview went really well, and when they asked me for a salary I told them 80k because I had about a years worth of experience doing research in the field I'd be working in. I know it was on the high side, but I wanted to be able to negotiate down. They tell me that the last person only made 65k, and that they had a masters (I only have a BA), but they thought I could get 70 if I asked for it. I did, and the day I expect to hear back about an offer they tell me that the company is scrapping the platform and that they decided not to fill the position. Well...

Fast forward a few weeks, and I get an email from another company asking me to interview for a very similar position, likewise as a contractor at NIH. I interview and it goes very well, and they also ask me for my salary. I had been told that contractors for the federal government don't make as much as those in the private sector, and was warned not to sell myself too high from family. I'm not sure if that was the best advice. Anyway, I told them that I wanted 75-80, but that I was flexible because I understood it was a contracting job. (Also, during this time the original company contacted me to say they were reopening the position and that it was basically mine if I wanted it, but they would only give 65). When company B offered me the job they gave me 68, which I negotiated up to 69 because I didn't need healthcare. I guess I'm worried that I could have gotten more if I'd played hardball. They reached out to me, and were very impressed with my qualifications. OTOH, everyone else at the company has a phD in machine learning, while I only have a BA. I was unemployed and living with my parents, so I was admittedly desperate for work (which I know is a bad position to negotiate from). I'd also been living in Iowa for the last 4 years, so I wasn't sure what an ""appropriate"" salary for the area would look like. Did I screw up by not pushing harder for a higher salary?",finance

personalfinance,PhD and Living Situation: Need Advice on Renting or Buying on a Limited Income w/ Savings,"Hi! I am a prospective PhD student at a university in VA. I am single and would be making about ~24,000/year with the possibility to earn more at some points. I will have to go on research trips abroad during this time period, with the possibility of limited outside funding. I will be living in this area for 5 years, at minimum, and up to 7 years.

Debts: I currently have a car payment of about ~200/month. Cell phone bill, usual utility needs. I have around ~10,000 in deferred federal student loans from undergrad. I have a credit card which I pay the balance of monthly. I have Excellent credit. 
Savings: I have ~41,000 in the bank from an inheritance I have received.
Future: After completion of my PhD program I plan on applying for jobs as a Professor. I may also be able to pursue government and NGO work with my language skills and research history if that does not work out. 

Housing: I have primarily been looking at condos/townhouses/apartments. My problem is that because it is a college town there are very few properties around what I perceive to be my budget based off of calculators (~100,000). My preferred plan is to get a multibedroom apartment and out room(s) to other students/young professionals, but these types of residences would be above what I could necessarily afford with the loans calculators seem to think I am qualified for.. While I recognize this puts other responsibilities on me, it would also give me additional income. I also am aware that I may need to factor in HOA costs, general maintenance and repair, etc. 

I do have family that may be interested in investing in the property with me, but it would be up to whether they offer when I explain what my plans are. I am not taking this as a given. With my current finances, is buying a good idea? I have a LOT of financial anxiety and the idea of wrapping up my inheritance makes me very nervous but it seems better than letting it sit and sinking ~36,000-50,000 in rent (assuming I am able to get an apartment at the median rent cost of $600) over the course of 5-7 years. 

I'm still in the preliminary phases of thinking through this, but I should be hearing back from other PhD programs and able to make my final decision soon (so far I have only been accepted to this school and anticipate this being my only acceptance) and begin working on living and moving arrangements. I do already have most furniture/kitchen appliances/etc that I would need. 

I really appreciate any feedback/guidance that I can receive from this community. I don't have many people I can turn to that I believe I can trust (hence the use of a semi-throwaway, too). Only certain people in my life even know of my inheritance, so it restricts the number of people I can ask. Thank you so much!",finance

personalfinance,Need help deciding on best student loan repayment plan and tax filing status,"Hi all,
I have a question about the best loan repayment plan for my situation. I searched the subreddit and couldn't find this situation exactly. I would really appreciate any input you might be able to provide.  

**Details**:

* Graduating from MD program, will start residency in June
* Total: ~$330,000 in loans at ~6.2% interest
* Married and my spouse has no debt and made ~$45,000 last year  

I am trying to weigh the costs and benefits of the PAYE vs. REPAYE programs in order to make the best decision about how to file our taxes: married filing separately (MFS) vs. married filing jointly (MFJ). Since PAYE does not count spouse income when MFS, this would be the main advantage of this plan.  

Here is how I see the plans:  

**REPAYE/MFJ**:  
PROS:

* Negative amortization interest subsidy benefit - this would help my loans grow at a slower rate in the early goings
* Because they consider spouse income regardless of filing status, we would file jointly and get an additional * ~$2000 in tax refund this year
* Both of us can contribute max to Roth IRA  

CONS:

* Consider spouses income regardless of tax filing status, monthly payments would be bigger for this year, and substantially bigger as my income increases  

**PAYE/MFS**:  
PROS:

* Only consider your income for payment schedule if you are married and file taxes separately, $0 monthly payments for first 12 months  

CONS:

* Loans would grow at the full interest rate due to no negative amortization interest subsidy benefit
* Lose ~$2,000 in tax refund this year by married filing
* Lose ability to contribute to ROTH IRA given MFS status  

For our first year, it seems like REPAYE might be the best option as our minimum payments even with my spouses income considered is only ~$30 per month, which is less than the additional tax refund benefit plus the interest subsidy and Roth IRA. This cost/benefit ratio becomes more difficult to calculate as we progress and our shared income becomes &gt;$120,000 in later years of residency and the difference in monthly payments between PAYE and REPAYE is more like $300 vs $800.  

Is it ok to consider this a year-to-year decision and revisit the numbers next year when deciding a plan? At that point, could we theoretically decide to file separately even if we file jointly this year? Am I missing anything by thinking about the payment plans year to year rather than on a long term basis?
Thanks in advance for your input. It is much appreciated!  

**TL/DR**: Is it worth it to consider married filing separately for taxes in order to minimize loan repayments with PAYE? Is it ok to jump back and forth between filing status and payment plans based on year to year fluctuations?",finance
personalfinance,Payoff car loan at current interest rate (16.9%) or pay down enough to be above water and refinance?,"A little back story, recently out of chapter 7 bankruptcy, bought a new car (not asking for opinions on that matter, plus it's my dream car and I plan on keeping it for as long as i possibly can) with a high interest rate, it is through GM however so at least it's through a good finance company.

financialindependence,Buying a townhouse in 5 years,"Currently we own a condo (well, ~30% of one). We want to move closer to DT Toronto and move into a townhouse (let's say ~$1,300,000 value in 5 years). I am posting here to get some opinions on our plan.


Current Condo Value - $460,000

Current Mortgage - $315,000

Future (5 yr) Condo Value - $590,000 (assuming 5% yearly appreciation)

Future (5 yr) Mortgage - $270,000

**Equity in 5 years - $290,000 (assuming 5% realtor fees)**


Over the next five years we plan on saving for this purchase by contributing to a TFSA (30% CAN equities / 50% US equities / 20% Int. equities):

Initial TFSA amount - $19,000 

Savings over five years - $36,000 per year

**Savings in 5 years - $228,000 (assuming a 7% return, minus ~$20,000 for capital gains taxes for the amount over the TFSA limit)**

I know it's not advisable to invest funds that we want to withdraw in 5 years in equities, but we need to be aggressive to have any shot at us getting a place on its own plot of land in Toronto. If we experience another 50% drop in equities we will have to either move to the outskirts of the GTA or live in a slightly larger box in the sky.


This leaves us ~$470,000 to put down on a house in 5 years (an extra $20,000 will be added to our emergency fund due to increased future expenses and $30,000 for land transfer tax and attorney fees).


This leaves us a $2,200 bi-weekly mortgage payment (assuming a 30 year amortization and 5.00% interest rate). This is high for our current salaries, but I am assuming that our salaries increase in the future to make this more reasonable. If they don't, then I guess we will have to lower our expectations.


We would still save for retirement:

Company-matched RRSP contributions (combined) - $11,300/ year (this is including company matched contributions).

Additional retirement savings - $20,000 - 30,000 (RRSP) this is the average overtime that we have done in the last few years. Also any pay raises or improvements in our savings rate would go here.

Current combined salaries - $104,000 (after tax)

personalfinance,"When filing for the FAFSA, my parents instructed me to withdraw some money from my savings and checking account, now I'm worried that I've committed a federal offense.","I'm currently a freshman at an in-state public university. For this year, and most likely other years to come, I will have to pay little to nothing in order to attend college from scholarships and grants. 

Some of these grants have come from filing the FAFSA, which I have done twice now (once in January of 2016 for my freshman year that started in August, and later in October 2016 for my sophomore year that will start next August).

The major grant I received from the FAFSA was the Pell Grant, amounting in over $5,000. This makes sense given my parents current financial status; they are local entrepreneurs, whose business is tanking. I believe that the information they gave me regarding their parental contributions was correct because of the lifestyle I was brought up living; my mother was very modest and stingy, and focused heavily on saving our money for college because she and my dad would most likely not be able to pay for my post-secondary education at all. Because of this, I worked two or three jobs at a time from the age of fourteen, but that still hasn't been enough to pay for all of a four-year degree.

Because of this, I believe my parents instructed me to do the following, and helped me do so: they withdrew money from my savings and checking accounts a few weeks before I filed my FAFSA, leaving about $1,000 total between both accounts so my expected financial contribution would be lower. They wanted me to save the money I had worked for and keep it in case of an emergency, like their business failing and we are become homeless, (which some months seems very real). Now that I've done the FAFSA twice, this makes the withdraws of money not included in the FAFSA around $8,000 dollars. This money is supposedly stored in a safety deposit box (that is a relative's box who I believe knows the situation) inside of an envelope with my name on it.

I didn't realize that this was probably a very bad thing to be doing until thinking it through. I was only doing what I thought was right because that's what my parents told me to do, and I didn't think the money I had accumulated would make a difference in my FAFSA. I'm very worried that this could be a federal offense, and I have no idea what to do. Do I report it? Will I lose my money? Could I go to jail? What happens if I don't report it and get caught? 

Theoretically, I could pay for a semester or two of college if I had to, and I don't mind working during school especially if I need the money, but I don't know how to even confront my parents about this. 

tl;dr
My parents withdrew money from my accounts to make my financial contribution on the FAFSA be smaller so I could potentially get more money/save the money I worked for in case of an emergency. Is this a problem, and if so, how do I fix this, and what kind of punishment could I be facing?",finance
personalfinance,Turbotax filing questions,"Okay this is going to be kinda long.
I am 17, full time student, working part time, received my W-2 form a few months ago, was told to file it to get a tax refund. So I looked around and was recommended TurboTax by one of my co-worker to file my tax electronically and easily.

I finished through TurboTax's guide and filed it electronically a few weeks ago, received my federal tax refund, state refund still not yet received.

Of course as you might have guessed, if I am 17, then I am most likely living with at least another adult, I do, and I most likely am have an adult co-sign my health care insurance plan, and I do.

So now today, after my dad went to a tax preparer of sorts and showed the agent my tax return form that I e-filed (downloaded digitally from Turbo Tax), he pulled up and that my dad is(or will) somehow owe over $7000 (other fees not included)in penalty fee due to me filing my tax as an independent. Ok, the first question that came in my mind when he yelled this topic at me was, what? Since when?

So I looked through my turbotax form again, and (I think, correct me if I am wrong) I found the reason, line #5, ""If someone can claim you (or your spouse if a joint return) as a dependent, check  the applicable box(es) below and enter the amount from the worksheet on back.""

No boxes were checked, and under it, says ""If no one can claim you (or your spouse if a joint return), enter $10,350 if single"", and $10,350 was filled next to it. Ok so I think I found my issue, and my immediate question was still, what? I was never shown this by TurboTax nor was I asked about this, I don't even have any memory of writing(typing) down $10,350, especially where it asks this specific question. So my dad says that because *I* ""claimed"" myself independent, that screwed him over because they'd think that he tried to cheat, and I understand that that makes sense.

The second thing my dad yelled at me was that I did not file anything about my health insurance coverage, I do remember being asked about having health coverage or not by TurboTax, and I did click yes for all year round and that was it, there was nothing else, TurboTax says that that's done with Health, so I am not sure what he meant by this, no numbers, no value. My dad does co-sign my health insurance.

Now I went around and looked a bit and figured that I now have to make ""amend"" to my filed taxes. My dad says I must receive both my federal AND state return in order to fix it(is it true?), I've only received the federal tax refund and not state, TurboTax status says that it is accepted on both however. Does making amend tax return files need to have both federal and state tax refund money received first?

Also, how do I *properly* make amend for my tax return? Can you make multiple amends?

personalfinance,Need help in deciding what to do with some cash/home/investments,"Background:
I'm a 31 year old male, married. I make about 115k a year and my wife makes about 70k. I put about 11% (matched by my company) of my pay into my 401k and wife puts combined with the wife, we're at about 400k. We have about 20k in cash savings which i consider untouchable. I have about 50k in company stock which is vested throughout various periods. I have about 80k in other assets (described below and subject of my question).

We bought a home in 2015 and we currently owe 300k, with the house worth about 470k. I lease my vehicle and my wife owns hers but owes about 20k. We have no credit card debt. Wife owes about 10k in student loans.

My question:
The other assets that I mentioned above are collectibles that I have accumulated throughout the years. They are fairly liquid and could sell them fairly quickly at about a 10-15% loss of their current value (due to fees and whatnot). Over the years, they have proven to grow fairly substantially (some well over 300%) but I feel like having so much money tied up could be dangerous. 

I've been considering selling these assets lately but i'm not sure what to do with the cash.

Scenario A (my preferred) would be to use to the cash and pay off some principal on the house. Ideally, I would love to bring the monthly payment down but I can't do that without refinancing since I have a fixed rate mortgage. I'm not sure a refinance at this point would be smart since interest rate would be higher than what i currently have (3.5). 

Scenario B would be to pay off some principal thus lowering the number of years on the loan. I do envision staying at this home for a long time.

Scenario C would be to add an addition to the house, I would add a master bed/bath. I envision having to do this regardless, now or later as I plan on having my mom living with us in a few years (3-6) from now. This would increase the home value and would recover close to 100% of the investment in the case we had/wanted to sell.

Scenario D would be to leave the assets in question alone and let them grow or shrink (its a gamble really).

Scenario ??

I'm not really sure what to do here. My biggest worry about the mortgage is having such a high payment that if I lose my job or my wife losses hers then we would struggle to pay it and our other monthly obligations. Halfing the mortgage would really easy my mind. Any suggestions are welcome.",finance

* How do I know if that incentive is still available? I was reading that they expire after a certain number of uses on a per-manufacturer basis. 
* How do I know if I am eligible to receive this tax benefit?
* How is that benefit applied? Reduction of gross income? Straight-up rebate/return when I file for taxes next year?
* Is this a poor decision to make with ""real EV"" technology improving and EVs becoming cheaper ever year? (I'm thinking of depreciation which my current vehicle has already taken the brunt of since I bought it used)

## Musings:
1. Based on mortgage calculator estimates, every $1 against the principle saves us a $1 in interest effectively doubling the investment. Naturally, this will change as the remaining principle decreases over the years.
2. The tax implication is complicated and we're consulting our tax advisor.
3. Exercise extreme caution on market predictions, especially private companies that may or may not go IPO with no market equivalents.
	1. The company is already an [hyper-unicorn](http://www.dr4ward.com/.a/6a00e54fd9f059883301b8d1942864970c-pi) over $10B in valuation.
	2. The company will almost certainly not be a hyper-unicorn worth over $60B.
	3. The company's future is most likely bounded between $15B and $60B.
	4. The company would need to more than double to beat the mortgage interest savings ie &gt;$30B which is extremely challenging but has happened multiple times with the founder.
	5. Using linear extrapolation, which provides a high correlation coefficient with conservative growth estimates, it would take 7 years to double. A reminder that extrapolation is naughty and misleading.
	6. Arguably, the mortgage savings would double over the lifetime of the mortgage (10 years with this additional investment).
	7. It is common for stocks of this class to bubble-inflate at IPO beyond their core financial fundamentals.
4. The tax implications are confusing.

In summary, we could reap a larger reward if we hold the ISO for several more years at a risk. However, the guaranteed upside of paying down the mortgage early is compelling. The scary unknown is the tax implication which is clouding the situation.",finance

We dont even use the credit cards anymore, just keep them open for credit score purposes.  
  
So my question is; is it smart to try to consolidate the two credit card debts into one personal loan, using our house as collateral; refinance our house to a lower interest rate and roll the CC debt into that; or continue paying off like we are now, a little more than the minimum?

I have an account with TIAA-CREF through my employer, where I have a 403(b) and a pension. I am contributing the maximum for my Roth 403(b) so that by the end of this year it'll reach $18,000. I am also contributing 5% into my pension and my employer contributes 10%. The problem is I have no idea how to pick a fund that will aggressively invest my money. Of course I know it should be a fund with more stocks, but there are so many to choose from! Also, does anyone have any experience with TIAA? Are they high or low fees, good or bad?



Second, I want to set up a Roth IRA and contribute $5.5k into that but don't know how to go about it. I know I have to open a new account... Should I stick with TIAA (all in the same place) go with someone else (maybe TIAA isn't my best choice)? I keep reading index funds match the performance of mutual funds but have less fees. Can someone suggest where I should open my account?



Third, I am building an emergency fund - should I set a goal of a certain amount (like $10k) and then put my money elsewhere? Otherwise, I would just be letting the bank account rise... I was thinking either a house downpayment fund (I live in a very high COL area) or investing in stocks. On top of this, I am paying off $8.5k in student loans. The interest rate is roughly 6%. My goal is to have this paid off in around 12 months.



I would appreciate any advice on direction or strategy, and where to put my money...Which fund do I choose from, where should I open my Roth IRA, what do I do after I've hit my emergency fund goal, paid off my student loans, and contributed max towards retirement?

investing,After March 15 everything might collapse!,"On March 15 trump will have to negotiate and raise the debt ceiling or face collapse!

""President Trump will have to deploy “extraordinary” measures in two weeks to avoid a default on the debt if Congress does not move to raise the federal borrowing cap, a little-recognized deadline that could expedite his showdown with Congress over taxes and spending.""

“I think what people are missing is this date, March 15th 2017.  That’s the day that this debt ceiling holiday that Obama and Boehner put together right before the last election in October of 2015.  That holiday expires.  The debt ceiling will freeze in at $20 trillion.  It will then be law.  It will be a hard stop.  The Treasury will have roughly $200 billion in cash.  We are burning cash at a $75 billion a month rate.  By summer, they will be out of cash.  Then we will be in the mother of all debt ceiling crises.  Everything will grind to a halt.  I think we will have a government shutdown.  There will not be Obama Care repeal and replace.  There will be no tax cut.  There will be no infrastructure stimulus.  There will be just one giant fiscal bloodbath over a debt ceiling that has to be increased and no one wants to vote for.”

I work 90%+ from home in a room I have dedicated for my office.  My company does have a local office in which we will sometime go work at if we have a meeting/etc.  It is our choice to work from home however.

When working on my taxes, HR Blocks website advises I do not qualify for home office deductions because my employers offers an office to work at.  However, when using TurboTax is allows me to enter deductions (internet costs, utilities, etc).

The difference in refund is about $100 when you factor in HR will file both federal and state for free and TurboTax is charging me for both.

personalfinance,"Just recently got offered a job, need advice on planning what to do.","Hi r/PersonalFinance! I read a few articles and wiki pages (and saw the flowcharts) and I think perhaps some more nuanced advice might be helpful for me. Here's some info, I hope it will be sufficient:

I'm 26, I graduated on December 2016 in Florida and was recently offered a minimum six month contract job at $26 an hour in Florida (with expected overtime between five to eight hours a week and unlimited OT hours the closer the company gets to a deadline). 

I start mid March. I know for a fact this job is 40 hours a week and there ***will*** be overtime given the industry that I work in. (I just can't predict the specific amount of OT that I will work.)

* My current savings account has $7000.

* Estimated six month rent is expected to be $3000 since I intend to live with roommates (I have contacted and spoken with them, they both work at the same company and we will be on the same dev team). Monthly rent is $500 a month.

* Estimated six month utilities are $600. Monthly would be $100.

* Estimated six month gas expenses are $240 over the next six months (I live about 10 minutes away from HQ and I estimate I'll refuel once every three weeks which equates to eight refuels across six months). 

* Estimated six month grocery expenses are $1200. ($200 a month)

* Estimated dining out expenses are unknown as my friends who work there always have a weekly meetup at a small cafe near HQ. I intend to order something small just to not feel left out. I apologize for being unable to be more specific with this particular unknown variable.

* Health insurance is under my parents' plan, but the coverage is assumed to end when I turn 27 this August. This is another unknown variable.

* Adding the known estimated costs, the amount of money I'd be spending would be about $5040 over six months. However, the unknown costs (health insurance and dining out expenses) are what worry me.

What I really want to do (and I know this is really hard to do given the info provided) is to start planning and saving for retirement. I'm contemplating on opening a Roth IRA. 

As a contractor, the contracting company offers savings plans through New York Life (the brochure specifically mentions 401k plans) and I have no clue how to read or understand much of the information (aside from doing some quick research on Morningstar ratings). I don't know if I should take screenshots of the plans offered (or if that's even a good idea), but I just want some advice on how to proceed.  

I have been doing small research over the years and I do know that I should most likely open a Vanguard account.

personalfinance,Why have a beginner emergency fund?,"My wife and I have about $6,000 in credit card debt. Last year our income was $29,000. This year our income will be over $50,000 thanks to a very unexpected promotion for one of us. We've been trying to put back for emergency funds and debt repayment since we started paying attention to our money and keeping up with r/pf back in September. Never expected our income would go up so quickly. So now, we've gone from having barely enough to get by, to having over a thousand left over to use each month however we want. So now here's my question... We could pay off our debt over the next 6-7 months and be out of debt completely. Why should we put back one month's expenses worth of savings before paying off this debt since it costs us more in interest every month that we don't pay it off? What if we just had a $500 emergency fund or something smaller so we could get out of debt sooner?

EDIT: I left something out. Why have an emergency fund when we're getting out of debt, rather than using the credit card that we paid off somewhat and just going back into the same debt if there were and emergency. I'm asking purely from a mathematical standpoint, not a peace of mind kind of question. 

EDIT 2: Noticed I didn't include our interest rates. We're young so our interest rates are between 22-29%. 

EDIT 3: Thanks for all the advice guys! I've decided to keep a $1000 emergency fund until I pay off my high interest debt.  I'm okay with that amount of risk.",finance

personalfinance,Pay off student loan debt or contribute to Roth IRA?,"I have been doing a fair amount of research on this topic and have found a mix of answers... it seems to be almost split 50/50.

My fiance and I are both 25 years old. She is about to graduate Pharmacy school and has a lot of student loan debt. Right now it is at $255,000 (ouch) with a mix of interest rates. When she graduates and starts work in the next 3-5 months she will be making a salary of around $115,000 or more. I have recently paid off all of my debts since graduating college and have a salary of $95,000. Cumulative salary when she has a full time job for the two of us should be in the $200,000 + range. Her loans are the only debt we have. We both own our cars and currently do not own a home/have a mortgage.

We are planning on CRUSHING the student loan debt once she finishes school and starts making good money. Basically living frugally and using all of our spare $$$ to pay off the loan. We anticipate it should take us about 4 years by paying $7,000+ towards the loans at a minimum each month. After that we will save for a house.

I have a fair amount of $$$ that I am undecided on what to do with (~$15k)... I am wondering if for the tax year 2016 we should both contribute the max $5,500 to a Roth IRA account... Or I could just throw it at the loans. My concern is that once we are married (1-2 years at most) we are not going to be able to contribute to tax-advantaged IRA funds (salary over the ~$195k limit). Obviously, contributing to an IRA for the year is a 'use it or lose it' scenario for everyone but I feel this is even more the case with us given that we will likely never be able to contribute to IRA again after a year or two. We are both fortunate to have good salaries so in the grand scheme of things $11,000 of loan debt will take us only like 2 more months to cover in the future if we choose to contribute to IRA now.

What should we do? Pay off $11k worth of the debt (highest interest accounts first) or contribute to Roth IRA while we still can?

personalfinance,Thoughts on refinancing mortgage?,"We bought our house for $210,000 in 2011, putting only 5% down. We took out an FHA loan with PMI of about $200 (by now it's $175). Interest rate on the loan is 4.75%. We've been throwing money at the principle whenever possible and the principle is now $171,000. We will have a few small windfalls in the next few months and were thinking we would pay down the mortgage to $168,000 (which means we will theoretically have 20% equity of $210,000 if our home value has stayed the same) by May and refinance. The PMI is going to come off in August no matter what (our loan pre-dates the FHA loans with PMI for the life of the loan). 

I've run the numbers and the monthly payment on a 15 year loan (shaving 10 years off our mortgage) is roughly equivalent to what we pay now with PMI. Or we could do a 20 year loan which would be a lower payment than what we currently pay, and still shave 5 years off the loan. 

We intend to stay in this house as long as possible, but acknowledge life is uncertain and anything could happen.

So I guess here are our options:

- Don't refinance, get PMI removed in August, continue to pay extra towards principle.

- Refinance to 20 year loan, yielding a little wiggle room in our fixed expenses (we are thinking about baby #2 and $200 a month wouldn't hurt during the daycare years).

- Refinance to 15 year and have mortgage paid off by the time baby #1 starts college...

I'm also slightly worried our home might not appraise at the amount we paid in 2011. It's unclear to me, at any rate, based on the neighborhood. I know you should take it with a grain of salt but Zillow has our house at like $180,000.

Any advice on choosing a lender is also welcome. The rate I used for running the numbers were just based on our credit union.

Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Just finished college and wondering how I should split up my savings.,"So I'm 21 y/o and starting my first post-college job this July and I'm hoping to get some advice on how I should be structuring my savings. I will be earning $60k/year + ~$12k/year in bonuses. I'm budgeting for and expecting about $1,800/month in expenses which includes my planned discretionary spending. 

I currently have 0 debt and have been able to save up a little over $15k. I know I should put this towards my emergency fund but I'm unclear if my emergency fund should be a separate account from my savings or if it can be the same. My current savings account is just a student savings account through Chase with basically a non-existent interest rate.

Instead of a 401k match my company simply contributes 5% of my salary regardless of what I put in. However, this will not start until I have been working there for a year. I know that my other options are a Roth IRA and a standard IRA and based on what I've read I should be choosing the Roth. However, I also want to be able to buy a house within the next 2-3 years so I want to make sure I have money liquid for that.

So how should I best divide up my savings between: saving for a house, Roth/Standard IRA, 401k, and other investments I may not know about? And do I need a need a separate account for my emergency fund?",finance

Do I interrupt my investing schedule to pay this off before 1 month of interest hits, OR do I keep investing and pay it off next month?

I am a E3 in the Coast Guard and was renting a room from a man, in Annapolis MD, near the station that I work at. Around 1am this morning, I was woken up by the landlord telling me there's a fire and I need to get out of the house. The house was completely engulfed with almost everything I own in it( Social Security card, birth certificate, wallet with my CAC card and ID's, all of my clothes, the lease agreement documents, and entertainment stuff). The fire also spread to my car and engulfed that too, totaling it. I did not have renters insurance for my room, but I did have full coverage on my vehicle. 

I'm just looking to be pointed in the right direction on how to get my personal documentation things back, so I can have my identity. Also, legally, should I be covered by the landlords home-owners insurance as far as my vehicle goes, since the fire on his property destroyed my property? I'm unsure of how those things work. Not expecting anything for my personal belongings. 

My vehicle was financed, and I believe the amount owed was higher than the current value of the car. Would I be reimbursed for current value on Kelly Blue Book or value purchased?

personalfinance,Company sold - how to offset capital gains? (California),"So over a year ago I was made 5% member of an LLC in California.  We sold the company at that start of February.  So this is great.  However, I'm having to give up almost 50% of the money on tax.

Apparently I'll owe around 90k in taxes from the sale (20% Fed and 10% state).  However, the company is also paying back 1/3rd of the sale price in debt back to a parent company (that my partners are owners of...but not me).  So now I'm left with about half of what I expected.  Is there anyway I can offset or invest that $90k to avoid tax? Bonds of some sort? Some sort of 1031 exchange?

personalfinance,"Not married, both with Fed and Private Loans. Best Options for repayment.","Hello all, 

I am trying to determine the best repayment options based on my finances with my soon to be wife. We have two children together.

**Household**
I make the majority of our income as my wife stays home with our young children not old enough for schooling yet. We rent for 2150/month. In Southern California so this is typical but a good price for the house we are in. At the end of the day with all expenses we have really only been able to make our private loan costs per month. Even with a very small savings that will probably be eaten by medical costs soon.

**Federal**
My federal loans total 105,000. Her federal loans total 40,000. She is IBR at $0.00 since she works part time at night and we are not married. Nearly all she makes go to the private loans. I have deferred mine while I work out what I need to do.

**Private**
Both Navient/Sallie Mae. Our payments total over $1,000 a month. I have decent interest rates ranging from 6 to 10% while she has some loans at 11 or 12%.

**Options**
From my understanding, if we would be married my income would need to be added to her federal loans account forcing her into repayment. IBR at 0.00 is loosely considered ""payments"" as far as forgiveness goes. I spoke with Navient/Sallie Mae and Fed loans they both indicated that they do not consider other loans. i.e. Private doesnt care what Im paying for federal and vice versa. Also, it seems unfair the repayment plans do not account for SoCal housing costs. 

**Credit Worthiness**
She has the credit of above 710. No mortgage, really just credit card debts. My credit is recovering from delinquent accounts missed payments on 13 accounts since each student loan is considered an individual account. This was my fault. I thought it was in deferment while it was not. No I have 13 negative accounts for 7 years. I also have some credit card debt. Currently just over 610. Score was 720 then 410 after the delinquent accounts and now up to 610.

**Questions**
* What payment plan would be recommended for federal for me? Will speeding up marriage ease or worsen our burden?
* Refinance with SoFi? I hate sallie mae navient, they are horrible.

I am not usually one for posting on Reddit but I have pushed my personal ego and stubborn attitude aside to ask for advice/help. I'm going to try to be as specific about things as possible.
I am a 24 year old college grad, in the field of Graphic Design. I have dreams of creating youth art galleries, and things to give back to the community. But I cannot obtain these dreams quite yet..
Since the age of 15 any money I received went to my parents. My college scholarships that were in check form also went to said parents. They took thousands from me, because we were getting evicted here and there, and starving. I did everything I could in Highschool to get scholarships to college. I went to the University of New Haven CT. My parents never went to college, so I had no guidance.
I worked throughout college, saving where I could, but since my family had no money, I had to take out credit cards to buy food and books, etc. Along with grants, I had to get loans to go through school.
The total that I currently owe is over $110,000.00 with payments over $300 a month, on income driven payment plans. (The loan companies are DOE federal loan, and NAVIENT). I spoke to Navient today to remove my account info, and they said if I do, I'll owe over $800 a month just to them.
I wanted to remove my card because I recently lost my car, and had to then quit my job. So I figured I'd ask for lower/temporary no payments, and they refused. My bank account is negative.
On top of this, I support my parents. I pay the electricity and internet, as well as groceries and money occasionally.
I have made a series of decisions to help my family in trying times (under the impression I would be paid back) and it has created a deep hole of which I cannot see light.
I am looking for employment locally since I do not have a car. I am looking for employment near my boyfriend because if I get something, I can stay with him and share his car. But I legitimately fear this hole will only continue to grow over the next 10-30 years, and I will never be able to get a home. Or start a family. Or give back to the community. When I was younger I always volunteered. I can't even afford to do that now, and it has sent me into a depression.
Lastly, I attempted to start my own apparel screen printing online shop, but have not been able to market well, so as a viable income option it has yet to succeed.
I am lost, I am panicking, I am scared, and I need advice. I have been strong and giving for so long, that I have finally broken, and I need your help.

I want to apply for financial assistance through the hospital. After calling them for months, I decided to be even more proactive to avoid the bill going to collections. I had two other medical bills to pay, and I definitely cannot afford the $1,600.

""*We offer free care for emergency, or other medically-necessary, services for our patients who have:*

* *An annual family income that is less than or equal to 300% of the federal poverty level, as determined by guidelines published annually by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (FPL);*
* *A minimum medical bill account balance of $35.00, for either a single or combined accounts;*
* *Cooperated with efforts to exhaust all other payment options; and*
* *Completed a program application, and provided supporting documentation to verify income.*""

financialindependence,Question about investing in the country you want to FIRE in,"**The big question**: My wife is a Brazilian citizen and is a US Permanent Resident (green card). She works in the US and pays taxes here and does *not* pay taxes to Brazil. I am a US Citizen. All of our investments are in the US, currently. However, we want to move to Brazil eventually. We were looking into whether it made sense to start investing in Brazil with a portion of our excess income. 

Our thought process was that the interest rates are great (12%+, which is because inflation is higher of course), the Real (BRL) is pretty weak against the USD right now when looking historically, it would be nice to have some local holdings for when we travel there and eventually move there, etc. We were thinking about using Magnetis (magnetis.com.br) or Verios (verios.com.br) which are essentially Betterment for Brazil. We would probably invest ~$10-15k/yr so it wouldn't be a huge risk given how much we'd continue to invest in the US. We would essentially be hedging forex risks such that we'd have local currency to use if the BRL:USD exchange rate tanks in the next few years. 

Our big questions are: 1) Is this a good or bad idea for FIRE? 2) If so, how would PFIC impact us?

*Income*: $230k/yr, plus RSUs in a private company (may IPO in next few years, or may not!)

***Wife*** 

*Age*: 28

***Together***

*Objective*: Spend a couple years traveling and then live in Brazil to spend more time with her family.

*Risk Tolerance*: High, but not as high as gambling (i.e. blackjack). We use a risk tolerance of ""10"" for Betterment/Wealthfront like services, for example.

*Current Holdings*: $35k cash, $325k taxable investments, $200k retirement account, $250k rental property (w/ $140k mortgage), and then the RSUs. The RSUs are hard to value because the company is private, but assuming we IPO in a couple years at our latest private market valuation then I'd be looking at $2mm pre-tax. Market comps say it could be closer to 2-3x, but who knows.

*Other Assets*: $5k car

*Annual Investments*: We both max out our 401k's ($36k/yr), invest into taxable accounts ($90k/yr), pay additional mortgage principal ($5k/yr)... we have some leftover to invest more if we desire.

personalfinance,"$56k inheritance, prioritize mortgage/student loans or debt? (USA - VA)","Hello PF,

We are a family of four who live in Virginia are about to be given $14k each as part of an inheritance (after taxes, etc).

At the moment, our debts are mainly mortgage and federal student loans (one credit card with $2k on it, no car payments, etc.).


**STUDENT LOANS**

* Spouse 1’s student loans are $106,759; 2 consolidated, 2 Direct Grad PLUS, 4 Direct Loan, various interest rates but can post each specific amount and interest rate if necessary.  

* Spouse 2’s student loans are $130,028 (3x Direct Unsub Stafford Loan, 2x Student Plus Loan, 1x Direct Sub Stafford Loan, 1x Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan).  Again, various interest rates and amounts that I can post if it is helpful, though they are all federal.

Both of us are on income based repayment and are paying $0/month.


**MORTGAGE**

$265,420 Conventional without PMI at an interest rate of 3.5%.


**INCOME**

* Spouse 1 makes $43k as a federal employee and is enrolled in the public service student loan forgiveness program.

* Spouse 2 makes about $5k annually.

**Retirement accounts** are minimally funded (3%) as for our area, cost of living is extremely expensive, particularly relative to our family size.  Currently each of us (adults) have about $10k in retirement accounts.

The other two family members are babies (2 and 1), and originally the plan was to put their $14,000 inheritances directly into their 529s.  However, I am also considering putting some aside for trust funds for them to access when they are 25 (depending on how advisable that is).

*Ideally we would set aside about $5k for personal spending (new shoes, home improvement, etc.) and would like to fully fund an emergency fund with $10k but would like to allocate the rest of it as meaningfully as possible.  I’m hesitant to put anything towards paying off Spouse 1’s student loans as the likelihood is that he will have his loans forgiven after 10 years and we would only be paying the income tax on that.  Spouse 2’s student loans would be on the 25 year forgiveness plan, and we are less sure about how to tackle that.*

**So right now, our questions are:**

* What to prioritize for the adults?  Mortgage, retirement accounts, or student loans?
* Throw all money for kids into their Virginia 529s or invest elsewhere?  Trust fund?

What can I do?,"About 2 years ago my parents decided to surprise me with a new car. 2006 MX-5 that was financed in my fathers name and I was responsible to pay it. I wasn't aware of them getting a car for me neither was I there for the purchase. The car was just showed up one afternoon in the garage. Being 18 at the time and not know anything about buying a car, I went along with it. Parents know what's best for you, right?

Fast forward to about a couple of weeks ago and my sister is trying to purchase a car for herself. We start researching everything there is to buying car and how to get a good deal. Then something came to me...whatever 
deal my parents agreed on for my car is shit. 

-------------------------------------------------------------v--TL;DR--v---------------------------------------------------------------

The loan for the car was $13,814 with a interest rate of 10.32% and monthly payment of $258.17 on a 72 month term. 

What's worse is the car upside down by about $5,000. 
(I owe about $9,000 on the loan and kbb gives me a estimate of about $4,000)

At this point I have paid $7,745 with about $3,000 of that being interest. Which is kinda upsetting seeing I could of put that towards my college tuition. That being said...

1. Should I keep on going and pay it off.
2. Talk about refinancing it with my parents. Maybe putting it into my name (my credit score is 767).
3. Try to find some crazy dealer to match the loan for a trade in for a new car. I know some Mazda dealers are trying to get old MX-5 owners to trade in for the new model (probably not possible nor a good idea). 
4. None of the above...Give me your wisdom.

Someone even told me to get a small, secured installment loan to improve my credit and diversify my types of debt.

personalfinance,HELP! Married. Should we file taxes separately? Unique situation,"Hi all,
I have a question about the best loan repayment plan for my situation. I would really appreciate any input you might be able to provide. I posted this in /r/studentloans as well but didn't receive a response.

**Details**:

* Graduating from MD program, will start residency in June
* Total: ~$330,000 in loans at ~6.2% interest
* Married and my spouse has no debt and made ~$45,000 last year  

I am trying to weigh the costs and benefits of the PAYE vs. REPAYE programs in order to make the best decision about how to file our taxes: married filing separately (MFS) vs. married filing jointly (MFJ). Since PAYE does not count spouse income when MFS, this would be the main advantage of this plan.  

Here is how I see the plans:  

**REPAYE/MFJ**:  
PROS:

* Negative amortization interest subsidy benefit - this would help my loans grow at a slower rate in the early goings
* Because they consider spouse income regardless of filing status, we would file jointly and get an additional * ~$2000 in tax refund this year
* Both of us can contribute max to Roth IRA  

CONS:

* Consider spouses income regardless of tax filing status, monthly payments would be bigger for this year, and substantially bigger as my income increases  

**PAYE/MFS**:  
PROS:

* Only consider your income for payment schedule if you are married and file taxes separately, $0 monthly payments for first 12 months  

CONS:

* Loans would grow at the full interest rate due to no negative amortization interest subsidy benefit
* Lose ~$2,000 in tax refund this year by married filing
* Lose ability to contribute to ROTH IRA given MFS status  

For our first year, it seems like REPAYE might be the best option as our minimum payments even with my spouses income considered is only ~$30 per month, which is less than the additional tax refund benefit plus the interest subsidy and Roth IRA. This cost/benefit ratio becomes more difficult to calculate as we progress and our shared income becomes &gt;$120,000 in later years of residency and the difference in monthly payments between PAYE and REPAYE is more like $300 vs $800.  

Is it ok to consider this a year-to-year decision and revisit the numbers next year when deciding a plan? At that point, could we theoretically decide to file separately even if we file jointly this year? Am I missing anything by thinking about the payment plans year to year rather than on a long term basis?
Thanks in advance for your input. It is much appreciated!  

**TL/DR**: Is it worth it to consider married filing separately for taxes in order to minimize loan repayments with PAYE? Is it ok to jump back and forth between filing status and payment plans based on year to year fluctuations?",finance
personalfinance,Save for House or Pay Off Student Loans???,"My wife and I are trying to decide whether or not we want to spend the next year saving to buy a house or paying off our student loans. Here are a few things to consider:

My income: $73,000 USD base with an additional $9K variable. Wife doesn’t work, stays home with our [currently] one child.

Combined student loan debt: $47,000 with an average interest rate of 4.5%. Current payments total ~$450/month.

1 car loan: ~$12,000 at 2.9% paying $275/month.

We have no other debt and both have great credit.

We plan on living with in-laws for the next year while we start a side business. Therefore, we will have no rent and will finally have enough money to either save for a down payment on a house or pay off our debt.

A modest house in the area where we are planning to buy and settle is ~$300K. But, home values in this area continue to climb.

I understand that ideally you should pay off debt before incurring even more debt in the form of a house. But, I also don’t want to spend the next year paying off student loans and then return to renting a home (after a year with the in-laws) and have all that rent not go towards a mortgage. 

What is the best/fastest way to accomplish both buying a house and paying off student loans?

Note: Once the side business takes off there is a chance that we could do both things at the same time. However, for purposes of this conversation let’s assume I have my 1 income alone.

You done goofed guys.  You've been listening way too much to your evil overlord publishers again, AKA Sega.. or something...

I now know that you do not truly have your fingers on the pulse of gaming culture.  you are out of touch... seriously, I mean it!

Here's what people will inevitably conclude:   Real time strategy games are about having tactical and strategic options.  Having 2 or three lanes to your goal of destroying a turret limits those options.  Fine if you want to add the mode but disappointing that you do not have the other traditional modes... forgivable if your CEO didn't dismiss the criticism and state conclusively that Relic will focus on this mode.  In other words, you consider the real game modes (capture / annihilation) to be secondary / unimportant.  

You should have focused on the core game-play loop first: which we have been telling you we like for a god damn decade or so.  Do your CEOs play video games??  There's still a chance for you to fix this.  Release a dev diary with a plan on putting back the emphasis on the core game mechanics or capture and anihilation.

The purchase price for the beach property is $530k. Between putting 20% down and closing costs (I own a title company so costs should be relatively minimal), I will likely need $116k. Mortgage payment (pi/ti) on the beach property is ~$3500.

Does it make sense to use a HELOC given these circumstances? What other factors should I consider, if any? My goal is to keep my current home as an investment, income producing property and not lose out on the beach property. 

Should I just forget about the HELOC and sell my current home, using the net some or all of the net proceeds to purchase the beach property?

Any help is greatly appreciated.",finance
Forex,Forex and the Canadians,"Hey All

Yep another thread about Forex in X country.  I'm sorry to do it but things change so frequently and the search in /r/Forex didn't turn up too much.  I have a couple questions about trading from Canada I hope some vets may be able to chime in on.
 

**Broker:**

I've often heard that PepperStone was the go to, but alas, no longer accepts Canadians.  Does anyone have any experience with another registered broker?    Is IC Markets the next in line for my money?  I currently have a small live account with them to verify I can deposit as a Canadian, but am hesitant to open a larger position there with fear of not getting it back.

Going with a broker govern'd by ASIC, am I even protected as a Canadian Citizen?

**Alberta:**

I've read that Albertans have some different rules to play by when it comes to FOREX.  Does anyone have any info/experience with this?  I honestly can't find much about it.

**Taxes:**

Yes I know, get a tax advisor/accountant.  And I will be, but can anyone share some basics on how this works?  If I withdraw $50k CAD from my broker, how does this impact me on tax season?  Just a basic example.

**Incorporating (Start a business)**

Should I look to invest through a business rather than personal?  Will it help with writing off losses, training, travel, etc?

Thanks for your time everyone.  If there is anything I may be overlooking as a newbie please pip(e) up!   

Cheers.


**UPDATE following a chat with a rep at ASC...**

(This is how I understood the conversation, I advise you to call and get the same info)

* It's not illegal for you to be trading FOREX within Alberta.  You wont get a fine for taking profits and you won't be audited following tax season for claiming those profits.   ASC is simply not in the business of protecting people who enter the FOREX market as there is ALOT of fraudulent activity.  

*  Other provinces are starting to follow Albertas lead and see why Alberta went this way in the first place.

*  Because it isn't ""Permitted"" to trade FOREX in Alberta, your position could be liquidated by a broker if they decide to adhere to Albertas/Canadas rules.  You could still open an account with a broker but if they decide to change their stance, you could be exiting the market much faster than you expect.

*  Losing money in Forex does not allow you write it off as a Capital Loss, incorporated or not.  But of course the Feds will tax you on your profits.  Putting this money through your business essentially allows it to be taxed twice as well (Business and Personal) so you better be doing well!

* Foreign market regulators do not protect you as a Canadian citizen.  If you get screwed over by (insert foreign regulated broker here), oh well.",finance

I am in know way saying Brexit will cause it but Britain will be out on its own with no support from the ECB. Maybe this will make Britain a much nimbler economy able to better react to such an economic shock, or perhaps it will provide to little leverage to be able to turn the situation around, especially given that the interest rates in the UK have remained low in what should be for all intent and purpose a rising rate environment. This low BOE base rate gives little ammo to help re invigorate a limp economy.

The idea is to take out a line of credit at a higher interest rate than your mortgage, use some of it to pay down your principle to save on interest paid, then start paying back the loan and continue with normal payments. Their example was to take out $25000, use $15000 to pay down principle on your mortgage and save on interest. Then pay back the $15k over 6 months and repeat. On a $300k house with 30 year mortgage, at 6% interest on mortgage and 7% on heloc, you save over $60k doing this (according to their numbers) but when I asked what would happen if instead of taking a loan, I paid $2500 extra to principle each month? They didn't have the numbers, but assured me that it would still save 10s of thousands of dollars to use the heloc method. Am I missing something? Does this method actually work/make sense? If it does, why isn't it more popular? 

They also showed a video by Mark Kohler, it was about taxes and paying your kids through your small business so that you can write off the money, and it can go into a savings account for them or they can use it to pay for school lunches, clothes, etc. It sort of made sense, but I was skeptical/unsure of what to believe was allowed and what's not. Wouldn't the kids need to provide a service? How would that be valued? He also said you don't pay them as employees, but as an outside service. Could anybody explain that to me?

Thank you for any and all help!

Hello Reddit! We are Sylvia Daunert, Suzana Hamdan, and Irena Pastar of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. In February 2017, we published our research in ACS Central Science, an open access journal, entitled [“Nanotechnology-Driven Therapeutic Interventions in Wound Healing: Potential Uses and Applications](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.6b00371)”  We look forward to answering your questions about this research today!


To introduce ourselves, alphabetically by surname:


I am Sylvia Daunert and I am the Lucille P. Markey Chair of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, as well as the Associate Director of the Dr. JT Macdonald Biomedical Nanotechnology Institute at the University of Miami. My group’s research focuses on the development of bio-inspired nanotechnologies to solve biomedical and environmental problems. We genetically engineer living cells and proteins for environmental detection, molecular sensing, molecular diagnostics, point-of-care tests, biomarker identification, and targeted and responsive drug delivery. We recently developed a nanocarrier-based method for the targeted delivery of stem cells for wound healing. The technology, while widely applicable to a variety of wounds, was first demonstrated in diabetic wounds and in animal models of corneal and retinal injury. I was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Michigan, and awarded my Ph.D. in bioanalytical chemistry at the University of Barcelona in Spain.


I am Suzana Hamdan and I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Daunert Research Group at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. My current research interests focus on the biological studies of nanomaterials derived from pharmaceutical drugs. In fall 2007, I received a Master of Science degree from East Tennessee State University, and was awarded a Ph.D. degree in May 2015 from the chemistry department at Louisiana State University. During my graduate studies, I developed novel techniques for size-control of nanoparticles derived from organic salts, and designed molecularly imprinted polymeric nanoparticles for chiral recognition of biological targets. I am currently the author of eight published scientific papers, with a special focus on nanotechnology and analytical chemistry fields.


I am Irena Pastar and I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Miami, Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery. Our department has developed an unique wound healing research program focused on understanding the nature of non-healing wounds at the cellular and molecular levels. We have also been active in a variety of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials evaluating bioengineered products, drugs, dressings and devices important to wound repair. After receiving my Ph.D. in molecular microbiology and completing a postdoctoral fellowship in immunology at the Rockefeller University, I pursued translational research in cutaneous wound healing. My research focuses on the molecular pathophysiology of chronic wounds and cutaneous infections. I am a leading investigator and co-investigator on multiple federal and industry sponsored studies on novel wound healing therapeutics and chronic wound pathogenesis.

But! Interest rates are creeping up. By november we may be looking at 1% higher rates or so, depending on what the Fed does. So would it make more sense for me to go ahead and do it ASAP?

Forex,"USD ""Pricing in the interest rate Theory""","So we talked about this last week with the whole ""interest rate gets priced in before the announcement"" I understand that it gets priced in before. I also understand if this happens then the interest rate announcement will not have a large effect unless it's a bigger rate hike than expected.

As of Friday I saw a few Fed hike calculators were saying a 90-98% chance of a hike from 30% in the beginning of the same week. 

Now, my brain works using logic and common sense so when I try to think of where or when the markets would price in the interest rate I think ""Well they wouldn't price in an interest rate hike if the likelihood of it happening is low, right?"".  Why would you spend the effort and time and resources moving price to factor in something that has low odds of occurring?  So if this were the case I would assume the market was pricing in no rate hike up until the point where the chance of it happening began to rise significantly.

So back to my brain and it's thoughts on this price being factored in.  Since the probability flipped 180 as of Friday (Yellen being the all knowing one) I would assume the market would want to factor in the interest rate hike before it happens. And there being only one week to do this(this week) is naturally and logically assume that the USD will be bullish this week. 

I came up with this theory on Friday, I was already long USD but so far this week I'm seeing that so far I am correct in my assumptions. I do know about the Nonfarm Payroll on Friday along with unemployment and I do know this is a big player in the hike decison, but seeing as it is on Friday I think that the dollar will still be bullish until that announcement with that announcement being the possible reversal point.  

I will remain long USD until either Friday or the rate hike (most likely the rate decision).

Thoughts and theories are welcome my tinfoil hat is always ready.

My mother and father divorced a while ago. She has about 48,000$ in savings. She is not eliglible for pension, she was a housewife all her life. 49 years old now, so she has 16 more years until retirement, unfortunately because of health issues she couldn't really work, but now she's getting better and in time may be able to work somewhere.

She has a house and a car, and no debt at all, but also no income, with about 500$ monthly expenses. In time if she can go and work, part of the problem will be solved. My question is what is it she could do with the 48,000$ saving she has.

 If she just puts it in the bank, it is around 2 or 3% interest rate at max annually, which is very low. She is very cautious about her money, because she already lost 20,000$ in a brokerage firm fraud, and probably never get it back, so she's not very fond of the stock market now. 

Main goal would be save a bigger chunk of the money for her retirement, and a smaller one to make some money annually she could get out.

personalfinance,"Tax Tuesday help for a guy with a small IRA, and a decent bit of debt!","I currently have a Fidelity Rollover IRA from my previous employer’s 401K, with only $770 in the account. I owe several thousand in student loans that I would very much like to see paid off, and with my current employer’s 401K being much more substantial than my previous one, I do not have a need for the rollover IRA (especially as how I can not invest in Fidelity’s mutual funds with less than $2,500.) 

What is the best way to withdraw all that money from that account, and use it towards my student loan? I make just around 40K a year, so my research has led me to believe I will be withdrawing $770, -15% for my tax bracket, and -10% for the early withdrawal, leaving me with approximately $577.50. I am perfectly fine with that.

Fidelity has an option to withhold a percentage for me, for the taxes.

&gt;Important Federal Tax Withholding Information: Pursuant to IRS requirements, Fidelity will withhold 10% from your gross IRA distribution (except Roth IRA distributions) unless you elect otherwise. Regardless of your withholding election, you are responsible for the full payment of any federal income taxes, any state or local taxes and any penalties that may apply to your distribution. You may be responsible for estimated tax payments and could incur penalties if your estimated tax payments are not sufficient. Federal tax will not be withheld from a Roth IRA distribution unless you elect otherwise. Due to unique withholding requirements, online IRA distributions are not available to non-resident aliens. A written withholding notice can be requested by calling Fidelity at 800-544-6666.

 If I do that and select 15%, will the withheld funds go directly to the IRS, or will I need to report that, or pay that in some way? I just want to know how much of the $770 I can put towards the loans, and how exactly to report it on my taxes. Ideally, I would like to send the money immediately to the IRS, so as to not have to set it aside all year long.

Hi pf, my dad passed recently and left me with $65k. I think I've got a handle of how to ""spend"" it, but I'd love some critique/second opinions on my plan. I'm 24M live in NYC. I know I'm in a much better financial position than most, and I would trade it all in heartbeat to have my dad back. Obviously that's not possible, so I want to make sure I honor him by using his gift as wisely as I can.


Current financial snapshot:

**Assets** 

* $11k Savings (Ally)
* ~$1.5k across checking accts
* $16.5k 401(k)
* $5.5k Roth IRA
* $49k Traditional IRA (rollover from previous employer)
* $3.9k HSA

**Debts**

* $17,750 student loans (avg ~3.5% interest)
* $5,800 on a CC (0% until April 2018)


I rent, and NYC has great public transit so I don't have any other debts. I pay off all of my other credit cards in full every month. I have roughly $4750 in expenses each month, with a budgeted take-home income of $5000 per month. My live-in girlfriend also contributes $950 to household expenses, so I save net $1200 per month. I'm paid biweekly, so I calculate my take home as two paychecks after taxes, 401k and HSA contributions. I'm on track to max out my 401k and HSA as I usually do each year. I also have a stock grant that begins vesting in August, this should be ~$40k before taxes on August and a little over $3k per month thereafter (also before taxes). I plan on divesting into  a diversified portfolio immediately after each vesting event.


Thanks for making it this far. So here's my plan for the $65k:

* Pay off remaining student loans. Probably not the most financially sound in the long run since the interest rate is low, but this money was intended to replace what I paid out of pocket for my education. 
* Increase Savings Acct to $20k (~4 month E-Fund)
* Backdoor Roth IRA for 2016 &amp; 2017 (I can roll my current traditional IRA into my 401k to avoid pro rata rule)
* Mega-backdoor Roth IRA the remaining $27k by diverting my paychecks and living off the funds I have now.


I'm planning on moving from NYC in the mid-term (4ish years), so I'm not worried about aggressively saving for a downpayment on a house yet. I'm also fine with paying minimums on the 0% CC until the term is up and paying it off in full- those charges were incurred paying for funeral-related expenses, and I just happened to have the card form product changing an annual fee card. I don't plan on adding to the balance.


My stock grants will then be my post-tax savings starting in August. I guess my questions are: does this seem reasonable to you? Is there anything I'm missing? Figuring out a tax-efficient post-tax asset allocation will also be a hurdle, but I guess I would have a few months to decide on that. Thanks in advance for your insight!


**Edit:** Monthly expenses breakdown

*Bills:*

* 3100 rent
* 225 student loan payment
* 65 internet 
* 120 phone
* 60 0% CC min 
* 200 doctor's/meds (pay out of pocket to leave HSA invested)

*Recurring:*

* 200 cats (food, litter, cat e-fund contribution)
* 40 subscriptions (Netflix, Citibike, Google Play Music)
* 300 Entertainment (dinners out, bars, etc.)
* 200 Things 
* 60 Incidentals (Haircuts, fees &amp; charges)
* 150 Groceries

personalfinance,Trying to clarify the Avalanche Method!,"Hi folks!

I am on board with the avalanche method being mathematically more efficient than the snowball method.

However, I am trying to understand the subtleties of the theory. Basically everyone is saying ""just pay the loans with the highest interest rates first"" and basically ignore the principle balances.

What happens when I have such a high principal, that the daily accrued interest is actually greater than a loan with a lower principle but higher interest rate?

Example: I have 3 loans.
Loan #1:
Principal $42,722.00; Interest rate 6.8%; Daily Accr. Int. $7.95

Loan #2:
Principal $40,500.00;Interest rate 5.41%; Daily accr. int. $6.00

Loan #3:
Principal $8,155.00; int. rate 7.21%; Daily accr. int. $1.61

My question is do I throw payments at Loan #1 and #2 since they actually accrue more interest? Or do I attack Loan #3 since it has the highest interest rate, despite having the lowest daily accrued interest?

The former seems more logical to me, but I may be missing something here.

Also, not sure if this makes a difference, but these are medical student loans. Planning on entering income based repayment plan during residency and all payments will be going towards interest and no principal. My understanding is I basically want to keep interest from growing out of control. So is the underlying objective of the avalanche method to actually minimize accrued interest in this situation?

Thanks!

Update:
Thanks for the awesome answers so far everyone! I am convinced that paying the highest interest rate loan is the way to go when destroying debt.
My related follow-up question pertains to paying off as much accrued interest on these loans as much as possible before the interest is capitalized into the principal.
Since the loans have different ages they have different amounts of total accrued interest.
Same loans as above: Loan 1 has $12,000 Loan 2 has $7000 Loan 3 has $1000
My follow question is does the same Avalanche theory apply to this situation? Basically do I pay off that $1000 in accrued interest on Loan 3 before paying the accrued interest on #1 and #2? This is all without paying any principal so I can minimize capitalization",finance

During the election season, we help co-ordinate our efforts spanning the local races, the state races, and our state federal races: a job that is made substantially easier by our fantastic national office holders - U.S. Rep. Rick Nolan and U.S. Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar. Basically, we do everything that you think of when you think of a political campaign. And 100% of that work is done by unpaid volunteers like myself, covering a rural Northwoods Minnesota county more than twice the size of Rhode Island with a population of less than 30,000 people.
About Cass County: We are exceedingly rural, our two largest towns have the same population – 1,004 people.  We have a total of 4 stop lights in the whole county.  We are the only county in Minnesota not to have a hospital. We don't have a Starbucks...but we have a population density of 14 people per square mile, which is roughly the population density of a Starbucks during non-peak hours. We have minimal use for blinkers on our vehicles, because up here everyone knows where you're going anyway.

...And because it needs to be said: Anything that I state as an opinion does not necessarily represent the beliefs of the Democratic National Party, the Minnesota State DFL, the Cass County DFL or even myself if I've had a few [Grain Belts](http://grainbelt.com/) or [Surleys](http://surlybrewing.com/).

personalfinance,Need advice on how much to keep saved and how much to put towards debt,"Hello! 

So, I have about $22K saved up, $17K left on my auto loan and $15K left on my student loans. The auto loan has a higher interest rate than the student loans. 

My main question Is do I pay off my car loan? Pay it down? Just keep making payments?

Also, my boyfriend and I are talking about getting married, so I'm trying to also think about what will be best for us in the future. He doesn't really have any savings but does have some debt. He's also not going to be able to build his savings up much over the next year due to some unexpected payments. 
My fear is if I pay off my car, it won't leave me with enough to be comfortable when we combine finances down the line. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

EDIT:
Income: roughly $3200/month
Car loan rate 5.8%
Student loan rate 3.7%

Monthly living expenses (rent, electric, internet, water, renters insurance, car insurance) ~$1500
This will go down by about $500-$600 once I move in with my boyfriend at the end of April.
car loan payment: $374
student loan payment: $200",finance

personalfinance,Perkins loan in collection + consolidation question,"I have about $40k in loans thanks to an ill-fated attempt to go back school between 2010-2012. After I left school, I was pretty broke and underemployed so I wasn't able to make payments on them for awhile. This split my debts into a couple of places: $27k are in a federal loan service manager (it started out in Great Lakes, now it's in Fed Loan Servicing) and $13k with a private debt collection agency. The FedLoan loans are all in repayment status, and I've been paying a nominal amount to the private collector to keep him from suing me. So that's how things basically are at present.

I called the debt collector this morning to increase my payment (my income has increased so I can start making slightly more substantive payments on the account), and he said that since one of the loans on my account is a Perkins loan, it could be transferred to my other account (the Fed Loan one) and combined with my current loans through consolidation. So then my balances would be $37k in Fed Loan Servicing and only $3k with the private collector. I would lose the payments I've made under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program I qualify for, but I've only made like 3 qualifying payments, so I'm okay with that as long as the transfer/consolidation is a good idea generally. I'm also currently in an income-based repayment plan. None of my loans have gone through any kind of consolidation process.

The immediate downside that I can see, which isn't disqualifying by any means, is that I don't think the private collection account shows up on my credit report right now. All of my other student loans do, so I assume that my credit report will take a hit because it'll look like my debt has suddenly increased by $10k. I wasn't planning on buying anything in the near term (though my car will probably need to be replaced one way or another within the next two years). With only $3k with the private lender I could knock that debt out by mid-2018 and be left with only the student loans.

Is there anything I'm missing? Is this a good idea? Any followup questions that I should make sure I square away with the debt collector when I talk to him again on Thursday? And help would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Unpaid onboarding training?,"I'm a consultant working for a consulting company. I get paid by the hour. Every time I start with a new client I have to go through an hour or two of training that the client requires. Is there any reason I shouldn't be paid for that training time? In the grand scheme of things it's very little money because time spent in training is dwarfed by time working with each client. So this isn't really about me needing the money. But I don't like being taken advantage of - it seems that consulting companies just don't pay for tasks done prior to your contract start date, even though those tasks are absolutely required. I understand that it is probably a pain in the neck to figure out the accounting for stuff done prior to a contract start date, but it seems like a pain in the neck that they should handle.

Am I missing something? If I'm required to do compliance training, is there really any exception that allows them to not pay me?

personalfinance,Pay Down Mortgage or Invest in IRA/401(k)?,"this might be a little long winded, but need a bit of advice. my wife and I recently purchased a house so I can FINALLY stop just plunking all my cash into a 1% Ally account (the previous advice i got from reddit). So now I'm wondering what I should do next with my savings.

Our debts are as follows (I'll go from highest to lowest interest rate):

*  USA Loan $20,000 @ 5.50%
*  USA Mortgage $700,000 @ 4.50%
*  Canada Mortgage $260,000 @ 2.00%

Our net savings per year are approx $50k-$75k from being extremely cheap and both having excellent stable jobs. This yearly savings number is made up of monthly savings as well as a couple of bonuses I get a year from work.

So question is, where do I start socking away money? I was thinking of doing the following:

1. Take all savings, aggressively pay down USA loan
1. Once #1 is done, pay my mortgage down but not with ALL my savings (maybe send an extra $25k/yr into the principal). Use the rest of the savings to put into 401(k), Roth IRA, etc.

The background on my thinking is that once I get under $636,000 on my mortgage I get much better rates (since I won't have a jumbo loan anymore). I am interested in getting that paid down, while at the same time not sinking ALL my savings into real property.

What's your thoughts on this? Thanks all.",finance

personalfinance,Switching my car insurance to another carrier.,"My family and I will be switching to another car insurance provider in search of lower rates.  My policy consists of my parents and me (22 year old male).  I have my own car that I'm making payments on, and the car is solely registered to me (NJ).  

We're browsing for new insurance plans, and in order for me to be on my parent's policy (to make my premium lower) the insurance company we're looking at requires my car to be put in my father's name (transfer of ownership??).  Must this be done?

The car is registered to me.  I have about $8500 left on the loan, my dad co-signed the loan so my interest rate is low.  

As I am still making payments on my car, I do not have title-in-hand (yet).

I'd hate to have to re-register my car to my dad, only to switch it back after a few years.  Does this legally make my car have more than one owner if I switched the name? 

Or, does switching the registration have anything to do with who owns the car?  Does the insurance want me to switch ownership, or registration of the car?

Multiple insurance companies aren't giving me straight answers here.  Currently, the car &amp; registration is in my name and that is fine with my current provider who allows this to be part of my parent's policy.

personalfinance,seeking student loan debt advice,"Hey money pros,

Using an aptly named throwaway to ask for help with the biggest speed bump of my life. I have roughly $100k in student loan debt from pursuing a degree I might not ever be able to use for health reasons. Roughly half of that debt is from a private loan at 3.9% interest, and the other half is with a federal loan at 6.8% interest.

I have absolutely nothing in savings, as all of my spare income has been going towards these loans. I recently moved back home so I won't have to pay rent, but I am also making less income (about $30k salary) whilst dealing with extensive medical bills.

Right now, I have to make a decision about how to lower the monthly payments and come up with a plan to get them paid off before I retire... or die from exposure or whatever people in my generation will do when we can't work anymore.

From what I can tell, my options are this:

1. Refinance all my debt, private and federal, with a company like SoFi who will consolidate it all and hopefully give me a reasonable interest rate and doable payments if I get a cosigner.

2. Do an income based repayment plan or PAYE or REPAYE plan with my federal loans. Even though my private loans are hurting me more right now with monthly payments, this should provide a little immediate relief at the cost of that 6.8% interest rate killing me down the road. I heard the REPAYE plan helps you pay for half the interest and they forgive the rest of the loan after 20 years though. Also, I can see more options coming down the road for federal loans when the government figures out that the economy is going to collapse when the younger generations can't afford to buy anything. With this option, I would just have to figure out how to pay the private loans as they are.

3. Same as option 2, but also try to refinance the private loans with another lender to reduce the monthly payments at the possible cost of having a higher interest rate. 

I'm not an expert at this stuff, and I've been avoiding doing more research because thinking about it makes me depressed, but I really need some guidance here. Any advice you can give me would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"[debt](CAN) Didn't really think my car purchase last year through, am wondering what path I should take now","Hey PF,

Before I start, I will preemptively agree with anyone who will say I was dumb to buy this car in the first place haha. I think it was a mistake and now I'm just trying to figure out what I can do now. I thank anyone who will help me out in advance! Also I'm a 20 year old single guy in Canada with no connections to his family (so getting funds or assistance from them isn’t an option).

Last February I purchased a still newish used car from a dealership after my beater wagon died. I bought a 2015 Chevrolet Cruze through a loan for $20,550 ($280/mo for 7 years with an interest rate of 6.990%). This is the cost of the car plus the 5 year/100km warranty on top of it because I don't know anything about cars and wanted to be safe. The whole thing was an uninformed and irresponsible decision.

Now this year I'm looking to go to school for IT and am in a bind due to the value of my car. I also am planning to move from Canada in my 7 year life plan to New Zealand so this huge debt is really in my way in regards to that as well. The amount for my schooling isn't nearly as much as my car, the tuition being $6800 for a 48 week course. I don't have that kind of money saved to pay for school myself so I would need to take a student loan of some sorts or a line of credit depending on how this car situation plays out.

I work in cellular sales with a base salary of $2250/mo plus commission. My take home pay varies from month to month, anywhere from $1900 to $2600 after taxes depending on what I sell. On average I would say it's around $2200. I am very fortunate that I live with an old friend and their family for an inexpensive $500/mo with all utilities included. I also made the bad decision to get a dog a couple of years ago so I would say I spend about $150/mo on taking care of him. I pay $48 for my gym membership, and then there is my phone bill which is about $80/mo. 

With all of this in mind the options I've thought of are as follows;

- Sell my car now as it's still relatively new and low km (plus I made yet another stupid decision to buy a $2700 sound system for it and a few other cosmetic touches) for the remainder of my loan or close to it and be completely rid of it (I still owe just over $18k). I would either buy another beater car or just suck it up and try public transit. After this I would have no trouble getting a government student loan, work part-time while in school for the year, then pay the loan off as fast as possible so I can begin saving for myself moving.

- Keep my car as it's incredibly useful not only considering the brutal winters, but having my dog and I live pretty out of the way of everything. For school I would take out a line of credit with my bank. Working part time as well for the year, after school pay off the line of credit and then start putting all of that money I put on the line of credit onto the car and hope to get out of my loan early so I can sell it off and maybe make a little bit of money. Use that money I would maybe earn from the car to start saving for moving.

- Keep my car, work for another year and save up enough to pay for school by myself or as close to all by myself as possible. Once out of school the plan would be like the second option. The only thing about this I really don't like is that it pushes everything back another year and I've been saying I'd go to school ""next year"" for 3 years now and I really don't want to keep doing that in fear that I never will. A lot of this is incredibly personal as my family is not a successful one at all. In fact I believe I'm the first to even have purchased a car like I have so that's really, something. I definitely make more right now than they ever have. 

What I’m looking for is to see if any of my laid out options are reasonable, if I should follow one of  them, or if I should do something completely different. Again I really thank anyone willing to help me out here.

Apple has filed suit in federal court against various defendants, which includes Nokia and two of its subsidiaries. To start, the case is in its very early stages. To this date, Apple is the only party which has filed a pleading (a document stating your initial stance on the law suit). None of the defendants have filed an answer (another type of pleading) dictating which allegations they admit or deny in the Apple complaint. 

Regarding Nokia, Apple alleges that Nokia breached a contract and violated various section of the Sherman Act, which, in its most basic form, is a law meant to prevent monopolies. The contract which Apple claims was breached, actually does not have Apple as a party to it. The contract was between Nokia and some of the other defendants, but Apple alleges that it can bring a claim for breach because the contract affects them. 

The other defendants here are companies that make money by acquiring patents and litigating or licensing them--they are essentially patent trolls. Nokia entered into an agreement with these other defendants in which Nokia bought out their patents. Apple claims that Nokia is attempting to monopolize the market by acquiring all of these patents as Nokia would then have enforcement rights over a bunch of patents that Apple thinks it shouldn't. Apple claims that these patents would restrict their market. In response, Nokia has filed a bunch of patent infringement cases against Apple, which I will not get to as their are quite a few. Just know that Nokia is counter suing. 

On January 12, 2017, the Court gave the defendants until March 28th to respond to Apples complaint. None have done so thus far. My take on this whole thing, is that one of two things will happen. First, this case may go all the way through discovery (the evidence stages of the proceedings) and the court will make a ruling as to any remaining counts against Nokia--this would probably take a couple of years. Second, and what I think is more likely, is that Apple and Nokia will eventually settle to squash all of this beef. Last time they settled, Nokia ended up receiving ~$700M. If this were to settle, Nokia may agree to license patents to Apple in exchange for some $$$. I really don't see Nokia paying apple any money unless the the Court itself makes a ruling.",finance

So for the majority of my life people have scoffed at me being a gamer. They think and say things like ""When is he gonna grow up and stop playing with toys?"" It has always pissed me off that close minded individuals could judge like that. So I've never been ok with me pulling out a portable system and using it in public. I didn't do it with Gameboy, GBA, PSP, Vita Ds, 3DS or anything else. It's a me thing. I've always felt uncomfortable being gawked at, feel like I'm being judged. Then the Switch comes along. I have used this in coffee shops and other public places without any sort of hesitation. This thing comes everywhere with me. Don't know why I found it more comfortable. But I did. And that is a good thing. I know too many people who stop playing games or collecting this or that due to ""age"" which is complete bullshit. So for this, I say thank you Nintendo.

Bitcoin,Have an Opinion on Bitcoin ETF? Tell the SEC!!,"&amp;nbsp;

*If you want to skip the inspirational call to arms, and just want to know how to easily contact the SEC with your opinion, scroll down.*

&amp;nbsp;

This subReddit's subscribers, and our friends at r/bitcoinmarkets **represent the world's greatest think tank on all matters Bitcoin**.  We have varied opinions, but our collective research, discussions, and ideals are unparalleled. 

&amp;nbsp;

Almost everyone here has an opinion on the bitcoin ETFs  coming up for SEC approval or denial.  **No one's opinion is correct, but everyone's opinion should be heard.**

&amp;nbsp;

I've worked with state and federal regulators in various agencies.  They're real people.  Yes, they are hooked.   No, public comments don't sway a foregone conclusion the other way.  But SEC staff members review and summarize the comments for the Commissioners. **Who knows which great idea - already published on Reddit - might slightly change the viewpoint of a Commissioner, if published as an SEC public comment?**

&amp;nbsp;

Submitting a public comment to the SEC is somewhat like voting in a national election. You know full well that your vote is not going to change the outcome, but not voting is apathetic, and makes it pointless to complain about the results if you didn't at least try.   We can still complain; we only have a few days (hours) to 'vote.'

&amp;nbsp;

*Public comments are the voice we're given in influencing an SEC decision.**.   So use it.   

&amp;nbsp;

**The SEC doesn't read Reddit to form its opinions.**.  At least there's a chance that a staff member on the SEC may read some of the public comments and mention one or two to a Commissoner.  **If the 200,000 subscribers to this sub constitute the Bitcoin brain trust, let's speak our minds to someone who truly has a say in BTC's future.**. 

&amp;nbsp;

It takes just a few minutes and you might make a 0.1% difference.  Why not?  Submit a public comment, rather than limiting your thoughts to this sub.

I currently also have about $6,000 in Cash. I have ran a credit report and all that is shown is my Federal subsidized student loans and my state loans all of which are deferred payments without interest until 6 months after I graduate.

personalfinance,Pay monthly minimum or monthly interest accrued?,"Hi, all. So I'm three months away from my first required payment toward about $117,000 in student loans (that includes interest). The majority of them (about $100,000 post-interest) are private. My household income between me and my fiance is about $75k after taxes.
I'm planning my first big payment on these in two weeks when I get paid again. I'm going to be throwing between $2,500-$3,000/month at them until they're gone and I have a question about the best practice to fight the demon that is compound interest:
Is it wiser for me to pay the minimum payments on all the loans (I have a 180-month payment plan and the loans I'm most concerned about have between 8-9.75 interest rates) as I attack one at a time, or, should I ignore my minimum payments because they're lower than the interest accrued each month and pay whatever the monthly interest accrued would be? The drawback is I'd have a little less to destroy each of the nine loan accounts at a time.
I've had the calculator out for a few days now and my hunch is to pay the interest each month to keep it the accounts not in my cross hairs from swelling, but I wanted to see what all of your advice would be.
For the record, I'm considering consolidation but I like that my minimum payments would lower as I pay off each loan when they're divided up, which lessens my desire to have an emergency fund of about $5,000. A minimum payment of $1,500, while I can afford it, would be terrifying if I were to get sick or lose my job. I'd rather wait until I've got this number cut down to about $50k and then refi with pristine credit (Currently have a 740 but not a ton of credit history).

personalfinance,Help with buying a house,"My wife and I are planning on buying our first house. We're very green to all of this and it can definitely be overwhelming. We want to make sure we're making the best choices available without being taken advantage of.


Our situation:

- We have about $5000 cash.

- I make 61k, my wife stays home with our daughter.

- I got a new credit card a couple months ago, credit check number 1.

- I got an auto loan a month ago for 15,000 at 6.5% (10 year old vehicle), credit check number 2.

- I spoke with a mortgage planner today, credit check number 3. He told me we could get $150,000 and pay 3% down and have a monthly payment of $960, or 5% and pay $920, including fees and insurance. That's at 4.125% for 30 year fixed. This is about what we were anticipating spending, but he told me we could go higher if need be. I've checked a couple other sources and this seems to be a decent interest rate for our area.


My concerns:

- I know our savings is low. I've recently been looking at our budget and revamping it. It looks like with the new plan we'll be able to put back about $1,100 per month. I would eventually like to split this number between personal savings, retirement, and a 529, but given our current situation I think it needs to all go to savings until we get it built up a little.

- I've got 3 credit checks in 3 months. This is not typical for us. We've always paid off debt ASAP. The mortgage planner told me today my credit score is 711 and my wife's is 739. I suppose the damage is done already though, so there's probably not much point worrying over this.

- I'm selling a vehicle. I expect to get roughly $12,000 from this and I was planning on using the money to pay off my vehicle loan but now I'm wondering if I should redirect some of this towards making a bigger down payment.


Thanks in advance, pf gurus.




**Edit:**


I spoke with the mortgage planner again. The figures he quoted me include taxes, fees, PMI, and home owners' insurance. That's the out-the-door figure we'll be paying each month, but of course there's still closing costs and other things to consider.

As for the vehicle, I have to have a truck. I could probably sell it and get a cheaper one that would work for my needs, but it would have more miles/require more maintenance/etc. It wouldn't be worth going through the hassle. I have looked at getting a more fuel efficient car to drive to work, but after running the numbers I found out I would only have about $2,000 to get the vehicle assuming it gets 50 mpg for it to pay for itself within a reasonable time. This would be feasible with a motorcycle, but that's not practical for my job or commute.

I should have mentioned, the $1100/month we'd be saving is assuming a $950 mortgage payment. In the meantime, we should be able to stow away close to $2k per month. I'm sure we can actually do even better than that. I estimated quite high for our expenses. I'll look at the results of our budget and adjust accordingly after a month.

I think we're going to focus on saving right now and looking/researching houses. That way we won't feel pushed to get something immediately. We can take our time, while saving more for a better down payment.",finance

I tested out of high school in 2015 with a GED and worked on and off in between then and now. I have little to no savings (~500USD) and am not currently working. I intend to get a job within the next month and I am taking the ACT next month. I want to move to Hull in England and start school there in September doing CS. I spoke with the school's international department and have been told a GED with an ACT score of at least 25 would allow me to attend school there (even though the entry requirements page has changed regarding ACT but I have emailed them about what that means). I intend to live in the UK once I finish school there.
I would need to get a pretty big loan ($20k) for my first year of school there. I would probably have to take out more loans for the following years, but I'm not sure how taking loans from the US works while I'm in school in the UK. I would work the entire time I attend school.

If I worked full time until it was time to leave I could save around $5k. My parents both make over $100k a year but are not good at handling money, have no savings, and are both in a lot of debt with bad credit.  Even though I am not eligible for FAFSA, I will definitely not be able to get any help financially from my parents. 
Is there any chance of getting a loan from anywhere, even private lenders with high APR? I'm not entirely sure on how loans work either, but I think I have to have a  good credit score and income for most places to consider one? 

Do I have any options on loans I could take out? Should I just wait a year and work to save while building credit before going to school? Is this too irresponsible, money wise? I will be 20 turning 21 if I choose to wait a year and just starting school and I'm not sure if that would look bad for me when trying to apply to universities. I would REALLY DEFINITELY rather put myself in debt for school and take out a large loan then focus on paying off my debt when I finish school.

Not only that, but all of his loans are through Sallie May, and some of them have 8.5% interest rates (he didn't know anything about federal loans, and his parents had him sign up for solely private loans...I know...)

We are currently renting, both work full time, and have one fully paid off car.  We met with our credit union's financial planner recently to look at what we need to do to be doing now in order to be ready to purchase a home in a few years, and one thing she suggested is we take out an equity loan on the car at a lower interest rate than the student loans, apply that money to the loans, and redirect our extra payments to the car loan.  The highest interest student loans are at 6.5% fixed, and the car loan could be for ~$13k at anywhere from 5 years at 4.5% to 2 years at 2.x%.

I get how we would come out ahead if we do this, but I'm uneasy at the thought of doing this.  It is a good idea?  Right now, no matter what, we own the car outright.  If we take out this loan, and we both lost our jobs, or are in an accident and are unable to work, we'd be at risk of losing the car, and be up the proverbial creek.

personalfinance,I received an unexpected check (tax refund) from the US Treasury Bill?,"As the title states, everything looked legit from face value--I checked the watermark, the details on the check etc. I am really confused because I filed my tax return online and expected to receive less than $280 on my federal tax return. I was part time working as an intern/full time in school and took out loans to cover tuition maybe (5k).

I do remember filling out 1098-T information on the 1040.com website but it did not seem to alter the $280 return. I later received the $280 via direct deposit from the IRS. I filed last month. Yesterday, I received a refund of $1,700. It came in a white envelope from the U.S. Treasury with the usual green-to-yellow gradient check with a pamphlet about myRA.com information to make use of the tax refund.

Can anyone shed some light on this? It did not come with any instructions, and not one of those scams where they tell you to deposit, spend this much and it'll bounce or anything like that.
Is this some sort of new scam I am not aware of?

How can I get information on why I received this amount?

Thanks.

personalfinance,Need help working out consolidation loan,"I'm hoping that someone may have some suggestions for me. I make around 78K per year, I have the following debts: 

1. Car loan for 25k
2. Checking line of credit for 15K
3. Owe my brother in law 19K on his credit card
4. around 17K in credit cards

What I'm really trying to do is move the 15-17K in credit cards on to a personal loan so I can clear up my credit card utilization, my credit cards are maxed right now and this is hurting my credit. He helped me by moving 19K on to his card, and I told him that my plan was to do that, get a personal loan for 15K to move my credit cards onto that loan, this would then clear up my credit card utilization and then after a month or two I would be able to get a bigger loan for the 19K that I owe him, PLUS the 15k in credit card debt. I was working with someone who is supposedly pretty ""savy"" with credit, but at this point I am sort of stuck. I have tried to get different loans and first I kept getting declined because my credit card utilization was too high. Then I convinced my brother in law to co-sign with me to get the loan and NOW I'm being denied because of too many credit dings from trying different loans. 

I don't really have an option to let everything sit and wait until the credit dings go away or I'm able to pay down some of my cards, I promised him that I would move the 19K off of his card within a month or two. 

Basically I'm looking for a temporary personal loan to move the 15K off of my credit cards, even if it's not the best interest rate, but I swear I have tried EVERYTHING and I can't get anyone to approve me for anything. I even tried asking one of the credit unions that I use to reconsider and gave them the information and what I'm trying to do (debt consolidation).

Overall my goal is to move the 15K checking line of credit, the 19K that I have on his card and my credit cards all on to one large loan with a low interest rate, I know that this will take a little bit of work to be able to be approved for a loan that big with a low interest rate, so I'm okay with leave the 15K checking line of credit where it is for now. 

Anybody have some great ideas for what I can do? Experian says my credit score is 649, but other ones say it's around 580. 

Bottom line is I'm looking for a way to get a 15k loan temporarily to clear up my credit card utilization for a month or so and bump up my credit score.",finance

personalfinance,"25, just got promoted, where should I put my extra income (ESSP, Roth or Loans) and should I refinance?","Hi guys, I recently got promoted(converted from temp to FTE) and have no idea where to allocate the extra money. I went from making $30/h and no benefits to a salary of 85k/yr and benefits. My benefits are:

* 12% annual bonus 

* 15k in RSUs that vest at 25% per anniversary for 4 years

* 100% match on 401k contributions for up to 6% of my annual salary

* ESPP: Purchase company stock bi-annually at a 15% discount with no vesting period and a look-back price-lock of 2 years (i.e. if the lowest stock price in the past 2 years is a greater discount than 15%, they buy stocks at that price instead)

I get paid bi-weekly and each paycheck (including the 6% 401k contribution) is about $2,050 after taxes. Note this does not include the ESSP which would be ~$325). My monthly budget (assuming I make the minimum monthly loan payments) is:

* Auto loan: **$321** ($10,721 @ 2.49% / 36 months remaining)
* Student loans: **$207** ($19.980 total / graduated payment plan)

   - $8,181 @ 3.4%

   - $3,511 @ 4.5%

   - $2,731 @ 5.6%

   - $5,420 @ 6.8%* Gas: **$100**
* Tolls: **$100**
* Phone: **~$250** - I realize this is a huge bill but I pay my entire family's bill so not much room for improvement here
* Rent + Utilities: **~$1050** - I plan on moving and this will probably increase to $1300-$1400. I live in the bay area and my current commute is killing me so this is for my own sanity. 
* Food: **$200**
* Gym: **$25**
* Misc expenses (home supplies, shopping, gifts, etc): **~$200**

* Total: **~$2,500**

My question is, where do I allocate my money? I will definitely contribute the 6% for the 401k and I figured the ESPP should be a no brainer, right? It's pretty much guaranteed money so long as I sell immediately (please correct me if my logic is incorrect). I have about $7k in an emergency fund so I should be okay on that for now.

1. Should I focus on my student loans that are 5.6% and higher instead of putting money into an IRA? I figured I would try to put my annual bonus into my Roth in March 2018 (when I receive my first one) but I'm not sure since I really want these loans gone. The thing is that I'm 25 and only have around 3k in my retirement funds so I don't want to lose out on that compounding interest and start later than I have to. What do you guys think?

2. Should I refinance my car loan (my credit is ~790) for a longer term? Now before you all crucify me on this, I'm asking because if I refinance for 60-72 months at the same interest rate (2.49%), I would only pay about $300-$400 more in total interest and reduce my monthly payment by $125-$150. I might even pay less in total interest if I qualify for a lower interest rate. I could then put that monthly $125-$150 ""savings"" into my student loans/Roth. Is this foolish?

personalfinance,Does it make sense to invest in a Roth IRA with a planned stretch of joblessness and debt due to starting law school in a few months?,"A friend of mine is currently working a full time job making decent money but will be leaving it in August to attend law school. She is saving as much money as she can to cover living expenses while she is in school since she will not be working for at least the first semester and may stay jobless for longer depending on how well she is doing in school.

She will be taking about $10k out in loans each year at an APR of 5.31% to cover tuition and possibly more to cover living expenses if her savings runs dry. 

She has $7k saved for law school, $4k in an emergency fund, and $1k earmarked to be put into a Roth IRA. 

Does it make sense to start putting money in an IRA while simultaneously saving for law school living expenses? Or should she just keep all extra money she has in a readily accessible savings account to live on. I am thinking that she could max out her Roth IRA because she will likely get a similar or greater return on those investments as the interest rate on the loans she is taking outing will still have access to those contributions if her savings and loan money runs dry if she really needs to pull from it. 

Is this over complicating things? Should she postpone long term investing until after law school?",finance

Now... I have some decent equity built up in my house. We have an FHA mortgage with a 4.25% interest rate initiated in Sept 2010. Our house is worth about $210k-200k. We owe about $155,000 on it still. Would it be a smart move to look into doing a Cashout Refinance for $175,000 and taking the additional $20,000 and paying off the CCs.

But I went to the Employment Development Department and they said that there was _no_ extensions possible. The guy hadn't checked me in yet, so I don't think he was talking about my case in particular... but he was emphatic about the point.

personalfinance,Help planning the rest of the year -- would like to move up to a bigger house,"Greetings all,

My wife (26F) and I (31M) are currently living in a 2BR Ranch in Rhode Island with our infant son.  We'd like to expand our family in the near future, and my wife has always hated this house.  I bought it before we were married because I thought it was a great deal and she reluctantly joined me.  


**The house** is a 2BR 1955 ranch that was a family sale -- appraised at 120k in 2013 with a 20k gift-of-equity, so I paid 100k.  I had since put in a lot of sweat-equity.

In 2015 it was appraised for a HELOC at 153k.  I've put in a bit more sweat equity since then and I feel the market has moved up a tad since then as well. 

We'd like to step up to a larger home in a better neighborhood.  Our current financial situation: 

Home:  

 - Mortgage balance: Approx $93,400
 - HELOC Balance: Approx $7,500

Major Debt: 

 - Debt: no revolving CC Debt (we charge everything to cashback cards and payoff the statement balance each month)
 - Other Debts: Just her federal student loans (about 21k)
 - Aforementioned HELOC ($~7500).  Monthly interest-only payments autopaid at about $23/mo

Income: 

 - My Income: $82.4k/yr gross + monthly profit-sharing bonus (Feb net was $5300 for the month after 401k, taxes, HSA, insurance, etc)
 - Her income: $0

Cash:  

 - About 10k cash in the bank.

There's a whole list of things we'd like to do around the house to get it ready for sale, mostly minor projects in the sub-$1k range, almost all DIY'able and most of those over a weekend.  All of them I think would yield a net gain in value, though I may want some help in prioritizing them.

**What I'm trying to figure out** is if it would be in my best interest to pay off the HELOC and how to go about paying for the projects I'd like to do.  It'd be nice to get some help prioritizing some of the projects we'd like to do (i'll edit this post to put them at the bottom).

The houses that we're really liking are in the 200k-220k range, but I'm also incredibly concerned about being able to sell this house at a point where I have &gt;44k worth of equity for a down payment (not to mention closing costs, escrow seed money, commission and everything else).

There is also the potential of moving in with my MIL for a short period of time if necessary, but that leaves a concern of what to do with the pets (2 dogs 1 cat).

* **Student Debt**: Will be about 12k after next quarter's tuition is paid. All federal loans, I pay the interest as it accrues and some extra here and there when I can. 

* **Credit Score**: 651, was 716 two months ago but went down because I stopped paying my credit card balance in full. I'm chipping away at it.

Both approved me for way more than I was willing to spend as I have great credit all around and will do a 20% down payment. Quicken is 4.75% interest and the local Credit Union (Backed by Americu) is 4.25%.




The realtor immediately dragged both through the mud, saying only half of online loan originators like Quicken Loans get through closing (in her experience, lower income area), and Americu is terrible. So she set me up with a lady she ""knew forever"". I met with the referred originator our of courtesy. Basically, the Same scenario and was approved for way more than I am willing to spend, but with an interest rate of 4.75% ""on the high side"".


The problem I had is the referred originator said I would not know my exact interest rate until I make an offer on the house. That seems insanely backwards. I understand an interest rate is not ""locked in"", but it feels like there is some sort of backdoor kickback scenario going on, as I am a first time home buyer.

Okay, this might take a moment to explain, but I believe it is all pertinent to understanding my situation and getting proper advice. I'll also explain things in the way that I understand them. This is to make sure that what I am trying to say is understood in the easiest way possible, in case I am using improper terms or have a misunderstanding of how something works.

I was in the Navy for 3 years(currently 25; was 20 when I joined). I have a mixed TSP(thrift savings plan;unique to government/military) account with standard and roth.(according to my understanding this means the standard is taxed later and the roth is taxed now?) The current amount in there is around $10,000 and continues to grow. Since I am no longer in the navy, I can no longer contribute to this account and any growth is based solely on what I have already invested.(unless I get a federal job in which case I could start investing again)

Now, about 2 years ago I opened up an account with Edward Jones(Roth). I was putting in $400-500 a month up until October when my wife got sick. I than reduced it to $100 a month and have kept it there out of necessity. I received a call today from the office that I started my Edward Jones my investment through, stating the way my investments work is due to change.

The way it was explained to me is that currently the process works based on a commission. I don't really understand it all, but according to the office a new law regarding IRAs will be put into place April 10th. I was told that if I wanted to increase the amount I contribute per month I should do it now(Before april 10th), because once the change is implemented any future increases I want to make will require me to open up a new, er..., account(?) that will be under this new tax thing coming up instead of the commission my current account works under.

These are my current questions. Any other advice/guidance/information is of course welcome!

1)Is this upcoming change good or bad?
  

2)What is better the tax or commission?
  

3)What are the pros and cons of increasing the amount being contributed to my current Roth(IRA) with Edward Jones to keep everything under commission? Or would it be better under this tax thing coming up?
  

4)I was told about a different type of investment called a ""No load investment"", by my retired parents. What are the pros and cons of possibly investing in those, and how does that work? Are ""No load investments"" also subject to this tax I have been told about?
  

5)My Edward Jones office is advising me from time to time to roll over my TSP to them, but I am hesitant to do so. I prefer to keep it in TSP, because I was told TSP has exclusive investment stocks, because it is handled by the government. Would this change be wise?
  

That's all I can think of at the moment. I tried to submit this under the retirement Sub-reddit, but I don't use reddit all that often. So if this ends up in the wrong section, I apologize in advance. Thank you for your time",finance

gaming,Don't ever playtest for Activision,"So here is the story basically I am signed up for playtests through Activision in which they will contact me for potential opportunities to try new games and what have you before release. Now I had never actually taken part in one before, but when I got the phone call to participate I was quite excited to help with a video game in any way, but also they were offering some free swag as well. The testing site is around 1 and a half hours away from where I live, but I figured no big deal for the opportunity to have some input on a new title! Now when I was contacted I was guaranteed entry into this playtesting as long as I arrived before 6:30 so I showed up around 6:10 with a fair number of people already being there signed in and was then told I was in an ""Alternate"" spot so if someone who was confirmed didn't show up I would be let in. I kind of stood there dumb struck like I have a confirmed spot that's the only reason I would drive out here for this. So I decide to wait all the way through to see if this guy will actually allow me in or not and he looks at me an 4 other people telling us that we won't be able to take part and hands us a measly gift card for our troubles. 

I was beyond angry at this point and explained point blank that I was already confirmed a spot in the test and the 4 other people behind me said the exact same thing and had the exact same email that I had saying guaranteed entry. I then tried to contact Activision playtests support directly and this is what I received in response ""We’re sorry to hear that you felt wronged in any way. We strive to ensure our playtests are completely staffed by qualified participants. In order to ensure that happens, those that most closely match the profile we need are selected as primary those that fell just outside our parameters as alternates. This enables us to quickly fill seats if participants selected as primaries fail to show. As history has shown us, if alternates are aware of their status beforehand, they will not show. Lastly, we always ensure our participants that do not receive a seat in the study are adequately compensated for their time. We encourage you to respond to future surveys as we are constantly looking for different player profiles to test new games"". This practice would not be terrible besides the fact you are not told if you are in an alternate slot and like in my case can end up spending over 3 hours and $40 in gas to try and participate in something you love just to be told sorry no dice not our fault we won't tell you anyway.

personalfinance,Remodeled our house and we just got a better than expected appraisal should we take out the max loan?,"We did a house reno and I was worried that we were going to be eating some costs. Instead it appears that we may have increased the house by more than the reno costs (a miracle that usually only happens on HGTV)

Anyway to make this quick:

Original house cost: $142K
Reno costs ~ $190K
Appraisal: $340K
Interest rate: 4.125%

Some personal financial background:

The only debt we currently carry is the $40K remaining on the existing mortgage

Wife and I bring in ~ 90K per year with some upside since I have just started my own data system business

We have a 12 (almost 13 year-old) &amp; an 11 year old that will likely want to go to college some day

We had approximately 45K in savings before the reno. We were misled into a bad loan type at the start of the construction process and so we have had to beg, borrow and steal to finance the construction to this point ourselves. So currently we have some IOUs that we will be able to pay off when the loan closes which should be very quickly now that the appraisal is in.

MY MAIN QUESTIONS:

1) Should we take the loan for the max amount ($272,000) knowing that we can invest the rest and save for the kids college since there is a good chance that the 4.125% interest rate will look great in comparison to college loan rates/interest rates moving forward? Or take the loan amount that will cover the reno and with a little left over for the rainy day fund?

I made the mistake of physically going into credit unions and having online lenders run hard pulls on my credit.


If you have yet to do a walk through on a house, you only need to get pre-approval from the lenders. Do not let them run a hard pull until you are ready to pull the trigger on a house.


I researched for years and somehow I messed this up.


This is geared for people who believe it may take longer to buy then 30 days.


If you think it may take longer than 30 days, the lenders will have to run another hard pull, which lowers you credit scores a bit.


Plus, the pre-approval interest rate is just a smoke number, and you can only lock in the rate after you have found a house to make an offer on.

personalfinance,Investing in properties outside my country of residence?,"First things first, I am 22, and very much a noob at investing. After I got fed up with university I researched real estate investing heavily for several months as an option for setting up passive income and supporting myself without a 4 year degree. I really enjoyed and still enjoy obsessing over the lessons. I was planning to start the licensing course for my state over Christmas, but back in November my factory job started demanding compulsory overtime from me, and I didn't see the sun or have an ounce of free time for two months. By the time that ended, some unpleasant but elucidating shit had gone down in my personal life and I realized it was crucial for me to get out of my dead-end opiate-ridden hometown again as soon as possible.

To that end I am one month already into the other big course I've been looking at doing since university: getting licensed as a TEFL teacher. My intent is to be able to support myself comfortably, doing work that genuinely helps someone improve their potential, while I see the world for a few years and become fluent in other languages, which have all been core goals of mine since I realized university was failing to push me toward any of them.

Real estate is honestly something I got into for the prospect of livable money for a healthy amount of work (not slaving 50+hours a week in a factory) and the intrigue of involving myself in such a major part of people's lives. Where you live and your relationship with your shelter is a huge part of life, like medicine or food production, and I love reading about housing materials, what materials and designs work better in different environments, how houses are appraised and valued, etc. I'm not just interested in it for the money alone, but the money was the initial draw.

**My main question is, if I plan to leave the country for a TEFL job sometime within the next 8-12 months, is it worth it to move forward with the tuition and course for getting my state's real estate license at this point in my life? What can I really do with a real estate license if I'm not living in or near the state I got licensed in?** The license must be renewed yearly, which costs $$, and I don't know what I could exactly do from overseas that would make me money. **Would it be wiser to wait until I'm through traveling and settled somewhere long term? Would I be hampering my ability to be successful in real estate later by doing that? I know plenty of investors manage property remotely, but they often employ property managers or have the know-how to fix up their properties, which does not seem realistic for the experience and capital I have built up for myself so far. In a few years, maybe.**

FWIW, I'm really into minimal waste, location-independent lifestyles, and FI/RE. That is the mindset I am approaching all of this from.

My spouse graduated from a private institution in December and has federal direct + private bank loans. Will need to begin paying on private loans in July and federal loans in December.

For the past 2.5 years I have been on a $0 payment income based repayment plan through nelnet.  I am beginning 4 months of forbearance today so that I do not have to pay on my loans until after PA school graduation.  I am going to apply for the national health corp scholarship as well as try and find additional scholarships/programs to repay loans via service.  At the very least, working for a nonprofit will allow my loans to be forgiven after 7.5 years since I've already met 2.5 years.  Should we refinance my spouse's loans or just get on an income-based repayment?  Is there anyway for us to refinance my spouse's loans into my name so that they can be forgiven sooner/be eligible for additional forgiveness programs?

My Loans ($42,211.72):

I am looking for advice directly related to these loans and the best way to go about organizing them to pay them off.  With my spouse potentially earning in the 6 figures within 8-12 months, and my potential as a PA, I am not worried about paying bills. Please avoid commentary that includes, but is not limited to:

- ""you should not go to PA school""

- ""you should not have gotten married or bought a house""

personalfinance,Unconsolidate student loans,"I have 18k in a federal consolidated student loan @ 6% with a 20 year repayment.  The only reason I did this was because I didn't have much income after graduation and couldn't afford the $350+ total payments.

Original balance was ~24k and I have been paying on it for about 6 years.

Is there a good way to break this up in to smaller loans?  For example, like 6 $3k loans? I would like to pay off this stupid loan in chunks and free up cash flow while doing so.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage lender said something really weird to me in his office.,"I'm shopping around for a mortgage and have been talking to three different lenders. 

I went in to see one guy and have him run my numbers and see what he could offer me. 

When he finished calculating he asked me how his interest rate compared with other offers I had gotten and I told him honestly that it was in the ballpark, but slightly higher than the other two. 

Then he said, ""well, give me a reason why I should give you the best rate possible."" 

And I honestly didn't know what to say to that. In the end I think I said something like, ""well wouldn't you want to offer me the best rate possible so I have an increased likelihood of using you for my mortgage?"" 

And he kind of laughed at that and started talking about how he hates working with people who only care about the numbers and people need to understand that there's a lot more to a mortgage than just the lowest interest rate, etc. 

To be honest, it was really strange and off putting to me. Why would he tell me to ""give him a reason"" to give me the best interest rate possible? 

Was the number he gave me not the best he could do? What could I have said to him in that situation that would have satisfied his question? 

I'm just a little baffled and looking for advice about what he meant by that and how I should respond in the future if I'm ever asked a similar question.

personalfinance,Student loan prioritization/refinancing,"Thanks to you all for helping me pay off 4 student loans early.  I am allocating extra payments plus any 'bonus' money directly to these loans and it feels great to have less debt.  I am almost done with the 'easy choices' and I could use some help prioritizing.  I'm not necessarily looking to change my budget.  Rather, I'd like to make smarter decisions that fall in line with the current decisions I'm happy with.

Some basic details I often see requested:

* No credit card debt (other than revolving work expense account, paid in full)
* Decent credit score ( 750-800 )
* Maxed 401k match plus more because they only match the first 3%.  I do 9%.
* Decent emergency fund/savings (3+ months)
* Car has one more payment then I will be making the same payment into a savings account for my next car.  I'll be waiting for my current car to die before looking into a new one so I hope to have 3-4 years of payments worth in my car savings by then.
* Currently allocating $1,000/mo to student loan payments.  I have approximately $310/mo in over payments once minimums are satisfied.

Student loans (low -&gt; high balance):

* $4,100, 3.6%, private, $80 min
* $6,600, 2.65%, Stafford unsub, $70 min
* $9,000, 4.5%, private, $65 min
* $72,000, 6%, direct consolidation of federal loans, $475 min

I know realistically you are supposed to pay off highest interest first.  However, $72k would take a decade while I'm making minimums on the other smaller loans.  My current plan is as follows:

1. $4,100 - lowest balance, medium interest, quick to repay and forget about an entire lender
2. $9,000 - second highest balance and interest.  Also co-signed and I'd like to remove the co-signer.  Missing my very first payment by 3 days makes me ineligible despite 48+ on-time payments. /gripe
3. $6,600 - medium balance, lowest interest, last remaining 'easy' payoff
4. $72,000 - pay this monster balance with all snowball funds freed up with previous loans

I think this would make me feel best, based on accomplishment, despite it not being the *best* financial decision.  However, any contrary opinions?

Also, more importantly, can I/should I re-fi the consolidation?  I've been looking at SoFi but I don't know if loan origination fees would offset the interest improvements.  I see 3.375% - 6.74% on their website so the odds are my interest rate would be better than the current 6%.

dogecoin,[rant] the real solution to dogecoin's value is not removing inflation.,"This is such a big pet peeve for me right now because misinformed economics is also a huge pet peeve for me in the other big subreddit I go to, /r/runescape (there it's the misinformed opinions on the GE).

This has been stated before many times but I feel like people need to be reminded. And also because I'm really frustrated.

#INFLATION IS NOT THE ANTICHRIST!!

You know why there is majority inflationary currencies and why we went off the gold standard? Because inflation is better for currencies!

Yes, your investment loses value, but that's the point of a currency! **It's a thing that facilitates the transfer of wealth!** If your money grew in value every day, why spend it? Why not wait til Friday and pay your rent? Then why not wait til June to buy that thing? Then why go get a job at all if you're earning value by doing nothing for the economy?

Yes, deflation is good for investments, but we are not a Fortune 500 company. We are a community of people who want to transfer goods and services around! There's a giant difference. You will not get rich without effort with Dogecoin. The Gold Rush has passed, people. Dogecoin will not become $5 each in a year like Bitcoin. It will become $5 each through collective dedication and hard work. Using the rocket analogy, NASA doesn't launch their spaceships like we would start a car – each launch costs well into the $100 millions.

#Our real inflation is actually shrinking.

Inflation is also dependent on how much is lost! If people lose their doge all the time, and consistently lose more than 5 billion a year, then doge is actually *deflationary*, not inflationary! Just because we have a permanent 10k a block reward doesn't necessarily mean we're inflationary.

Furthermore, each block that passes, our inflation rate is actually *shrinking*, because there are more coins. Unlike the Federal Reserve that can print out as much money as they want, we can only mint 10k per minute. If that is not enough to maintain a set inflation rate, then that's too bad.

Assuming inflation is bad, and the US tries to maintain an inflation rate of 2% each year, why is the US dollar the most valuable currency in the world? Exactly, because inflation does not preclude a currency from becoming successful and may in fact be helpful. Inflation is not a death sentence. (That's hyperinflation.)

#Inflation v deflation is about what we want to be.

Do we want to be an investment? Then we want deflation. But what value do we serve? None, the only value is that it'll be an investment for other people. You know what that is? A Ponzi scheme. Unless we can prove that we can make each coin useful (which, by the way, is a number on a computer, and not even an entire number so not even an entire byte), an ""investment"" currency is just a scam.

Do we want to be useful? Then we want inflation. It'll encourage people to exchange currency for valuable goods and services as soon as possible. You know what that is? **A currency**.

#So why are we losing real value each day?

Bitcoin and Litecoin have grown, as have many others. I will not argue otherwise that we are losing value. But what is the issue?

The issue is adoption. Inflation is good for a currency, but a currency is worthless without adoption. A good currency can be exchanged directly for non-financial goods and services and not just a proxy for another better currency.

So my request is to shut up about Inflation v Deflation and talk about real issues like how to get more people to utilize it, and how to solve the issues it shares with Bitcoin and the likes, and how to create more infrastructure around Dogecoin itself.

I personally would like to interact with people using Dogecoin – buy stuff on a Dogecoin Amazon.com, and purchase things that charities would like directly without having to convert to USD or the local currency. Could that mean medicine for charities like Doctors Without Borders? Or would that be custom-made socks for the most recent charity effort? Whatever that could mean.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Ways to reduce AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) for tax purposes?,"Looking for ways to reduce AGI *or taxable income* for *last* year, and plan better for *this* year as well.

I have done a lot of searching (both here and in general) but just want to make sure before we send everything off to the accountants for last year's taxes.

**Can still be done for last year (up to tax day)**

* Contribute up to $5,500 per person to an IRA

* Max out HSA contributions $6,750 family

**Can't be done after Dec 31, but could be done for current year**

* Contribute up to $18,000 per person to a 401K 

* Itemized deductions - mortgage interest, state taxes, property taxes, etc.

* Small business owner health insurance premium deduction 

* Make large charitable contributions

personalfinance,"I want to start throwing $1,240/month at my $75k school loan. Worth it? $45k income, no wife or kids.","$1,240 lost to debt every month for the next 6 years straight. That's currently 55% of my net income.

&amp;nbsp;

School loan: $75,000

Balance after each year of payments:

12th month: $64,503.30 (holy shit!)

24th month: $53,345.32

36th month: $41,484.39

48th month: $28,876.24

60th month: $15,473.79

72nd month: $1,226.99

73rd month: $0.00

&amp;nbsp;

I can only imagine how great it will feel in that 6th year. It may seem like a big monthly payment but it doesn't put me in a bad spot. I already live frugally.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm about to pay my car off ($4200 @ 16.99%) with a lump sum payment. That'll free up $240/month to throw at the school loan. That's where the 240 in $1,240 comes from.

&amp;nbsp;

**What I was initially planning to do:**

&amp;nbsp;

$75k at @ 6.125% is $382 per month in interest alone. I could pay that minimum for 20 years (IBR plan, forgiveness) and not even touch the principle. That would give me $858 ($1240 - $382) to invest, instead of throwing it all at the school loan.  

&amp;nbsp;

If I went this route, I'd have ended up paying $91,680 in interest after 20 years. I'd still owe $75k. When that gets forgiven, it's calculated into my taxable income: $45k salary + $75k loan = $120k. I'd owe $30,000 ($120k * 0.25) in federal taxes come that 20th year. But 25% in 2037? HAH, we all know we'll be taxed by at least 40-60% within the next 20 years.

&amp;nbsp;

So, if I invested $858 every month for 20 years instead of trying to pay off the loan, I will end up with $315k saved with a conservative 5% ROI.

&amp;nbsp;

**Options:**

 - Attack loan: End up debt free after year 6. Also, save &lt;= $500 annually with interest write off.

or

 - Ignore loan: End up with $315,000 in savings after year 20... with $30k taxes owed.

Can someone give me more insight into whether one or the other is the best route to take? Obv. I think I prefer option 1.",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"Hello all, I don't want to take too much time from you all in reading this, so I'll try to keep it short but could give more information if necessary.

My wife and I bought a condo right before getting married because we hated the idea of renting. I was the first of my siblings to purchase a home so I kinda had no idea what I was doing and purchased with a 7/1 ARM even though we planned on keeping the house long term and renting it out after eventually upgrading to a larger home. However, when planning for the future, we've determined that it will take us 8-10 years to save up a 20% down payment for a more permanent home. We live in Orange County, CA so housing is really expensive. We could save up much faster, but traveling is a priority for both of us so we set aside enough for a big vacation every year as well as some smaller getaways. That 8-10 year period of savings for a down payment would put us in our mid to late 30s.

This past summer we were forced to move across the country where my wife matched for a 1-year pharmacist residency program, so we've been renting our house out. With interest rates increasing, we've been mildly freaking out and want to refinance to lock in a relatively low, fixed rate as rates continue to increase. Unfortunately we'd have to refinance as an investment property because it's currently being rented out, which gives us much worse rates. A couple lenders I've spoken to think it's a bad idea for us to refinance since we're not living in the house. For what it's worth, our current 3.125% rate is locked in until January 2022.

Our options are:

1) Refinance now at a slightly higher rate (4.25-4.75%) and play it safe locking in a rate and increasing our monthly payment only a couple hundred a month (still less than what we're charging for rent). Keep the property long term as a rental property after we upgrade.

2) Wait until the summer when we move back in and refinance then (risking drastic increase in rates)

3) Not refinance and sell the house in a few years and use the money from that sale to fund our down payment on a larger home.

4) Refinance now at a slightly higher rate (4.25-4.75%) and play it safe locking in a rate and increasing our monthly payment only a couple hundred a month with the intention of selling the property in a few years to fund our future down payment. Just in case it's a down market at the time we're looking to sell and decide it isn't a good idea to sell.

5) Any options I am missing?

Thank you all for your patience and opinions. I am doing my best to become much more adept at these sorts of financial decisions!

personalfinance,"Late 20's, terminated yesterday, have 8+ months of living expenses in emergency fund, and no debt. Should I look for a new job, try to earn a modest income online temporarily instead, or look into furthering my education. Also have health issues, and a kid.","Thanks in advance for any advice you can give. Really sorry for this wall of text and endless back story. Anyone who reads this and replies with advice or even their own life experiences is a freaking saint.

  I was just terminated from my job yesterday afternoon. The pay wasn't great for the amount of work required, but I really did love my job and I liked my coworkers. Unfortunately, I can't get work in a similar field without getting certain degrees or licenses, and I have a feeling my former employer might say or do something down the road that would impact my chances of getting hired by anyone else anyway. There is literally no job competition for the field I work in; the very nature of the job, if done successfully, will make it obsolete one day, and one organization, the one I worked for, runs every branch in two counties. It's partially federally funded, and organizations in similar fields frequently collaborate with my former employer. So, job prospects are not looking good for me in this field.

  Part of me is freaking out at the idea of not having a stable income and wants to apply to basically any and every available job right away, especially since I have a kid and I'd rather he'd not experience the same issues I did growing up poor. There's a lot of factories and businesses in my area that are hiring, most paying the same or more than what I was making. Another part of me is trying to focus on the fact that I have over 8 months living expenses saved up, no debt, and exercising a little extra frugality, could expand those 8 months into at least 10 months expenses, so I don't need to rush into any type of employment just yet. Although, I would not wait the full 8-10 months before getting a job.

  I'm considering getting more education to stay in my current field. However, there's the issue that going to school to get a degree or license of any kind just to stay in this or a similar field would put me in debt. My ""8 months expenses"" would be more like 4, and the rest going to tuition for the first year, and I would still need to get a job so we won't be homeless while I'm in school. 
  
I also have some health problems that have been an issue since I was a teenager. I'm prone to getting colds and viruses easily and often, a minimum of once a month. I get severe nausea pretty regularly, often suffer from vertigo, light sensitivity, pain, etc. It happens a few times a week, usually. It made my attendance at my former (very flexible) job suffer, which contributed to my termination (although it wasn't the only reason), and I can see it severely affecting my performance at any job I apply to in the area, or even with making it to classes on time. My doctor hasn't diagnosed me with anything, and since my blood work and tests mostly come back in the range of normal, and I ""seem"" healthy, she ignores my complaints, and just follows up a few months later.
  
Instead of getting a job immediately, or schooling, I am considering doing some temporary hustling like selling things on eBay/Amazon, which I've done before with mild success, maybe offering services on Fiverr or Elance, or branch out into other fields of work online. This might be a good solution to my problem, as my health issues wouldn't affect working from home as it would having to do a 9-5 on the other side of town, plus there's the savings on gas money, ordering lunch, and afternoon babysitting. Although, if I'm not even 1/3 of the way to replacing my old income by 4-5 months, I would start putting job applications out.

What say ye? Warmer than average weather driving construction activity?  The continuation of long term economic acceleration?  Or simply optimism over the new era of prosperity being ushered in under Trump? 



U.S. Jobs, Wages Show Solid Gains in Trump's First Full Month https://bloom.bg/2mPf5rT

E: because nobody clicks links here's a quick blurb:



&gt;Payrolls gain 235,000, driven by construction, manufacturing

&gt;Average hourly earnings increased 2.8% from year earlier

&gt;U.S. Adds 235,000 Jobs in Feb., Jobless Rate at 4.7%

&gt;U.S. employers added jobs at an above-average pace for a second month on outsized gains in construction and manufacturing while wage growth picked up, as the labor market continued its steady improvement in the new year.

&gt;The 235,000 increase followed a 238,000 rise in January that was more than previously estimated, the best back-to-back rise since July, a Labor Department report showed Friday in Washington. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent, and wages grew 2.8 percent from February 2016.

&gt;While unseasonably warm weather may have boosted the payrolls count, the data represent President Donald Trump’s first full month in office and coincide with a surge in economic optimism following his election victory. The figures also validate recent comments by Federal Reserve officials that flagged a likely interest-rate increase this month.

&gt;“We’re getting closer and closer to full employment,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “Wages had been the one sore spot in the labor market data, and I think that’s coming through here. With inflation accelerating I think we’re going to start to see even stronger wage growth down the road.”",finance

personalfinance,27 year old male-- trying to build a financial future. $14.10 an hour/$1602 take home a month. Anything I can be doing better budget wise?,"Just for the sake of transparency; I made some poor financial decisions in my younger days, but I'm attempting to rectify them. This is my monthly budget of expenses, my brother was supposed to help me double-check my work, but he's been busy. Anyways, to the hard facts;

27 year old male, next to nothing in savings (just started building my emergency fund, text form budget)

**$14.10 an hour/$1602 a month take-home.**

**Expenses:** $1,290 total.

**Food** - $200.00. 

**Audible** - $15.00 a month. 

**Rent** - Technically $260.00. It's $420.00 still, but I'll go over this down below.

**Student Loan Y/X** - $50 &amp; $33 respectively (income based repayment plan started a month ago).

**Fun allotment** - $75.00. I'm over assigning this category since I don't buy many games anymore, but I want to be as realistic as I possibly can.

**Travel** - $144.00 in gas a month. 

**Credit Card Payment** - $120.00 on 15% interest rate. (Total: $1,631)

**College Repayment** - $120.00 a month ($1,100 left)

**Gym** - $36.00

**Phone** - $36.00

**Insurance** - $40.00 (this just recently got kicked down last week, from my horrid full coverage insurance of $120.00 a month, ew).

**So a few caveats:** 

**Rent** - My rent will be $260.00 a month. I had a car repair bill come out of the blue thanks to winter (car slid and really screwed up the passenger side front wheel by hitting a curb). 

I'm very handy with car repair, but a service like this required access to a lift and tools I couldn't afford to purchase. 

Took it to a repair shop to have it fixed: $2,100 overall. It depleted my starting emergency fund ($300.00), put $200 in cash, $1k on credit card and my brother had to pay $600.00. I had to ask him to cover part of food/rent for that month, as I couldn't come up with the money to pay it. Overall, $980.00 total owed to my brother.

I have him take out in cash $260.00 per month for rent starting officially last month, leaving the current balance of $720.00. 

The way I have this setup in my head right now: if I pay back my brother near immediately, that frees up an additional $260.00 a month, which I can then use to kill Credit Card while minimum paying everything else. 

**My current savings/where my money is being divided:**

I opened a interest-yield checking account with NorthPointe bank. 5% APY but only if you meet a certain amount of restrictions, which I believe are do-able for me; 16 debit card transactions a billing cycle, aggregate amount must be $500.00+. Electronic statements (done). And finally a direct deposit of funds or an automatic withdrawal of $100.00 more per billing cycle. I just signed up for this about a week ago, still waiting on my debit card. In the interim I opened the account with $100.00 so I could earn the standard rate of 0.005% that I wouldn't be earning with Chase anyways (in case I can't complete the requirements for the 0.05% this month.)

**Ally Savings Account:** 1% APY, restarting my e-fund. I opened the account with $60.00 (not much, but it's a start). I'm currently working on percentages for my monthly income that I can safely auto-deposit into my Ally Savings Account. When I get my debit card for NorthPointe Bank I'll be re-setting up my direct deposit to automatically cycle to these two accounts. A bulk majority to my NorthPointe account so I can get that nice 5%, anything safe that I can spare will go to Ally. 

**My question to you folks:** is there anything I can be doing better in regards to saving money here? I'm trying to be realistic with my budget and nail down any unnecessary expenditures. It looks like I may need to bite the bullet and get a part-time job during the evening hours. I have a few hobbies that churn out a few additional bucks, but it's nothing substantial to help income.

Recently I tried a mystery shopper thing as a side-gig but getting payment from them on time is like pulling teeth. Debating weekly plasma donations (3x) to pull in an extra $105.00 that I can assign to debt, but I'd like to not use this option if at all possible.

My 1 year anniversary with my current company is coming up, so I can expect my income to go up $0.50, but still not substantial. I'm actively looking for other positions that pay more, but so far no luck.

A bit about my College life. Junior year student with a yearly GPA/cumulative GPA of 3.5. I don't have a degree. Due to how my tuition was setup at my university I ended up (in that last year) not being able to afford my books, or living expenses. Got a job at a factory 5-10 miles down the road (biked there) but ended up passing out on the factory floor due to lack of nutrition. I was eating a box of pasta a week, if I got lucky. It wasn't a good time in my life. 

When I left my university they slapped a fee of $2,800 for leaving classes near the middle of the semester and would not release me from this debt. The $120.00 a month is for that. It's now down to a manageable $1,100 so I'm seeing some light at the end of my tunnel! After that I can get my transcripts from my University and get back into school.

My current work-place offers a 5k tuition reimbursement for IT/Business classes only, so I was planning on taking them up on their offer. I always wanted to go to medical school (that's why I went to the College I did) but the expenses for the overhead are just too much for me to cope with.

Anyways, that's my story (a long one and I'm sorry for that). I really wanted to cover all my bases and provide as much information as I could about my situation. Thank you all for your helpful eyes and responses. Let me know if I can provide anymore information.

3000 in checking account that gives 3% APY up to 15000$

3500 in savings account that autopay car payment (basically 6 months worth of payments)

2500 in checking account to pay upcoming bills

My goal by the end of the year was to fill both checking accounts to 15000$ to have an emergency fund of 30k$ in liquid cash (that still has a mild 3% return).But after that (or before if you have a better idea) I do not really know what to do next. I am keeping in mind that we are going to try to have 1-2 children in the next 2-3 years so my expenses will increase.

There are some things I have considered:

1. Her 401k match starts next year, so I will max out the match.

2. Upping her and my 401k to the maximum, however I am not 100% sure what the federal max is or how to actually know I hit that number.

3. I'm not sure how to open or start a Roth IRA

4. Refinance house to 15 year at 3.6%? I am worried about going this route since my expenses increase as I have children and the upfront cost of doing so.

5. Pay off car early?

6. Something I have literally 0 to do with currently is investments/stocks. I have no money outside my 401k in this and I have no idea what I am doing or how to go about this.

7. Financial manager?

Let me know if you have any tips for me, I feel like I am reaching a point where I am not really comfortable anymore managing finances. My goal was to always hit 50k in liquid cash and have only a house payment which I should be doing in the next year or so, but after that I am completely lost. Let me know if you have any tips or ideas on what I need to do. I don't want to just keep stockpiling cash and pay off my house for no reason (I am even considering just going completely debt free).",finance

personalfinance,How to manage credit cards with high APRs?,"Hi Personal Finance!

First, I'd like to say that this subreddit and all of the advice I have read here has changed my life. I grew up in a very poor part of East LA and there was never financial advice to be learned from those around me as my family lived paycheck to paycheck to scrape by and be able to put food in our bellies. I wanted to break the cycle and I could not have gotten as far as I have without you all! (I mean, I have a savings account for the first time in my life! It's measly, but it's a start!)

Now - to get into details.

I make $41.6K a year. I am not living paycheck to paycheck thankfully (broke the cycle!), but I also do not have a large amount of disposable income. I have student loans and credit cards that I am working on paying off, and other debts which thankfully do not accrue interest. So, naturally, I am focusing on the debts that accrue interest.

The debts with the highest interest are three credit cards and I am trying to gauge my options. I opened my first when I was 19 to try and build credit. That was going fine, although I was spending more than I should have and should have left more of my credit line unused in case of an emergency. I say this because an emergency did happen in January of 2016. Due to a multitude of external circumstances compiled by my being ill-equipped and underprepared, I lost my car to repossession, was stuck in an apartment I could not afford alone, my electricity and internet were shut off, and even Top Ramen was becoming an expensive diet. Trying to save my car and stay above water with my bills, I got two additional credit cards after I maxed my first one out. All three of these are closed as they were maxed out and I was late on payments for a couple of months, so they ended up way over their limit.

Yikes.

So, now I have the following three credit cards:

Capital One CC (open)	
APR: 25.40%	
Current Balance: $1,681.85
Credit Line: $1,900

Chase CC (closed)	
APR: 23.49%
Current Balance: $975.50
Credit Line: $1,000
*This one was over by almost 50%. I recently got it down below its credit line which was my first goal: get all credit cards below the credit line

B of A CC (closed)
APR: 21.49%
Current Balance: $635.79
Credit Line: $900

One thing to note is my credit score is not the highest... FICO score is currently 571 (it was lower by over 100 points this time last year, so I've really been putting in work thanks to advice I have read on this sub).

My goal is to use the method where I tackle the highest APR first, now that I have gotten all three of these credit cards below their credit limit. I have been researching about consolidating credit cards balances/transferring balances/taking out a loan with a lower APR to pay off these credit cards, and I would love some input from this sub on those who have had experience with this process.

Thank you so much in advance!

EDIT:

Adding a couple of notes here:

- I have a budget sheet. It is organized per pay period for all of 2017, including my minimum income for that pay period (not including overtime as I do not want to count my chickens before they hatch), every bill that lands within that pay period, and a budget per pay period for groceries, personal, etc. I reconcile every transaction in my bank account with this sheet so I know if I went past my budget in any category within a pay period.

- I also have a sheet of my debts. It includes every debt, contact numbers, interest rates (if applicable), and projected payoff of non-interest debts, including a sheet per debt where I track how much I paid per month and how much interest was accrued (if applicable).

- The two closed credit cards are not sending me to collections, so long as I make at least the minimum payment on the card.

- My first goal was to get all of my credit cards below their credit limit, while paying as much down across all three as possible. That goal has been met, so I am now trying to figure out the best plan of action to tackle these three credit cards given my (not so great) situation.

- By paycheck to paycheck, I mean to survive, not to live comfortably. I am, for the first time in my life, not worried about where I am going get the money to pay my rent, eat, etc. I am aware that I am not in a great position and that all of my disposable income (minus contributing to an emergency fund) should be directed toward these debts. My difficulty is how to do this the most efficiently.",finance
personalfinance,Reasonable credit increase request?,"Hi everyone, long time listener, first time caller...

I have had a credit card with my bank since I was 18 (currently 20) with an interest rate of 12.75%, and a limit of $300.

solar,Is this normal? I'm a landowner looking to lease my property for a solar development farm and I received this Sustainability Consulting Agreement.,"So as the title suggests, I own ~1,000 acres of pasture land in south Texas between San Antonio and Houston. I'm really interested in leasing portions of my land for solar development, so I reached out to the Texas Solar Power Association (txsolarpower.org) And asked them to point me in the right direction.

I then got a call from a woman who said she was contacted by the TSPA and that she was to be my consultant. I couldn't talk with her for long, so I just asked her to email me as much information as possible. She said she'd send me a ""Sustainability consulting services agreement"" and that it would show everything she would take care of. Here's what it consists of:

I have $1,600 to pay off some credit card debt, and I'm trying to decide which of my cars to pay down. For reference, I have the following cards and balances: 

 * BoA - $445 (limit of $500) - 20.74% APR
 * Capital 1 - $685 (limit of $750) - 23.40% APR 
 * Capital 1 - $2,242 (limit of $2,300) - 25.40% APR
 * Synchony Auto card - $757 (limit of $1,000) - 0% APR for 4 more months

As you can see I've been running some pretty high balances and that's one main reason I'm looking to put this money towards this. 

Would it be best to pay that entire chunk towards the Cap 1 card with the highest balance? Or would it be best to say, pay of the lower balance Cap 1 card, the BoA card, and then most of the Auto card? 

I'm just not sure what's going to do the best for me and figured I would ask.

Thanks!

personalfinance,Purchase a House From Family,"My wife &amp; I are considering buying a house from her parents. The house is great - old charm, good schools, near parks, walkable to downtown, etc.

We haven't fully talked through the details of what purchasing from her parents would look like - infact we're probably a year away from it - but it sounds like they would sell it for the lower-end of market value, which just happens to be within our target range.

FWIW - we currently live in California, but would purchase the house if/when we move back to Michigan.

This has been a long-term 'fixer upper' home - no one has actually lived in it for ~10 years, and it has appreciated a lot in that time.

Coming at this from the perspective of trying to maximize the benefit to both parties - limiting taxes and limiting interest on a mortgage - is there anything we should know about buying a house from family?

- Taxes: any tax benefits/implications from doing this within a family?

- Inheritance/Gift - my (limited) understanding of the federal inheritance tax allows families to bequeath ~$5.5MM before being taxed... any chance to use this?

- Rent-to-Own: could this be a way to cut out the interest on a mortgage?

personalfinance,Questions about my finance advisor advice,"My wife and I have always been pretty responsible when it came to finances, but in the last 2 years we decided to raise the bar.

She has pension through CalStrs and a 403b with no match. We are maxing out her 403b bc I don't trust the pension plans to exist through our retirement.

I have a pension through Kaiser that I trust a bit more than CalStrs, but I also max out my 401k.

Since we started contributing more money, I decided to get a financial advisor/manager; trying to manage investments on my own seems overwhelming, and since using the planner our investments have averaged 11% (which I know won't last, but its been almost two years, so I have been very satisfied.)

I recently spoke with her about saving to remodel the kitchen that brought up some interesting discussions that I wanted this communities opinion on...

She recommended refinancing the house and taking out 30-40k for home improvements. Our current mortgage is 390k @ 3.75% interest rate. She seems confident that the refi would have ~4% rate and that investing the money into retirement accounts would yield much larger results than saving $300/month and paying for the remodel cash. 

Does this make sense to do? It seems like the math adds up, we would get to enjoy some remodeling now, but I wanted more than just my brain on this. I'm not super knowledgable about this and I don't want to make a big mistake.

Also, she recommends an umbrella policy, which I have never really read about in any advice pages. Maybe I'm reading poor material.

Lastly, she doesn't recommend buying a car anymore. According to her leasing a car saves in the long run due to maintenance costs, and also has the benefit of newer cars. I am a content man; I drive an 15 year old Honda Accord that I will drive into the ground (but it has starting limping which is why I'm saving for a new one). Is it really a consensus that maintenance on newer cars is so expensive that leasing is the better option?

personalfinance,Student loan refinancing questions,"Hello all,

So a little background before my question:

I'm currently in the process of refinancing one of my student loans and have a few questions. As of now, the loan I'm looking to refinance has a balance of ~$70,000 with an interest rate of 7.25% (fixed). I've applied to refinance with a couple of places and have narrowed it down to the two that seem like the best option. The best interest rates I'm being offered are between 6.14% and 6.27% (both fixed).

Now, my question: Is there a minimum rate reduction that must be met to make refinancing worth it. Or in other words, is the ~1% reduction in my rate worth refinancing for?

Also, I have another small student loan (~$5,500) with an interest rate of 6.8% (fixed) that I'm looking to pay off, assuming I can reduce the rate of my larger loan with the higher interest rate (above). So assuming I do refinance the larger loan, would my $5,500 best be spent paying off the loan with the smaller balance but higher interest rate ($5,500; 6.8%) or should I put the money towards the larger balance with lower interest rate ($70,000; 6.14-6.27%)? Obviously, if I don't refinance the money would best be utilized putting it towards my highest balance and highest interest loan above.

personalfinance,Small Inheritance and Taxes,"All - Looking for some thoughts on a recent situation.

My husband and I yesterday received a small inheritance from a distant relative.  Approximately $1,200.  Along with the check came a note stating that it must be reported on your taxes, and if you've already submitted taxes, then you have to file an amended return.

We have already submitted both our federal and state taxes, and have received both refunds.

If we do go and do an amended return, where would we amend it?  Would we add $1200 to our income?  

Our state, Oregon, has Estate Tax but not inheritance tax.  Montana, the state in which the deceased person is from has neither.

So why do I have to amend my taxes?  And out of curiosity, if we received this money in 2017, why do I have to include it on my 2016 return and go through the amendment process?

personalfinance,Question about loan repayments,"Using a throwaway, appreciate any advice! I'm graduating from graduate school this summer and have a staggering loan total (and unfortunately no career due to a change in career options). My principal loan total is $235,000 and I have $40,000 in interest accrued since starting school. My question is in regards to a gift of $50,000 I am fortunate to receive from family.
Is it more logical to pay off the interest accrued in sum before it capitalizes, or should I allow it to capitalize while using that $50k to pay off the highest interest loans first instead? From what I understand, the interest of a loan will be added to the principal value and will have compounding interest, correct? So this would make me feel that the higher interest loans should be paid first. My average interest is 6.4%, but I have about $140k spread between 6.8-7.9%.

Tl;dr: Pay off accrued interest before it capitalizes first, or use the same money to just pay the higher interest rate loans since all interest compounds (is that correct?)?

In October MEFA contacted me telling me that they needed paperwork verifying that I am a full-time student or I was going to need to start paying back on my loan. After a lot of running around and getting paperwork from different places we finally discovered that since I was out of school full time for 6 months, MEFA now viewed me as a graduated student and was expecting payment.

My parents have told me that they cannot afford to pay more than they are already, but they are willing to stop paying the federal loans interest and put that money towards my MEFA loan, and I can somehow figure out a way to come up with what amounts to about $150 a month in price difference. Obviously this means that I would now have a large loan growing in interest that I could not do anything about until I graduated and was able to start paying it back. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this when working with MEFA - the person I talked to stated that there were no exceptions on private loans but both I and my parents have no experience in repaying loans like this I would really appreciate any outside help from someone who has experience in this. I didn't have a choice in leaving school for the year and returned as soon as I was able, so is there anyway to work with MEFA on loan payments or contest my graduate status in this kind of situation?

I'm interested in the Lexus because of its reliability and the fact that it's a nice car. I don't want to ride around in a beater, although I don't exactly need a luxury car. I want something that I feel confident riding around in, that I enjoy, and the way I justify this to myself is that if the car is nice enough I won't get the itch to buy a nicer car for at least 4-5 years - getting the most out of the car. 

My financial situation is OK, but in flux. I have recently received a job offer that increases my COL adjusted take-home pay by 35% and I'd be getting a $13k sign-on bonus as well, which I plan on socking away in an emergency fund. 

Gross Annual Income: $60k

Net Monthly Income: $3770

Monthly Side Income from Web Design: $150

Current Bank Account Balance: $5700 (before the down payment on the car)

Student Loan Balance: $23840 at an average rate of 4-5%. I pay $315 a month on these

Rent+Utilities: $1000

Credit Card: I use this for subscription services only so my monthly balance is always under $200.

Groceries/Dining Out/Drinks: This fluctuates and I don't stick to a budget, but I forecast about $1000 a month on these. I could definitely be a lot more frugal here if I tried. 

Question is, what should I do? I really like the car and I need to make a decision soon. I am daunted by taking on such a large debt but I am also really uninspired by economy cars like corollas, civics, etc. I feel so torn, like on the one hand I'd like a nice car and on the other I don't need it and it's a huge expense. 

Please let me know if there are any questions you have. This is the biggest financial decision I've made yet and I want to make a decision that I'm happy with. Thank you in advance.",finance

The first option is 15 Years,	Variable 3.78% intrest and	$354.61	monthly payments.

personalfinance,Need quick advice on strategies on sequencing paying off some debt,"OK, I have a not-terrible problem with having received some money and I want to figure out the right sequence and/or amounts to pay off some credit card debt to maximize the benefits. 

I just settled a car accident case and netted about $65,000. This will not touch all my debts, which include prior year tax debt on a payment plan (manageable) and student loans (manageable.) What I've decided to do with this is to pay credit card debt.  I started my business, which is profitable, on credit cards and use them to pay for business expenses, so more than half my credit card debt is tax deductible anyway. What I want to do is maximize my FICO score and consider improving the cards I'm holding.  I'd also like to eliminate my balances, but I also may need to keep some cash on hand.  

I have the following: AMEX gold which has about a $2000 balance. Citi Preferred Diamond MC with about a $3000 balance on a $19k credit line (this was previously a $14k balance I already paid, but too recently to have affected FICO yet.) B of A Alaska Airlines ""Signature"" Visa with $17k on a $23k credit line. (ugh).  I have two smallish student loans, but their interest rates and payments are so low that I'm not necessarily wanting to touch them. I have a very large federal student loan that is indexed on the RE-PAYE program and its payments are also very manageable, but it's always going to depress my FICO a bit. 

My FICO is about 715. I'd like to bring this up at least 50 points. I'm probably coming into a bit more cash this year, and I'm planning to use it as a down payment on real estate.  I also need to get my teeth fixed (~$20k). 

I haven't really done much credit card shopping. I've had all the same cards for 13 years, and in the case of the Citi Card, for something like 27 years. 

Questions: 

1. Let's say I pay off the B of A down to $2k or so, and use a 0%  balance transfer option I have on that card to move the remaining Citi balance to that card, which will keep it under 30% utilization.  Will my FICO be the same as if I paid it all down to zero? 

2.  Are the benefits of moving to AMEX platinum, which they keep offering me, enough to justify the fee? 

3. Are there any real benefits to an AMEX corporate card vs. the personal card, where I primarily use the AMEX for business these days? 

4. Should I get away from B of A and/or Citi altogether?  I've moved most of my business spending that isn't just paid out of my business accounts to my AMEX card because the rewards are better, but not everyone accepts AMEX. Are there better VISA/MC to consider? [edit: as for example, should I consider moving ANY of these cards to a corporate card if there are any advantages? I can  pay them off, but cash flow isn't really a problem.]",finance
personalfinance,"I'm a medical student that may have an opportunity to save 100k in debt, but will delay career by 1 year. Worth it?","Hey /r/personalfinance, thanks for reading!

I'm a medical student who may have an opportunity to do a year-long internship at my school. That will obviously delay my graduation from 4 years to 5. In return, the school will cover almost 2 years worth of tuition (~100k), as well as provide a ~20k stipend for living expenses for the 5th year. 

-My tuition is ~55k/year

-Living expenses are ~20k/year

-Total debt upon graduation without internship: ~300k

-Total debt upon graduation with internship: ~200k

-Some of my loans are private loans at ~3% interest, most of my loans will be federal student loans at ~6.5% interest.

-After I graduate, I will be in residency for about 3 years making roughly 45-50k/year, and after that when I'm a practicing physician I'll be making about 200k/year.

I am starting grad school in September and was looking for some tips on how to deal with my undergrad student loans.

Some background:
$22,000 undergrad - federal
$4,000 undergrad - Perkins

About $10,000 of the federal are unsubsidized and will collect interest while the rest are in grace while I'm in grad school.

I have some (not a lot) savings - should I focus on using these savings to pay off some of the unsubsidized loans with higher interest rates, continue making regular payments until I stop working at my full time job at the end of August (about $60 a month on IDR, my balance is 0 but I always pay around that much), or use the savings as an emergency fund/for the future/for things I may need while in grad school?

OR do I scrap all of that and start paying more each month - $250-350 - and forgo putting that money in my savings account?

Thanks in advance for the help!

Forex,Why the market's reaction to the Non-Farm Payrolls data this week is a giant red flag for the upcoming FOMC and beyond.,"The market's reaction to the March NFP was absolutely the opposite of what you would anticipate on the face of the data alone. NFP headline beats expectations handily, and yet the USD sells off with vigour and enthusiasm. 

When events like this happen, you will see a variety of reactions. Finance press talking heads and uninformed trading journalists will cast about looking for fine detail in the release, or other news factors to explain the reaction. Amateurs and professionals alike will mutter things about ""market irrationality"". Most will shrug it off and turn their attention to the upcoming week, or even just the weekend. For some, though, it's very loud and clear message from the big end of town, and it says ""pay attention!""

Firstly, let's review the data itself.

  * **NFP Data breakdown**

Data Item | Expected impact on USD 
:-- | :-:
Headline +235k vs 197k Consensus | Firmly Bullish
Prior 227k. Revised to 238k | Bullish
Unemployment rate 4.7% vs 4.7% exp. Prior 4.8% | Bullish
Average hourly earnings 0.2% vs 0.3% exp m/m. Prior 0.1%. Revised to 0.2% | Neutral/Bearish(1) 
Average weekly hours 34.4 vs 34.4 exp. Prior 34.4 | Neutral 
Participation rate 63.0% vs 62.9% prior | Weakly bullish
Private payrolls 227k vs 193k ecp. Prior 237k. Revised to 221k | Bullish
Manufacturing 28k vs 10k exp. Prior 5k. Revised to 11k | Bullish 
Government 8k vs -10k prior. Revised to 17k | Neutral
 
^^(1) This is subtle and debatable, but one could interpret the flat trajectory of AHE as evidence of weaker than anticipated wage inflationary pressures. At best it's a slightly weak facet of an otherwise strong report.

Obviously this are just my interpretation of the data, but to be clear, I'm trying to represent what the *mainstream market conventional wisdom* would say, and not my own personal opinion on the economics of the situation. I think that it's a pretty non-controversial representation.

Secondly let's look at the currency impacts:

* **Spot FX market response to US NFP data**


Currency Pair | Market Response
:-- | :-:
EURUSD |     Unequivocally and powerful bearish USD  
USDJPY |    Significant price conflict, ultimately somewhat bearish USD    
GBPUSD |    Mixed picture, ultimately weakly bearish USD  
USDCAD |  Bearish USD with partial recovery  
USDCHF | Bearish USD but reasonable support of USD  
AUDUSD |  Bearish USD  
NZDUSD |  Bearish USD but reasonable support of USD  
USDMXN |  Bearish USD   
XAUUSD |   Bearish USD  

This is *exceptionally noteworthy*.

A NFP headline that met expectations and only inspired a neutral USD response would be very noteworthy alone, but to see such vigorous selling of the USD across the board is giant neon sign that something is afoot.

It is also very telling that there is divergence in the responses with each currency pair. Particularly telling is that sentiment regarding EURUSD is markedly different to USDJPY. Putting together the reaction to the news profile can give you a good idea where a currency stands versus the US dollar, and what the bank's plans for it are.

* **So what does this mean?**

It means that *something is afoot*. Exactly what that might be is less clear cut than analysing the response as per above.

A good item to check  for more information is the Fed Futures Fund sentiment: http://cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html

After NFP, it rose to over 90%, so it couldn't be more clear that the market is essentially absolutely certain there will be a rate hike.

This leads us to the most face value interpretation of events:

The market expects a rate hike at FOMC, however the major players believe that the pricing in of the hike has been overdone, and are now selling off. The likely outcome of this is that FOMC day sees a rate hike, USD soars on the announcement, only to be driven down either immediately, or in the short term, as banks/mega-fund take profit and rebalance portfolios.

A far less likely interpretation, but one that will surface should a USD sell off eventuate, is that ""they know something the public don't"". Either that there's not going to be a rate hike, or that the US is about to have a major political risk event. Both are plausible given current events, but I would not rate these as sensibly tradeable theories given that one can account for the same event sequence with a conventional and very vanilla financial theory: the USD is simply overbought with respect to the underlying like future capital flows.

Even more unlikely, but still possible is that this is market manipulation to try and catch the market offside for a further bull run with the rate hike. The NFP data release is a vulnerable point in the market where people are willing to inject large amounts of speculative capital based solely on what price is doing at the moment, rather than having any long term bias. Money in a few minutes, and you don't care which way price rolls. This makes it much easier for major players to convince speculators (and speculative HFT algorithms) to roll a certain way, just so they can get better position. I'm not convinced this is the case here though, usually that sort of manipulative activity is reserved for 'mid-importance' news. If this is the case, then there will be  limitations to how far the market is driven in a certain direction, and one would expect certain technical barriers to be preserved. 

It's also worth noting that the mix of responses lends itself to interpretation. USD weakness against EUR and the commodity currencies, but significantly lesser against the JPY and CHF suggest that the market view is that the global environment still favours Risk On over Risk Off positioning. 

* **So how should you trade it?**

Do I look like a millionaire to you? I made more comment karma than money trading last week, and that was just one upvote on a /r/C25k post.

Besides, I can't tell you how to trade your system. What is important, though is that if you are asking how to trade this, then you have a deficiency in either your trading system or your analytical system. Because these events occur reliably in the market, and you need to have some systematic way to deal with the knowledge, which includes ignoring this as ""funnymentals"". 

Additionally, this is just one data point, albeit a very, very significant one in my book.

Stay safe out there USD bulls, and good luck to those who want to ride the countertrend waves should they come to fruition. Already the EURUSD is attacking critical longterm down trendlines, and the AUDUSD is setting its sites on reversing what should have been a powerful bear breakout. Of course, the market's underlying sentiment can also turn on a dime, usually at the expense of yours.",finance

I'm going to go ahead and throw out the numbers and hope for the best. 

Really quick, in 2012 I had a relationship end while I was unemployed. We had a total debt of $20k at the time. I had taken ownership of a little over $16k. We were living in an apartment costing $1600/month. I had lived there for a few months then paid a $1200 fee to leave. By late 2013, I had a little over $18k in credit debt. 

     Income &amp; Bills

Monthly income: $2,370.00 

Monthly Student loan payment: $312.00

Total monthly bills for rent, car, utilities: $1138.00

Total monthly credit payments: $200-$700

medical debt remaining: $1200.00

     Budgets are set for:

Daily Meals: 20$

Monthly Gas: 70$

Monthly Entertainment: 50$

     Interest accrued from all accounts over the years:

 2013 - $1112.52

 2014 - $1115.12

 2015 - $1098.53

 2016 - $1029.79

Total: $7650.54 
 
  
The interest accrued over the years equals well over half of the debt remaining. 

     PROBLEM: 

With the BofA promotional interest rate expiring later this year and the security of my job becoming unstable due to a recent company merger, I need to plan for the worst. 

I have a 401k that, almost every year since 2012, I have taken out a loan from. I know this isn't a great idea, especially with how well the market has been. Right now, this is my only backup plan. I have no other savings. If I lose my job, I will cash this money out and take the 30% tax hit. 

In 2015 I had looked into options such as debt settlement, debt consolidation and even bankruptcy. I do not own a home and my car is a lease. Asking friends or family for money is out of the question. 

     OUTLOOK: 

By the numbers, things look good. Going from 18k in credit debt to a little over $7k in 5 years is pretty good. Going from $31k in student loan debt to $26k is also pretty good. Managing to afford moving expenses, lease break fees and enough discipline not to overspend on games, Chinese food or various dinner outings over the last 5 years, is also pretty good. I was able to reduce my student loan payments from 312 to $175/month just last week. So, this is pretty good. (My income driven payment plan had expired and I was able to move to another plan type where my payments increase each year.) 

     GOAL: 

My goal for this year is to finally rid myself of the debt I had taken on 5 years ago. I am thinking of getting a 2nd job.


Am I on the right track to pay $8k in credit debt within the next 9 months? Are there other options outside of savings accounts that could help me survive should I happen to lose my job? Also, just generally, how well/bad does it sound like I am doing? Any tips, tricks or guides are much appreciated! Thank you for your time.",finance

Bitcoin,"After further thought, a bitcoin ETF is totally unnecessary.

Second. There are a lot of traders who want predictable spikes to cash in on. They want an ETF only for that event

Bitcoin is a global commodity or currency that the privately owned Central banks like the Federal Reserve see as a potential threat. They have unmatched ability to influence governments and their agencies such as the SEC. All governments can eventually work with a common currency and free themselves from the power of the bank owners.  

Fractional banking is destroying your currency value and making the central bank owners rich but this is temporary. Many countries are reaching a point of insolvency and will be required to either devalue their currency or tax their citizens beyond their imagination.

I was wondering if the community could give me some advice to get into a fairly balances portfolio.  

Mind that I’m in Europe (BEL), but I never invest in European companies (reason for that is a separate discussion, unrelated to my question).  

Besides that, I’m currently crawling out of a deep hole of personal issues that left me broke (essentially went from 'well off' to 'zero' because of some unforeseen circumstances).  

I’m 41 years old, have little over 20k to invest, I want this money to be ready for my next of kin to have a start in life as good as possible in 15 years or so. I'll take care of myself with the rest of the money coming in.  

My current position : I cut all expenses to the minimum, swallowed my pride a live with relatives now, I have no debt, I don’t smoke, I pay all my bills, never go on holiday, never dine out expensive and I save every Euro I make after the basics are paid.  

The 20k are in a portfolio for now as follows:  
65%  emergency fund (cash account with 0.01% interest rate)  
10% VIXY  (pure hedge against bad times, but I know that’s not normally used for long term)  
5% SCHB (bought at 52$)  
13% Disney (bought while back at 106$, long-term holding, keeping for as long as I can)  
7% in bitcoin bought at 250$ or something  

I calculated the value as the value at the price I went in, not the price it is now. So the VIXY went down considerably by now, the Bitcoin went up and so on…  
My first idea was to lower the emergency fund to 6k and reinvest the rest in SCHB and QSR evenly divided.  
Companies I really like:  LVLT, KO, SONC, PATK, MGM and EFX  (I helt all these in a previous life, to my joy)

personalfinance,Should I build a healthy emergency fund before I start attacking my student loan debt?,"Hey everyone, mid-2016 I started taking my personal finances more seriously. In the past 6 months I've paid off around $5,000 in credit card debt, I have $2,000 left (should be paid off by May). Once that's out of the way I'm going to start attack my student loan debt which looks something like this:

Private - $65,000 (@30 years)
Federal - $30,000 (@ 25 years)
Parent Plus - $8,000 (@ 10 years)

I'm planning to attack them in that order and keeping them separated though I may consolidate the private loans as my reduced interest period is ending.

**My question** to you is would it make sense for me to build up a healthy emergency fund first?

Right now I have $6,500 in a savings account, and an extra $3,000 in my checking (it could be moved to the savings, but I'm moving it over slowly). If I lost my job tomorrow my monthly expenses could be cut down to $3,000 ($1,750 is rent) so my target savings for my emergency fund is $18,000. I should be able to put between $1,400 and $2,000 per month into the emergency fund so I think before the end of 2017 I would be able to support 6 months of expenses.

It will likely take me 5 years to fully pay off my student debt so I don't know if it really makes sense having a partial emergency fund available for that many years, especially since I will most likely be moving across the country in 3 or 4 years.

They're the type to spend any money they get and are constantly asking us for money; none of us mind giving them whatever they need if we can, but we've all decided that we want to start saving for them. 

Our plan is to open a savings/retirement account that will grow over time.  There are 6 of us and we would each pay ~$100 into it monthly.  We want to be able to pull from it when they ask for money, so we're not having to save for them and spend on them.  My questions are:

1. What are things to look for in savings/retirement plans that would be best for this situation? 
2. Should we open a savings account to put money into and checking account to pull money from? 
3. Is there any truth that opening a savings account is better at a Federal Credit Union over other banks (like Chase)?",finance
personalfinance,Shopping for a mortgage?,"I have recently begun looking for a home and I understand that the first major step is to get qualified for a home loan. 

* How do I go about this? 

* What should I be looking for? 

* Will getting qualified be a hard or soft credit inquiry? Is there a way to find out about how much I would qualify for with different lenders without getting a hard inquiry? 

* What are the most important aspects of a loan? Comparative importance of interest rate, ability to only put down 5%, mortgage assistance, PMI?


Some potentially important background for me is that I'm low income and could qualify for mortgage assistance programs to help provide 3-5% down payment, but that would need PMI for the full length of the loan, and interest rates of upper 4-5%. 

An alternative loan program I've seen has been no PMI if I put down at least 3% (I don't remember the interest rate though).

personalfinance,Consolidating Student Loans Through A Private Lender. Need Help &amp; Advice,"I currently have 54k in Federal student loans and have finally reach a point after college 7 years later where I am able to pay them off consistently on a 10 year plan but the interest rates are killing me.  The interest rate ranges from 6% to 7.65%

A large bulk of it about 20k is at a 7.65%.

I've done some research on consolidating privately and it seems you lose some federal benefits including discharge of loan obligation upon death and forbearance options if you can show economic hardship. 

I've also read you can get good rates if you have decent credit and a somewhat high income.  Which I do.

I'm wondering if the benefits of consolidating are worth giving up those federal benefits.

personalfinance,How can I refinance my private student loans right after graduating?,"I recently graduated with student debt and now I need to release my parents as cosigners. They need to move and aren't able to get approved for a big enough loan to buy a house due to my loans. 
I am married and we are using both of our incomes to make payments on our loans. However, all of the banks and refinancing programs I've looked at only take into consideration my individual income and not our combined household income. My income is tiny.  Additionally we just graduated so there isn't a record of consistent payments beyond the last three months.  Often applications also look at length of employment and I just started working three months ago. 
I've checked rates and it looks like without a cosigner, my interest rate will nearly double. 

We want to avoid having my husband cosign my loans because then his loans will double and his credit score will go down. 

Does anyone have advice for how to release my parents from being cosigner of my private student loans after making 3 months of payments using my husband's income primarily?",finance

1. What does the bond market typically do when interest rates go up?

personalfinance,Financial Planning,"Hey guys, so I've read up on a bunch of stuff but I'm still a bit confused on what I should do because I guess my situation is a bit funky. I dropped out of college this year and I'm currently working as a stuntman.

I already paid off a 1k debt to my school with my tax return but I still have 20k in federal loans I need to pay off. I started working as a stunt performer for an amusement park and its a 9 month contract and I haven't decided whether or not I will renew my contract because film/tv jobs pay more.

So I've done a rough estimate on my expenses and its around $600 a month, and I'm going to be making around $1,800 month for now but that might increase because my summer hours will change in June. My job offers a 401k but I do not know if its worth it because we don't make that much to begin with and I might not even be with them for a second season.

I was reading about Roth and Traditional IRA but I do not know which is better for me. I also do not know how I should save or invest my money because its not like I make a consistent annual income.

EDIT: Also one of the guys who was on the stunt team last year said he made around 17k total but this years team got a pay raise and we might be making a bit more than that.",finance
personalfinance,IRS sent me a letter asking for a Form 8962 and copy of 1040A for tax return with turbo tax (California). Need Help.,"Hi Everyone! 

I submitted a tax return with turbo tax for the first time this year, usually my dad does my taxes but this time I wanted to do them myself. I think I might have messed up on something and I am worried I won't get my federal tax return, I already got my state one. 

When I was filling my turbotax form out online, I encountered the health insurance page where I put I didn't have health insurance (when I did) it was really dumb of me because I just wanted to get the process over with and I didn't have the 1040A form at the time, again really stupid of me. Anyways I proceed to finish and submit. Everything was great until I got a letter in the mail from the IRS asking for a copy of my 1040A and 8962. I go and get everything, both forms I have on hand right now I can mail it in right now! 


The problem is that I am on a shared policy plan with my parents and brother and turbo tax needed my SLCSP. Basically asking me the allocation percentage for the tax credit for everyone on the policy. I read more about it and found out it can be from 0 to 100% and again I wanted to get it over with, I put 0. Turbo tax then said ""Congrats your tax information for health insurance matches our previous records"" (it was something along those lines) and it generated my 8962. 

TLDR; Got a letter from IRS for 2 documents. Submitted taxes without the documents and already got state return. I get the forms and now Turbo tax basically said that what I entered before in terms of tax credit for health insurance (without the 1040A form) matches what I entered now (with the 1040A form). I am assuming everything is good and I can submit the forms to the IRS. I wanna know if what I did was right with putting 0 as my allocation percentage. Please advise!",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan and Credit Card Debt Consolidation/Refinance...?,"Hello All,

I'm five years into paying off my student loans totaling ~$30k (private and federal) and have been able to pay above the minimum consistently. I also have ~$50k in credit. I left my job two months ago and my credit card debt has quickly jumped up to ~$10k. It's frightening. I've started a new job and can make the payments (hopefully a bit over the minimum), but is that the wisest thing to do? I've been getting mail about personal loans to decrease the interest. I also get mail about consolidating (I think that's what the idea is...) my student loans. 

So Guize, what's the best way to go? Just keep paying and eventually get there? Or, should I move this money around in some way to get the lowest interest in the long-term? Can I combine my credit card and student loan debt to get a lower interest rate? What expectations should I have in terms of the rate I get? (credit score 658)

Thank you if you've read this far.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm taking steps to further my career but I already have 38k in federal student loans. Husband has 19k. What should I do? (Long, sorry)","Here goes. I currently work as an assistant pre-k teacher and I love it. This is what I was meant to do. I look forward to coming to work every day and I love my students. 4 and 5 year olds are hilarious. I also greatly enjoy working with my lead teacher. It's awesome to have a co-teacher though I know that the older grades will most likely not have two teachers in the same classroom. The drawback is the pay. To give you an idea, I made just under 15k last year according to my tax return. I'm hourly and I don't get paid for summers or Christmas break. I always have to scramble and figure out how to pay for summer. 

Here's my background. I have a BA in English from 2011. At one time, I wanted to become a writer and/or publishing editor. That did not work out. I bounced around until I applied for an assistant teacher position in a daycare with 2 year olds. I realized I loved it and eventually moved up to pre-k. I've been teaching for a little over two years now.

I'm now pursuing certification to become an early childhood education teacher. My hope is that I would teach kindergarten or first grade, maybe second grade. Though I know that you don't always get to choose the grade you teach. I'm also considering teaching English and/or Language Arts since my BA is in English. I would have to take the GACE English test for that but I'm not too worried about it. However, older kids make me nervous because I'm not used to them. I'm just used to dealing with 5 year olds. Anyway, I'm getting off track. 

I live in Georgia. This morning, I took the GACE Early Childhood Education combined test and I passed Test 2 at the professional level. Waiting on scores for Test 1 because it had a constructed response question. After I take the Georgia Educator Ethics Program Entry assessment, I can start applying for teaching jobs and hopefully a school will hire me on an induction certificate. Once a school hires me, I have three years to convert my non-renewable certificate to a clear, renewable certificate. 

I have two options for that. Apply for a Master of Arts teaching program and get my Master's degree. Though I'm not sure of my chances of getting accepted to the program. My final GPA in college was 2.72 (I was going through some personal issues which affected my schoolwork but I digress.) MAT programs usually want 2.75 minimum. Even if I get accepted, I fear that I will have to take out more student loans in order to afford the degree. 

My husband is currently in school for his bachelor's in criminal justice. He's a corrections officer right now and he's trying to become a police officer. His student loans are federal and are about 19k right now. 

Another option for me is to do the GaTAPP program. It's more streamlined and it's faster. Cheaper too. Tuition is a total of $5,500 for the provider I'm looking at. It would get me a clear, renewable certificate. But no Master's degree. And I have to admit, I want the Master's degree. Plus with a Master's, you get a higher salary. 

I think that's about it for now. If I need to provide more information, please let me know. And if you read all this, I am very grateful. What should I do? Should I take on more student loan debt and try for the Master of Arts in Teaching? Or just do the certificate-only GaTAPP program? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Which student loan repayment plan is the best in my situation?,"Not sure what to do. Here's my situtation.

- I have about $156,000 in federal grad school loans with an average interest rate of 6.75%. I'm on the graduated repayment plan currently and my monthly payment is about $1,100 for the next 2 years.

- My average monthly take home pay is about $4,500. My other major expenses:
* Rent (LA, CA): $1400
* Car Insurance: $150
* Transportation: $300
* About $12K on a 0% balance transfer until July 2018. To pay this off in time I have to allocate about $800/month.
* Groceries/Toiletries: $300-400
* Internet/Phone: $150

This leaves about $200 left over, which terrifies me. My biggest priorities are to pay of my student loans, build a safety net, and contribute to my 401k (I only contribute 1% now).

My ""safety net"" today is around $1,500.

**Question: Refinancing options** My monthly student loan payment under PAYE/RPAYE would be $450. This would give me an extra $650 a month to put toward my safety net, but I know the interest on my loans would accumulate like crazy. It's forgiven after 20 years, so assuming I make the same then as I do now (WHICH I HOPE ISN'T THE CASE!!!) then I'd only pay $108K of my loans. But who knows where I'll be in my career in 1, 5, 10 years???

I've shopped around for refinancing and I got pre-approved for a 20-year fixed 6.09% with a monthly payment of $1130 (only $30 more than my current payment). This doesn't help me build a safety net, but my student loan interest won't go crazy. And I'll pay it off in 20 years. BUT I lose the protections of the federal program. :(

Either way I’m going to be paying for a long time. Should I take the extra cash now, or guarantee my loan interest stays in check? I don't know what to do.

**Budgeting**. I'm definitely going to move when my lease is up in July so I can pay hopefully &lt;$1,000 in rent. Moving closer to work will ding my transportation costs in half. So that's an extra $500-600 to my Safety Net, which will help.

And I am very lucky that I'm eligible for about $10K in take home bonus (but it's not guaranteed!). So that's not in my budget, and 2 paychecks aren't included either (because I'm payed bi-weekly). This stuff I'm going to use as Safety Net if I get it.",finance

I called the number they gave me last year, but it's freaking automated and even though I give my adress etc. I never recieved anything and finally I got fed up with dealing with it so I never filed last year.

Is there anyway I can fill it out online or something, print it off and mail it out the IRS that way? Preferably, for free?

I currently have it set where I only pay what I owe with slight wiggle room just in case.

personalfinance,(SWE) What happens with my adjustable rate housing loan in case of a market crash?,"Preface: I'm not a finance guy and I might be talking out of my ass.

In Stockholm, people have theorized about a housing crash for years upon year and the real estate prices has just kept growing quite fiercly. Here's my situation:

* I am a newly graduated student in my first, but quite high-paying job.
* Renting is crazy expensive in Stockholm and getting a first-hand contract takes 8 to 20 years of queueing (ie. not an option).
* I'm thinking of buying my first house within a year or so.
* I will be taking a quite hefty loan but there is little worry I will ever be unable to pay the interest+mortgage.

I can choose the readjustment term of the loan to anywhere between 3 months to 10 years but it has historically been much cheaper to keep it at 3 months since the rates have been steadily decreasing. At the moment, the rates are at around 1.5% a year for 3 month readjustments and 3.5% a year for 10 year readjustments.

Assuming that the housing market becomes unstable and crashes soon after I take the loan and buy a house, could someone walk me through how the process would affect my interest rates? I hear that they stay low during a recession but what if the market instead of a full blown crash just slows down and real estate starts losing value a little bit at a time for a prolonged peroid of time? Is it ever wise go for 10 years of fixed interest rate even though it's 3 times the current rate? I'm looking to get into investing as soon as I have this housing thing figured out so I'd like to predict how much I could save for that in the future.

personalfinance,[28M] Recommendations on HSA Fund Choice,"Hi PersonalFinance,

I have an HSA through PayFlex and have crossed the $1,000 account balance limit to start investing it. I would greatly appreciate your advice on which mutual fund or funds to choose to invest in as well as how often to do so.

The list of currently available funds can be found here: https://www.payflexdirect.com/FinancialCenter/Accounts/HSA/InvestmentsV2/BNY%20Investment%20Performance.pdf 


For now, I'm looking at the HSA as an alternate retirement account and am willing to assume a bit of risk with it. I'm currently leaning towards the Vanguard funds such as VSMGX or VSMAX or the 2055 target retirement fund RFKTX.

My health plan deductible is $1,500 which I can either keep in the HSA account earning 0.05% interest or pull from my emergency fund/checking if needed. I'm single with no dependents and healthy so my health care costs are pretty minimal. 

PayFlex has a $2/month maintenance fee for investing which I'm pretty disappointed in. I've been to https://www.hsasearch.com/compare/ and there are many HSA providers that do not charge a fee. Would any of these providers be a better choice? 

Thank you!

Graduation is in two years, hopeful job is in the actuarial field. Median entry level is about 65k. Area is Pittsburgh.

This may lessen as the classwork gets more difficult, but I still have the opportunity to make a conservative $500+/week during the 3 month summers.

A real estate mogul who comes in often scoffed at my idea to put 20% down, fearing PMI cutting into margins. Rerunning the numbers, I see what he's getting at. Combined with the advice of the businessman  (and if I can find a bank to finance the project) there are a wealth of cheap four-unit properties in the neighborhood of 150k in the area. By putting a minimum down payment in order to keep a healthy slush fund for emergencies, the monthly payments for 170k at 8.5%/15 yr are roughly the same as 320k at 4%/20yr.

personalfinance,"Questions about wage garnishments, dealing with federal creditors, and bankruptcy. [Long]","So back in 2010 I joined the US Military. I had recently left college after financing my four years primarily in Navient and Dept of Ed loans. I spoke with a representative of the Dept of Ed on the phone prior to leaving for boot camp, and he informed (in fact promised) me that my loans would be placed in deferred status upon my starting active duty the day I got to boot camp and would stay that way until my discharge.  

Unfortunately this never actually happened, and my accounts all became delinquent and eventually defaulted. I never once received any mail or phone calls from the Dept of Ed during my 14 months in the service. Several months later, nearly two years after the original phone call, I received a letter informing me that I had defaulted on everything and that the Dept of Ed would take a lump sum payment or begin pursuing other options. I called repeatedly and informed them of my (lackluster) income and of the call and promise I had been given. They never listened or cared about the original call as I had no proof of it, and they only once offered a payment plan, but at a rate higher than 60% of my monthly income. I kept trying but no one would offer payments I could meet, and kept insisting upon payment in full. Eventually on the (probably bad) advice of someone I trusted I let the loans be closed, and after which they started falling off my credit report.  

Fast forward to today, nearly 7 years after the original call where I was promised the accounts would be deferred, and my *parents* (I don't live with them) received a letter addressed to me stating the following:  

&gt;You have failed to respond to a previous Notice of Proposed Wage Garnishment sent to you by the U.S. Department of Education (Department), which included a demand for payment on the outstanding student loan debt held by the Department and detailed the steps you otherwise must take to defend against garnishment of your wages as payment toward this debt. As a result of your non-response, the Department will order your employer to begin withholding 15% of your disposable pay every pay period until the balance is paid in full. The unpaid principal portion of the balance noted above will continue to accrue interest. Your employer will be required under Federal Law to comply with the order.  You may still exercise the right to contest this action as cited in our original Notice of Proposed wage Garnishment. However, because you failed to comply with the terms of the previous notice, your exercise of this right will not result in the delay of wage garnishment.  

I never received the original notice, nor was I even aware the Dept of Ed was even still pursuing collection of these loans. They are no longer on my credit report, are listed as closed with a $0 balance, and it has literally been years since I last had contact with a representative. I had been attempting to go to school again this fall, and have already been accepted to a university. However, I had been planning on paying for the tuition with the GI Bill. As I understand, you can't use the GI Bill while you have federal loans in default, but the loans have been closed for several years, so I figured I had a chance.  

This leaves me with several questions:  

* Is it legal for them to issue a notice/garnishment like this when I never received the original notice they are referencing?
* How are they issuing judgements on debts which were closed and are no longer listed on my credit report?
* I have considered filing bankruptcy before, but even in extreme circumstances as mine it is supposedly nigh impossible to discharge student loan debt now. Is there any leeway in this regard?  

I may have more questions than this, but I am honestly so completely taken aback by this I don't know what to think. I never liked not paying these down, but I never was given an option, and now I feel like I am pretty well financially screwed for a long long time, as without the GI Bill I can't afford school, and my employment opportunities don't seem to even pay much of the principal under such garnishments (if the garnishment takes effect I will take home less than 13k/year).  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Cash Savings vs Debt advice needed,"I have a question that about my debt vs savings that I’ve been struggling with for some time and my specific plan to address it.

I have roughly $48k in debt and close to $30k in cash savings. The debt is spread across several CCs ranging from 12% - 19% APR.

I know logic, and many posts on this forum, dictate that I should pay down as much of the debt as possible however something about having the security of that amount of savings (in case of emergency or something) has prevented me from doing that. Instead I’ve continued to pay for that security through the interest on my CCs. 

My thinking now is something along the lines of:

* Get a loan with a much lower, fixed interest rate for the total debt amount from someone like SoFi, lending club, etc..
* Use that loan to pay off all my CC debt
* Use half of my cash savings to pay off the SoFi loan (this would also significantly improve my credit score)
* Keep the other $10k for an emergency fund
* Budget to pay down the remaining SoFi loan over the asap (i.e. 12-24 months)

Inflation is just not happening in the US, due to Quantitative Easing. As a result, Gold is still overvalued, especially if the fed now continues to raise rates, which I expect will occur. **Bitcoin will rise with an interest rate hike because unlike Gold, there is further upside in the capital value of Bitcoin**, so the need for some type of yield to offset it is greatly reduced.

personalfinance,I am a non-resident alien and USPS lost my tax return form,"Hi, I was in USA as a J1 Work &amp; Travel participant during the last summer. Normally a lot of people tend to file their tax returns via tax professionals but I have decided to file them on my own since they request more than 1/3 of my eligible return. And before you ask, foreigners are not eligible for free e-file. The only option is good ol' postal mail.

Well, the state tax form has been delivered to its destination successfully. But I cannot say the same thing for the federal one. IRS requests non-resident aliens to send their returns to Austin, TX 73301-0215. It was okay until the mail reached to local post office, first they tagged it as ""Undeliverable as Addressed"", then ""Business Closed"" and finally ""Departed USPS Facility"" and that's it. It has been dead since 25th of February. I googled the local post office and apparently it is notorious with losing people's mail and not answering the phones and even the local congressman cannot do anything about it. I have filed an electronic missing mail form on USPS' website but I have pretty much given up hope since government-enforced postal service monopolies are pretty much the same everywhere around the world.

What are my options at this point? I read somewhere that I might be eligible for an automatic extension since I am out of the states, is this claim true? Would there be any penalties since I thought USPS which is the government's de facto postal service might be a good idea for filing official documents in the first place?

Filing a 4868 by mail does not really make sense, since I can just file 1040NR-EZ again instead.

Worst case scenario I might choose one of the private delivery services such as DHL but IMO their prices are ridiculous (100 - 150$ for simple mail).

personalfinance,Where should we put our money for a house?,"Hey there! My husband and I [26/27] both started our first ""real"" jobs after grad school in the last year.

After the loans, we'd like to start saving for a house. My question is where should we put the money for the down payment?

personalfinance,Should I refinance my mortgage to lock in a low interest rate?,"My wife and I are about 2 years into our mortgage. Here are some facts: 

• 7 ARM

• 3.25% rate

• Remaining principle: ~$200,000


This is our first house, which we bought in November 2014. I wish I'd better understood how absurdly low interest rates were at the time, as I probably wouldn't have gotten an ARM. Now a couple years down the line I'm a little more knowledgable about this, and this seems like it was probably a mistake. 

I'm considering refinancing into a fixed 15 year. Some googling indicates the rate we can expect to be between 3.75-4%, which I feel better about than the uncertainty of the adjustable rate which will kick in 2022. So we would get to preserve the relatively low interest rate, and also get the benefit of a 15 year amortization schedule rather than of a 30 year. 

However, I'm unsure which is better: the shorter amortization schedule at a slightly higher interest rate, or the lower rate at a longer repayment schedule, plus the uncertainty of what will happen in 2022. 

Right now our monthly payments are about $900. Between the two of us, this is very, very affordable. The 15 year at 4% would raise that to about $1500, which is still very comfortably in our budget. 

Of further interest is that we received a gift of $30,000 from her parents with the specific instructions of applying it towards our mortgage principle. Even though at our current interest rate there are easily better vehicles for this money, it's still a gift horse I'm not going to look in the mouth. We expect to get another $20,000 at the end of the year for the same purpose. 

If we apply the $30,000 towards the principle before refinancing, that takes our expected mortgage payments down to about $1200/mo. 

Given the costs associated with the refinancing, should we try and lock in the present interest rates? The idea of owning our home outright is very appealing, and I'm starting to regret using an ARM.

Any advice would be appreciated.",finance

I've never keep a strict budget but have always tried to be responsible with my money. I don't like to owe money but it's sometimes a necessary evil in life. When i graduated college in may 2013 i had 12 grand in student loans and within a week of graduation i was back living at home and working a full time job as a temp in a factory to pay off my student loans. Every cent i earned went to paying that off, thanks to a loan i got from my maternal grandma for 3 grand i was able to pay off the 12 grand days before the interest kicked in at the 6 month mark. I payed my grandma back 3 months after that. I was let go as a temp but a month later was offered a full time position with the same company. I purchased my first car in the spring of 2015. i put down 7 grand and financed the rest with a 6 year loan with a 1.9% interest rate. That fall i moved out of my parents house in ny and moved into a two bedroom apartment in nj with a roommate. ( i couldn't find anything affordable in NY that wasn't farther from work then i already was ). Due to some unforeseen circumstances that occurred early 2016 such as an emergency trip to eastern Europe to see my hospitalized paternal grandmother (she's ok now) along with some legal issues with the the state of nj and some other things i've raked up about 9 grand in credit card debt. I've just finished resolving the legal issues and would like your help to figure out a budget that i can live by so i can start saving for the future and pay off the credit card debt as quickly as i can.

My monthly take home is 2365 and since it's a union job i get medical/dental/vision coverage thru the union. I pay 815 a month in rent, 282.08 for my car, and 241.63 for car insurance (i'm working on lowering it). 40 a month for utilities (fluctuates with use) another 42 for my phone and 22 for streaming services. After paying those i'm left with 929.29 for groceries, gas, miscellaneous expenses and my credit cards. I have 4 credit cards, 2 are from chase, 1 is the amazon rewards card and the 4th is a pc richards card which has nothing on it. Thanks to my tax return i was able to pay off one of the chase cards this week. Currently i owe 5015.17/5500 (owed/limit) on the amazon card and 4295.86/5000 on the other chase card. Right now i have 9321.83 in credit card debt and another 9528.39 left on my car loan for a total of 18,850.22 in debt. I'm not worried about the car loan because i have 37 months left on it and my interest rate is 1.9%. It's the 9321.83 in credit card debt that i'm having trouble making a dent in, but paying off 1 out of the 3 cards i owed money on will help with paying off the other two. I currently have 125.64 in my checking account and 1367.16 in my savings and id like to start planing for my future but can't do so without getting the credit cards off my shoulders.

Please let me know if there is a more appropriate place to post (new to reddit)! I have about $15,000 saved up that I want to put towards my loans. This is money that I have saved and does not include my emergency fund. 

My initial thoughts were to pay off A, C, E and then start paying extra on loan D with the money that would typically go to those loans. After A, C, E, I was thinking I would pay off D, B, G, F (in that order). This is more of a snowball approach.

On the other hand, I could make a nice dent on loan D and put all $15,000 towards that loan and potentially pay that one off in the next 2 years. Then, I would pay off the others in order from highest to lowest interest rate (avalanche). 

My question: Which strategy is best or is there a better application of my $15,000?

personalfinance,Too conservative? First time home buyer - looking for advice on monthly mortgage payments,"I am a FTHB shopping in an aggressive housing market. I have a base income of $121K and about $130K in cash set aside for a home purchase. My fiance makes about $70K per year, and has about $60K in savings. We have no debt other than a small amount of student loans (&lt;$5K at sub 5% interest rates). We are currently shopping for our first home, and having some challenges determining the ""right"" monthly budget to set aside for a home. There are a couple scenarios we are considering:

* Continue renting at about ~$1500 per month. We're in Seattle, this is a low rent and allows us to continue setting aside cash. Unfortunately, with Seattle's fast growth, we may risk being priced out of the housing market if we wait a year.
* Try to buy a house outside of the city that is closer to our rent payment. Homes outside of the city may not gain as much equity in the long run.
* Purchase a home we could see ourselves living in for 5-15 years at about $550K at 20% down. Monthly payments would be +$1K from what we're paying now, depending on property taxes.
* Be more aggressive and look for housing in the 600-650K range. This would push our monthly Mortgage+Insurance+Taxes (PITI) to the $3K+ range. While this is less than a 1/4 of our gross pay, it feels high. Am I just being too conservative?

Ideally I'd like to have a monthly payment that would be comfortable on my income alone ($7400 a month take-home). At $3K a month my PITI would be 40% of my take home, which feels aggressive but do-able. Am I right in thinking this is too much? Will I feel ""house poor""?",finance
personalfinance,Never Get Blocked at the Pump Again,"Here are a couple of tips to avoid the headaches of a blocked credit card. 

A few years ago I was at a gas station slipping my credit card into the slot over and over again. The pump declined my every attempt. When I got home I learned someone got my credit card numbers and started buying clothes at a store in Atlanta. I live in Seattle. The company said it would take seven to ten days for me to get another card. I only had the one card. 

The next day I went to my bank and withdrew some cash for gas and food for the next several days. Then I did two more things: 1) applied for what I call the ""online-only"" credit card and, 2) withdrew $200 in cash. 

I used to have one credit card I use for everything, shopping at local stores and buying things online. Now I have two cards. One is my everyday card used at local shops to by gas, food, etc. This card has to work every time. I never use it to make online purchases.

A few years ago major department stores like Target and Home Depot announced their credit card services were hacked. Since I shopped at those stores, I immediately went to my bank and asked for a new card. I wanted to banks to block the cards before the thieves had a chance to use them.  I have a third credit card that acts as a backup for my everyday card.  It sits in my desk draw and is only used while I wait for the replacement of the everyday card to arrive. 

My online-only credit card is used only for online purchases. I leave it in my desk at home. This card backs my PayPal account.

Chase Slate (as far as I can tell) would be perfect and is recommended all over... except you can't transfer from another Chase account.  I'd prefer a card with 0% balance transfer fee, 0% for 12+ months, no annual fee.

personalfinance,How are 401K contributions actually taxed? Slightly advanced question.,"I elected 100% of my bonus to go into my 401K this year, ad I excepted SS and Medicare to be taken out of that amount, which they were,but then federal, state, and local taxes were then applied on those FICA deductions. 

Here is the [statement](http://i.imgur.com/YcL5LtX.png). 

Is this correct accounting? That is to say FICA deductions are considered taxable income? This makes quite a difference in how to think of 401K contributions. Instead of them being deducted 7.65% for FICA, in this case the actual effective deduction was 12.5%. 

Googling around does show that FICA payment are essentially non deductible. Which makes the following statement true: Cost of your 401K contributions is 7.65% FICA plus your marginal tax rate on such FICA withholding. 

The point here is to understand the actual immediate cost one needs to pay for income deferral.",finance

personalfinance,General Portfolio Advice (25 year old Urban Single Male),"When I graduated from college 3.5 years ago, my net worth was -$45K (student loans). I am now in a better place, but looking for any / all advice to optimize my portfolio after having made some mistakes along the way:


- 401(k) = $3.8K

- Roth IRA 1 (BRK.B) = $0.5K

- Roth IRA 2 (Betterment) = $24.1K

- Traditional IRA (Betterment) = $14.9K

- Investment in Small Startup = $1K

- HSA (Credit Union, 1% interest no fees) = $0.5K

- Betterment Investment Account = $14.8K

- Wealthfront Investment Account = $15.1K

- Wealthfront College 529 = $0.6K

- Robinhood Stock Picks = $5.7K

- Bitcoin = $7.3K

- Ethereum = $2.3K

- Bank Account (1% interest) = $20K

**- Total Assets = $111K**

**- Total Student Debt (6.8% interest) = $26.4K**

**- Thus, Net Worth = $85K**

I've thought time and time again of paying down more debt out of my pile of cash (only generating 1% interest a year), but every time I'm about to do so, I look at my returns on Bitcoin and Ethereum and see how they are by far beating my interest rate on my student loans (doubling/tripling every year since I've owned it), and even my other investment accounts are doing better than the 6.8% interest rate my student loans are charging.

Another thing I've heard - home ownership. Home ownership would be an obvious move, but my life is too unstable (I work in the finance sector, bouncing from major city to major city, planning to move to a high-growth Asian country next year).

I'm still right on track. I've had really bad months, and I've had really amazing months, but I'm exactly where I should be overall.

Now, this year I'm getting a tax return that is sizable for my income level and industry. I'm getting nearly $2600 back. 

My debts are as follows, and yes, many of them were poor choices I'm still paying for. 

*  9.24%    Credit Card 1: $1900

*  8%    Student Loan: $9500

*  3.74%    Car Loan: $12800

*  Variable   Credit Card 2: $980 ish

*  Variable   Credit Card 3: $1900 ish

*  NA    Medical Bill: $150

Now, I am keeping part of that tax return for play money since I allow myself very little play money during the year. However, I've been looking at my month and if I refocus my payments for the month, I believe I can almost completely pay off the remaining balance on my Credit card #2 and #3 as well as obviously completing the medical bill. All while keeping my $300-400 for play money.

However, my brother is getting after me for not following Dave Ramsey and setting aside a $1000 emergency fund first. I'm following more along the lines of a Mr. Money Mustache post I read on the same topic. 

I feel like if I have $1000 in savings I'm losing money due to interest rates on my bills. I also feel like since I do not plan to close the credit cards they can be a backup ""emergency fund."" I've been clawing my way out of debt and would be VERY hesitant to put a balance on them again, but in the event of a TRUE emergency I COULD. Whereas, with cash, I feel I'd justify it more.... Because I ""need"" this or that. Also, those variable rates can go as high as 22% or something ridiculous, so I feel not paying them off ASAP is detrimental... 

I'm just wanting other opinions. My brother has been financially aware and financially responsible far longer than I've been attempting so I tend to listen to him.... but this time I feel he's wrong.

personalfinance,Pay taxes or invest in IRA,"Longtime lurker first time poster. I have to say a lot of these posts are great read. Anyway, i have a situation and was hoping to get your input. As the title says, should I pay my taxes or invest that money in an IRA. Sounds crazy, right? Hear me out. 
Last year I was self employed for the entire year. I calculated my estimated taxes but due to unforeseen circumstances I only made 2 of the 4 quarterly payments. Both of those payments amount to a little bit under $3,400.  I managed to save $2,500 anticipating this would be the remaining amount I would owe. Perhaps a couple hundred over or under. Now, my traditional IRA is in dire condition to say the least. A little over $6,500 to be exact. So my question to you is, should I take the $2,500 and invest it in my IRA and thus lowering my gross income by $2,500 and therefore end up being taxed on a lower amount or should I just have that money to pay the amount I will end up owing on my federal taxes and start investing smaller amounts in my IRA? Of course if i invested the money I would start saving again as much as I could from now until April 15 in order to pay for my taxes. I'm married, the wife is a homemaker and last year I made around 54K. I may be totally off about reducing my gross income and being taxed less and if I am please let me know. Thanks.",finance

Few tidbits:

* We have a 3 month emergency fund
* We've saved up so we can have 5k in the bank for ""home repairs"" (outside of the emergency fund), enough cash to furnish the house, and enough to cover a rough estimate of closing costs
* We put ~8-9% into retirement (sadly though, I don't have an employer match)
* My wife only works 6 days a month, and we have a 16 month old kid. Ideally, she doesn't have to go back to work more than she wants. I don't see her stopping all together.
* We are not putting any more away for the kids schooling. My hope was to get retirement up to 15% first.
* When I do all the math if we buy say a 250k house, we've got about 11k for a down payment or ~5%.
* Completely debt free (cc's paid off every month)
* Currently renting and because of the school system in this city *need* to be out of here 2020.
* My income should rise pretty consistently for another 5 years. Job security is solid.

My concern is putting down so little (5%) compared to what I had planned all my life (20%). But now matter how I massage the numbers, even with PMI included, the presumed increase in interest rates (which I have at ~4.5% Q4 2017, 5.16% Q4 2018, 5.92% Q4 2019, 6.13% Q1 2020 (this is when I'd probably get up to 20% down payment, for comparison)) offsets the money saved by waiting for the 20%.

I'm a month away from paying off my credit card balances, which is the largest burden off of my back, but now I'm looking at my options for a student loan that I had to allow to go delinquent about a year ago, and also outstanding medical debt not yet reported to the credit bureaus.

For the student loan, particular loan servicer assessed their own fees on the loan balance, bringing it to about $1675.  The amount that I can consolidate into my existing federal loans (of which I am on an IBR for and have very low payments on) is about $1150.  I'm not sure what would happen to that extra ~$500 in fees that the servicer charged if I choose to consolidate.

The medical debt totals about $1800, which I'm making regular monthly payments on until I can make an offer to settle.

I have a 401k that I haven't touched in about a year that totals to about $3700, which I can round down to $2590 after taxes should I choose to cash it out.  Now, before someone messes their pants over the thought of cashing out a retirement account, I would feel infinitely better about paying off debt instead of saving for retirement at this time.  I still have a lot of years to save, so, I'm genuinely not worried about my gumdrop buttons.

I'm planning on using the funds to pay off both debts, but if I am able to consolidate my student loan and pay off the servicer to remove the delinquency from my credit report, the rest I am able to roll over into my current 401k.  Naturally, I want to go with the least expensive option, but the decision is weighing on me because I am desperate to move out of my mother's basement.  It makes dating quite difficult.",finance
personalfinance,$110k Student Loans at high interest. Need advice.,"Hi /r/personalfinance. Am I screwed? I feel screwed.

I graduate in May with about 110k in student loans. About 30k are federal, and 80k are private. My interest rates extremely high right now (between 7% and 9%) so I fully expect that I will refinance after I get my degree in a few months.

I would be in mental turmoil if I didn't line up a job after graduation. I have a bachelors degree in computer science and got a job as an associate software engineer. I'll earn 72k with medical benefits, stock options, and a 4% match on my 401k.

I've been making budgets and planning as best I can, but I'm overwhelmed and unprepared in finances. Overall my strategy is to refinance at the lowest interest rate I can (my parents can't contribute payments, but they will cosign). Live off as little as possible. And pay everything I can towards the loans (after the 401k match, and maybe my stock options?). Specifically I expect my income after taxes to be $4500/month. My expected housing ($800), car lease ($200), food ($300), and other expenses ($300) should bring it down to $2900/month. And I expect there will be some things I don't account for, but ideally I want to pay at least $2000/month towards the loans.

So my questions are...

How concerned should I be about this?

What should my approach to refinancing be?

Can you offer any other advice on anything I'm missing?

I don't like admitting it, but this is taking a mental tool. So any kind of reassurance would go a long way too.",finance

I (23, M) recently graduated from college and got my bachelors degree (Liberal Arts, Focused Psychology, Sociology, and Criminal Justice) with over 100k in debt (went to a smaller private school, at the urging of my father). I have been looking for a job, but so far have not had much luck. I currently work at a fast food restaurant as a manager, making above minimum wage, but I'm struggling to make my monthly payments on my loans. I had about 2k saved up in savings, but I've had to use that to pay my loans, and soon I'm not going to be able to afford them.

When I was taking out my loans, originally I was going to take them out from Sallie Mae, but my father suggested that I take them out from our bank (Citizens), as they offer student loans, and claimed that because we were part of the bank, we would receive a better rate. However, we found out later that this wasn't necessarily true. As a result, my loan payments are fairly hefty every month (about 1k a month).

I also have some federal loans (Stafford loans), and they offer me many different payment plans so that I can adjust it based on what I'm making, and how much I can afford to pay. However, our bank doesn't offer any sort of service that I can find on their loans, and I'm struggling to keep up.

I would *really* like to refinance because I feel like that would make the most sense in my situation, however, my father decided that he does not want to help me out, including cosigning so I could refinance my loans. He is allowing me to live at home, but that's pretty much it. (I live in Michigan)

*Note: Most of my balance transfer options and/or consolidation options are at a higher interest rate than my current cards at my credit.*

Credit Card Debt: 
* $500 at 0% interest currently, 23.5% v commencing 6/1/17
* $3,100 at 14.7%
* $6,230 at 21%

Student Loans:
About $30k: 
* Direct Subsidized Stafford $4,758.33 4.500%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford $2,687.97 6.800%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford $1,043.21 4.500%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford $6,599.97 6.800%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford $5,110.31 6.800%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford $5,711.63 3.400%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford $3,983.30 6.800%

Back-taxes:
* About $5k, on monthly payment plan on $50 per month - interest unknown? 

Fixed Costs: About $2500/month

Income:
* $832/week at PT job (32 hours/week for 3 month contract)
* ABOUT $375/week at PT (hours vary, $37.5 per hour)

After taxes I take home about $4k/month for these next three months –– after these 3 months, I'm not sure what I'll be making.

If I had to guess, the payment plan would look this way: 

* Pay-off the 0% CC that is about to go to 23%
* Next, pay minimum on 14.7% CC while paying as much as possible on 20% CC (about $600/month?); then pay the remainder of 14.7% loan off
* Continue paying monthly tax amount ($50)
* Defer student loans until CC payments are paid off, then begin monthly payments again –– utilize additional money to pay down taxes more aggressively/begin a savings?

I know this is kind of a mess, and even more so messy because one of my incomes is W-2 and a short term contract, while the other is 1099 and varies week to week. Any suggestions would be appreciated!!

personalfinance,[Taxes] Wages reported to Duplicate State(CA),"I moved to Arkansas on May 28th (residency established with lease) to take a new job with HPE. My position started June 6th, so as far as I know I should only owe taxes to Arkansas for this position. HPE provided 2 W-2's, one with my correct wages and correct state information to Arkansas, and a duplicate to California. My wages have been reported to both Arkansas and California which obviously needs to be fixed.

The problem is HR is fighting with the tax dept over this. The tax department refuses to fix anything until my personal information is fixed, but HR has already fixed the problem. So the ticket has been opened and closed constantly for the past month and the tax department wont fix it.

I attempted to file a W-2 complaint with the IRS, however after talking with multiple people, they refuse to file a W-2 complaint for state errors on the W-2. They will only file a W-2 complaint when the federal portion contains an error.

I have contacted the California Franchise Tax Board who said I had no recourse other than to continue working with my employer or I could contact the EDD in California since they deal with W-2's.

Contacted the EDD and they won't help and they told me to file a W-2 Complaint with the IRS because the IRS provides the information from the W-2 to them, so they have no control over incorrect information.

So at this point I'm stuck on multiple fronts with California pointing at the feds and the feds pointing at California. I have my HR blaming the tax department and the tax department blaming HR. 

Any idea what I can do to get my W-2 corrected?",finance

personalfinance,"The IRS has filed over 100k in tax liens in 2011, i got a letter saying they won't provide me with any info","I ordered a free credit report in 1/2016 and it showed a page of state and federal tax liens. I contacted a tax person that day and they had me sign a power of attorney and charged me $75 for the call and form then stopped returning my calls.  I tried to order transcripts on the website and by phone but the 3 questions it asks- I did not answer correctly so it referred me to web/phone/snail mail again.  

In June 2016 I walked into a local tax attorneys office and told him what my free credit report said. He prepared a change of address form and charged me $75 and said the IRS will probably mail you something since this is a significant amount. 

Around the end of 2016 the tax attorney is saying he doesn't think those liens are mine or somebody must have paid them so I run a free name search for courts across the USA.   It shows my liens are filed in my county and I visit the recorder to make a copy of them.  

The county recorder provided me years and amount and for instance it says I owe $70k for 2008 but I became unemployed in 2007 and recieved no unemployment or income of any kind. It shows I owe the state $10k for 2004 when I only earned $28k and had w2 and claimed 1.  

 From 2008- 2017 I've been caring for a relative with Alzheimer's and I recieve no paycheck, the tax attorney says I should file taxes and report a small amount of income so the IRS knows I'm back in the workforce and if I do owe something it will be hard for them to squeeze much out of me since I really can't pay back a significant amount. 

He suggested I report $ 775 a month caring for my relative. My family is pissed that the money has to come from them and warn me if this back fires I'm on my own. 
 I sent the IRS almost $770 for 2016 taxes and i don't feel like I'm doing anything right.  

Right after my 2016 return was filed the attorney mailed a 4506 asking for tax records dating back to 2004.  It was broken down into 5 requests.   

They mailed the attorney responses for 2011-2015 and it said I made no money.  They mailed me a copy of a 4506 for 2004-2006 with a RAVIS letter attached. The letter has 39 boxes and the checked ones are   

3. We can't provide any of the items you requested. (Not to be a grammar nazi but isn't it "" can not""?

27. We can't provide the W2 /W3 form you requested the SSA may be able to help you.

39. We notified the 3rd party listed on line 5 of 4506 T-or EZ that we couldn't complete your request.  However we can't tell the 3rd party the reason why. 


This month I tried to see if the liens are hurting me and I went to a bank to open a account and they said I have an IRS alert that needs to be lifted and once the account is open the alert goes back on.  
After 15 yrs with Sprint they said I could not finance a new phone, then I got a letter saying the problem was my credit report says my student loan balance exceeds the amount I can borrow.  I don't have student loans, and I don't know why tax liens wasn't the reason.( I'm waiting for the free copy of a credit report on that).  T mobile said my credit is so fabulous I can have 12 phones under my account.  I filed a claim for money the state of CA was keeping and they sent me a letter saying they have intercepted the funds because I owe state taxes. 

I don't know what I should do next but I feel I have to ask for help. My family acts like I let this problem go since 2004, the liens weren't recorded till 2011 and i began looking for info right away in 2016. I feel like some people really don't believe I'm trying, in fact a relative was screaming at me last week to notify the IRS by return receipt mail I demand answers in 10 days.  They claim I'm not being aggressive and people aren't taking my situation seriously because I'm to passive.

personalfinance,Is my accountant accurate with my income tax return,"I went to my accountant to file in my taxes over the weekend. The two big changes for the 2016 file are: new job in October 2015 that bumped my annual salary ~$50,000 more than my previous job, and I bought a house last year.

I was convinced by many that I would get a decent refund just simply because I purchased a house. In the end, I owe about ~$3,000 in Federal and ~$1,500 for the state. My accountant told me it's due to mainly a very low witholding and that I should adjust it via the W4, and my donations are also low ($1,000 last year). If I didn't purchase a house, I would've owed more according to him.

However, I was working in Qatar during 2014-2015 as consultant and received my delayed payment after several follow-ups finally in May 2016 (~20K USD). I also have received a limited payment (~5K USD) from my home country in Dec. 2016 (some pending payments as well) and no other income. Now would appreciate if you would advise me about the following questions:

1- Should I file the taxes for 2016 as I have had any payments in the US? If this is the case which, my I do all the required procedures online or have to do it by mail for the first time (like Canada)?

2- Do I still owe anything to Federal or the state (CA) as never worked in the US and thus no payments?

3-Being in the US form late September, I didn't have any medical insurance and wonder is there any penalty for this issue?

4- Which software is better to use which is free and reliable?

5- By the way, how should I file for the tax online at the first place? How does it work? What information and documents are required based on my situation?

-She has 26k left to pay
-She had 'missed some payments' last year and then one in January 17, made the payment in Feb, and then it still went to collections.  (she wasnt clear on how many payments missed and when)
-New collections agency (General Revenue Coorp) is saying they're going to charge 16% on the loans unless she can pay 90% in the first 30 days ($23,400 or so)

Supposedly Woodrow Wilson was afraid the the US Dollar, which then was backed by gold, would collapse since this gold deposit far exceeded the total amount of gold found up until that date and therefore the news of this massive gold find was squelched and control of the Grand Canyon was turned over to the Federal Government.

personalfinance,"Stay in Public Service for the Loan Forgiveness, or Leave and pay WAY more","Hi all. I have about $60k in federal student loans. I make income based payments of about $250 month through the Public Service Loan Foregivness Act. Basically, as long as I make 120 monthly on-time payments, while holding a full time job at a qualified organization, the balance of my loans will be forgiven in 10 years. At the rate I currently pay, I don't even pay the amount of interest accruing, so my loans have actually increased in the two and half years I've been making payments (though I will eventually break even - which will suck for tax purposes). 

My conundrum is whether I should continue with this plan. I only make about $35k a year right now, which is hard. I live in Seattle, a very VERY expensive city, but that has open jobs like crazy now. I have a skill set that means I could probably make more in the private sector. 

Should I jump ship on this plan and go private? I likely would no longer qualify for my repayment plan and would see my monthly payment skyrocket, with the intent of paying the whole thing back over 20 years, meaning my debt will be longer, but I'd be more capable of paying it and would have more money in the long run.

So upon doing some research, I learned there were several ways to get this loan out of default so I can be elgible to recieve student aid again. I decided to conslidate the loan using an income driven plan which was the most approperiate option for my situation. 

I read with this option takes about 3 months to successfully process and consolidate the loan, and when that happens, I will be immediately out of default and elgible for aid again. 

A couple months have passed and I have gotten a letter about a month ago stating the loan was consolidated and all that. 

So I resubmitted my FAFSA again, and apparently I'm still in default of a loan and am not elgible to recieve aid still.

With that said, here's a picture of my finances ""per month"". Maybe some of you can help me determine what to cut out. I have a lot of justification on these things, but I need to not justify and start being smart. Obviously, looking at this, my expenses are more than my income. So I come to reddit for help. Here are some things about my situation, that does not include gas and food:

Monthly ""Take Home"" - $3779.54 (I am getting paid $41.01 an hour so I'm making over 85K a year. I get paid bi-weekly every 2 weeks)

**MONTHLY EXPENSES**

*NECESSITIES*

$280.09: Car Payment - Due by 7th of each month (Owe $9,293.44 car is worth about $6K - I drive 80-85 miles daily for work)

$71: e-surance car insurance - Due by 1st of each month

$465.06 Per Month: Property Taxes (I live in NJ, this is cheap)

$29.75 Per Month: Municipal Utilities

$28.54: Water Bill - Due by 11th of each month


*LUXURIES*

$98.64: Comcast Bill - Due by 4th of each month (Internet only)

$109.94: Verizon Wireless  - Due 12th of each month

$21.39: Monthly Gym Membership - Due by 7th of each month

$117.40: DirectTV - Due by 18th of each month 

$12.49 TeamSnap -- Due by 6th of each month (I run a hockey team)

$9.99 WWE Network - Due 25th of each month

*COSTING ME MONEY*

$496.94: Discover Personal Loan - Due February 4th  (Still Owe $12,253.82 - 5 Year Loan for 20K @ 16.99% and I'm always 15-20 days late which adds a late fee)

$25: Capital One - Due by 4th of each month (Owe $1,019.95 on $1500 credit line @ 0% for 90 more days)

Chase Card: $30 -- Due by 28th of each month (Owe $1,197.31 on $2000 credit line @ 17.24%)

Bank of America Card: $25 -- Due by 25th of each month (Owe $376.16 on $700 credit line @ 15.49%)

$157 Discover Credit Card - Due by 18th of each month (Owe $7,755.69 on $7700 credit line @ 12.99%)

$281.50: Visa Gold  - Typical due on the 12th of each month (Currently in Payment only status, Owe $13,854.16 on 15K Balance @ 9.85%)

$336.23: 401K Loan - Taking out bi-weekly and still owe $999.84 of $3K Loan. 3 More Payments Left.



With that said, here are more thoughts and questions:

* I will consider other sources of income like selling items and roommate as a last resort.
* How long could I live off my 401K if I lost my job and didn't get unemployment for some reason (aka quit or was fired for poor performance)?
* Is a consolidated debt program like National Debt Relief or anything else OK for me to get? My step-mother used one that had lawyer representation and I understand it's basically one fee at the end of the month but reduces my credit cards and loans.
* If I lost my job, what would happen to this consolidated loan program if I can't pay it?
* Can I afford to live off of a job that is 20K or even 30K less than what I make now?
* Am I putting too much into taxes per paycheck? I'm a single man living on his own (now children either). Should I take back some extra earnings? I am concerned about owing taxes if I do so. I got back close to 4K this year in Federal AND State
* Are there any other programs or such I should consider?

Any advice is much appreciated! Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Putting taxes on a card with a 0% introductory APR,"I used to be extremely debt averse but now as I'm discovering the time value of money and the credit card point game I'm realizing that it can be profitable to assume debt with a low interest rate and financial discipline. That having been said, I'd like some feedback on my plan:

I'm self employed and owe a large amount of taxes to the IRS for 2016. I plan on maximizing my retirement contribution, which is substantial, in order to reduce my tax burden significantly. I'd still be able to pay my taxes but I'd need to sell some non retirement, investments which I don't want to do.

Instead I would maximize the limit on my 0% apr Chase Freedom card, use it to pay my taxes, maintain the balance until the 0% introductory rate expires (while making minimum payments), and then pay it off entirely.

Pros:

1. My investments would appreciate

2. The value of the points I would earn on my card greater than the fee I would incur (more the domain of r/churning)

Cons:

1. My credit card balance would increase my utilization % on my credit report and hurt my score

2. A decline in the value of my investments would take a greater toll since I would be forced to sell when the introductory rate expires.

3. Any unforeseen expenses (medical, layoff, etc...) would take a greater toll since I'd have to sell even more investments.

Con #1 isn't terribly important to me since my utilization would only jump to ~30%, my score is pretty good, and I'm not buying a house anytime soon. 

Con #2 can be mitigated by assuming less risk. 

Con #3 is unlikely as I'm single, without kids, healthy and young.

Is there anything else I'm missing? Would love to hear your thoughts.",finance
personalfinance,Expected Lease Buyout Interest Rate?,"Hi!  
  
My car lease is up in November (2014 Honda Civic with ~20k miles). The buyout price is $10,800 and I would like to buy it out.  
  
I will have $3,000 to put down, can pay $350 per month, and I'd like to do a 36 month loan (unless there is a case for a longer/shorter loan period). I live in California and am currently paying $87 a month for insurance.  
  
My credit score is ~790.  
  
This will be my first car payment, and I'm not sure what kind of interest rate to expect. I inquired at Chase for an interest rate quote, but was told since it is a lease refinancing, I'd have to submit an official application and could not get a quote.  
  
Any ideas or rates I should be aiming for? Any suggestions for places to get quotes/apply to?  
  
Thank you!

personalfinance,DFAS overpaid me $12K on 31 December.,"According to federal law I have to repay. Fair enough as it was an employee error that generated the payment. Since it came with my regular pay, taxes and retirement contribution were taken out. Net received was about $6500. Did not spend it.  Wrote a check to return it. According to federal laws my pay is being garnished to cover the balance which I never received but was paid as taxes. Adding insult to injury I have to file taxes and will pay AMT on the overpayment. This extra tax means I have to write a check to the IRS for far more than I planned. I usually try to cut it close and avoid AMT or overpayments. So now my cash flow is having to cover $8500 between garnishment and taxes....all to cover payments for money I never actually received. Am told DFAS will give me a ""tax certificate"" at the end of the year. My question is, what exactly is a tax certificate? Is it a credit that reduces my refund and then I pay taxes the next year? Is it a document I use to refile? DFAS will not answer my question in time for filing this year as my help ticket response time is estimated as 120 days minimum.",finance

I am mostly likely going to file bankruptcy because I would like to rebuild my credit which has a score of about about 500. About 3000 or so of my debt is student loans and that is going to drastically increase because I am now attending a university (just accepted). I've done quite a bit of research and reading and I know my student loans aren't dischargable but about 9000 of my debt is. I want to rebuild my credit but since I'm going to be getting into a lot more debt from school paying back the other 9k or so will just cause more hardship and I may be sued in the process of waiting till I can afford too. What I want to know is 1. Is bankruptcy at 25 a viable thing to do? Or will it ruin my ability to get credit for life? 2. Will it affect my ability to get student loans both federal and private? 3. Should I get a lawyer or file per se? 4. Is this a wise move given the information? Also I have a credit card I use frequently and am looking to keep it has a 500 limit and I use it responsibly. Will I be aloud to keep it? My debt is not from bad lending practices. Will a car loan place or any other place take this into consideration post bankruptcy?



I got into debt mostly from an uninsured car accident and terminated lease agreement. No one was hurt in the car accident but I did damage the car. I know I should of had insurance but I couldn't afford it and I am a foster child so I didn't have parents to help or guidance. The place I was living was hell to me and my mental Heath was declining. I had to move and I needed to drive to get to work and school. This is something I'm sorry for but it was either that, or be homeless or live in what I felt like was hell. If I could pay I would.",finance
personalfinance,Auto Loan in relation to my Credit Scores,"Hi. I was just at a Car dealership. I realize Credit Karma doesn't give exact scores - just estimates, but that's the only real thing I have do reference off of. Going into the dealership I felt okay. 

I kind of searched around and estimated that with the Credit scores of 660/Transunion and 740/Equifax (going off of the 660) I could probably estimate an apr of anywhere from 5%-10%. 

So, then I used auto loan calculator off google and plugged in the numbers. My estimated apr, total amount of the loan, and the loan periods I was potentially wanting. I felt pretty good with the outcomes. 

Here's the numbers I plugged in:
- 10% Interest Rate
- $14,490 Total listed Price of Vehicle
- 48 Month Loan Period

That came out to = $368/Mo. (Total price accumulated over time was $17,640)

They pulled my credit and estimated that banks would provide me with a 48 month loan period at $420 a month.. I then checked what apr that is at and it's 17.3%..........

Is something up here or is this normal? I asked some people in the industry and they referenced anywhere between 5%-10%.. (I was honestly expecting upwards of 10 though).",finance
personalfinance,Conversion from traditional to Roth IRA to pay for school?,"Sibling is not on Reddit, but I am not sure how to advise her on this:

My sister is planning on starting pharmacy school next fall (6 years of study). It will be full-time, so she's trying to plan ahead.

By the time she starts, she will have about $52k in her retirement accounts. Liquid savings are going to be used for living expenses while she is in school, but it won't last 6 years and she'll have to take out loans for tuition and living costs. She will work part-time during the first 2 years to help cover some of that.

She's planning on after pharmacy school getting a job with the federal government, qualifying for PSLF, and then socking away the maximum into a TSP/401k each year as well. If she conservatively earns around $100k post-school, that's about $5800 before taxes per month, and she could easily put the max into her retirement account ($18k/year). The government also includes match up to 5% of income on contributions, so that would be an additional $5k/year.

She is thinking she could use her retirement funds to help pay for school, by converting to a Roth IRA. Since she won't be working during the PharmD (4 years), the taxes will be low, and there's no penalty for taking out retirement funds for school costs. Her reasoning is that she'd rather have a smaller loan balance, and she can ""re-fund"" her retirement account in about 2-3 years post-graduation with a much higher income position.

I question if she should bother with using any retirement funds at all, and just take out loans for everything. She will lose out on compounding interest in the last 4 years every-time she withdraws funds, although I doubt her account is getting a 7% return. However, her student loans would have a guaranteed cost of 6.8% interest every year.

I'm pretty close to this as she's my sister, any impartial help or financial analysis would help her out.

Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Resolving tax debt,"Long story short I owe the GA state gov. About $1000 from past years of being paid 1099 while working full time. I am a single father of an 8 year old daughter, whose status as my claimable dependent has offset what I would owe the federal govt and leave a few hundred dollars leftover as a refund due to me which the state will most likely take toward what I owe them, my question is, would it be worth while to find and pay a cpa or other tax advisor for advice and help filing, or should I just save the money and file through a free tax software  and throw myself at the will of the IRS? I am no longer being paid 1099 and am paying as much as I can afford out of my paycheck every week but being a single father making around 35,000 a year I'm not able to set my tax status to take the max amount every week. I've tried to get on a payment plan with the state but another caveat is that I've been told I have 2 years worth of taxes not file from long ago, I can't remember why I didn't file or how to go about finding the info to file, I believe I was unemployed for those two years but not collecting any type of benefits (I.e. Unemployment). For this reason they won't set me up with a payment plan Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I do not receive any child support, my child's mother is a junkie and part of our custody agreement which took place at a coffee shop with my attorney present  she relinquished sole custody to me because she had been in and out of jail on drug and shoplifting charges so she didn't really stand a chance... to stay out of an expensive court battle I let her off the hook as far as child support because she couldn't or wouldn't pay anyway, she was more concerned about this than losing her child  so it was the main reason she signed over custody imo ... she hasn't worked and years and is in and out of jail frequently as it is. I get no government assistance of any kind food stamps or otherwise, but my daughter is on peachcare Medicaid which I pay for monthly along with $50/week after school child care. I am privately insured through my job. 

Tldr; I owe the GA state govt around $1000 in back taxes for a couple of years of 1099 pay I didn't pay taxes on, would owe the fed as well but my daughter/dependent has offset the would be debt. Should I just file myself through free software or possibly pay a cpa or other entity to help me find the best course of action and maybe (fingers crossed) get me some money back. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and if any more info is needed please let me know.

Bitcoin,It's actually a good idea to put a significant part of your wealth in Bitcoin,"I'm not saying that you should put **all** of your money in Bitcoin (never put all your eggs in one basket).  

But a long-term investment in fiat currencies (like Dollar) is insanity, as it's an investment with a *guaranteed* loss. It's like buying stocks of a company who has officially promised to rob you (by the means of taxes, hyperinflation, ""war on cash"" and other questionable practices).  

Compare it to Bitcoin: because of its scarcity and because of some major long-term political trends [1], the value of Bitcoin will continue to grow in the foreseeable future. And it's significantly easier to destroy Dollar than to destroy Bitcoin – because Dollar has a single point of failure (the FED).

If you're a smart investor, you'll never keep more than a few thousands bucks in fiat. Everything else should be invested in Bitcoin, other strong cryptocurrencies, precious metals, stocks, real estate and other things worth investing in. 

Bitcoin is the money. Dollar is a risky investment with a guaranteed loss. Act accordingly.

Hi Reddit! My name is Chris Yarosh, and I’m the Science Policy Fellow at the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Washington, D.C. I work with ACS’s External Affairs and Communications (EAC) team to promote policies that support science and address the concerns of the chemical community.
Before coming to Washington, I earned my Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics from the University of Pennsylvania. For my dissertation, I studied how cells regulate RNA-binding proteins (SFPQ and TRAP150, specifically) to influence pre-mRNA alternative splicing and other cellular processes. When I wasn’t in the lab, I could be found teaching high school students the basics of running experiments or imploding watermelons with rubber bands at the Franklin Institute. I also hold a B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Scranton (yes, that Scranton) where I did some polymer chemistry research and ruined several expensive pieces of equipment.


As the ACS Science Policy Fellow, I work with my EAC colleagues to cover a range of issues of interest to ACS members, including federal funding for scientific research, STEM education, innovation, green chemistry, and regulatory policy. Mostly, this means keeping tabs on the federal agencies that fund chemistry research, helping ACS members get involved in the policy process, and communicating ACS’s positions on critical issues to policymakers.
As someone who recently made the jump from bench to desk, I understand how opaque the policy process can be; I also understand just how important it is for scientists to learn as much as they can and get involved. I’m excited to answer any of your questions!  Ask me anything!

stocks,AUPH Dilution,"Aurinia Prices US$150.5 Million Public Offering of Common Shares

Business Wire

VICTORIA, British Columbia -- March 14, 2017

Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:AUPH) (TSX:AUP) (“Aurinia” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the global immunology market, today announced the pricing of its underwritten public offering of 22,300,000 common shares (the “Offering”). The shares are being sold at a public offering price of US$6.75 per share. The gross offering proceeds to the Company from this Offering are expected to be approximately US$150.5 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses.

investing,What you should buy when interest rates goes up - Jim Cramer's Real Money Book - JOIN IN!,"Currently reading Jim Cramer's ""Real Money"" book, copyright 2005. It's a great book for beginners on explaining portfolio balance, how to make cylical plays, how to measure companies with P/E ratios and more. 

Here is what we are discussing: https://imgur.com/a/DGchX

Under the flow chart he explains what we should BUY while interest rates are rising under an improving economy and what we should SELL.

QUESTION 1: Does this traditional chart still apply to today's conditions? For example, REITS should be SOLID right now under that chart, however housing supply is low and demand is improving under a strengthening economy. 

Question 2: Are we in an improving economy or are we really on the downside and the interest rates should be reversed on the chart? 

He says that we should buy the companies that everyone else is afraid of right now because when big players shift their money over big Macro events that is how you get in early. Does that mean we buy gold right now? Do we load up on PG?

personalfinance,Need advice on a balance transfer card.,"UPDATE: I went with chase slate but they only gave me 1800 which isn't really helpful for balance transfers. Is there a way to talk to someone and get it raised?

I have worked on paying down my credit card debt a lot.  I was at about 75% credit card utilization.  After using tax returns and putting large amounts of my paychecks towards that, I have gotten it down to about 38% and owing about $12,000.  The last amounts here are difficult to pay off now because of the high interest rates on the large balances that are carried:  
5000 on a Wells Fargo CC

750 on a Discover CC 

1500 on a BestBuy CC 

850 on a Buckle CC 

1500 on a Walmart CC

1100 on a MilExchange CC

1000 on a KayJewelers CC

Because of the high interest rates on these cards my monthly payments are not doing much and it is difficult to make all the payments, although I have managed so far.  Because of this I am looking at transferring as many of these as I can onto a new balance transfer credit card and paying them off within the 0% interest introductory period typically associated with balance transfer cards.  My credit score is currently a 724.  What are some good cards to apply for at my credit score for the purpose of balance transfers?",finance

investing,Loan at/near the risk free rate? (academic/practical),"Assume that I can construct a portfolio and perfectly delta hedge it with no costs at all. The options are priced in accordance with put-call parity. I should earn the risk free rate because I assume no risk haven a perfect delta hedge at all time (right?). Given these unrealistic, academic assumptions, is there anything stopping me from reversing the portfolio and lending at (or very close to) the risk free rate? If I were to implement this strategy in practice (with same assumptions) would that allow me to optain a loan at the risk free rate AND spend the money (maybe on a yacht) or would the entire ""loan"" be bound in margin reqs by my broker? If margin reqs lock my loan why is that happening? With a perfect hedge I assume no risk and therefore shouldn't put up much margin (or what?). If margin reqs are not locking my loan, why are people not lending this way? Is it simply that they can't hedge perfectly or am I missing something here?

 Another related thought: In a realistic setting, could I optain financing at (or close to) the risk free rate by shorting T-Bills and rolling them? Or are margin reqs and/or commision in the way again? If they are why? I don't see much risk being short a T-Bill because we know the (nominal) interest rate and their expiry date is not far into the future. Maybe commisions are way too high?

personalfinance,"(Virginia, USA) [19/M] Looking for advice on how to manage my money and loans for living expenses at college.","Hey guys, college student here. I like to think I'm pretty good at handling my money but the complexity of student loans and my budget is starting to weigh on me as I start the transfer process to a 4-year university.

So a little background. I'm an engineering student at a local community college that will be finishing my Associate's degree this spring. I have applied to a solid 4 year and am awaiting my acceptance (should come April 1st), but I have met the terms of my school's articulation agreement and should be guaranteed acceptance. I will be able to finish my Bachelor's in 2-2.5yrs.

Here's my financial situation. I currently am working as a student tutor while I'm finishing my studies and I'm making a modest $600/month after taxes. I do my best to save what I can but a large chunk of my income gets eaten up by gas and that's fairly unavoidable (I drive a civic and get good gas mileage but my school is ~40 miles away, 5 times a week). I plan on making substantially more over the summer as I'll be able to work full-time and will have an associate's degree so I will try to maximize my ability to save up then. I have some credit card debt (~$2000) that I keep transferred onto 0%APR cards so I don't accrue interest and I've managed to keep my credit score floating just under 750 up to this point. Another factor to my situation was the passing of my grandmother last October who left me $10,000 to help with school. I should receive a check from her lawyer this week for the full amount and my current plan is to pay down the majority of my credit card debt and then keep the remainder in a savings account to use as a slush fund for emergencies and whatnot.

On to my expenses. I recently toured the apartment complex I plan to live in (I will be a junior so on-campus is out) and I've gotten most of my figures totaled up. I will be living with my best friend of 6 years (He will not be a student, he works full time with home depot and makes between $2500-3000 a month, so his half should be without issue) so here's what I'm looking at for my half:

* $653/month/person for rent (Includes water, sewage, trash, cable, internet, stackable washer/dryer, gas heat, and hot water)

* $30/month/person estimate for electricity (low due to heat and hot water being included in rent)

* $250/month? food budget. Not too sure on this one. I do my own grocery shopping now on my dad's dime and it comes out to just a little over $50 and I'm going around once a week.

* Obviously this can't be my entire budget because I'm not including cost for gas and entertainment, etc. but with a bus pass until I get to school I really won't know how much I'll be spending in gas and I guess the other categories will be dictated on how much money I have left over.

So the ideal part here is that my dad is paying for the actual schooling part of my expenses. Tuition and fees, books, and supplies (sans pricey laptop for crazy EGR school reqs.) are all going to be covered by my father (provided I keep a B average). So the only thing I really have to worry with are living expenses, keeping my car running (though ill most likely be using a bus pass to get on campus), and my expensive laptop.

So as you can hopefully see from what i'm looking at here I've got a lot of figuring to do from a money standpoint. I plan to work while I'm in school but I know my degree path will be fairly difficult so I'll never be able to work enough to cover all my expenses realistically. So I'm looking at loans. My father is financially well off so I'm not eligible for subsidized loans or any money from my FASFA, although he is willing to cosign should I need to get a private loan (We've been Wells Fargo customers since we were Wachovia customers so I figured if I was gonna go that route it would be through them, but opinions are welcome obviously).

So, at the end of all this, I'm basically just looking for any opinions at all or any advice you guys (or girls) might have that might pertain to my situation. My current (albeit not very educated) plan is to just take out a student loan (from who I dunno) to the tune of about $10,000-12,000/year to pay for (in the first year) My computer (about $2000) and then to supplement my income for the apartment and food expenses.

The reason I'm having to deal with this now is because I toured the apartment complex yesterday and they told me I should most likely try to get into a lease as soon as I get my acceptance because their apartments tend to go quick. She told me that within 2 weeks of signing the lease I owe first months rent ($650/person) and security deposit ($200/person) and that will be kind of hard to pay in my current situation unless I get my loans set up now.

So to format my questions better:

1. Is my budget pretty realistic?
2. Is my current ballpark idea for a loan amount about right?
3. How should I try to get loans? Federal Loans v.s. Private loans is getting me confused and the FSA website is not helping much  because it doesn't have much documentation for my situation (tuition already paid, just need living expenses).

**TL:DR**: Engineering student needing to figure out how to pay for living expenses for a couple years at university. I should have an 8000$ slush fund to keep me out of the danger zone but I'll need to supplement my income to keep me afloat.

personalfinance,"Looking to move out, not sure how much I should allow for rent","**Location:** Minneapolis

**The situation:** Moved back in with my parents after college, around 6 months ago. I'm looking to move out again now and I'm not sure how much to allow for rent. 

**The money:** Weekly paychecks are $750 take home after an automatic deduction of $265 into my 401k. I have around $23,000 in cash right now. I spent around $300 last month including gas and groceries and I would say that is fairly typical. 

I do not have any student loan debt due to scholarships and part time work. I do not have a car loan due to not having a car, but I will need to buy one before I move out. 

**Why I'm asking:** I lived away from home for 4 years in college but I spent those in absolute cost minimization mode. I'm hoping to spend a little bit more to get a slightly nicer place but I'm not sure how much is smart to spend. I know the 30% rule of thumb but I'm also potentially considering grad school in the future and was wondering how that might affect things. 

I'm also wondering what major expense categories might come up as a more ""real"" adult, and how much to estimate for these. In college I mostly just paid rent and fed myself. 

**The car:** I'm also not sure what's the smartest thing to do is with respect to the car. I plan to buy used but I don't know how used is best. If the car is older it may be less reliable and cost money sooner in repairs or replacement costs, but it will obviously cheaper.

Budget is ~1,220 a month depending on summer/winter.

Took out unsubsidized federal loans at 5.84% interest

 * ~12,000 2nd year

 * ~47,000 3rd year (I wanted to only take out 34,000 but there was miscommunication) I'm still recovering from the loss
Outstanding interest so far $2,000

 * I will be taking roughly 30,000 loans 4th year 

I received a windfall $ of ~20,000 in vested shares (taxes took half)

Do you guys suggest I hire a financial advisor with fiduciary? Or is my debt small that taking the time and energy is not worth it?

Questions I have are:

1) should I pay off the interest and some of the loans now with the windfall $.

2) Use the 20k for 4th year and not worry about the current loan (30,000 and only take out 10,000)?

I should let you know that after 4th year the principal borrowed and interest will be combined into a new collected principal so I'll be paying a greater interest when I graduate medical school. 
ex: If I borrowed 50,000 at 5% interest with 5,000 interest accrued. After graduation, I'll be paying 55,000 at 5% interest.

Any smart way I can apply for taxes and say the money went to school for a greater refund?

As of right now I'm just paying the minimums due to high rent and decent but not huge income, i.e. to pay my loans off faster I'd have to cut into my fairly modest discretionary spending.

BlockChain,How can I use blockchain in this fintech project?,"Hi Community,  
I have this project summarized below and I'd like to know if blockchain would be appropriate for it. If so, how?  
#Project Summary  
The project is to create a financial institution where you don't rely on credit, but on investment.  
Let's say the actual interest rate of the bank is 5%, if you deposit 100$, your bank account is credited with 100$ plus compound interests until retirement, which totals to 338.64$. if your retirement is in 25 years.  
It might appear wrong at first, but the idea is not to know how much you have, but how much you will have at retirement.  
The same applies to withdrawals. If you withdraw 100$, 338.64$ is removed from your assets.  
This way, all purchases have a direct impact on your retirement and you know exactly the impact that this new phone will have on you retirement money.  
Added to that, the system would handle regular payments that are usually required like mortgage, electricity, internet, tv, etc.  
You wouldn't have to worry about these anymore, but would still be able to see the impact they have on your retirement money.  
All excess money, would be used to fund new customers who wish to get rid of loans or credit cards. These 10%, 15, or 20% loans would be transferred to your account at a 5% interest rate until fully repaid at which point you start saving.  
The interest rate (5% used as example above) would be as per your risk management profile to ensure regulations are followed.  
To ensure stability, a monthly fee would be charged instead of interest rates on loans and all money waiting for retirement would be invested as per risk management profiles.  
Interest rates would fluctuate following the market.

personalfinance,Take rate reset deal on 5/5 Penfed ARM rate before feds start raising rates?,"At 2.75% until 2/1/18.  The current 5/5 ARM is 3.125%.  My reset offer is 0.0625% less than the current rate: 3.07% for the next 69 months (so I'd lose 9 months at 2.75%).

The feds are 99% going to raise the rate tomm and probably at least one more time this year so I am looking at two fed rate raises before my loan resets.  I'm not an expert on how this effects mortgage rates, but it seems rather likely that the 5/5 ARM won't be going below 3% again anytime soon.

I have read the loan reset is linked to the 5-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate + 2%.  I am leaning towards taking the deal as I feel I have more to lose than gain - it's 'only' $50 a month more on my mortgage before tax deduction.  I just don't see the Penfed dropping below 3.125%.",finance
stocks,"Gold Price is down below $1200, which was prev resistance. $JDST,$NUGT","Disclaimer I bought $JDST @ 17.38 today.

I ve been looking for relationship gold price and $JDST and $JNUG. Obviously they are highly correlated. I think $JDST, $NUGT will hike tomorrow. 

1) after stock market is closed, gold price went down below $1200 which was bottom resistance. 


2) we have FOMC meeting tomorrow. 

Of course, it is highly expectd they will increase the rate but I am betting on 
FOMC forecast on the rate. If they say they will aggressively increase the rate in this year, price of the gold will go down more at least for tomorrow.  Also watch for $JNUG due to politics


* March 15th: Netherlands Prime Minister Election

* March 26th: Hong Kong's Chief Executive Election:


* **April 23rd and May 7th: France's First and Second Round Presidential Election:**
 I think this event is very important

personalfinance,New-build home weird mortgage question,"Built a home and took out a personal loan of 60k from a family member (interest free). Then took out a more traditional construction loan for 250k.

Now I'm finalizing my long-term financing and even though we only want to borrow $310,000 (60+250) the loan officer is saying we HAVE to classify it as a cash out loan which will cause about a quarter percent jump in interest rate. 

Does that sound accurate? I've tried pushing back a couple times. What questions should I ask? Any input or ideas are welcome! Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,"Refinance private student loan now before interest rates rise, or wait until after salary increase?","Some background: I'm 25 years old, make $60,000 per year, and have a credit score of 770.

I have a $37,800 private student loan from Sallie Mae with a 8.75% adjusted variable rate. It seems that interest rates are starting to pick up, with the Federal Reserve expected to hike their funds rate three times this year. I'm assuming the rate on my loan will rise as well since it is variable, which makes me eager to refinance as soon as possible. 

That said, it's likely that my salary will increase to $65,000-$68,000 in the near future--six months at the latest. If my salary is higher, my understanding is that I'll be able to obtain a lower interest rate when I refinance.

personalfinance,"Spend savings on paying off student loans, paying off car, down payment on a house, invest it, or a little of each?","Hi r/personalfinance,

What do you all think I should do in this case?

I'll have approximately $10-11k in savings this September.

I currently have $11k in student loans at a 6.8% interest rate. I have a car which I financed - $8k owed at 3% interest. And, I would love to buy a house.

It kills me that I spend my money on rent vs. It going into an asset that I will one day own. I'm personally leaning towards buying a house, but I realize that the burden/obligations can outweigh the benefits at times. I'd also need to do a low down loan, pay mortgage insurance, and use a chunk of my savings on the home buying process.

I'm 25 years old, soon to be 26. I have a credit score of over 800 (barely) and I make about 60k a year before overtime, about 65k after. I put about 5% of my income into 401k, which isn't matched by my employer. It will be matched in October of this year.

To be honest I don't have much interest in investing the money. I'm really after applying that money towards something that benefits me immediately. Which I know is not good long term thinking. But, it tempts me that 10k can become $500k by the time I'm 65 at a 10% return rate.

personalfinance,Relocating to America for a job posting.,"Hi everyone, I don't know if this is the right sub but since most of you are Americans I can imagine that you'd be a great help to me. This would be a long post, be warned. 

I'm from Singapore, and I've been offered an overseas position in the states under the same company I'm working at. I'm relatively young (25 this year). It's an advertising agency and I've been offered $USD65K per annum before taxes. The post will be for two years with an option to extend depending on performance. They will accommodate me a studio apartment in a condominium, so I don't have to worry about accommodation. They will be covering me with private insurance too. I only have to cover my daily costs, plus a car I guess. I will be located in San Francisco, California. If I'm not wrong I will be considered a legal non-resident alien. I chuckle everytime I'm referred to as an alien. 

I'm wondering about the type of taxes a foreigner has to pay in my wage class. I've been trying to read up online and the tax laws are quite confusing. I will be receiving around USD$2K a month from renting my apartment in Singapore when I'm away in the states, in addition to my pay. Also have dividends coming in but not much I guess. 

My apartment in Singapore is fully paid for and I do not have outstanding loans to pay. I've excellent credit score in Singapore, but I'm not sure how that will be transferred to the states. 

The questions I have are:

1. What are the different taxes that I have to pay yearly? State tax?  Federal tax? (except for property tax) 

2. Would it be more economical to travel using public transport or would a car better suit me? Not really referring to cost but more of time + ease. 

3. I might want to pursue my masters in the states too. Are there any additional costs for foreigners? I understand with my portfolio I can pursue Masters in UC for marketing. I guess I will be getting a loan for a masters. 

4. I've been to lucky to have a small company I created to be acquired. Hence for a young person I've some substantial savings (+/- USD$60K). Would it be wise to invest in some property that I can comfortably afford with an exit plan of around 4-5 years? 
If I acquire one, I would be renting it for the first two years while I have my company sponsored apartment, and live in it for the next two or three years or so while I complete my masters. Do note after two years, I won't have as high an income or no income as I might be working only part time to pursue my masters. 

I understand I probably should hire a financial planner but I guess I wanted to ask you people first. I've decent financial planning sense, but it's a pretty new world for me. I come from an average, middle income family in Singapore and I'll be the first in my family to move to the states.

I've never posted here, but have lurked for quite a while, and I've been really impressed by the insight that a lot of you possess.  You've certainly helped out many people gain financial stability and control through some of their darkest and most stressful times, and so on their behalf, I again thank you.

-

In August of 2015, my mother passed away, leaving her home to my two sisters and I, in (3) equal shares.  The city has placed a value on the house and land at about $300,000.  The remaining mortgage is about $130,000.  This means that if we were to sell at this bottom dollar valuation, we could expect a gain of $170,000.  Divided three (3) ways, we three children would personally gain about $57,000 each.  This house is our sole inheritance.  

- 

My questions revolve around the decision to sell or keep the house.  

The house is located near an ever expanding state university in a popular tourist town on in New England.  Our tourist industry is booming and growing, with new businesses opening every year and property and rental costs only increasing.

I live in the house currently with one (1) of the other beneficiaries.  We split the mortgage evenly, which amounts to about $550 each, or about $1100 total.  A very doable sum for the size of our current abode.  The third sibling lives on her own and owns a condo.  She does not contribute to any costs associated with the house unless they are related to major issues (broken water heater/rewiring/etc..)  

- Sibling A, me.  I am a 26 year old graduate with about $35k in student debt working as a server.  My income is somewhere around $38k/year.  I am on the fence about keeping the house (and so why I am coming here for advice.)  I realize the house may increase in value, and applying some repairs would give us a chance at a higher sale later.  I am low on cash and in significant debt, but could manage on a  frugal budget if I needed to.  My plan is to move out of the state/country and do some budget traveling while continuing to work in hospitality for the next year or two.  I also have graduate school plans, and have received admission to top programs.  Yet my increased debt load would render me almost $90k in debt after receiving an MA, and that much student debt is hard to justify, especially with an MA.  

- Sibling B, is the oldest sister.  She is a 35 year old server (though currently unemployed.)  She is 100% set on keeping the house at all costs.  She has propositioned to buy out our shares (based on a  valuation by an appraiser.)  Yet, I'm concerned with her ability to secure a loan.  She claims her boyfriend would cosign, yet he has expressed to me privately that he would not.  Her ability to get a loan for that large of an amount is questionable.  Her credit is fair at best.

- Sibling 3, the middle sister.  She owns a condo and is very hands off with this property.  She has plans to buy her own home and raise her own family elsewhere.  She wants to sell, now.

My questions, then, are:  

What do I do to maximize the gain from this inheritance?  Do I unilaterally force the sale through the court, costing attorney's fees yet getting my cash out immediately?  Do I approach sibling 2 for a loan fed buy-out?  Do I go about my life with my meager income and return to this proposition in 5 years when the property value has grown (the remaining sibling occupant of the house [if I move out] would fill the remainder of the mortgage with a friend as a tenant)?

I have been thinking about this for almost 2 years, and I cannot decide what to do.  I have the power to force the sale, but I don't want to lose us all money.  I could wait some time, but would I be wiser to get the cash and make an investment on something else?  

Worth mentioning that sibling 3 (who wants to sell) refuses to pay for any improvements to increase the value.  I am willing, but it would be unfair to pay for improvements alone, only to split more profit later.

Please help me sort out this mess.  Thank you all, you fine, fine souls.",finance
personalfinance,Private student loans. Be ruthlessly honest.,"I want to go to a certain elite university and do something I know I will love, in a place I dream of living. I've been accepted, against all odds. I estimate that I might need a maximum of $130,000 in loans for a Bachelor's and a Master's, and as of right now, I cannot get federal loans at all. They may be all private, unless the uni's policy changes. This isn't factoring in any scholarships I might win (I have won ~$40,000 in scholarships for my first Bachelor's, but I have no illusions that I will be that lucky, this time).

The job I would be able to get after pays ~$70-100,000/yr where I live, but I think it pays more like either 30,000€ or 60,000€ there (though my degree will be more technical than average, like an engineer, and information is contradictory, obviously). I want to live there. I see stories on reddit of people being really frugal and essentially becoming the living dead in order to pay stuff off asap, but I am just scared. On one hand, the opportunity I've been given just doesn't happen to people like me. On the other hand; this is exactly why. 

I just am young and scared of making a stupid decision that won't pan out, or that I'll look back on and bitterly regret--I don't know anything about loans (I'm trying to learn..) and I have no support financially or otherwise. 

I'm about to look at Wells Fargo and Discover, then find out if Nelnet and SoFi are only for federal loans. The first payment is ~$11,000. I guess I just borrow as I go, and presumably end up with like a dozen (or more) little loans that add up. Ideally with no interest rate higher than...7% is the number I'll pull out of my ass. But preferably under 4%. 

I'd just like some perspective, because I'm an idealist and constantly overestimate my ability to cope with impossible situations. 

tl,dr: Is a once-in-a-lifetime golden opportunity, that will fulfill my every dream, worth possibly $130,000 in private student loans debt?",finance

stocks,Fed is “modestly to moderately behind the curve” on inflation,"Economist at Goldman Sachs (GS) said in its client note published late-Tuesday, the Federal Reserve (Fed) is “modestly to moderately behind the curve” on inflation, suggesting a faster pace of tightening in order to avoid inflation from overshooting its 2% target.

Key Quotes:

“Overall, standard policy rules suggest that the Fed is modestly to moderately behind the curve, but not to a degree that is comparable to the largest policy errors of the past or that could not be rectified by moderately faster tightening.”

“But the experience of the mid-1960s—a time when a sudden spike in inflation would have seemed similarly implausible—suggests some caution is warranted.”

personalfinance,Capital gains tax - possible to pay less by asking my girlfriend to invest (lower tax bracket) using our joint bank accounts?,"Hello,

I've searched through this thread for this question, but didn't find exactly the answer, so asking here.

Lately, I've been getting into investing with stocks (after maxing my 401k, IRA, emergency funds, like this sub advises) using a taxable brokerage account (RobinHood). All is well and I'm thinking of selling some stocks that have performed well (less than 1 year held). Since I've never sold stock before I searched the tax implications and will see that I'll pay 28% federal + ~9% CA state short term capital gains tax, which is fine, but then I thought about my life situation and if in the future I can reduce the tax I'd pay in on capital gains.

So, I live with my girlfriend (of 6 years) and we have a joint checking/savings account, many joint credit cards etc. She is trying to do her own business at the moment, so I pay for everything at this time. However, her tax bracket is lower than mine, she would be in the 15% bracket. 

If she was to setup a RobinHood account and fund it using our joint checking account (but I actively manage it), then if I sell stocks using her account, she would be responsible for the tax on the gains, but at a much reduced rate - any gains could then be transferred to our checking account and would be used to pay for the taxes, at tax time etc.

Is this ok to do? Basically I fund our joint bank account and we use her RobinHood account to invest, paying tax at her marginal rate which is lower than mine, transferring gains back to joint account and we both use the money.

I realize that you could also either a) transfer stock or b) do a (&lt;14k) gift tax per year; but considering we have a joint account, was wondering if simply using our joint account is ok.

Not trying to completely avoid paying taxes, just curious if I can reduce the amount to pay.",finance

personalfinance,"Selling to my house to help my grandmother, need advice.","HI PF,

First off thank you so much this community as helped me so much over the years. 

My grandfather passed away about 4 months ago and my grandmother feels very depressed and alone. She is about 75 and had been dating him since they were 16 so you can only imagine how devastating that would be. Her tenants are moving out of the other side of the duplex she owns and shes going to give me a pretty crazy deal on rent. Combine this with me wanting to be there for her and some of my other family in the immediate area that also are struggling with their health right now makes this a pretty easy decision for me. 

All emotional reasons aside I want to talk about the financial aspects of this transition and what I should plan to do over the next couple years. 

The housing market is super hot in my city right now and homes are often selling for above market price and fast. My home has increased in value very significantly based on my zestimate(I know this isn't accurate but I think there is at least correlation to the local market). My zestimate has gone up about 20k in the last 3 years since I moved in. I know that people say timing the market is a shitty idea and thats not really what I'm trying to accomplish but it seems like an unintended side effect of other life circumstances.

When I sell my home I expect to have about 40-55k in equity depending on what I can sell it for(I'm young and never had to go through this so no idea what to expect). I plan to live next to my grandmother for 3-6 years and then try and find another home when/if the market takes a turn the other way. With that in mind I have a few questions:

1. What should I do with the money? I cant commit it to any long term investing because I will want to use it for a down payment on my next home. Preferably all of it. Yet it still feels like a waste to have 50k sitting in an account not really doing anything of value.

2. I would like to pretend I still have a mortgage when I make this transition and pile money into this account to eventually maybe pay a house off in cash next time around or at least put 50%+ down as a down payment. How does the community feel about this? I have anxiety about debt so paying off a home is largely peace of mind for me. Also the feds increasing interest should be extra incentive to have a smaller principle for my next home. I know this is again sounding like I'm trying to time the market but I've read in a few places that interest rates and home costs are normally inversely correlated. Not sure if this true but it would be a nice bonus if so. 

3. It would kind of kill me to pay a realtor 6% of the homes sale. I mean not literally but I'm a huge nit so emotionally it would. With that said I plan to sell the house myself. Any words of wisdom for people who have done this themselves? 

4. What are the things I should focus on fixing up before I move put it on the market? I know you cant see my house but in general what are the highest ROI repairs and maintenance that I could make? My house is not in perfect shape and could certainly use 5k in renovations to get it updated. My main bathroom is pretty antiquated and a few of the hard wood floors have some spots where the stain didn't stick with a consistent tone and some scratching. Everything else is at least decent. 

5. Are there any other things I'm missing in general?

I'm really looking forward to your thoughts. This is going to be a rough transition for me because I do like my home but family comes first. 

Note: I wanted to proactively address some of the comments I anticipate. Renting my home is not an option for me out of personal preference. I already max out my Roth IRA and contribute to my 401k up to the employer contribution cap. I would plan to increase my 401k savings by 1% once the house is sold just to have some additional retirement savings accumulating early on in my life.",finance

P.S: I am pretty sure 401k contribution started on the first paycheck after January 1st, and at the same time, medical plans stopped

Can someone please explain:
1- Why did the taxes (federal, state, NY) drop in the first place?

2- What is this Pretax Deduction thing?

3- Am I not covered with Vision, Medical and Dental anymore or what?

4- What's going on with 401k? only starting at the new year? is that a common thing?

personalfinance,Need Advice on $750k student loan debt,"My best friend recently came to me asking for advice on how to go forward with his $750k student debt. I am a securities analyst and long term debt and retirement planning is out of my expertise. Looking for some help or suggestions from other sources. 

His wife and him will both be doctors when they graduate in 2019. She will make approximately 100k starting, and he will make approximately 120k starting. The interest on their combined 750k student loan debt will be around 5%, could range to 6% with rates climbing a bit. They will have a 20 year payoff schedule on this loan. They do not want to include the federal debt forgiveness as they anticipate the legislation to disappear and they are using banks to refi. 

Their goals are to have a child within the next five years (2017-2022) Buy a 180-200k home, and buy a new 25-30k car. 

No credit card debt or personal debt.

They will need money allocated for their dog each year, and good internet (no cable needed).

personalfinance,How to prove to lenders I can make payments for a future auto loan?,"So I got a credit card out of highschool to raise my credit, and I went in trying to buy a 2013 used truck, (I ended up not getting the payments I could afford so it fell through, but it was a good learning experience) but even though I had credit in the 720s, since I had never financed anything near $20,000, I had no proof I could make the payments, thus only giving me an 8% interest rate at the lowest.

What is something I can do to start to prove that I am reliable to lenders? Would I have to finance something that I can already afford cash, but what would be a suitable amount? I was thinking we need a new dresser, maybe we could finance one through the furniture store at 0% interest for 6-12 months, whatever it is they do. My credit limit is near $2,000 on the credit card. Should I max that with everyday stuff I will already buy, and just start paying it off at no interest?

I am confused and every time I am told one thing about credit, I find out something even more detailed that completely changes the way I thought. I do currently pay rent, but I guess that is not good enough or not reported on credit?


EDIT:

First off, thank you all for trying to help, I really do appreciate it. But, most of you are completely missing the point of my original post, and that's partially my fault for not clarifying.

My main question is what is the best way to show lenders that I can handle a payment? I was told I can only get a loan with a cosigner because I have never financed a big purchase before. That is my main problem. The debt to income ratio was not the issue according to the finance manager, **the income stated on my application was the new amount I would be making during the summer, the finance manager said that would be fine, whether he was right to do that was not my concern** I HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO WAIT ON THE AUTO LOAN. 

Now, I was able to get a loan with a cosigner, but decided I AM WAITING because I was not able to get my payments low enough for the next couple of months. I was wanting a new truck BEFORE starting my long commutes for the new job, not after. My truck now can crap out at any point. Currently I am a student, I only make like $400 a month. But, I have money saved for the next two months to cover the truck payment of up to $300 I planned on, for 84 month loan (I know, that's long, I was going to refinance after those couple of months and had actual money to spend, still not the best plan but I was fine with it)

The ONLY new payment I would be taking on would be the truck payment. I don't pay the insurance. I already pay for gas now. Everything else is COMPLETELY covered and accounted for. I will not have to pay for rent when I start my new job. My student loans are deferred until December.",finance
personalfinance,Need advice for first credit card. 23 M &gt;40k annuall,"Hey so I'd appreciate some advice, I'm looking to get my first credit card even though I don't super love the idea of credit.


 So for starters I'm going on a vacation to Italy this summer for a week (fully paid for already since I'm decent at saving) and I'm planning to pop the question to my GF of over 5 years while there. With the rings style and cut and whatnot shes wanting ends up in the price range of 7-10K for the price of the ring. I don't have that lying around while still having money for rainy days so I'm wanting to put it or at least part to credit and then make payments. 


I wont put all of the ring on credit obviously since no company will give me a 10k line... but I know most stores offer payment plans I'm just figuring that the interest might be lower on the credit card than the store payment plan. So I'm wanting to do a down payment on the ring with the CC then make payments on both if that makes sense. Need a CC eventually anyway so I'm told for when we want a house.


Now for my financials I bring home post-tax, insurance, and 401k around 2700$ a month and save most of that. My bills right now end up being 975$ monthly without groceries which we split so I end up paying about 20$ a week there since we cook our supper every night and get free lunch at work. Additionally around 40$ a month for gas which is unavoidable sadly. So total of 1035$ which still leaves me around 1665$ for other stuff, from my moderate research on rings I could with store credit alone get a payment plan for ~100$ with a pretty high interest rate in the double digits but have it paid in 5 years... I would like to pay it faster and have less interest to pay on the already expensive ring. Also I don't know that I want a store credit card that can only be used there when I could have a major card that I could use anywhere including in Italy if needed although unlikely.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Should I open a new credit line?,"So, I recently got my first credit card this past January from Capital One (QS One) and I am finishing up college this May. My CL on this card is $300. I have been paying it off in full and on time and got a credit score reported of 670. Once graduating, I will be starting a full time job where I will be making $70k a year, pre tax. I will be taking a loan out to purchase a car sometime in mid-May as well ( around $25k). My father said that he would cosign for the loan so I get a better interest rate than if I use only my credit to apply for it. His credit is in the 800s so that should not be an issue.

Bitcoin,Why I think BU is more about centralization of power than about scaling.,"I’ll start with the following, I’m fairly neutral and I’m not going to talk about either side being “evil”, but I am allergic to bullshit. 

BU proponents consistently talk about scaling this, scaling that, it’s all about scaling, lower fees, bigger blocks, removing the blocksize from being hardcoded and bringing it for the network operators to decide, I’m not going to get into the pros and cons of either side. This is what they all talk about.

But they don’t mention their own articles of Confederation, article 2 which states:

    BU roles shall consist of:
    President: a publicly identified (real-life identity is known) BU Member who is responsible for the ongoing        activities of the confederation. The president shall resolve BUIP number conflicts, organize BUIP discussion (in the forum designated by the secretary), and schedule/initiate voting (within the limits specified in these articles).*

    Secretary: a publicly identified BU Member who is responsible for recording activities and vote results, and     making this information publicly available. The Secretary is responsible for creating, maintaining and moderating a public forum where discussion can be held. Moderation is exclusively limited to moving content with an indication of it being moved - no content may be deleted. The secretary shall tally and report on votes.

    Developer: a publicly identified BU Member who is responsible for maintaining the BU code repository, choosing which committers have access to the software repository, reviewing and merging patches, and periodically releasing BU software. The Developer is an outreach position - s/he must actively work to encourage others to work on submissions, and to convert one-time submitters into regular committers.

    Pool Operator: a publicly identified BU member who is responsible for running the BU Mining pool as specified in Article 4. The position of pool operator might be vacant and pool operation is optional, as resources permit.

    Member: an individual who is invited (by BUIP) to join the Confederation, signs this document, and has joined or voted within the last 1 year. Non-publicly identified members may have restricted voting or other restrictions as determined by subsequent BUIPs - this measure may be needed to restrict duplicate accounts.

    Officer term is for two years. For continuity, elections shall be staggered by 6 months and take place 1 week   prior to responsibility transfer. Beginning with the President on Jan 15, 2018, then Secretary, Developer, and Pool Operator. This means that the initial officer term may exceed 2 years. Voting for all the initial officers shall occur on Jan 15, 2016.

[In case this section is edited or removed, here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/YOYAMyI.jpg)

Notice how every participant has to be “publicly identified”, what does this have to do with scaling? Why have a articles of confederation at all? Why have voting? Why have a 'president of bitcoin' ?

What stops the 'president of bitcoin' from being blackmailed, threatened, etc, in order to steer bitcoin in a certain direction? 

If it was just about getting bitcoin scaled, increasing the block size, and getting more transactions, you wouldn’t be seeing all of this extra fluff in my opinion. You'd just see code, not a whole damn Confederation.

To me, it feels like the scaling issue is being used as an excuse.  

Satoshi Nakamoto wouldn’t agree to something like this, and Bitcoin itself probably wouldn’t exist if Satoshi had to “publicly identify’ himself before being allowed to release bitcoin.

stocks,"Experienced investors, evaluate this small investment of mine","So me and a few friends downloaded an investment app (Bux) which has both simulated and real investments. Had a little fun on it with fake money first, but today thought what the hell and decided to put £50 GBP into it.

I bought into two US indices - £20 on the US Tech 100 and £20 on the Wall Street 30. There was an option for leverage so I went all out and chose the maximum (20:1) for both of the two.

I chose index funds since they seem to be some of the most reliable investments and these two in particular have increased steadily over the past year. The Tech 100 for example has increased by about 10% in this time. If we hypothetically assume that the next year is similar and it increases 10%, and I have 20:1 leverage on it, then my gain on that £20 should be around 200%, minus opening/closing fees and the interest. Which means I should have turned that £20 into somewhere between £50 and £60, with £30-£40 profit (I am unsure exactly what the interest rate is). 

So my first question is: are my numbers correct here?

2nd question: Is this a stupid investment? I thought that with the general reliability of index funds and the potential for a significant gain on the initial £20, that it was worth giving a shot, but I may have missed something crucial.

This is the first time I have invested anything and that £50 I can afford to lose, but I was interested from an experienced perspective if what I did was good, bad, stupid, or whatever. Any opinions would be appreciated. Cheers.",finance

personalfinance,"I am self employed, made a lot of money. My wife is employed, didn't make much. Would filing separate benefit us?","Hello, I have a unique situation, and question.

I am self employed and made quite a bit of money. My wife on the other hand is employed and did not make very much. We also have a daughter.

Would it benefit us if we filed separate and my wife took all account deductions / credits for child / expenses etc.

And I file separately.  Also self employment tax is a little confusing. I do have an accountant doing all of this stuff for me which I will be finalizing very soon. But I have a few questions (will also bring it up with them.) Does a self employed person pay the 15.3 % SE rate PLUS federal income tax? or just self employment tax ?

To throw out some number estimates
Wife income: roughly $18,000
my income: roughly $145,000

Can my wife take child care costs if it was paid by me? Would it benefit us if we filed separate and she claims our child?

solar,"Please help me choose a solar system. Riverside, CA.","I've been researching the past few months. Had 3 solar reps come for a consult, and had about 10 different over the phone conversations with other installers. Solar City, Freedom Solar, and Sempre Solaris came for an in person consult. I'm leaning towards Sempre Solaris. Sempre Solaris seems to have the highest quality of panels and best warranty. They're also highly reviewed on Yelp. Solar City and Freedom Solar offer production guarantees ($.08 and $.18 respectively), but I can only imagine how hard it would be to try and claim against their production guarantees. I'd rather have reliable panels I don't have to worry about.

Sempre Solaris is offering $17000 for a 7200 KWH (annual) system before fed rebate, with micro inverters.

I also want to get solar soon, due to Net Metering 2.0 rolling out soon. (Should I be worried about this?)

In the book, Lewis discusses the fraud committed by HFC in 2002.  He writes ""The document offered a fifteen-year, fixed-rate loan, but it was bizarrely disguised as a thirty-year loan. It took the stream of payments the homeowner would make to HFC over fifteen years, spread it hypothetically over thirty years, and asked: If you were making the same dollar payment over thirty years that you were in fact making over fifteen, what would your ""effective rate"" of interest be?  It was a weird, dishonest sales pitch.  The borrower was told he had an ""effective interest rate of 7 percent"" when he was in fact paying something like 12.5 percent.""

personalfinance,Desperate help. Don't understand self employment taxes at all.,"So first a little background. I made no income at all in 2015 nor had a tax liability. From my understanding that means I did not have to do quarterly payments in 2016. Now from June-December as a self-employed person I made around 8,000. Now I understand I have to do an estimated tax but I have no clue how to determine that. During February I made 10k so already made over my 2016 earnings. 

With that information can someone please help me get an understanding of what to do.

I set it up on hr blocks website and it said I owe around 1100 federal income tax and 391 state tax. I am from Maryland. My issue is these estimated taxes. 

So is this what I do. I didn't have to pay estimated taxes in 2016 since I had no tax liability in 2015. As a result I go ahead and file with hr block and pay the 1500 I owe state and federal.

Now I have already made 10k so far this year. So does that mean I take 15.3% of that and make quarterly estimated payments out of that for the SE tax? I understand if my income goes up I need to adjust the next estimated payments. For the state of Maryland also is that my only tax obligation? The estimated tax payments? 

Then next year when I file I will owe the federal income tax.

personalfinance,"I'm 19 and working for a top Fortune 500 company while in college, but I'm barely breaking even.","Apologies in advance for this being so long, I tried to summarize as best I could.

So as the title states I'm 19 and I'm currently a sophomore in college. I am very fortunate to have landed a job when I was 18 at a Fortune 500 company part time. We will just call it the Fruit company. I make a little over 15 dollars an hour and generally work 20-25 hours each week. So each biweekly paycheck comes in around 400 after the government takes their share. I know it's not a lot but I have a lot of opportunity to grow here and their are other benefits I will get into later. I try to be as frugal as I can with my spending but I will occasionally spend more han I should on things. My costs each month usually total up to around 825. That's including rent, utilities/bills, and groceries. 

Obviously being in college I have tuition to pay as well, which comes out to roughly 12,000 a year. unfortunately I lost a scholarship because I became complacent with the grades I was getting and my GPA fell to a 2.95 which is .5 lower than what I need to maintain this scholarship. Fortunately I can regain this scholarship so long as by the year end I bring my GPA back up to the 3.0 required. Doing this would give me 5000 dollars a year cutting that 12,000 to 7,000. This year was the first year I had to take out a loan for the 12,000. Last year I saved all my money and sold my car to cover the tuition since I can just walk everywhere being that the campus and my apartment are in the city. 

So when I took out this loan I was given the option to go with a variable interest rate that was currently at 6.8% or something like that, or the fixed rate of 9%. I opted for the 9% just because I would rather know that it will stay there than take the risk of that 6.8 jumping for whatever reason. Hopefully this was the right choice. Through my job I can actually refinance my loans so I may be able to get that fixed rate even lower than what the variable was, I still have to speak to them to get a quote. 

As I mentioned before I get some great benefits from the company, one of which is they reimburse a little over 5000 dollars worth of tuition costs each year. One of my questions is what to do with this money I get back? I also enrolled myself in the stock purchase program which I opted to have 4% of my paycheck go towards that. It goes through a period of about 8 months and then the stock is purchased at whatever the lowest price was during that entire period. So generally that puts 500 each period into my stock accounts. At the end of the year I also usually get a stock bonus  a little over 1000 dollars that vests in 1 year from the grant date.

My main problem is that I am really just breaking even each month after I have paid my rent and bills. So I feel like I'm not really setting much aside. What can I do to give myself a little extra cushion? I feel like the stock purchase program is something that will really help me down the road so that's the main reason I take some out of my paycheck each month. There really isn't anything I can cut any further cost wise because my apartment is pretty much the cheapest you can get and I keep my bills as low as possible by not having the AC on and keeping all the lights off. I'm just really tired of this feeling of worrying whether or not I'm going to have the money each month and not just being able to easily pay everything and live comfortably.

“With [equity] growth momentum nearing its peak and rates increasing further with a hawkish Fed, the asymmetry for equities is turning increasingly negative,” the team wrote, noting that Goldman expects three rate hikes in 2017—in March, June, and September. “Higher bond yields are likely to weigh on equities and reduce their buffer for shocks.”

personalfinance,New Job Questions Concerning Debt and Housing,"Hi all, 
I recently got a huge promotion at a place I was previously contracting at for a month.  The compensation is 50k a year, with a 401k.  I opted for investing 3% of my check for now.  I also have no dependents, so I can get more tax back later.  
I have student loans worth about 50k and 50k, with payments that are 400/mo (parentPLUS that I'm paying my parents) and also I'm paying $0 on my federal loans currently.  Next December, that will change when I update the IBR, I'm estimating payments being increased to ~$400 unless I opt out of the IBR and go for a payment that'll be 350-500/mo.  Basically, my monthly costs are currently ~500/mo, and in 8 months it'll be 800-1000 a month.  
With that said, I'm 26 years old and live at home again.  I know people are really into ""knocking out the debt,"" but I'm not really into being 30 and living at home still...  I also know my parents plan to move away from here in the next year or so, so I'm trying to make arrangements accordingly.
I'm thinking that in about half a year, I'll have a good amount of savings (minimum of 15k if all goes well), and I'll have a good idea if I'm going to be staying around the current job.  Should I make moves to buy a house?  I know of a good area nearby that I think is going to be growing a bit and would like to invest well.  If I can find a place for 80-100k and put a large downpayment on it, should I?  I'd like to move out but hate the idea of throwing away money by renting, which would probably be around the same as a house payment (800-1000).

How fucked am I?","I'm not looking for /r/relationships advice so much, or maybe I do need it, I don't know. Mostly I feel very stressed about moving forward, if I will be able to make it for myself or not. 

For starters, I make $58,200 in suburban Philadelphia. I can't afford the town we live in, and she's keeping the apartment, so I'll need to move, either back to the city or elsewhere. Still figuring that part out. 

After taxes and contributions to my Roth 401k, I end up with about $3000 in my bank account each month. My employer matches 10%, I put in 10%. Very thankful. Not sure about switching back to pretax or scaling back though. 

So for bills, they go as follows:

Student Loans: Currently I owe about $63,000 private and $22,000 federal. Yeah. These have been refinanced as far as I can with my current credit score. The cost me $640 and $160 a month respectively, though I currently pay $900 on the one. Shitty mistakes, it is what it is.

Current rent etc: I currently pay $600 for rent, $80 for cable, and water/sewer/trash moves around, say $50 or so max. In a new place, electric and gas would be on me probably, and rent for a studio around here is ~8-900 for a possibly bombed out rat nest. I don't know anyone looking for roommates and I would prefer to move ASAP, finding a stranger to go immediately is going to take more time and every day still living together is going to actually kill me.. Also, moving back to Philly would increase my taxes by about $170, if that's best for me. Rent is cheaper there and I'm not finding many listings in the suburbs in my price range. I don't know yet.

Car: Insurance is 160, gas is around 100 maybe, current tolls are around 70. Not sure if I'll still need to take the turnpike or not. I did just pay off the loan, there's that going for me.

Food, going out eventually, etc? I don't know yet actually.

Other: About 100 in subscriptions (gym, streaming stuff, etc), 80 in phone bill, probably some other small stuff.. I used to be able to squirrel away a few hundred a month for future big stuff, a wedding, a dream car, but.. you know. 


Anyways, by my math, I'm going to be left with a startlingly low amount of money at the end of the month, in the worst case scenario.


Also. It should be said, I have about $2500 in savings. I'll need first/last/security to move, plus I have literally no furniture. Literally all of it is hers from her rich parents. No friends, family, whatever can help me there. Will I be okay to put some IKEA stuff on credit, or how fucked am I in that regard, too. Having my savings wiped and then not being able to save more is really bothersome. 


I think I cope by having anxiety about things like this. Anyway, TLDR: If I'm fucked, what's a good thing to look about scaling back? If I'm not fucked, I don't know, what do I do from here?",finance

I decided to post this on here to see if anyone had any advice on what I can do in my situation. 
Two years ago when I filed my taxes after returning to the workforce the preparer filed them incorrectly. My taxes are fairly simple. Just myself and one dependant. (It took less than 5 minutes). The preparer e-filed( I was not given a choice), hit submit and told me it would be $318.97! I felt that this was an excessive amount to charge. I asked if she could cancel the submission because as a single parent, I just could not afford that much. She told me that there was no way to reverse it. My stomach dropped. I let her know it would have to come out of my return. This particular year my taxes were with held and went towards my student loans.  A few days ago I checked my credit score and noticed an outstanding debt from said tax preparer, only now the debt is upwards of $350.00 Apparently, the tax preparer did not receive their payment from my return (I have since rehabilitated my student loans). I have also hired a CPA to refile them correctly. Is there anyway I can dispute this debt since I have incurred additional costs in fixing their errors? My taxes have to be completely refiled per my local federal IRS office. Is there anyway to dispute the amount?

I want to start off by acknowledging that I know am better off than a lot of people, but I still feel like I’m stuck in a rut and I’m not sure how to grow what I have. I’m 27 and live alone at the moment.

I like to think I understand how to manage my finances, but that’s mostly because the people around me that I can compare myself with are not very responsible with money. I would love any and all advice
Here’s a bit of a breakdown of where I’m at:

**Liquid Assets**
•	$11,250 in various accounts

**Non-Liquid Assets**
•	$196,000 in property and a vehicle

**Liabilities**
•	$150,500 Mortgage of (interest rate of 2.47%)
•	$7,400 Student line of credit (interest rate of 4.5%)
•	$4,500 in RRSP which I used for a down payment on my condo. I have till 2029 to pay this back without penalty
•	I cosigned for a line of credit for my little sister so she could go to University. It’s for $10,000.

**Income**
•	$2575/month take home from my main job
•	$600-$800/month take home at my second job

**Expenses**
•	On average I spend $2,500 including all my bills, food, ect..

I was able to get to the point I’m at by working three jobs and going to school full time. My grades and social life did take a hit because of this, but at least I don’t have a huge amount of student debt hanging over my head.

At this point I’m not sure what I should focus on. Should I work on paying down my debts or should I put my liquid assets into investments? I’ve been interested in getting into the stock markets, and I’ve been doing some research on companies I like. I’m meeting with the bank on Friday to open a WebBroker account, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to put my money into the market yet.

I’m nervous (probably irrationally) about not having a job at some point, so I’d like to have a cushion in case the worst happens. I’d also like to do something to be prepared for retirement, even though that’s a long way away. 

I just have a lot running through my head and trying to sort it out's a nightmare. Even just writing this down helps. Again, if anyone has any advice to help me understand what to do I will take it.

I was was wondering what a good end point for purchasing home with some student loan debt (due to its low interest) &amp; Savings?

btc,Where are Greg Maxwell's promised 2WP trustless sidechains?,"Every coin holder has had to ask what separates their coin from a ponzi, and for Bitcoin many have posited prediction markets, asset issuance, stock trading, options and futures exchanges will provide that critical point of differentiation.

All the usual suspects in this space, from Blockstream to Ethereum to Counterparty and to a certain extent colored coins, have stuck their necks out over the years claiming they are the pre-eminent solution for this market need.

But in Bitcoin's case, those of us who supported [Counterparty](https://counterparty.io) and on-chain systems were told that we could *never* achieve this on mainnet since ""Bitcoin doesn't scale"".

Now that Ethereum is [once again approaching](https://coinmarketcap.com) 20% of Bitcoin's market cap on huge volume, it's time more people get fed up with Blockstream's bullshit. **Where are the 2WP sidechains, Blockstream**?

If Bitcoin mainnet had SPECTRE 12s block times, and we increased OP_RETURN to 500kb and in general at least *pretended* to like [embedding Ethereum inside of Bitcoin blocks](https://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-recreates-ethereums-smart-contract-platform-on-bitcoin/), then we could make tremendous progress towards thwarting the competition before it's too late.

I'm as diversified as the next guy, but this is just *so aggravating*. It's deeply regretful to see *inferior technology* winning in the marketplace for ideas when better tech is untested and unsupported due to lack of funds, lack of attention and just pure politics standing in the way.

Forex,A Forensic Approach to Trading: Examining the FOMC release.,"It's a truism in trading that your strategies are worthless unless they pass the test of the market. They either make money in the long run, or they don't. We have a hard, factual standard we can hold matters to.

When it comes to theories about what is *happening in the market*, it's much harder to apply similar standards because many things don't appear on the charts. However, this often means we fail to even try.

This is bad practice. We should be willing to challenge our own, and other's theories about the market, as well as investigate out-of-the-box theories, by comparing them to available chart evidence. 



**Edit: /u/squitstoomuch has drawn my attention to the fact that my analysis and understanding of the situation has some serious, if not fatal flaws. Rather than delete the post, I'll leave it up because looking at other people's mistakes is often useful, and it's still a good idea to compare your ideas to the charts and see if the market validates them. Grossly incorrect stuff has strike throughs, the rest still stands.**

~~For example, a very common analysis you will hear after the combination of rate decision and Governor press conference is that the overall direction of movement can be accounted for by what was said in the conference.~~

~~This is something you can assess by looking at the charts.~~

**Proposition 1: The USD fell largely due to Yellen's comments implying future rate trajectories**

Consider: 

M1 EURUSD  
http://i.imgur.com/MS7ceQf.png

M1 USDJPY  
http://i.imgur.com/JeHI8qw.png

You can see that the majority of the price movement against the USD happens within the first ten minutes after the rate release, and within that, the majority of the move happened within the first minute. 


~~Logic dictates that NONE of this movement was related to the content of the speech, simply because the speech had not been given yet.~~

You can also see that although there was movement throughout the speech, it managed to only depress the USD an additional third compared to the rate release.

~~How you choose to interpret this is up to you, but at least you can now frame the 'it was Yellen's speech that did it' theories in the context of some irrefutable evidence.~~

~~My personal interpretation is that whilst the speech content strongly influences price, and did further depress the USD, it was not the *original motivator for the drop*. Nor was it the main determinant of the magnitude of the drop in the value of the USD, because both of those happened before she ever opened her mouth.~~
~~    

Let's look at some more propositions. 

**Proposition 2: You should trade what happened last time** 

USDJPY H1 chart from 14th December 2016, the previous time rates were raised.
FOMC raises Fed Fund Rate, USD goes:

http://i.imgur.com/qL7upT7.png

... up. So if you had simply looked at  what happened last time, and then bought this time, you would have lost money. I'm going to strongly recommend that nobody short the USD for the next rate hike *just because* it went down this time!  
 

**Proposition 3: You could have just predicted the movement on technicals.**

Well...

http://i.imgur.com/zYOlVmw.png

... as it turns out,  one of the most basic, elementary technical strategies (trendline + horizontal resistance) would have gotten you in nicely this time, at least on USDJPY. The EURUSD set-up was a bit more advanced, but still straightforward in the context of the essentially guaranteed rate decision.

http://i.imgur.com/L8B7s1K.png

Interestingly, pivot points perfectly predicted the extent of the day's price movement this time round.

USDJPY (D)

http://i.imgur.com/emY42Nn.png

EURUSD (H1)

http://i.imgur.com/fD8UDss.png

(Note the different timeframes. This may just be a case of coincidence, but I will say that ever since I put them on my charts, they've been very useful for exactly this sort of thing: how far the market will go before a pause or a retrace).

**Proposition 4: the market is irrational and unpredictable**

I don't have any strong evidence to disprove this, but  I will say that the NFP price action was a big red flag that something like this was going to happen on FOMC day, and that there are [clear, strongly repeatable analytical approaches](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/5yq8sd/why_the_markets_reaction_to_the_nonfarm_payrolls/) that predicted an outcome like this. Many people were not the least bit surprised.

^^^^^^^^^^. 


Finally, I'd like to suggest that this is much more than just ""pricing in"". I don't have the time nor patience to go through my archives and dig out every ""priced in"" economic release that I've ever tried to trade, so I'll leave the evidence hunt for those more curious. 

But in my experience, when the market has priced an event in, and that event happens, the usual result is ... nothing. This is what 'pricing in' means, that price is already correct in regards to that information.

If anything actually happens, it's usually counter-intuitive, and that means that the big banks are using the event to hustle price about. 

As a footnote, that's not the only way they hustle price. One thing they also like to use talking heads to influence market sentiment:  http://news.forexlive.com/!/goldman-sachs-see-a-second-fed-hike-in-june-20170310 (This bulletin is saying there will be faster rate hikes, ie investors should buy USD. You might wonder why Goldman would risk their reputation by putting their name behind directions they're not trading, and the easy answer is that nobody remembers these bulletins, but everyone remembers the end of year profits of the bank.

Forex,I believe I know why USD tanked yesterday after FOMC statement,"My thanks go to /u/alotmorealots for writing such a [nice post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/5zoo2z/a_forensic_approach_to_trading_examining_the_fomc/). It really made me think and search why EUR/USD reacted as it did, though I did not trade it this time.

If you look at the [30 Day Federal Funds Futures chart](https://s.tradingview.com/x/CXwXi297/), you will a significant upward movement yesterday. It coincides with the FOMC statement release time if you switch to [intraday](https://s.tradingview.com/x/Grzg1mel/). When the fed funds futures goes up, it means that the lower interest rates are expected. Thus, **fed funds futures market has clearly interpreted the statement as such that implies lower future interest rates**. It was likely interpreted that way by big USD speculators as well (otherwise, it would create a huge arbitrage opportunity between FF futures and USD spot markets). Of course, it brought weakness to the US dollar across all currency pairs.

The exact reasons for such interpretation are unclear to me, but I guess some big institutional market participants had hoped that Yellen would produce a more hawkish statement and/or projections (though they were not quite dovish either - see [difference with February statement](http://graphics.wsj.com/fed-statement-tracker/)). There also was one FOMC member who voted against the rate increase.",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loans - Help!,"Hey guys, 

This is my first real post and I'm hoping to get some good advice. I've been reading the forums a lot lately and I've witnessed tons of amazing responses to questions asked by all kinds of people. 

I graduated back in 2012 and I still have about $25,000 in student loan debt. I have mostly federal loans ranging from 3.5% APR to 6.8%APR. 

As I was doing my taxes I realized I paid over $2000 last year in interest alone. Not including principle payment reductions! 

Most of my bigger loans are in the %6.8 APR. My monthly payment ranges from like $300 to $500 per month. I've been trying to pay more to get the principle balance down lower, but I can't. As I'm not really employed well at the moment. I currently drive for Uber. 

I have good credit, about a 715 score. I make about $500-$900 a week and I pay about $900 a month in rent. I don't have a car payment. 

I'd like to get my student loan refinanced, ideally into one loan. I also have a perkins loan that I pay my school separately $40 a month. Which I paid $142 in interest last year on. 

Have any of you refinanced your student loans? If so, what interest rate did you get? Which company do you recommend? I hate paying 2 grand in interest alone per year. That's ridiculous to me.

There's really no use for dash other than being a redundant crypto to bitcoin and a bunch if f early investors hoping to cash in on a predictable growth like bitcoin. The possible resistance could be merchant acceptance. There not enough market cap for them to be interested. 

The PBOC raised their interest in reaction to the Fed raising their rate in the US. This has a strengthening effect on the Yuan. But this may be temporary. Nevertheless, it could slow down flow into bitcoin temporarily

financialindependence,"Paying Off $75,000 in 2 Years","I recognize that this will not be applicable to many of you, and I realize it's not even particularly original advice. But I have seen enough people here (and in Personal Finance) dealing with student loans that I thought it would be worth sharing. 

For us, paying off these loans was not about the ideal ROI. We know we could have gotten a better return if we had put our money in the market, especially once we killed off all of the loans over 4% interest. But financial independence isn’t only about being set up for early retirement ten, twenty, or thirty years down the road. For us, it is about limiting our debts and liabilities now. 

With student loans (or any other kind of debt) over our heads, we would have always felt like we needed to work. Now, especially with our spending so low, I will feel comfortable taking more time off each year. 

Most of this is conventional wisdom from financial independence, but some of it moves away from a more conservative take on money in favor of getting rid of debt ASAFP. 

*Edit for context: We earned roughly $100,000 over these two years. $39,000 the first year and $61,000 the second. 

Without further ado, these are the seven steps I’ve followed to pay off $75,000 of student loans in just two years. 

**#1: Understand Your Loans**  

You can’t kill your loans if you don’t understand them. Just like it takes time and effort to get to know someone in real life, it takes time and effort to get to know your student loans - even if you hate them. If other Kindle books work as a dating guide, consider this a guide to breaking up with your student loans - and, like your crazy ex, making sure they stay away.  
- Understand your interest rates and what they mean over time
- Understand how little minimum payments actually do toward getting you out of debt
- Understand the best way to make payments (some loan servicers take credit card payments, which went a long way toward churning for us)
- Understand interest capitalization - this is how companies make money, and the #1 reason you should get out of debt ASAP

**#2: Consider Your Purchases**  
The Latte Factor is real, ya'll. Giving up a $10 lunch out every workday in favor of paying off your loans means an extra $12,000 thrown at them over the course of five years. Considering your purchases looks different for everyone - in many cases, it is helpful to set up a budget and stick to it. I'll admit, we didn't budget at all, but we knew where our money was going and sat on ""larger"" purchases (i.e. anything over $50) for at least a few days. If you can't - or won't - budget, at least track your spending through Personal Capital or Mint. Delayed gratification is your friend.  

**#3: Make it a Game**  
We've been fostering nine little girls, and what's true for them is true for everyone: gamification makes everything better. Set a minimum loan payment goal (at least twice the actual minimum payment) and see how far above that goal you can get each month. We consistently set completely arbitrary goals, like getting below $10k by the New Year. These goals were not necessary, but they kept us motivated when the slogging got particularly sloggy.  

#4: Don't Sacrifice Too Much  
Having only one financial goal for two years might have started to drive us a little batty. Instead of throwing every single penny at the loans, we also made the space, time and funds available for things we enjoy and value. We love to travel, and have spent close to $10,000 on it over the past two years. Sure, we could've used this to pay off our debt even faster, but we didn't want to be slaves to our goal. I also love to cook. The first year of hitting our loans hard, we spent around $100 per month on food, keeping our meals very, very frugal. The second year, we honestly got tired of that and upped our grocery spending to $400 in order to get imported items, meat, dairy, and healthier options like olive and coconut oil. I don't regret our spending, because I considered our purchases first.  

**#5: Work Smarter AND Harder**
One of my favorite themes in FI is to constantly look for higher paying work and to work out a side hustle. I honestly believe this is the key to FI. Over the past two years, I've been able to build up my hourly rate from $15 an hour to $35 an hour (still a pittance for some of the heavy hitters on here, but it's great for Central America). I've also built up a relatively lucrative side hustle. But building your hourly rate when you're paying off the emergency that is student loans is not enough. I've also consistently worked 50-60 hours per week. I'm young, I'm healthy, I have energy. Why not? By working at least ten hours extra per week, we were able to cut down our payoff time by about a fifth. The conventional wisdom that Millennials tends to perk up at is to work smarter, not harder. But why can't we do both? With my 25th birthday approaching and loans paid off, now I can consider more of a work/life balance.  

**#6: Keep Your Other Finances Healthy**  
There are really only two points to this: first, make sure none of your other debt is more of an emergency, and second, keep an emergency fund. It doesn't make sense to carry credit card debt while aggressively paying down student loans, but it would to keep a auto loan at 1%. That's about as mathematical as I get, so you're welcome. The other area of importance is to keep at least 3 months of expenses as an emergency fund. Since our required monthly expenses are so low, ours was only $1,000. I'll admit: we drained that a couple of times to throw extra slugs at our student loans. I helped us kill our loans faster, but it also added a little extra stress since we had no cash in our accounts at some points. It's not a strategy I'd recommend, so make sure you build up and keep up that emergency fund.  

**#7: Stay Consistent**  
This is by far the most important element of paying off student loans quickly. Getting the ball rolling may be difficult, but the 'middle' will be the hardest part of paying off your loans. It was very rewarding to see our balance go from $75,000 to $50,000. It was a lot less rewarding to see it go from $50,000 to $30,000 and see how far we had to go. We stayed consistent by maintaining a minimum monthly payment goal ($2,200 for us) and throwing whatever extra we had for that month. Sometimes our payments were right at $2,200 - sometimes they were double that. If you have a salaried job, I recommend setting up automated payments so that you don't even have to think about it. That limits the temptation to drop back down to the minimum payments.",finance

- Understand interest capitalization - this is how companies make money, and the #1 reason you should get out of debt ASAP

**#2: Consider Your Purchases**  
The Latte Factor is real, ya'll. Giving up a $10 lunch out every workday in favor of paying off your loans means an extra $12,000 thrown at them over the course of five years. Considering your purchases looks different for everyone - in many cases, it is helpful to set up a budget and stick to it. I'll admit, we didn't budget at all, but we knew where our money was going and sat on ""larger"" purchases (i.e. anything over $50) for at least a few days. If you can't - or won't - budget, at least track your spending through Personal Capital or Mint. Delayed gratification is your friend.  

**#3: Make it a Game**  
We've been fostering nine little girls, and what's true for them is true for everyone: gamification makes everything better. Set a minimum loan payment goal (at least twice the actual minimum payment) and see how far above that goal you can get each month. We consistently set completely arbitrary goals, like getting below $10k by the New Year. These goals were not necessary, but they kept us motivated when the slogging got particularly sloggy.  

#4: Don't Sacrifice Too Much  
Having only one financial goal for two years might have started to drive us a little batty. Instead of throwing every single penny at the loans, we also made the space, time and funds available for things we enjoy and value. We love to travel, and have spent close to $10,000 on it over the past two years. Sure, we could've used this to pay off our debt even faster, but we didn't want to be slaves to our goal. I also love to cook. The first year of hitting our loans hard, we spent around $100 per month on food, keeping our meals very, very frugal. The second year, we honestly got tired of that and upped our grocery spending to $400 in order to get imported items, meat, dairy, and healthier options like olive and coconut oil. I don't regret our spending, because I considered our purchases first.  

**#5: Work Smarter AND Harder**
One of my favorite themes in FI is to constantly look for higher paying work and to work out a side hustle. I honestly believe this is the key to FI. Over the past two years, I've been able to build up my hourly rate from $15 an hour to $35 an hour (still a pittance for some of the heavy hitters on here, but it's great for Central America). I've also built up a relatively lucrative side hustle. But building your hourly rate when you're paying off the emergency that is student loans is not enough. I've also consistently worked 50-60 hours per week. I'm young, I'm healthy, I have energy. Why not? By working at least ten hours extra per week, we were able to cut down our payoff time by about a fifth. The conventional wisdom that Millennials tends to perk up at is to work smarter, not harder. But why can't we do both? With my 25th birthday approaching and loans paid off, now I can consider more of a work/life balance.  

**#6: Keep Your Other Finances Healthy**  
There are really only two points to this: first, make sure none of your other debt is more of an emergency, and second, keep an emergency fund. It doesn't make sense to carry credit card debt while aggressively paying down student loans, but it would to keep a auto loan at 1%. That's about as mathematical as I get, so you're welcome. The other area of importance is to keep at least 3 months of expenses as an emergency fund. Since our required monthly expenses are so low, ours was only $1,000. I'll admit: we drained that a couple of times to throw extra slugs at our student loans. I helped us kill our loans faster, but it also added a little extra stress since we had no cash in our accounts at some points. It's not a strategy I'd recommend, so make sure you build up and keep up that emergency fund.  

**#7: Stay Consistent**  
This is by far the most important element of paying off student loans quickly. Getting the ball rolling may be difficult, but the 'middle' will be the hardest part of paying off your loans. It was very rewarding to see our balance go from $75,000 to $50,000. It was a lot less rewarding to see it go from $50,000 to $30,000 and see how far we had to go. We stayed consistent by maintaining a minimum monthly payment goal ($2,200 for us) and throwing whatever extra we had for that month. Sometimes our payments were right at $2,200 - sometimes they were double that. If you have a salaried job, I recommend setting up automated payments so that you don't even have to think about it. That limits the temptation to drop back down to the minimum payments.",finance
personalfinance,Mom gifted me money to use towards my student loans. What's the best way to allocate those funds?,"Hi Reddit. I have about $30k in student loans from undergrad that I am paying off. My mom recently got a promotion/bonus and unexpectedly gifted me $4k to use towards my student loans. I also plan on using around $800-$1000 of my tax return money to help pay down my debts. I am familiar with both the avalanche and the snowball methods of paying these debts off, and I am more inclined towards the avalanche method, since I would like to pay as little interest as possible. I am wondering what the best way to allocate this $5k-ish towards my loans would be.

Here are the totals and interest rates:

Loan 1: $7033.43  at 6.550%

Loan 2: $4006.01 at 3.610%

Loan 3: 2,836.85 at 3.610%

Loan 4: 8179.46 at 4.410%

Loan 5: 7808.78 at 4.040%


Does it make the most sense to put all $5k towards the loan at 6.550%? Or should I spread it between multiple loans, perhaps putting $3k towards the highest interest loan, and $1k each towards the next highest interest rate loans?
I have been trying to do the math and I can't make heads or tails of it past a certain point. What's the most economically efficient way to allocate this money?",finance
personalfinance,[Debt] Private student loans dropping off this year. What to expect?,"Hi all - according to my latest TransUnion report, I noticed that three private loans are scheduled to drop off my credit report this fall according to my state's Statue of Limitations. They total about $17K, which would bring my total debt down to around 40K total (counting federal student loans, and a car loan). I am completely up to date on everything else currently and making consistent payments. Credit score isn't great right now, obviously because of these private loans that I neglected for so long. Should I expect to see a significant boost to my credit score when the private loans fall off?",finance
personalfinance,Going off of another college post.. I dont know what financial decisions to make for college,"So here's my situation. 

New Jersey, currently a senior in highschool, only applied to two really good In-state schools and got into both no problem. Both schools offered me *very* substantial federal and state, however, I don't know how to go about deciding. 

School #1 is where I want to be, and would most likely be happier there as well as succeed more from better academic opportunities; the only caveat is that I would have to dorm and that would leave a balance of nearly $7,000 that I could only cover with private loans. There's no way for me to pay for this out of pocket or have my parent help me.
Advantages: won't have to work a lot through school to support myself so I can focus of assignments, bigger school with more academic and networking opportunities, and definitively a more social environment than other school (which really makes a difference for me).
Disadvantages: having to take out private loans (will elaborate further).  

Now, School #2 is much closer to home and I would be a commuter. The campus is really not in that great of a place but the programs are pretty good (though not better than school #1). Nearly my whole cost of attendance will be covered by government aid with very minimal federal loans and no need for private loans. I should add that I don't really want to go here but the financial aspect makes it hard to look away. 
Advantages: most likely &lt;$5000 will be taken out in fed loans during four years, close to home, good programs.
Disadvantages: will have to work much more in order to support myself which will likely affect my focus on school work, will need to buy a car for commuting (I.e. extra bills), I'm new to the area and being a commuter will make me feel a bit lonely as making friends is harder, social life is generally really dead, mostly like will be really unhappy here.

A word on the loans... my single-parent mother has horrendous credit and is in no position to cosign a private loan. I would end up asking another family member to cosign, but there's no guarantee of them agreeing.  So committing to school #1 is contingent to whether or not I can even find a cosigner. 

Should I follow my happiness? Should I focus on the financial burdens? Im really conflicted and, as a sufferer of depression and anxiety, I am really worried that physically being in an environment where I am unhappy could really fuck with my head. But I don't know what's worse; a period of potential anxiety or tens of thousands of dollars of debt. 

Thanks for any responses!!!

Edit1: I should add that the $7k balance is a remainder after applying my financial aid of federal grants, federal loans, and state grants.  So the sum total of all private and federal loans would be upwards of $50k.

Edit2: Thank you guys so much, your input has been very helpful!",finance
personalfinance,Interest rates are too high. Calling doesn't help.,"I called Wells Fargo today. I have $4,000 on a platinum credit card. They charge me 25.49% APR. I have a 707 credit score and asked them to lower my rate. They basically laughed at me. I threatened to transfer the balance to another card and they blew it off.

My wife and I are school teachers. I make about $42000 (she's $35,000) annual and I have about $14000 on 23%+ APR cards. I've called each and they don't care. I have been working to drag ourselves out of debt. I have already paid off four other credit cards and have been snowballing. But money is tight and that leads to temptation to use credit. I am now looking at debt consolidation loans and balance transfers. 

I'm worried that I won't be approved for high enough balances to make the transfers or loans worth the hit on my score when I apply. 

How can I shop around without ruining my credit? How do I make good on my threat to leave Wells Fargo?

My credit score is 735. 

Trying to navigate the best way to pay off debt/save for retirement/become financially stable and literate for a lifetime! I've been reading this forum as often as possible as I was basically financially illiterate. 

I plan to use the snowball effects for my student loans but am wondering if it would be better to focus on paying down the ones that are already collecting interest, or after I pay off my highest 6.8% loan, to switch over extra money to the perkins loan even though it's not due or collecting interest for another year. 

8,0000 in Federal Perkins at 5% 
-- i was told yesterday that payments are not due until April 2018 and no interest will occur until then. 

3,500 at 3.4% 

2100 at 6.8% - the one i've been targetting 

5600 at 3.86% 

2200 at 4.66% 

I'm graduating this semester and expect to find a position for 50,000 at least starting June 1st. I am going to stay with Grandma as long as we can stand each other but I think I will have to move into my own place mid-summer since I will be able to afford it. 
I currently am in 2 classes and work around 25 hours with about $700 paycheck every 2 weeks. I've been using this to pay down the 6.8% loan to get it where it's at now and I plan to have it paid off in about 6-8 more weeks. 
I am really targeting jobs that offer a 401K but I would also like to take about $1,000 to start with when I get a new job and put it towards a retirement account, I am thinking a Roth 401K. When I mentioned this to my Dad he told me it was a bad idea and to just focus on the loans for now but I would like some more opinions. I think starting earlier is better, right? I will be 25 this year. 

I have about $400 owed on a barclay card for apple computer but as long as it's paid off in 6 months there's no interest. Otherwise my regular Chase Sapphire preferred I pay off every month and usually about $100. My work provides a lot of food and living with Grandma has its perks as far as food costs go.

$30-40 electric.
$50 car and renter's insurance combined.
$66 cell phone bill.
$45 internet bill.
$10 netflix.
Grocery bill depends. I can get by at around $50 a week.

Federal are a little over $16,000.

Private loans are on a temporary interest only payment plan, but I try to pay $100-200 a month on them.
Federal are in a temporary forbearance. 

The reason for the interest only/forbearance is I went through some personal struggles and medical bills; but I'm now ready (well... and pretty much have to) tackle them as they are now my only debt.

It worries me that soon I will be owing the full amount per month on my loans soon, and want to be in a good financial situation.

I received company stock options and restricted stock some years back. The company was sold and I was forced to cash out both sets of stock. I received a 1099-B for the 2 sales. It shows $0 Federal Income Tax Withheld.

However, I received a summary of the stock transaction and it clearly shows Federal Taxes were paid. I called the broker (Computershare) and they stated that is normal. The Federal tax withholdings was paid by the employer. And would be included in my W-2 total Federal payments. And on my W-2, it shows the income from the Stock sale (Box 12 Code V).

Thus, to me, the stock transaction has been fully reported to the government.  However, if I input my 1099-B on H&amp;R Block's tool, it raises my income but since it shows 0 Federal withholdings, I owe more Federal taxes.

I am confused because I feel like this is double taxation and I am not sure how to input this correctly. Any help/guidance would be much appreciated!",finance

I'm looking for a way to automatically calculate a savings system that uses two different interest rates, with money flowing from one account to another at a fixed interval.

We put money in to a short term term deposit, but while we wait for that to mature, her income every month goes in to a general savings account. Every 4 months, the term deposit matures, and we add whatever we've saved in those 4 months, and open a new term deposit.

personalfinance,My family is eager to assist me with my student loan payments to help me avoid interest; I would appreciate any feedback on our plan.,"(x-post from /r/StudentLoans, which hasn't really resulted in any mindful or useful responses so far)

**Current Plan**: 45k Loan, 750/mo for ~6yrs (10k interest over that time, 55k overall)

**Proposal 1**: 45k Loan, 3k/mo for 1.3 Years (15 months), (2k interest, 47k overall) [After: ay parents 1k/mo for ~4yr]

**Proposal 2**: 45k Loan, Pay 10k from my own savings immediately, 35k Loan Remaining: Pay 3k/month for 1 Year, 1.2k interest, 36.2k overall [After: pay parents 1k/Mo for 36mo)

My family has always been very supportive, and are encouraging me to develop a plan whereby my student loans get paid off quickly with their help to avoid accrued interest and I'd pay them back at a reasonable rate.

Additional Info: All of my loans are Federal Stafford Loans with 6.8% interest rates. And my income and budget may well enable me to add ~500 or so funds each month on top of the 3k my parents would submit to FedLoan, so it could get paid off even more quickly. My income is between 4-4.5k/mo and monthly expenses/rent total 2.5-3k on average. And the savings account I'd pay from for Proposal 2 would leave a healthy amount for emergencies.

**Questions**: I fully appreciate how generous an undertaking my family is offering me here. Proposal #2 is the leading candidate in my mind.

**(1)** Are there any basic modifications to the proposals you would suggest? I'll be monitoring responses and can provide more details if it'd help.

**(2)** I've seen threads in PF made by surprised redditors who paid off their loan early and were hit with an unexpected tax issue in the next year, what should I expect in this regard?

**(3)** Are there any other suggestions or tips you'd recommend? With my family support, we don't see any reason *not* to undertake an aggressive payment plan like described above.

**(4)** Kind of a side question, My Stafford loans totaling 45k are distributed across 8 or so of these federal loans--some being 8k, some 5k, some 2k or less. Is there any method to specifically which ones are paid off, if they're all 6.8%? These first couple months I've paid $750 it appears to have apportioned the payments automatically, but is there any reason to manually target the bigger loans, or does the FedLoan system do it in the most beneficial way already? Could be super naive with that supposition lol.

Thanks a lot for your time reading this!",finance
btc,Stop!!! before we kill bitcoin,"I am just a holder, I do not have grudge against BU or Core. I go to r/btc and r/bitcoin.

For last couple of days, this argument over BU and Core is becoming very annoying. Most of the long term holder are calling this childish and they are cashing out. Alt shills are taking full advantage of this situation.

All I see, r/btc calling core blockstream whores trying to centralize and r/bitcoin calling BU chinese miner shills trying to centralize. Both of them are blaming each other for centralization with no intention to solve the real issue. I do not see any solution to this issue. It is only hurting bitcoin it self.

Yesterday I was in a bitcoin meet up. Most of the people in the meet up were long term holders and they were all fed up. I have never seen this before. All that drama in 2014 crash, all the hacks, goverment regulations, non of them discouraged the holders and now this argument is discouraging lots of believers.

It is important to have scaling and it has to be done. It can be done with out name calling and fighting. Fighting will only hurt ego and the other ones will fight back, regardless of who is right and who is wrong. This can be done in a mature way with out becoming agresive towards each other.

personalfinance,Income tax payment vs IRA investment,"Didn't get much love the first time. Trying a second time see if I have better luck. 

Longtime lurker first time poster. I have to say a lot of these posts are great read. Anyway, i have a situation and was hoping to get your input. As the title says, should I pay my taxes or invest that money in an IRA. Sounds crazy, right? Hear me out. 
Last year I was self employed for the entire year. I calculated my estimated taxes but due to unforeseen circumstances I only made 2 of the 4 quarterly payments. Both of those payments amount to a little bit under $3,400.  I managed to save $2,500 anticipating this would be the remaining amount I would owe. Perhaps a couple hundred over or under. Now, my traditional IRA is in dire condition to say the least. A little over $6,500 to be exact. So my question to you is, should I take the $2,500 and invest it in my IRA and thus lowering my gross income by $2,500 and therefore end up being taxed on a lower amount or should I just have that money to pay the amount I will end up owing on my federal taxes and start investing smaller amounts in my IRA? Of course if i invested the money I would start saving again as much as I could from now until April 15 in order to pay for my taxes. I'm married, the wife is a homemaker and last year I made around 54K. I may be totally off about reducing my gross income and being taxed less and if I am please let me know. Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Am I going in the right direction towards getting out of debt?,"I've read through this sub for a while and decided it was time to post. Four years ago, I purchased a car. I was young and had my eye on this car for a while. I wanted it by any means necessary. My credit wasn't great so I had to drop a $2,000 down payment on it. End up with a interest rate in the mid twenties. I'm almost halfway out of the loan but I'm upside down on the car. It's too old to refinance. I have no choice but to pay it off now. I currently owe a little over $9,000 and I'm paying $1,000 a month on the principle. I just need to get the car paid off, it's falling apart. 
I also have a credit card from a failed business I ran that has ¢3,200 left to pay off. I'm making the minimum payments on that since the interest rate is only 1.5%. I read that Dave Ramsey recommends the snowball effect but given the current state of decay on my car, I don't think that's possible. Should I continue what I'm doing or go about it another way? 
Also, the car I got a loan on is not what it said it was. The previous owner put the car through he'll. Title says it's a 2007 but most of the lights outside the car state its an 05 and the engine is also an 05 model. The carfax was clean.. It is covered in hail damage from a tornado which they failed to claim on insurance so it makes me skeptical of what else may have happened to the car.

personalfinance,"After 4.5 years, my net worth is finally net positive!","[Chart of data](http://i.imgur.com/RB2YWtG.png)

This data was extracted from Personal Capital and is a plot of my net worth. There is data from before October 2013, but at that time I hadn't linked most of my accounts, in particular my loans. Today was a significant day for me because I had finally reached the point where my net worth is positive.

My story is, I finished with about $150000 or so of debt out of graduate school in 2012 and finally started making an income and living on my own. Previously, my only previous job was a low-paying job during college, and this was during the 2007-2008 period. At that time I had no knowledge of what a 401k or a Roth IRA was, no clue about a stock or a mutual fund. The financial meltdown didn't register with me. Even in 2012 after starting my job I was still unaware of anything related to investing.

Some time during my first year of working I stumbled upon the The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing book. It was useful knowledge, but I didn't have the determination nor confidence to initiate the plans laid out in that book. It was only a year later, after reading it once more again, did I finally open my Roth IRA with Vanguard. I played it safe with just VTSMX.

With regards to my student loans, I was on the IBR plan. I had no clue the amount of loans I would be taking out back then and no idea of the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized. In retrospect, I was never explained any of this when I accepted the financial aid package. Maybe they briefly did but if they did, I never thought about the future. I'm sure they would have explained if I had asked, but they did not volunteer this information (say what you will, but without a good mentor, without knowing what to ask, without knowing where it's headed, you are young and you don't necessarily have the foresight to see this). In addition I didn't realize paying this IBR amount would make a negligible dent to the loan principal. I feel most students and graduates end up in this situation.

It's unfortunate I can't explain what happened between 2013 and the end of 2015. My loan about was about $160000 at that point and stayed constant from 2013 until July 2015. I probably hoarded cash during that time (ie sitting in checking account making the bank money; I also did not have the concept of an emergency fund in my mind at this time) and spent it on stuff. I did maintain my yearly maximum Roth IRA contributions, however. It must have been around this time that I realized, gee, I'm accumulating over $10000 per year interest; any payment less than about $850 means all I'm paying is for interest (and my payments were a pitiful $500 a month). [Here's a plot of my student loan payments over time](http://i.imgur.com/W0YiI0z.png).

I started paying extra each month when I had the extra money. The increase in net worth over the first half of 2016 cannot be explained purely in terms of paying off student loans, which I won't get into, but let's just say I made some atypical investments that in retrospect I would not have with my current knowledge. In short, stick to the Bogleheads philosophy to investing. If you see charts and numbers claiming high returns and they compare these directly to the SP500, assume they are manipulated (not fabricated, but selected for certain timeframes to make them look favorable). You won't regret ignoring these; just play it safe, slow, and steady. Keeps life simple, keeps the tax returns simple.

Continuing on, in mid 2016, my new job started. This one gave me access to a 401k and a great 403b so I have been shoveling money into these accounts to the best of my abilities, so my net worth growth continued on the same trajectory. I also refinanced my student loans, more than halving my interest rate ($10000 to less than $5000 per year). I don't get a tax deduction on student loan interest no longer, plus my future income will be consistent, therefore I was comfortable with refinancing and losing the student loan benefits. With Personal Capital, when they were pulling data from Sallie Mae/Navient, it only looked at the principal and did not include the interest on the principal, therefore I was saddened to see that large dip once the new refinanced amount registered in Personal Capital.

Also of note, in 2016, I had been leaving money in a checking account, enjoying seeing my balance grow larger. The realization, however, that doing that just gave the bank extra money that it can use to make money for itself led to me opening a high-yield savings account and diverting my money there and leaving a minimum in the checking account. 1% is not much, but a dollar is still a dollar.

With loans refinanced, I paid a steady amount per month. The interest rate is low enough that I feel comfortable diverting money towards investments/savings instead of paying off the loans faster. Every two weeks the remaining extra money bumps up my investment accounts and my net worth number inches towards $0 and it finally broke the $0 barrier this week. I still have a long way to go, but that is another story.

It's a long post; thank you for taking the time to read all the way here. If you're early on in your life, mid-life, or even later in life, I hope you picked up a few useful tips and mistakes not to make from my story. Currently I am reading The Millionaire Next Door. I have read quite a few blogs on investing, retiring early, etc, so have a decent amount of knowledge regarding investing safely and reasonably. Even if you feel the same, I felt reading The Millionaire Next Door affirms that living frugally and prioritizing saving is the right path, and the anecdotes in the book about the mistakes people make help me avoid the same ones in the future.",finance

With that said I would like to pay back the loan with as little as possible going toward interest. The terms state that I can pay early each billing cycle and I'll have less interest for that month, however when I make my payment the following month I won't really have saved anything since it accrues daily based on days since last payment. Does this mean if I say paid weekly instead of monthly I could limit what goes toward interest? Also, could I for example take my loan installment divide by 30 and make daily payments to avoid accruing daily interest at all, since it would have only been one day since last payment? Any advice would greatly help, first time dealing with a loan with a simple interest.",finance
personalfinance,Taxman: taxed in two different years for same income? Any way I could have (could still) avoid this?,"Hi - this seems illogical to me:

I just received my tax figures from my CPA, and there's a line that indicates what my prior year's tax refund was, and this is counted as income, and therefore subject to being taxed.

Rough details: I'm paying net 25% tax, so my $1k-ish return from last year is costing me $250-ish.

Isn't this simply two bites of the same apple, as this is actually refunded income from 2015 - overpaid taxes - not income from 2016?

Is there something I could have done differently/or can do now to avoid this?

Thanks for your insights!

clarification: this isn't my total due this year, but just the part that seems off to me. I certainly don't want to throw any money away that I don't have to

Edit: confused why people are specifically responding with ""state"" details; perhaps the principle is transferable, but this is about a federal return.

Also - could you explain to me how I wasn't taxed enough in 2015, then? The government stated I met my tax burden for _2015_ and gave me some of my _2015_ income back. I didn't earn this money in 2016; quite the contrary.

To use an absurd example: If I earned an insane amount of money in year X and paid an insane amount of tax throughout year X for year X, and the government implicitly states: ""You've met your tax burden, good citizen, as a matter of fact, you've paid more than you have to! Here's $100,000 back that you overpaid from year X's income!""

If I earn nothing the next year (keeping all other things constant), the government can count income I earned in year X as income in year Y and require me to pay (at $100K tax rate of 25%) $25,000.

Does this clear up my ... errr ... confusion a bit?

The last couple years have yielded very low inflation, so that's good, but inflation expectations are up and so it's more urgent for me to do something if the house won't work out right now. I know that normally it's a bad idea to time the market, but I think the domestic markets are currently inflated. Currently, domestic markets are set to require several years of good returns to justify their value; maybe that'll happen, but it seems like an unusually risky time to buy. 

Meanwhile bonds will take a hit when interest rates go up, which they will, unless stocks (and the general economy) take an abrupt hit and soon--and I don't want to bet on that either, so while I will hold my old bonds, I don't want new ones unless they are short term (read: lower than inflation).

science,Science AMA Series: We are a team of ESF scientists who developed a way to make American chestnut trees resistant to the blight that virtually wiped out the species 100 years ago. We’ll talk about how we can help restore this iconic tree to our forests. AUA!,"Hi Reddit! We are a team of scientists at the College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, New York, and we’ve been working for 27 years to create an American chestnut tree suitable for restoration of our forests. Billions of these trees were killed by an invasive blight fungus that was first identified at the Bronx Zoo early in the 20th century. There are references to American chestnuts throughout our culture, with chestnuts roasting over open fires in the winter and Chestnut Streets running through towns across the country. Furniture made from American chestnut is long-lasting, as are barns that dot the countryside, because the wood is durable and rot-resistant. If the wood were available now, we might be building our backyard decks with it. Perhaps most significantly, the species’ abundant nuts were once a dietary staple for wildlife.

Our research team found a way to add one gene from wheat to the American chestnut’s 38,000 genes, to make it capable of withstanding what was once a fatal blight. It works by detoxifying oxalate, the major weapon the fungus uses to attack the tree. We use tissue culture to grow the trees initially, but we have now established seed orchards for future production. We continue testing to ensure these transgenic trees are safe for humans and the environment. The next steps are to establish a restoration forest for demonstration and research, and to obtain federal approval to distribute the trees to the public and introduce the trees into the wild.

Here’s an introduction to the people you’ll be speaking to today. We all represent ESF’s American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project.

Edit: Because so many people asked about when the trees will come available, I will try to answer here.  First, our trees have to go through a rigorous review by three federal regulatory agencies, EPA, USDA, and FDA. We have been communicating with them for the past two years to learn what data they need and and the process to submit.  We believe we will be able to submit sometime this year (2017). From what we learned, we estimate the process will take between 2 to 4 years.  While we go through the process, we are setting up nut production orchards as part of the 10,000 chestnut challenge so that we should have seedlings available as soon as we receive registration from the EPA, non-regulated status from the USDA, and an OK from the FDA.

personalfinance,A few questions about student loans (mainly about PSLF),"First off, thanks to everyone here who helped me in prior questions! You guys have really helped me focus on priorities instead of wasting my $ on relatively frivolous things.

Anyways, a little background first...

Where I live, the job market is pretty slim. I've been looking and applying to local jobs that would expand my horizons, especially in my field of study, but nothing yet. I'm optimistic, though :)

The good thing about my area is the super cheap cost of living, especially in my particular case (rent is $275/month, and it'll drop to $100/month starting August 2017). So my 2 jobs that add up to ~$30k/year can easily manage 80k in student debt. Here's what my loan situation looks like:

$30k consolidated (due to my income, I couldn't consolidate all of my private loans. I did it to release my cosigner from a portion of the debt and to get a lower rate) at 4.8% Apr. Monthly payment: $315

$12k at 6.5% Apr. Monthly payment: $115

$8k at 8.5% Apr. Monthly payment: $100

$30k in federal student loans, set at an income-based repayment. Monthly payment: $125

I'm focusing on the ones that didn't get consolidated that have ludicrous rates. Plus my cosigner isn't too fond of the impact I'm having on his credit, so they're a priority. Before you ask, no, he won't help me consolidate the final 20k in private loans. It's just his belief that it's my responsibility to pay it off by myself at this point. Fair enough. I guess. In any case, I can apply around December 2017 to release his name from the remaining private loans.

My question is about the federal loans. I've tried educating myself on what the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program can to for me. You can check it out [here](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) if you want. 

Right now I'm working a local gov't job and a non-profit in tandem, that adds up to a full-time job, as per the requirements of the PSLF. From what I've read, Income-based repayment is a valid form of qualifying payments. So I'm on the right track to getting loan forgiveness in less than 10 years, right around when my other loans are going to be finishing up as well, at my current rate of payment.

My question is this. For those who may know, would adding a third job in the private sector disqualify me from receiving the loan forgiveness? My particular jobs are heavily dependent on the nearby colleges, so summer can be difficult to find more than 30 hours/week. I make up for it now by working 45-50 hours during the school year. While an average of 30 hours/week qualifies as full time for PSLF, it's not really stable or sustainable for my liking. I wanted to add a third job, but the easiest route would be going private. Uber is looking rather good as chump change to offset the few hours I'm going to get over Summer Break. Do you think it would disqualify me from receiving the PSLF?

Also, I found this little gem while reading:

""Note that loan amounts forgiven under the PSLF Program are not considered income by the Internal Revenue Service. Therefore, you will not have to pay federal income tax on the amount of your Direct Loans that is forgiven after you have made the 120 qualifying payments.""

Does this mean that the amount forgiven won't affect my taxes whatsoever? Like, will it have no bearing ony returns?

Side note, my cosigner is not too enthused about me being able to utilize this program, touting it as a ""Liberal way of thinking"", like I'm stealing money from the taxpayers by doing this. It's funny because he's the one who mentioned the normal 25-year loan forgiveness program. I can understand where he's coming from, especially how he managed his loans growing up and where he is today. But I mean, the way I see it, I'm taking a pay cut to work for the gov't or provide a service to the public for 10 years (I'm assuming similar jobs would pay more in a private setting. Am I wrong?), and for that service I get a thanks from the Federal gov't to the tune of ~$15-20k in savings. So far he's the only one who has reacted negatively to this program that I have told. What do you all think? Is this program cool or not so cool?

Also, with the volatility of the current Federal govt's budget plans, do you think this program could be in danger of getting cut? I'm not too afraid, since the gears of the Federal gov't grind slowly, but they may be grinding a bit faster than 10 years. What do you think?

Again, thanks for everything you all do. It really helps to have a frugal conscience telling me that new console isn't really a good investment, or a car isn't my top priority right now. Any help on this particular topic would be really helpful. Cheers!",finance
personalfinance,Question on opening a HELOC,"Disclaimer *This is not something i'm going to do I'm just curious about a thought I had*

So I was at my bank replacing my debit card, and noticed the person replacing it was a loan officer. As we were talking she mentioned that they have a promotion going on right now for HELOCs. They cover 100% of the closing costs and have a rate of 2.99% for three years, then it converts to the prime interest rate (~3.5%).

The monthly payments I would owe would be only on the interest. 

Got me thinking. I have about 100k of equity in my house. Why shouldn't I take $80k out as a HELOC and invest it for the next 10 years. I should beat that interest rate easily right?

Is it just a risk tolerance thing if the market bottoms out I lose the house? Or are there other reasons for not doing this that i'm not thinking of.

personalfinance,Got screwed into a credit card,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this. 

I only have 2 credit cards now. They are both from Bank of America. The first one is my go-to. However, i just started another degree and in December I needed $600 I didn't have for the first tuition payment. I went to my bank and they suggested a card with a $1000 balance and no interest rate for the 18 months (which is kinda usual). I told the person at the bank why I needed the card and what I wanted to use it for. 

However, I've been receiving interest charges rates the last 2 months because the 0 interest rate only applied if I transferred my other card balance to the account which was never mentioned, and when I skimmed the paperwork nothing like this came up. I only learned today after calling about this balance transfer that activates the 0 interest.

 I'm fucking pissed and need a little guidance because having 2 cards with interest is killing me. They never even explained the balance transfer process either. I wish I could close my account but I don't have enough money to do so. Also, sorry but I don't know how to put a flair on the thread title.

personalfinance,(US) Wanting feedback on a large home sale and paying other debts down.,"Howdy everyone,


I'll just jump right into it. So, about 4.5 years ago my wife and I started house hunting. We picked the optimal area to buy the house in, as far as market value, and dug in to get one house in particular. We got that home at just about the lowest it has ever been due to the market crash. We paid $143k to get this home in a coveted subdivision and now the value is up around $280k (we've not yet had a formal appraisal). 

I bring in ~30k working for the state as a database guy and my wife brings in ~35k as a high school teacher. Salaries are low, granted, but so is overall cost of living. 

Additionally, we have debts totaling about 55K. 

These are:

* my student loans totaling 24k @ 6.25%

* Mitsubishi car loan totaling 8k @ 6.0%

* Hyundai car loan totaling 17k @ 6.0%

* AMEX credit card totaling 5k @ 0% (introductory period)

* And obviously, our mortgage totaling 134k @ 3.25%

The plan here is roughly this: we want to get into what my wife calls her ""forever home"" (which will run around 300k) and I want to pay down debts and start actually saving money, rather than throwing everything at high interest loans. The timeline and money shakeout would work as follows: 

1) we sell our home for top dollar in our area, 280k, 10% of which I've gathered is eaten up in closing costs and realtors and so on (also, from what I've read since we've lived in the home for more than two of the last fives years, we are not subject to capital gains tax. Please please correct me if I'm wrong) . We now have 252k at our disposal.
 
2) 134k pays off our home now. 118k at our disposal.

3) We make a deposit of 60k (or whatever 20% is) on the new home, leaving us with 58k.

4) Nuke the consumer debt of ~30k (two car loans and AMEX). Now at 28k.

5) Put 1k in both of my daughter's 529 plans for school. Now at 26k.

6) Put 4k for my wife and I in a 401k so we can maybe have a decent retirement. 18k.

7) put the remainder is savings as an emergency fund so we never have to scrounge again (hopefully).

Now, you're probably wondering why I didn't mention my student loans, since they're pretty hefty. I work for the state, which I believe qualifies me for public servant debt forgiveness after 10 years of service. I have worked for the state just about 2.5 years now, and the pay is pretty abysmal (net is @30k right now), however we paid about $300 out of pocket for the birth of our second daughter, so the benefits are amazing. Additionally, they have an employee pension plan that would be amazing to supplement other retirement savings. That being said, am I better off working for the state and paying minimum on my student loans so they can be forgiven in 7.5 years, or is it better to strike out on my own and get about 2x (around 60k) what I'm getting now, but with no debt forgiveness and no stability (the only way I lose my job is if my state ceases to exist). I'm one of the database reporting guys, if that helps. 

Also, we will not see 3.25% again, but we've tentatively spoken with a lender who said we would get 4.25% easily. So interest rate on the new home would be no more than 4.25% @ ~310k. To wrap all of this mess up, I'm really just trying to get the opinions of people who have done something similar and could help me out on my logic. Usually I'm pretty impartial, but the thought of paying off both cars and having money in the bank makes me a little illogical. 

If I missed some details please let me know,

Thanks everyone.",finance

personalfinance,Credit Card Recommendation,"I am 24 and looking into getting my first ""real"" credit card soon. 

Some credit history background: I have had a $500 limit secured card for ~8months with around 20% utilization (only used for gas for me and my wife). I have not had any loans or debts, so that card is probably the only thing in my credit history. My credit karma scores are 715 for transunion and 700 for equifax, with 1 hard pull recently because I moved and switched internet providers. 

My monthly spending is around:
$400 groceries
$300 eating out
$200 fun
$100 gas
$1,700 bills (rent + utilities)
$650 daycare
$400 other items
=$3,750 total

My salary is around $5,000 monthly take-home (wife is a student and works part time, but we put almost all her income directly into savings, so I won't consider it here as useable income).

First, some overarching questions about credit cards and cash back programs in general:
1) most say the cash back is on ""eligible"" purchases, but I can not find their definition of ""eligible"". Can I get cash back on stuff like utilities and daycare online payments? Or is it only through purchases at stores? What about online Amazon purchases?
2) if I am considering multiple card options, should I apply to all at once and then determine which one to accept after seeing their offers? Or should I just apply for them 1 at a time start from the best option down?
3) Is submitting the application also an agreement that I will accept any limit and apr they offer me, or do I get the offer and then have to explicitly accept it?

I would prefer a cash-card over a ""points card"", just as a personal preference. I am not considering the interest rates, as I am going to pay them off in full each month, so that will not really have an effect. I have done some research and there are three main cards I have in consideration:

Amex - Blue Cash Everday Card:
 + $100 after $1000 spent signup bonus
+ 3% back in supermarkets (but I don't believe this includes stores like Walmart and target, as the terms excluded ""superstores"". Does anyone know if this is the case? Is there a list anywhere of what exactly ""supermarkets"" includes?)
+ 2% back on gas (but once again not ""superstore"" gas stations, and I usually fill up at Walmart or Sam's Club gas stations, which I think are excluded. Can anyone confirm?)
* 1% back otherwise (if a superstore is not eligible for the 3% back, does it just drop down to this 1%? Or does it just give nothing back?)
* no annual fee
- can only redeem cash back in $25 increments

Discover - Gas and Restaurant Card:
+ 2% back on gas and restaurants (not sure if gas stations like Walmart and Sam's club are included here either)
+ double cash back rewards after a year (so effectively 4% on gas and restaurants and 2% otherwise)
* 1% back otherwise
* no annual fee
* my checking account is with discover now, not sure if that makes anything easier having my credit card with the same company
- I have head that discover cards are not as widely accepted as other credit card companies, not sure how true that is though

Capital One - QuicksilverOne Card:
+ flat 1.5% back on everything
- $39 fee

Looking at everything written out, I don't really see much reason to choose capital one over discover, as the double cashback bonus makes the returns higher no matter what within the first year. But the Amex is still a valid consideration. Although my credit history may limit me to only getting a lesser-valued card like the Captial One option, not sure on that.

I am actually a State of Indiana employee and am/was planning to soon file my taxes for the 2015 season.

I have received, as far as I know, nothing in the mail in regards to any immediate action regarding my accounts.

My original plan was to file for 2015, and knowing that I would receive nothing back in regards to federal or state taxes re-inquire as to what is at that point currently owed and move forward from there as surely it would have decreased.


So, I get off work yesterday and swing by the ATM to take out $10 so I could get a bite to eat at a cash only food truck. ATM declined my transaction. Weird, I thought I had a couple hundred in the account still.

I get home to find my balance to be negative $2,500~

It's after banking hours so I am unable to talk to a human about this, so I took a personal day from work today so I could call and get this sorted out. I thought perhaps my card had been skimmed from paying at a pump or something. I get put on hold for about five minutes and when the person returns they tell me that I received a levy from Premiere Credit and was given a number to call. Apparently Premiere Credit is closed today as well. Googling them I see they collect for the Indiana Department of Revenue so I can only assume they've levied my account on behalf of the state.


What are my options here? My paychecks are deposited directly into my account and I was told that the one I am receiving next week will be levied too.

I am now fearful that I could lose my state job, which I love, over this. The tax issues occurred as in independent contractor and not as an employee of the state.

Has anyone here dealt with this? How easy is it to get on a payment plan? I was hoping I'd have more time to resolve this, I wanted to file my taxes for 2015 and re-evaluate what is owed after that was completed. I feel like the timing for this couldn't be any worse.

personalfinance,"Defaulted on a federal student loan. Should I pay in full right now, or ""rehabilitate"" it?","(reposting this under a throwaway - whoops)

Hi /r/pf. In trying to get my credit info together in order to refinance my remaining private student loans (~$75k), I have discovered that I have *apparently* defaulted on two federal student loans that I was completely unaware of, totaling a little less than $1,600. I found out about the debts via my Experian credit report and subsequently found myeddebt.ed.gov, which I had no idea existed until now and through which I confirmed the debts. I was never sent any correspondence, or attempted to be contacted by phone; I know I should have been on top of things and I am definitely not without fault, but I'm still pretty annoyed at this... BUT that's not why I'm posting - I'm posting to get some opinions on what the best course of action is for me to make this debt disappear, with regard to my credit.

I called the servicer yesterday immediately upon discovering these outstanding loans, and was told that the current payoff amount for both of them is just under $2,000 (principal+interest, plus collection fees). From what I understand, I have three options:

1. Pay a ""settlement"" amount, which is basically the amount of the outstanding principal+interest. Not really interested in this, since my understanding is that ""settled for less than amount owed"" will count as a derogatory mark on my credit report. The default itself is *already* derogatory, so I don't really want anything else on top of that.

2. Go through a rehabilitation program. After (I believe) 9 or 10 months of on-time payments, the account will change from ""in default"" to ""in good standing."" After I've made the 9 or 10 consecutive payments, it will take another ~2-3 months for the account to be reported as ""in good standing"" on my credit report, so this would push our refi timeframe out basically an entire year.

3. Pay it in full immediately. I am in a financial position to do this today. However, I worry that without rehabilitating the loan, it will still not be considered ""in good standing"" even though I will have paid it in full, and even so it will still take 2-3 months to be reported as ""paid"" anyway.

I've asked the organization that I am considering refinancing with which is the best option for *their* purposes, and they told me that it really doesn't matter for *them,* as long as it shows ""paid""/""in good standing"" on my credit report. I am leaning toward paying it in full immediately, simply because I want to get this refinance done and out of the way so I can begin more aggressively paying it off, but I'm not sure how it will be reported; on the other hand, I *know* that the account will be reported as ""in good standing"" if I go through the rehab program, but it will push out my timeframe by a year. 

Other possibly pertinent information: I can afford the refinance, my husband will be cosigning and he has excellent credit, and the new interest rate will be several points lower than any of my private loans currently are. We've got a well-funded e-fund and our monthly expenses are very stable. Once we refinance my minimum monthly payments will go from $965.37 to (approximately) $612.41, and barring anything catastrophic I plan on paying $1200/mo (more if I can), which will have this nonsense gone for good by July 2023 and save me *literally thousands* in interest.

I calculated mu withholding to put me at zero but didn't account for the overtime and extra ""income"" and non refundable tax. Enough with the turkey, table below is the gravy.

We have one car and relay the vehicle between night and day work. Basically switching who works and who stays home with the kids. Oldest will be preschool, age soon and we planned on a second car for the schooling transportation. Our savings was just depleted with medical bills, and our tax situation makes this look difficult. 

**Legal? Solution**
So here is the greasy sleazy part. In the above table, case 2 provides the most cash refund as well as the lowest overall owed. Since I have the income I would need to apply for a (second) auto loan because we are not married. Unfortunately, due to missed deferment dates on my federal student loans I have 13 negative accounts that claim I was late 90+ days. Poor ownership on my part, its been remedied since but now with that and high student loans, high credit card debt and a credit score barely over 500 the owed taxes with the refunds are almost like a low interest 3 year loan. In case 2 from the table, the parents would receive 6k in total refunds and then owe 8k. 

**The Now**
I have completed my taxes but waiting to file. Will the IRS eat me alive for this? This is all in good faith and reasoning. Im not buying a darn fun money Tesla but a cheap used Mom-mobile for school.

So, he re-enrolled to pursue another BS in Computer Science because the jobs in the CS field are exponentially more abundant than Psychology. He is doing so well, maintaining a high GPA, hasn't missed a single class, and pours over his material vigorously. However, this past semester, he was informed that he has reached his Federal Financial Aid Limit, and he doesn't believe he will be able to finish his Computer Science degree.

I am a student as well and work part-time in a cosmetics retail setting. He is not currently employed because his class load has proven to take up most of his waking life as of late, so I have been supporting us financially.

personalfinance,Worth learning a second position for a small raise?,"In October 2015, I was hired on as a medical eligibility worker at a Seattle-based non-profit community health clinic. My position was a sub-division of patient service representative that primarily focuses on new patient registration, medical insurance, sliding fee discounts, applying for government assistance programs, etc. The other sub-groups are reception, medical records, and referrals. My starting wage was the lowest allowed for the PSR position at $14.71/hr. At the start of the 2016 year I was bumped up to $15/hr when that became the new minimum standard for my position.

I worked my butt off in 2016 and distinguished myself, earning excellent reviews from the patients I helped and respect from my coworkers. I took initiative with taking on projects and troubleshooting issues that were outside my actual duties. I aced my annual review but was told by my supervisor everyone would get a flat 2% raise for 2017 regardless of our performance due to non-profits not having the extra budget. This brought me up to a modest $15.30/hr.

A coworker who was leaving for an Amazon job confessed to me that she had been earning $16.50/hr. This shocked me because she was only hired two weeks before me with no prior work experience, same age, with a degree in fine arts un-related to the healthcare industry. I was a pre-med student with a double degree in biochemistry and geology, had volunteer experience at the UW Medical Center, worked as a state-certified caregiver, and spoke two languages fluently. Every time I helped a patient in my second language not only was I saving my organization money from using the interpretation services, I was actually securing more funding since interpretation services provided by employees can be claimed for federal compensation. Besides these facts, my coworker worked referrals which have a lesser workload compared to eligibility and she constantly had bad working relationships with our supervisor and coworkers. 

I had a meeting with my supervisor and put in an official request for wage negotiation. I requested an 11% raise from $15.30 to $17/hr, which would be little bit more than what my former coworker would have been paid if she had stayed to receive her 2% raise. My supervisor talked with HR and they stated that they would only grant a 3% increase to $15.76/hr, with an additional 3% increase to $16.22/hr IF I train for a new position (referrals) to fill the void left by another departing coworker. The issue is that I know that I’m already being underpaid NOW and they want me to learn a second new job to be paid less than what my previous coworker earned. They are dangling a carrot in front of me and saying they envision creating another lead position and that if I take the referral job to help them with the coverage shortage it would be a stepping stone to the lead position starting at $17.50/hr.

Should I take this opportunity? I feel like I can’t trust a single word that’s said. First they tell me they have no money to offer more when they clearly paid someone else coming in at the same time with fewer qualifications more than me. I’d have to increase my skillset and learn a second position to be paid LESS than what my coworker earned. They want me to learn a second job so they can shift me whenever there is a need, and I don’t know whether the lead position they talked about will ever actually materialize and I can’t know if they are genuine in wanting me to fill that position or stringing me along.

I apologize for the wall of text. My supervisor gave me a deadline of Wednesday 03/22 to make my decision and since my emotions are running high right now, I really wanted to run this by you all for your feedback and draw from your experience. I am tempted to just stay where I am and taking that 3% increase rather than take on a second position for only 3% more with only the PROMISE of a future lead role. I know a second skill set and having a lead position on my resume will be helpful, but I can't shake the feeling of being manipulated and used.",finance

personalfinance,Going from working 20 hours a week hourly to full time position at new job. How do I fill out my w4 (or help me understand the IRS W4 Calculator)?,"Hi

I'm going from a job getting paid hourly and working about 20-30 hours a week to a full time job and need to fill out my new W4. 

Last year I made about $36,000 and got back 1,600 federal and another 400 state on my tax return claiming 1 allowance on my W4 for that job. By April 1, when I start my new position, I'll have made about 9,000 from my current job already this year.

At my next job I'll make $74,000 annual salary with an expected bonus of 6,000. I'd like to adjust my W4 allowances so that I'm as close to receiving no refund next year, but I'd rather receive a small refund than end up owing taxes when I file.

I checked out the IRS W4 calculator but I'm a little confused about the page where I'm supposed to enter the actual salary information. On page 2, I think I'm supposed to select [1] job where I am or will be employed, for my new job. Then I think I'm supposed to ""Check box if you held a job this year but are no longer employed in that job."", representing the job that I'll be leaving at the beginning of April. Am I right so far?

Then, on page 3 I'm confused on what I'm supposed to enter in the first section. It says ""For the job you now hold"" over the first 7 fields, then ""For the job(s) you had earlier this year but no longer hold"" over the last two. I figure the former section is talking about my new job and the latter is talking about my current job. 

If I'm supposed to fill out the top section for my new job, I'm not sure if I should enter zero for the federal tax witheld so far and federal tax withheld on my last paycheck (since I haven't received a paycheck there yet) or if I'm supposed to estimate the tax withheld per paycheck.

It's sort of making my head spin, but maybe I'm completely misreading the form. A little clarification on how to fill out the calculator, or how to figure out the best number of allowances to take on my W4, would be awesome. Maybe I should just keep it at 1 and adjust if I don't like how it turns out next tax season? =P",finance
personalfinance,I got a great annual bonus and want to use a portion to finish off one of my student loans.,"Hi everyone, first time poster!

I'm extremely happy with my annual bonus and I can use a portion of it to finish off two of my student loans that are within striking distance (a few years left). The interest rate on one is 6.55% and the other is 5.8%.

Are there any downsides to this? There is certainly enough left over to invest back into myself (I have a small business on the side), so otherwise it would just be savings.

It's money I didn't have before, and making one big final payment puts a little bit of money back into my pocket every month for a few years into the future.

Would love to know your thoughts. Generally speaking, the less debt you have, the better. I've paid enough of these to have build credit, and I still have other loans payments. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Should I file for bankruptcy? (US),"Well, here goes. I was a dumbass in college. There is no other way to explain the situation I find myself currently in. I'll explain this as best as I can. 

When I was a freshman, I was living off of financial aid. I didn't have any credit, so one day while at a clothing chain with my mom, she suggested I apply for a credit card there to build some credit. Unthinkingly, I signed up for one (not know that there was an outrageous interest rate). I quickly found myself maxed out. 

When I was a Junior, I was living in my college town off campus during the summer, working at my part time job. One day, I couldn't afford groceries so I called my mom. She is definitely not wealthy, and couldn't really offer much advice except to apply for a credit card to help me until my financial aid kicked in in the fall. So I did. And, lo and behold, after a study abroad session the next summer, in which I had very little cash (financial aid was able to pay the tuition but the rest was on me) I found myself wracking up a massive amount of debt on that card as well. 

Then, when I graduated from college, I found myself extremely stressed out. I couldn't find work anywhere and my bills were getting to be too much. So I took out a loan to consolidate all of my credit cards to buy me an extra month. A few weeks later, I got a temp job in my college town and subletted a place from a friend to live. The rent was $500/mo for the summer. Well, naturally, I got fired from that job and still had a lease to pay for. Annnnd where do you think I got the money to do that? You guessed it! My credit card. 

I do have a job now in the same town, but I am really struggling because of my debt. I take home about 1800$ a month, give or take depending on overtime and costs of health insurance. 

So, I am now in a bit of a pickle. I'll lay it out for you. (I am currently paying the minimum on all of these.)

* $2149 on one credit card (with the ridiculous interest rate) - maxed out
* $3000 on another credit card - maxed out
* $5031 on my consolidation loan 
* $2500 on a student loan

One time expenses that I NEED to pay right now:

* $250 for overdue parking tickets
* $115 for overdue car registration
* $250 in overdue copays

(My car was given to me from a family member for free.) 

My monthly bills look like this:

* $525 for rent
* $215 for consolidation loan
* 100 for regular credit card
* 100 for other credit card
* $90 for car insurance
* $25 for utilities (I split a much higher cost with my roommates)
* $250 in copays for medical treatment
* $100 for gas (travel to work and to medical appointments) 
* $40 for student loan
* $60 for parking
*$40 for medication

Keep in mind that I am consistently late on these so the costs go up. 

Also, there is a nail in my tire, which cannot be patched according to the three tire shops I went to. They all quoted me at around $500. I need my car to get to my appointments and work. For now, I am just constantly refilling it. 

So, as of right now, I am looking at just over $13000 in debt. My monthly expenses are $1545 not including food or personal items like tampons and grabbing lunch at work when I forget mine. 

Quite frankly, I am drowning over here. I meet with a financial adviser from my bank tomorrow, who will hopefully be able to shed some light on my situation too. I am constantly late on my payments and have about $200 to my name. I have no liquid assets, no savings, no retirement, nothing. I don't receive financial help from family, nor would they ever be able to help me. 

I am running out of ideas and need some input here, guys. I am currently seeing a therapist and doing DBT which is extremely helpful for my spending habits, but of course, it costs money. 

Thanks!

Edit: 

Hi again, guys! Thank you for all of your advice. I spoke with my financial counselor today and she legitimately set me straight. Homegirl gave me the hook up. We are consolidating my credit cards, which will drop one from a 27% interest rate to like 8%. I am cutting up my credit cards and closing one. We set up some extra savings accounts and went through a budgeting plan. I think I am going to be okay! Imagine that.",finance
financialindependence,German here - joined the 7 digit club lately,"Hi all,
I joined the 7 digit club sometime last year and I cannot talk about this with anyone except my wife. So I will write about this here.
I am 44 years old, married (since 16 years) without children (we tried but did not succeed. Even had four tries with IVF) and living in Germany. I work as a self employed software developer all my life since university (so I never paid into the normal government retirement system). I had the pülan to retire early when I was in my early thirties but I did not make a real excel plan until 2006. At this time it really started. As I made a lot of money with my job we did not have to live frugal and could still save a lot. I already had some life insurances which made 3,5% since 1999 and 2000. Currently I pay in €780/month (it went up 5% per year in the past). Additionally I saved in stocks (around €2000/month). But the real kicker where the appartments I bought. Luckily my wife insited on this. We bought the first in 2009 €118,000 for a small two bedroom appartment in the outskirts of Munich. Made a 20% down payment and it will be paid back in 15 years. Interest rate is 3,8% on this one. Then a one room appartment for €75,000 in 2011 (10% down, 3,1% interes rate, paid back within 14 years) and another two bedromm one for €140,000 (20% down, 2,3% interest rate, paid back within 14 years). In the last few years the prices went up insanely. When I compare my appartments with what is sold right now I would estimate that they are worth €660,000. At the end of the year we should have €220,000 left to pay so net value for the appartments is €440,000. Of course I cannot access this money right now because in Germany you have to pay tax on the money you make from selling your house/appartment (if you donÄt live in it by yourself). 
Next we bought our house end of 2014. Price was €540,000 but as prices went up so crzay I would estimate it at €750,000. €430,000 left to pay at an avergare interest rate of 1,1%. Have to refinance it after 5 years (end of 2019) so I hope the interest rate stays so low. Altogether net value of the house is €320,000
Then we have our life insurances. If we would sell them today I woulg get back €160,000.  
And the last big block is our stock account. Right now it is at €176,000

So altogether our net worth is currently nearly 1.1 million Euro.
In my first plan 1 million was the goal. But then we get used to more luxury and I don't want to reitre and live frugal. 
So now our goal is 2023. By then I am still 50 and my wife 47. The apartments will be paid back (and the last one sold). The house will be paid back completely using the life insurances and our stock account should be at around €600,000. The other two appartmens should give us €1,100/month. And as we don't have children we can theoretically use up our money. 
We want ot buy a house in Thailand around this time (maybe work for another year just to get a more luxury house there). And retire completely to Thailand when I am 65 and sell the house in Germany. And use up this money during the next 20 years. And then in case I still have the two appartments and I will inherit the house from my parents together with my two siblings.

So this is the plan. Hopefully we will stay on track.

Thanks for listeing - I just had to explain it to someone.",finance

ethereum,Bitcoin fork and what it means for Ethereum?,"Up till now the battle between Bitcoin and Ethereum for the advanced blockchain use case has clearly been in Ethereum's favour.

With the upcoming Bitcoin hard fork, Bitcoin Core will have full support over their chain and quickly move forward with segwit which I believe will further enable side chains, LN and rootstock.

What's peoples opinions on this? I still think that Ethereum has the edge as its core is being designed to be massively scalable with advanced functionality.

In addition I believe that applications on top of Etheruem will be more secure as they are using Ethereums core functionality to run, whereas sidechains on Bitcoin will always need to be federated or risk 51% attacks where all coins can be stolen.

personalfinance,Assumptions in Valuing a Defined Benefit Pension (What interest rate to use?),"I'm trying to calculate a present value of a defined benefit pension and looking for feedback on the assumptions.  The purpose is to decide if, upon leaving the employer providing this pension, whether or not to withdraw from the pension plan and take my contributions. That is, is the present value of the future annuity greater than the present value of accumulated contributions.

To use some simplified numbers, say the benefit starting 30 years from today is $10k annually. The annuity has a COLA of 1% per year, starting only after the annuity payments begin. Assume payments for 25 years after the payments begin.   Assume annual compounding for ease of calculation.

Because payments don't start for 30 years, the selection of interest rate dramatically changes the calculated present value of the benefit. Here are my calculated present value of the annuity for this benefit using different discount rates:
4%, $50.8k  
5%, $33.3k  
6%, $21.9k  
7%, $14.4k  

So, what discount rate would you choose for valuing a pension payment that starts in 30 years? I've heard 7% is commonly used for market return assumptions.  However, this benefit carries much less risk than the market...more risk than treasuries, but not that much more (the provider gets AAA ratings when issuing debt). So, would something like a 4% rate be a better comparison for calculating the value of this benefit?

My contributions to this plan that I could withdraw are somewhere in the middle of the above range, so I think selection of the right discount rate changes my decision of if I should withdraw from the plan after leaving this employer.  

Any thoughts on choosing a rate would be greatly appreciated, or thoughts on if you think there is anything else to this I am not considering.",finance
investing,Cruise Line Industry,"Even with the cruise line industry recently bouncing back from its low last year, there may be some room to go. Historically, the three major players: Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian have had high single-digit to low double-digit ROIC. Because of low returns on incremental capital, these companies pay out FCF in the form of dividends, with the exception of Norwegian, the smallest of the bunch with only 24 ships, which plans to expand its fleet with 8 new ponies in the works. Carnival and Royal were the fastest to spread to new markets such as China, where ROIC has fallen short. These companies have special characteristics that make them interesting: tax exempt, negative operating capital due to upfront cruise revenue, fluctuations in fuel pricing and variable interest rate loans (with rising credit rates sometime in the horizon). Royal and Caribbean are more levered with a significant portion of this debt variable interest. They have superior quality fleets, yielding more per ship and paying less for fuel. They are better positioned to fair through a financial crisis because their luxury segment's customers are more resilient.Given the dynamics of the industry, Reddit, what are your thoughts on cruise liner stocks?",finance

btc,Clearing up Some Widespread Confusions about BU,"- **BU is not a proposal.** It's merely a tool to make it a bit more convenient for the people who run Bitcoin software to coordinate on blocksize policy *without* having to switch dev teams every time they as a community decide to go with a different policy.

- **Miners are not ""switching to BU.""** They are switching to getting ready for [Haipo Yang's blocksize increase plan](https://medium.com/@ViaBTC/miner-guide-how-to-safely-hard-fork-to-bitcoin-unlimited-8ac1570dc1a8#.9ojto75i6). They just happen to be using BU to do it, merely because Core doesn't allow any plan other than 1MB and Segwit. **Core deliberately provides software with a blocksize policy pre-baked in.** The ONLY thing BU-style software changes is that baking in. It refuses to bundle controversial blocksize policy in with the rest of the code it is offering. It **unties the blocksize settings from the dev teams**, so that you don't have to shop for both as a packaged unit. The idea is that you can now have Core software security without having to submit to Core blocksize policy. Since there have been bugs in BU as it tries to do a lot of other new things (not related to blocksize settings), there is even a new project called BitcoinEC that really is just Core with adjustable blocksize, none of the extras that BU and Classic have (which have caused a few bugs). *Instead of the community being spoonfed Core consensus or coordinatedly switching to a different spoonfeeder like XT, it is coordinating on its own.* Absent Core's heavy hand on the scale, the community and market will coalesce on Haipo Yang's plan, or something else that is likely reasonable (and if it was unreasonable, how is there any way to prevent it from that anyway merely by forcing the community to get spoonfed from *some implementation* (Core, XT, etc.) rather than just not getting spoonfed?). 

- **There is no such thing as BTU coin,** because again BU is not a proposal. There is, for example, Haipo Yang's proposal that the miners are moving to. You could call it CoreCoin vs. YangCoin if you were so inclined, but to call something BTU or BUcoin is just ignorant. People have only done that because they are stuck in the  Core paradigm where all the implementations have to come with a policy stance baked in, and where you must switch dev teams if you disagree with their blocksize preferences. Consider that **BU devs are big blockers, yet you could use BU to enforce a 100kB blocksize limit if you wanted to.** 

Running Core is like buying a Sony TV that only lets you watch Fox, because the other channels are locked away and you have to know how to solder a circuit board to see them. To change the channel, you as a layman would have to switch to a different TV made by some other manufacturer, who you may not think makes as reliable of TVs. This is because Sony believes people should only ever watch Fox ""because there are dangerous channels out there"" or ""because since everyone needs to watch the same channel, it is our job to decide what that channel is."" So the community is stuck with either watching Fox on their nice, reliable Sony TVs, or switching to all watching ABC on some more questionable TVs made by some new maker (like, in 2015 the XT team was the new maker and BIP101 was ABC). 

BU (and now Classic and BitcoinEC) shatters that whole bizarre paradigm. BU is a TV that lets you tune to any channel you want, at your own risk. The community is free to converge on any channel it wants to, and since everyone in this analogy wants to watch the same channel they will coordinate to find one.

Yet people who are accustomed to Sony are so confused by the idea that the community could coordinate itself that they assume BU is, like XT, a TV that tunes to a specific channel, and they rail against that channel as dangerous. This is quite silly considering you can use BU to tune to Fox! That is, you can run BU with exactly Core settings. So you know you are being snowed there.

Although the following is hard to understand because of the fact that Satoshi introduced a meant-to-be temporary, non-controversial 1MB blocksize limit into the code, **it is actually the Core devs who are tacitly proposing something bran new**: By keeping the 1MB limit all these years while it gradually grew to be very controversial (due to increased Bitcoin usage), they have changed the situation from Satoshi's original one where the code *didn't* come with any controversial stances baked into it, to one where it does. **Core has gradually moved to a lock-in model because they imagine the community to be incapable reaching consensus on its own, or at least incapable of reaching a good consensus.**

By retaining the 1MB cap well past its time, they have little by little snuck in a new governance model I will call Governance by Centralized Inconvenience Barrier (GCIB). This is identical to Sony's model where they try to govern what everyone watches by making it inconvenient to change the channel (you have to know how to mod your TV or go find another maker who may not make TVs as well). 

It is centralized because whatever goes into the Core repository counts as (they say) the ""reference implementation,"" and any client that deviates from that is subject to extreme censorship on the Core mailing list as ""off topic"" and coincidentally the same applies on all the biggest Bitcoin forums (except this one) and bitcoin.org. Core's hope is that this new governance model will keep people from doing anything stupid and reckless, thanks to Core's paternalistic guidance. You can ironically know it is centralized because they focus on arguing that Core is somehow decentralized, using the flimsiest of reasoning: ""anyone can contribute [but the committers must approve]"" and ""the team is decentralized because the devs live all over the world [so what?]"" and ""only unanimous votes among the 7 committers can make changes [that's still just an FOMC, and unanimity just means at best no changes at all and at worst total colluded central control]"".

The pretzel logic even extends further, as to avoid the accusation of central control they instead say, ""Fine, no changes at all."" Not realizing that this effectively disallows any kind of temporary measures, including Satoshi's temporary blocksize limit. That would be insane, especially in the face of hot competition from altcoins, so the pretzel logic extends further: only soft forks are allowed, and hard forks are *especially* not allowed under controversy. Yet this is the ultimate in silliness, because a controversial soft fork will merely incite everyone who is against it to hard fork as a defense.

The whole paradigm where they think they can somehow ""disallow"" people from changing the channel (coordinating on blocksize settings without a group of devs rigging the consensus-finding) is hopelessly centralized. The whole paradigm where they think they can somehow ""disallow"" people from hard forking by only issuing soft forks is hopelessly centralized. The whole paradigm where Core = Bitcoin is hopelessly centralized.

BU, Classic, BitcoinEC, and soon btcd are the new bread, the ""rooted"" clients in the way you root an iPhone. For the purist, BitcoinEC is rooted Core, a minimal patchset. Unlike Core devs, these devs all refuse to pretend they are the determiners of what Bitcoin is. They understand that Bitcoin is not held together by trivial inconvenience barriers erected by dev teams, as that would have a trivially easy attack vector, as you can't really stop people from running a patch or modding their code in the long run even if you could do it for a while by pointing out there are some risks now due to lack of coding talent and such.

personalfinance,$9200 in debt on a line of credit with my bank and I don't understand how interest works. (Canada),"My bank offered me a line of credit with a 10 000 dollar limit in 2013, which I took but didn't touch, as I've always been relatively self sufficient. In 2014, my father got sick and I had to leave my job and go out of province to stay with him. During that time, I used 8000 of it. When he passed away in spring of 2015 I came back to my home province and started working full time, but the wage was low and I lived paycheque to paycheque. At the end of 2015, I got an inheritance cheque for 10 000 dollars and used it to pay off the line of credit, and put 1100 into a tax free savings account. I also lost my job around that time, fell into a depression and didn't work all year until October 2016, where I got a job that is only 2 days per week and is currently still my only one.

In the beginning of 2016, I started to use the line of credit again for personal expenses. Over the course of the year I kept dipping into it without making any payments at all. By December I had used 9200 of it and have refused to touch it since. I still haven't made a payment and my bank has been calling me. Since I am so scared of my debt and still have the depression, I have been ignoring them.

The original interest rate on the line of credit was prime+3%, but in the summer of 2016 I got a letter from the bank telling me they had raised the interest to prime+7%. I am about to start working again full time, and I would like to pay off the line of credit, but I don't understand how interest is calculated and I am worried that I am in way over my head. 9200 is a lot of money to me and I have been considering filing for bankruptcy, since the only money I have currently is about 500 dollars in my bank account and the 1100 in the tax free savings account.

I am largely financially dependent on my boyfriend right now, however I pay for some of my own expenses, which work out to around 2-300 dollars per month. Is it feasible for me to pay this line of credit off once I start working full time (my monthly income will likely be less than 1500 dollars), or is declaring bankruptcy the better option?",finance

Instead, he proposed slicing the Department of Transportation’s budget by 13 percent, or $2.4 billion. The cuts would put the Federal Aviation Administration under the thumb of the private sector, reduce funding for Amtrak and wipe out resources for new transit projects.

personalfinance,To Pay Off or Not to Pay Off?,"I will be taking out a car loan in July to buy a car at the end of its lease. Currently I have large-ish balances riding on two 0% interest cards (~$5k with a $5.5k limit on one, 0% expires in November; ~$2k with a ~$7.5k limit on the other, 0% expires April 2018). I have a number of other credit cards and other lines of credit, so my utilization rate for my revolving credit lines is only about 16%. Credit scores from a number of free sources are all 720ish. TransUnion's ""CreditView Dashboard"" estimates I could boost my credit score to the 780s by paying off all my credit cards, and I have the money (sitting pretty in a nice 1% Ally savings account) to do so.

Questions:
1. Will taking my credit score from the 720s to the 780s improve the interest rate I get on the car loan (by my calculations it looks like it'd take about a 0.1% rate improvement to break even on the interest I'd lose on the money I'd use to pay off the balances)?
2. If paying off the cards is the right answer, by when do I need to pay them off to get the benefit, given I'll be shopping for a loan in July?
3. What are your favorite auto loan sources? Since I already bank with Ally I figure I'll give them a shot, but I'm open to whatever will get me the best rate.",finance

personalfinance,Very frustrating experience with H&amp;B Block,"I typically use Turbo Tax Free Edition every year, do the Federal through through there, then the state separately to save $10. In the end, it's zero cost to me and a bit more time for the state taxes this way. This year, my parents used H&amp;R Block Free Edition, so I figured I would too.

I don't have anything majorly complex. Two W-2's from a job change mid-year, 1099-DIV, three 1099-R's (401k rollover, company had to do it in 3 separate transactions), and a 1099-B for when I exchanged funds in a taxable account with Vanguard. Correct me if I'm wrong, but all these are normal things an average American would have.

Get the entire way through the Federal and the 1099-B is a ""special form"" accordingly to H&amp;R Block and to continue, I have to upgrade to the Premium Edition. Being at the end, I say, sure, for $54.99 I just don't feel like wasting more time inputting stuff. Plus, you'd rationally think you could do the state taxes through the premium edition, right? Wrong!

**Additional $30 something to file the state taxes... on top of the $54.99 for the premium already purchased**. I skip the state ones - keep in mind, it only tells you this AFTER you do the state taxes. Another gimmick to get you guy ""purchase"" more through them.

The final straw came when they were going to **charge another $34.99 for me to receive my federal return funds**. Yes, you heard right, a fee to receive the funds via wire/bank transfer. Of course, the other option is to sign up for a prepaid Visa card on their site, which requires a bunch of documentation, agreements, etc. Other than that, you can't have your refund.

**What the hell H&amp;R Block?** It easily felt like each time they asked for more money it was strategically placed at a point where you'd be feeling like ""I just want these done!"". Fine, I get a 1099-B might be a bit of a special form, but it's nothing crazy. It didn't even change my refund amount. But $30 something for the state after paying for premium? Then $34.99 for to get your funds? Ridiculous.

**The total came in around $120** if you didn't opt to sign up for the pre-paid card, which wasn't a simple process it appeared. For that price, I could toss my documents on a tax preparer's desk and say ""do these"".",finance
personalfinance,My school has sent me an email stating that I need to pay more money after paying the full tuition. Get I get some advice on how this works?,"Dear Michael,
There has been an adjustment to your account in Populi due to the change in your EFC (expected family contribution) resulting from verification of your FAFSA.
 
At the beginning of the semester you were selected for a process called verification by the Department of Education.  This means that the Department of Education asked for tax documents and W2 information to compare them to the information that you entered into the FAFSA.  The tax documents you provided were sent to our federal aid processor.  After they reviewed the documents that you provided and compared them to what you entered into the FAFSA, there was a change in your EFC (expected family contribution).  This change does not affect the loan amounts, but in many cases the Pell grant amounts are affected.  Sometimes the EFC goes down and a student receives more Pell grant and other times the EFC goes up and less Pell grant is given.

In your case, your EFC was adjusted higher than what was originally reported to us when you filled out the FAFSA meaning you will receive less Pell grant.  Therefore, your original estimated Pell grant of $5765 has been adjusted to the verified amount of $0 which is lower than originally estimated on your Estimated Financial Aid Award Letter.  You originally reported to us that your EFC was 100 after verification it came out to be 5701.

You will be responsible to pay the resulting balance on your account and your Populi account has been changed to reflect this balance. Please check your Populi account for your new balance and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

financialindependence,Dad thinks it will take 30 years for me to pay off a mortgage of under 100k,"Hey there, I was talking to my dad earlier about housing and said how I hope to get a mortgage for a fairly cheap house for under £100k and then rent it out in around 5-10 years after I pay the mortgage off. (Part of how I hope to reach FI but I didn't discuss this with him)


At this, he scoffed and told me I'd not be able to pay off the mortgage for close to 30 years as I can't save and will spend all my money! This is when it really hit me how much the majority of people don't realise their true spending power. My dad has been in debt most of his life and it seems like he thinks debt is inevitable. He has a very well paying job with many perks but he's still living paycheck to paycheck.

personalfinance,Gotta figure out my life,"I'm a High School senior graduating around May. I have around a 2.8 GPA, experience as a JROTC officer (which will give me a pay-grade raise in the military), and literally no college money saved up. I've been accepted to the university of Alaska, Anchorage, for computer science, but my dad recently told me that their ROTC program and the college in general would be far too expensive, and I would have to live with debt for a large portion of my life. So, he told me about how he Army has brought back the two year enlistment, and that I can knock out an easily bachelors in those two years, and go green to gold (enlisted to officer) when the time for my reenlistment comes since I'd have a bachelors, and it'd be paid for by the Army. 

   My original plan was to use my stipend from ROTC to help pay off college, but my dad and some recruiters have told me that state funding is being cut, and I won't be guaranteed to get any money. 

   I got an incredibly high score on the ASVAB (like one point beneath the top tier I believe), but if I do a two year enlistment the army won't give me a job they take 18 months out of those two years to get trained for, so I'll probably get stuck with something simple. 

   My question is, should I go Army and try to knock out a bachelors in two years, or go to college? 

   I haven't heard back from any scholarship apps I've sent, all I've been offered is federal loans and the Alaska Performance scholarship, which only covers a couple hundred dollars.

personalfinance,Is it better to invest excess student loan refunds or to pay off old student loan debt?,"Hey everyone, I have a thought experiment I'd like your input on, if you have the time.

I'm a medical school student planning on coming out with about $250,000 in loan debt (multiple loans, all with interest rates between 5-8%). Obviously, these loans have high interest rates and you cannot prepay any of the principal until interest is paid from what I understand. Therefore, any payments I would make towards them now would not reduce the overall debt burden at the end of the day, it would only help finish of the payments early. 

The way the loans are disbursed is in 3 equal disbursements per year (and I just got the 3rd one for my 1st year). Whatever is left after tuition is refunded to my personal checking account by the bank, and I can do with it what I please. Generally, I use it on stuff I shouldn't be buying with debt, but I'm trying to improve my habits. Therefore, I have two options: start paying off previous loans (I don't need the money to survive, luckily my med school is close to home), or I can invest it in a couple index funds and maybe two or three growth stocks (I have *some* experience looking at fundamentals from when I wrote for SeekingAlpha). 

The choice really comes down to whether or not I believe the overall market will beat the student loan interest rate over the course of about 10 years (which I'm pretty sure it will), or not. However, and here's the hard part for me: I don't understand the long term tax structure of student loans versus capital gains.

For example, if I average 8-12% returns over 10 years in the market and then close some of my positions to pay back loans, what is the likely tax rate on the proceeds? Would I be better off making returns in this range, paying the tax on that, and then paying back the loans, or am I better of paying the 5-8% loans early and taking the tax deductions for interest payments?",finance
personalfinance,"(CAN) Accepted to a Masters degree in Canada, dream college, dream teachers, but I'm poor in a 3rd world country.","Hello, everyone. I am not 100% sure this is the correct place to post this. If not, I apologize.

Before I explain my problem, let me offer some context. I am a professional musician; I play the trumpet, and that is at the moment my single marketable skill. I'm 25, Brazilian, single, no kids, about to get my diploma for a Bachelor's degree in Music by Rio de Janeiro Federal University (UFRJ). My mother, 58, widow, is unemployed with no income and lives with me. I have a steady salary from the City Hall band that covers my rent, home expenses and less than half of my transportation costs. In normal times, most of my income comes from freelance work. I have a sister, 34, married, pregnant, who occasionally chips in with groceries.

I have recently been accepted for a Masters degree in Orchestral Instrument at UBC. To study and work abroad has been a lifelong dream, and the trumpet professor in UBC is among the top 20 in the world. Last year I was invited to take part in a festival organized by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. I did very well, and a few of the teachers encouraged me to apply for UBC. I applied, I sent my video, and about 2 weeks ago I received an acceptance letter.

The only (!) problem is that I am in no financial shape to go. At the moment I (*am very barely able to*) live paycheck to paycheck. Poor financial decisions, combined with the worst economic crisis Brazil has ever faced (worse than 1929), have made my financial reserves (about US$ 10K at their height) to dwindle to zero.

My options are limited because of a few things. First, most student loan options are locked to me because I am a non-citizen trying to study in Canada. AFAIK, Canadian law does not have any provisions for people with student visas to take loans, and almost no banking institutions offer me options. Taking a loan in Brazil is being considered, but because I have very little provable steady income (only the City Hall salary), almost no loans are available - the highest loan offer I could get would pay less than 60% of one year of tuition, and that's on a 60-month plan I'd have to start paying for on day one. I'm working hard on scholarships, but Music courses have very little options available, both in Brazil and Canada. Working in Canada is something I'm also looking very hard into, but that has two problems: hour limitations and visa acquisition. I can't take more that 20h a week, and that apparently includes freelance work, which means I can either take a steady job that won't be enough to pay rent or I can look for freelance work that seems to pay very well but offers zero guarantees. About the visa - I need to prove I can support myself to get a student visa. Scholarships and loans would be good for that, but I can't offer *a job I'm still looking for* as evidence for that.

I'm trying different stuff, too - I'm fluent in both Portuguese and English so I was looking for work in Vancouver that might have a use for that (so far no luck) and I'm trying other stuff. Any suggestion - *any* - is welcome. Feel free to post stuff that you think is too obvious (I'm not a Canadian citizen so I might've never heard of it). Feel free to post ideas you think might be a bit stupid (even if it is I might give it a try). Feel free to post *any idea that crosses your mind*.

The Past: I had a 60k paying job last year which I lost 4 months back in October of 2016. I needed a car and so I purchased a car for $24k after taxes on financing in March 2016. I had a poor credit score so I took a bad interest rate in hopes of paying it off sooner and building a credit rating back. Monthly payments for the car are $500 in financing payments and $250 in insurance. (high insurance because I was under 25), the insurance has since dropped to $200 a month. 

Income: Since I lost my job in October I applied to Employment Insurance which gives me $950 biweekly till August 2017. I am paying my bills through the EI payments I am receiving. 

Debt: The car has $19,000 left to buy out if I wanted to pay it off fully. I needed the car to get to work, I got a 3 series BMW and put on lots of mileage on the car, but I do not need it anymore. Although I'm having a hard time selling the car for a good price. I listed it at 17k but I feel it will be hard to sell for more than $14k. So even if I sell it at $15k the value of the car is less than the financing. 

Options: I do not mind getting a part time job, not a full time job because my business has very good prospect of turning into something great in 2-3 months time. If I get any income, it will be deducted from that im getting from EI. For example if I make $1000 in a month, EI will only pay be $900 from the remainder instead of $1900,

However, I am struggling right now as I also have $6k in credit card debt which is getting extremely hard to pay off.

personalfinance,"I just defaulted on $17,000 without realizing it, for which payments I could've made 10 times over","Hi, Reddit, can you give me some recommendations? I'll describe what happened, and provide a tl;dr at the bottom. 

I finished my undergrad in May 2014 and did 1 semester of grad in fall 2014. I took a leave of absence for all of 2015 to pursue an 8-month technical internship, so I requested forbearance on my student loans. I finished my grad degree in May 2016, and have since started a relatively lucrative career. 

Over the course of 8 month since then, I've paid off 15k of my student loan debt to Loan Provider #1 (stafford loans) with hard-earned moneys. It looked like I was on track to paying off my principle in a pretty timely manner, and I'm paid forward at least 3 years with that loan servicer. 

But on thursday night I received an email from my school's Computing Services saying that I needed to log into an alumni account and move everything over from this .edu account to the alumni.edu account, because I would lose access to my active student account in 30 days. I had never accessed my alumni.edu account, but I presumed it was through gmail client. So I logged in for the first time ever and was greeted with the worst financial surprise of my life - a warning from my liaison at my school's student HUB warning of potential default. I was like ""what the flying F***!? I'm paid forward 3 years!"" I reviewed the email more closely and realized that the loaner name didn't match with Loan Service Provider #1. Turns out that I not only subscribed to stafford loans as part of my financial aid packages each year as an undergraduate, but also to $13,000 total in federal perkins loans via my school. I had never heard of Loan Service Provider #2, because I didn't choose my loaners, my school selected them for me. Then I remembered my Financial Aid Package offers and my Master Promissory notes. Concerned, I figured out what my user name and password pin were, and logged into the loan site for the first time. Whereupon I found that my loans had accumulated $400 in interest and $3000 in late fees, and 120 days of delinquency had passed, so my loans were now in collections. The website of Loan Service Provider #2 was incredibly archaic - apparently last revised in 1997, since updating their infrastructure would cost a lot of resources. But worst of all, I realized why I never received prior notice about due dates for my loan repayment plan - they had an address on file that was 3-4 years outdated. Apparently they don't have the practice or the automation in place to email their clients about due dates and delinquencies, and only contact with snailmail and perhaps phone calls with whatever demographics information they had on record. 

	1) None of my relatives reside at the address that they've been sending mail to for the past 4-6 months. 
	
	2) I considered phone calls from Loan Service Provider #2 to be spam along with every other spamming/fishing phone number that I don't recognize. I didn't get a voice message, but maybe my voicemail box was full at the time?

Bitcoin,Still holding and i believe on the long term bitcoin never going to fail you,"http://i.imgur.com/dDjsfq0.png

I'm a long-term investor, who's in love with bitcoin. I saw i lost around 25k$ today. From an investor eyes it's really bad, I don't understand what bitcoin unlimited trying to do. I don't even believe those guys have bitcoins. Because even a child can tell this kind of shit will fuck up the price.

Even if costs my invesment money, i won't use their shitty chain, since i don't trust their shitty developers either. They'll fuck up like ethereum soon or later, and all people following them will regret.

Bitcoin Core, have better developers, oldest crypto-currency and of course its price was steady and good for like 6 months. Paying 1-2$ for transactions OK for me, since every bank or money transfer system in the world will charge you higher. I don't want to buy coffee for bitcoins, we have cash for that. But i can keep my money in my wallet and withdraw any time i want, i see bitcoin as a bank in my pocket.

Think about linux kernel, if a bunch of idiots finds a way to reclaim kernel.org domain, and fork linux and write some shitty codes into it, and calls themself Linux since they have kernel.org, well nobody will use their kernel IRL since they'r not trustable and not experienced enough. Mark my words, this is exactly going to happen with BU. 

Right now i'm 25k$ down, but i'll keep holding, and tomorrow i'll start buying, because bitcoin never failed me. Even BU creates new chain, i don't think they can replace bitcoin. Worst case scenario: price will probably drops to 200-300$, bitcoin developers will find a way to prevent this kind of shit again, and all people will be learned their lesson.

So, I see BU guys as thefts who's trying to exploit Bitcoin and take control and shitting the plate they fed. We all lose in the process since we'r in the same boat with this idiots, but eventually Bitcoin is going to become stronger and bulletproof.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,[Taxes] What does xxx plus 15% of amount over xxx mean in Tax Bracket?,"For example:

$9,276 to $37,650	$927.50 plus 15% of the amount over $9,275

personalfinance,Need your advice PF! What should I be doing differently?,"Dear PF,

29Y Male looking for long-term advice on my personal finances. 

Assets? My vehicle was bought outright brand-new in 2012. Home is worth an estimated $230k with a balance of $142k left on mortgage. At this point in life, those are my two major assets.

Primary Income? I earn an estimated $68-$75k per year (depending on OT and bonuses). 28% of that goes into a 401k provided by my employer who matches every single dollar up to the federal max (the match is usually between $0.40 to $0.75 per dollar). I also contribute the max to my HSA which is somewhere around $3300 per year.

Secondary Income? My secondary source of income is usually between $15k-$30k per year and is given to me pre-tax. My goal is to have as many deductions as possible for my primary income to offset my secondary income. Tax time is still very painful! **Aside from paying taxes quarterly and deductions, should I be doing anything differently?**

Investments? Above and beyond that, I have a Roth IRA which I contribute about $1200 of my post-tax earnings to. **Should I max this out given my employer's 401K match is so aggressive?** I assume once I reach the federal maximum then I could re-evaluate this before April of the following year.

Debts? Aside from my mortgage, I do not have any. I have a few credit cards, one of which I use frequently and pay in full each month.

Liquid Assets? I have about $52k between my checking/savings. **Is this too much? What is everyone's thoughts on Money Markets?** I dropped $10k additional towards my mortgage this year, but with the mortgage interest around 4% I can't help but wonder if I'm better off investing than paying down my mortgage further. **Thoughts?**

I plan on refinancing my car loan into just my name around october. (Maybe sooner) Things hurting my credit right now is credit usage, two hard pulls, # of accounts is only 3, and age of credit. 

Is it better to apply now or wait? I was thinking of waiting since I don't particularly need the card atm but if it can help my credit in a few months and get me a better interest rate on my car then I think it would be worth it to get it now.

personalfinance,Looking for feedback on financial plan,"So I've decided I should start making some changes to what I am doing with my money and am also looking for advice/feedback on my new plan which I will layout here:

**Current Situation**

&gt;Liquid assets: 7.5k in checking, 4.9k in basic savings account

&gt;Retirement: 5.1k vested, 4.4k unvested traditional 401k

&gt;HSA: 1.5k (company adds 1.5k annually)

&gt;Debt: 3k on car (3%), 15k on student loans (3-4%)

&gt;Monthly take home: 3,680 after taxes and 401k

&gt;Monthly expenses: About 1600 total not including food

&gt; Monthly left over: about $2050

Currently I am contributing 10% to 401k, company matches up to 4% and they contribute another 4% no matter what. So I am putting in 10%, company is putting in 8%. 

I was paying $1000 a month towards student loans but now I want to make a change because only loans left are 3 to 4% interest rates.

**New Plan**

* Lower 401k contribution to 4% for maximum match

* Open Roth IRA and max that annually

* Pay minimum payment on student loans now ($160)

* Transfer savings + half of money in checking account to a higher interest savings account (ally possibly, anything with 1%)

**Questions**

* Should I open Roth IRA for 2016 year? if so how much should I put in it, I don't necessarily want to destroy my emergency funds

* Is it dumb to only pay minimum on my loans? The reason I am thinking about doing that is to save for a future house down payment or something (although that is not in my current foreseeable future)

* Is there something better than a 1% savings account for saving this money?

Any advice is appreciated, I am still new to personal finance but trying my best to start off right.",finance

gaming,Nier Automata was phenomenal.,"Completed the game a few hours ago and I feel like writing a small review on it. Granted, games under the Drakengard / Nier setting are usually good but Automata went a step further and integrated some philosophical themes into it's story.

**= Story =**

The player assumes control of the a YoHRa Android that's designated as ""2B"" - tasked with the mission to protect the last remnants of humanity were forced to live on the moon millenniums ago by the ""aliens"" and their automated machines.

Whilst strictly adhering to the code that Androids are not allowed to ""feel emotions"", it's clear that something warm and humane lies deep in the heart of the Androids.

The line between humans and machine becomes increasingly blurred as the story progresses - the humanoid machines began adopting not only the ability to love, care and provide warmth for their fellow kind but also possesses the same flaws that plagued humanity - hatred, distrust, fear, lust and prejudice. They possess the same strengths and the same irrationality that humans once bore - bringing forth the question of the Androids' worth and the meaning of what makes an individual ""human"".

The tale is, however, not without it's flaws. Nier Automata is an open-world experience and a fair portion of it's story is stashed away in the form of optional content. Cutscenes were a strong focus in previous titles but character development now comes in the form of completing side quests - where the protagonists begins questioning their place in the world after going through a certain sequence of optional events. Not necessarily an improvement as they're ""missable"" and doesn't provide as much of an impact as cutscenes.

Pacing for the main events of the story feels out of place at the midway point of the game and it's hard to feel sorry for the plight of certain characters as they were not as involved in the story or because their plight came to be with minimal foreshadowing - causing it to be sudden and unexpected.

**(Pros)**

* Feel Trip Simulator 2017

* Some unexpected twists that's foreshadowed earlier on in the game

* Cleverly covers some of the glaring plotholes in the later part of the game. The game even points out said plotholes for you - confusing the player even further.

* Strong philosophical themes that truly comes into play near the end of the game.

* Themes of the game were interwoven into the final portion of the game as a gameplay element.

**(Cons)**

* Poor pacing and development for one of the protagonists.

* Those not used to Yoko Taro's works may be thrown off by the extremely stark contrast between the first portion of the game and the later half of the game. The lack of build-up leading to the events of the second half of the game doesn't really help either.

* Side-quests covers the exposition of the game's themes - as well as the evolving mindset of the protagonists. Thus, for a fuller experience, the player *has* to go through these quests.

**= Gameplay =**

The game is primarily divided into two aspects. The straightforward combat element and the various bullet hell segments that are littered throughout the game.

The former relies heavily upon your characters' level, Plugin Chips (Equivalent of equipment), weapons' upgrade levels and your own aptitude in dodging the enemy's attacks.

The latter is divided into two forms of minigames. The Hacking minigame which relies on nothing but your capacity to stay calm under a constant stream of bullets and the Mech flight segments which relies partially on your equipped gear.

Combat is straightforward and runs on a combo system where your character could equip up to two sets of twos. One weapon would serve as a Light attack and the other would serve as a Heavy attack - your combo length is based entirely upon your weapon upgrade level.

Whilst it does appear that the game has some potential for actual combos; in practise, it's actually more reliant on your gear setup, the gear you're using, the protagonist you're currently using and your own aptitude in playing action games.

The game also offers three different protagonists - two shares a similar combat style but one of them has the ability to hack into foes on the spot at the cost of having more clunky combos. Ironically, it's very apparent that the character whom isn't ""suited for combat"" turns out to be a far more powerful character under player control due to the invincibility frames provided by his counters and his Hacking ability. (Essentially an ability that allows him to hack into enemies, play a minigame and dish out large chunks of damage - failing, however, costs a chunk of health.)

**= Open World Aspect =**

The open world element of this game is, to put it bluntly - bland.

Side-quests are virtually the same (save for context)- annihilation, hacking or fetching. It doesn't help when reliable means of Fast Travelling is only unlocked at the late first half portion of the game.

Enemies are generally the same, dull hordes of metal that you have to plough through. Unique enemies are limited to story events and side-quests only offers the same, generic enemy that's reskinned or albeit buffed. On the other hand, it's interesting to see how the enemies change (slightly) as the story goes on - reflecting the current state of the story whilst making the common mob more dangerous than before.

**(Pros)**

* Combat is drastically better than previous instalments

* Grinding isn't harsh and there are plugins to improve EXP / Item drop rate to save time. Money is easy to earn.

**(Cons)**

* Side-quests can be repetitive but some of them may prove to be rewarding as they provide further insight into the opinions and mindset of the protagonists.

* Hacking can get fairly dull and it's hardly punishing should the player fail as the player could easily recover the health lost most of the time. (Assuming they have the right plugin equipped)

* The first two routes are essentially the same story but based on two different perspectives with stronger enemies and some exposition on the background of certain boss characters, which, frankly, doesn't add much to the overarching plot.

* Common mobs are painfully generic and fighting them doesn't require much of a shift in strategy. On higher difficulties, naturally, you'd have to play smarter but with the exception of a few bosses and mob-types, the player doesn't really need to flex their brains all too much in the means to approach their enemies.

* Some notable glitches and bugs that primarily plagues the progress and completion of side-quests. You could usually fix 'em by reloading a save file.

* Some frame dips but nothing too severe.

**= Others =**

* Players unfamiliar with Drakengard and Nier would be lost on certain topics or miss the significance of certain events but it's still, IMO, playable for newer audiences.

* The game has only five important endings. The others are mostly spoof endings that speaks of the consequences of your ~~stupidity~~ actions in a very off-handed manner.

* A Debug feature and a Chapter Select option for clearing 3/4 of the game. The former allows you to place enemies with higher levels on the map / Debug Room (But you can't save) and the latter allows the player to get a 100% without going through the entire game again.

* Expect *some* anime cliches. Not as heavy as Drakengard 3 but it's still there.

* Shocking events are well foreshadowed so they don't feel particularly forced. In other words, shock value's fairly well managed in this particular title.

* As mentioned - a unique, final ending sequence that weaves the ""message"" of the game into a form of gameplay element. Players familiar with the universe setting could expect something new.

TL;DR Version : It's good.",technology

personalfinance,"[Oakland, CA] Almost homeless in the Bay Area...","I'm a 23 y/o college student living independently in a 2-bedroom apt. in Oakland, CA paying $525 in rent for a semi-private living room plus roughly $50 per month in utilities/internet in a $1900 2-bed apt. I currently have about ~$175 to my name with no savings or valuable assets to speak of. My approximate monthly budget is [here](http://imgur.com/a/LfVKo).


I moved to Oakland in late January after living with family for a year with about $3000 with the intention of getting a job right away so I would at least have a small emergency fund. However, due to some personal issues including drug abuse (weed and hallucinogens) and depression, I've essentially spent the last 2 months in my room sleeping, surfing the Internet, and generally avoiding almost all coursework or finding a job. The only thing I did with any regularity was go to class and even then I skipped some. I recently threw out my drug stash and am taking other steps toward overcoming my psychological issues.


Here's my current situation: My $525 rent is due on April 5th and I don't have a job yet. I don't know if I'll be able to earn enough before then to pay my rent and still have enough to live. I've applied for food stamps but since I'm a full-time student I don't qualify in CA until I'm working 25+ hours per week. I'm flunking two of my four classes and am planning on dropping those (which could impact my financial aid next year). Getting financial help from friends or family isn't a possibility for me at this point. If I drop out of school right now I would owe my university $15,000 in addition to about $30k in student loans with no degree to show for it. Ironically if I drop in early April I might not owe anything other than the loans I took out but I wouldn't owe the money to my university, just my loan servicer but I digress. In other words, I would owe 40k in student debt but have the ability to pay it off normally to the fed.


I'm pretty confident I can get a job within the next week as long as I hustle but I don't know if it will be enough $$$ in time. 


My first priority is tackling my drug habit and mental health but beyond that as far as I can tell I currently have the following potential options:


1.) Find a job ASAP my roommate who I pay rent to each month if I can use my $700 security deposit as my rent for April and then pay it back once I've consistent income. (I doubt this will work)


2.) Move home to family or friends if they'll take me in and help find a replacement roommate if necessary (and that's somewhat doubtful at this point).


3.) Find a job ASAP and pay the rent a few days/weeks late but screw my roommates over in the process since me paying the rent late makes us all late since we all lease together. I would have to pay a late fee of $50.

4.) Worst case scenario 1: Continue going to school part-time while temporarily homeless. 



Thanks in advance for any advice or help!

Update: Thanks for the thoughtful advice everyone! This is why I love this subreddit so much. I'm about 90% sure I'm going to move home next weekend at this point, take a leave of absence from school and work full-time while addressing my personal issues. One step at a time...",finance

personalfinance,Thinking about replacing car- want PF's thoughts,"**Let me start by saying that I've read enough PF to know the general themes of advice from this sub, but I still want some thoughts......**

&amp;nbsp;


I drive a 2007 Buick SUV which has just reached 118,000 miles. It's been in the family (grandfather -&gt; father -&gt; me) since it was purchased new. I paid $3k for it, it's currently worth around $4k.

&amp;nbsp;

So here's my current thoughts - the car that I have right now works, and it seems to be stable for the time being, but I would like to sell it before it's book value hits $3k. That way, I will have been able to drive the car for about a year or so completely free, with the exception of insurance, gas, and repairs (it has needed some, but overall hasn't been a money pit so far.)

&amp;nbsp;

I have the opportunity to **buy a Chevy Volt (MSRP $36k) for around $18.5k brand new** (GM employee discount factored in at purchase, current book value of the Buick factored in at purchase, federal tax credit for EVs which would be part of my tax return in 2018) which to me, seems like a steal. It would definitely be a step up from what I am currently driving, and **I could (at the time of writing this) but around $16k down on it**. *It isn't exactly what I want, but I recognize a sports car at age 22 makes little sense, so that'll be a goal for farther down the road.*

&amp;nbsp;

**I am overthinking this decision way too much. Should I buy the Volt, keep driving the Buick, or look for something else?**

For reference, I make around $62k.",finance
personalfinance,Pull from retirement for second property?,"We are a 34 year old couple with a baby. We bought a home in Los Angeles in a quickly improving area a few years ago for a good price and low interest rate. However the schools are terrible and we anticipate growing out of the small size. So we would like to move eventually. 

Either we sell our home and buy another, or buy a second home and rent our first. If we rent the first it would pay for itself and perhaps give a few extra hundred a month (after maintenance expenses). 

To garner a 10% down payment for the second we would have to loan 36k out of an employer-sponsored deferred compensation retirement account and combine it with some cash savings we have. We would pay the loan back bi weekly over 6-15 years (our choice) with interest. Interest goes back to our own investments. We would still have about 80k in retirement after the loan. I also may have access to a pension when I retire but I am not counting on that as there are many legal challenges trying to undo the system. 

QUESTION: Good idea to buy 2nd? We like the idea of investment property because we can pass it down to our kid(s) and we diversify our retirement passive income stream. The downside is that we take a big hit on compounding interest and don't have much cash buffer for a while.",finance

personalfinance,How can we get out of 220k of debt?,"Trying to turn over a new leaf on finances. Having worked on this for a few months (mostly just reducing expenses, building an emergency fund, and moving high-interest credit card debt onto low-interest balance transfer offers), here is the current state of things:

- $67k of credit card debt, which is nominally at 0% until at the soonest Jan 2018, but I think of as being at 3% since that was what the balance transfer fees upfront for it were. We are paying only the minimums on this as we try to bring up our emergency fund and figure out what to do.
- $70k of Parent PLUS student loans at an average interest rate of 7.2%, of which only about half are currently in repayment and the other half will go into repayment in Dec 2017 (D-day).
- $5.5k car loan at 1.99%
- $52k mortgage left at 7.25% on a home worth $100k-$200k, but probably more like $100k
- $24k 401k loan at 5.25%, which I think pays the interest to ourselves, so I don’t know whether this is considered “debt” except that it reduces our take-home pay when the payments are deducted. There is currently $330k in the 401k.

We are ~60 years old and in not great health, but also not actively sick. We have an income of ~$100k/year pre-tax. Even so, we’re having a hard time covering expenses + payments on all this debt out of our income. The other half of the student loans kicking in could make that impossible.

We currently have a little more than a month of buffer/emergency fund. When we started getting serious about this two months ago, we had no buffer at all and were living paycheck to paycheck.

Here is our current plan for what to do next:

1. Try to refinance our mortgage, hopefully with a cash-out refinancing that will allow us to pay off some of our credit card debt.
    - Our land is worth ~$100k, and our town assesses our home to be worth ~$100k as well for property tax purposes, for a total of a theoretical $200k. However, the home is in bad repair (we never felt we had enough money to repair it) and may be worth nothing, we don’t know. We hope we would still be able to refinance based on the land value alone, but it seems difficult.  
2. Refinance student loans to lower interest.
    - Haven’t even started to think about this yet.
3. If there is still high-interest debt after doing these refinancings, maybe look into getting a personal loan if it would be better interest than credit cards?

Obviously increasing income and decreasing expenses would also help, and we’re trying to do that, but it’s slow going and no magic bullet so far.

Do you all have any suggestions? Are we totally thinking about this wrong? We have been mostly focused on trying to eliminate the credit card debt through refinancing since the prospect that if could shoot back up to 20-30% if we run out of balance transfer offers is terrifying. Is there something else we should be doing?",finance
personalfinance,Importance of tax returns when applying for a mortgage loan... question mark?,"My wife and I are in our mid-late 20s and want to buy a home. We found the house we want, got preapproved for the loan and went under contract. Estimated monthly cost including mortgage ins. and home ins. is $694/mo. We pay $650/mo in rent right now for 1/1 with no yard. The house we are after is 3/2 on a half an acre. Seems like a no brainer. 

Well we were really excited about it until the lender asked for our tax returns. We haven't filed yet. In fact we haven't filed 2015 yet (while other story there.) I had already planned to take care of both soon, but now we are in a rush. And my employer didn't enter my W4 information correctly so I was barely taxed at all for one of those years. To make matters worse, the healthcare marketplace wants money back from me (yet another story) and with every W2 I enter (on a tax website) my Federal Due goes up and up... and way the hell up. 

SO, not only do I not know why I owe all this money, I'm very scared this will mean I don't get the loan I need for the house.

personalfinance,How much money should I be using to pay off debt vs. how much should I be saving?,"I'm 31 and my husband is 27, we have 3 kids between us. He recently got a much better job, and for the first time in my adult life I feel like we have achieved real financial stability, though our income is still pretty modest. I bring home $2400 a month after taxes, he brings home a base pay of $1400 after taxes, health insurance and child support, and on top of that makes commission, which can be as low as $1k and as high as $5k per month but usually averages between $2-3k after taxes. So our average monthly income is right around $6,000.

Our monthly expenses amount to a little less than $3k for bills/groceries/entertainment/etc., and we just started using You Need A Budget to keep that on track. For the last couple months (he got the job in October and just started making commission in January after training) we have been using most of our excess income to do some things we couldn't afford to do before- car repairs, pay a lawyer to take care of some custody/visitation issues, replace some worn-out furniture, etc. I also opened 529 college plans for the kids this month with $50 each, he started making the max contribution to his 401k that his employer will match (8% I think), I opened a traditional IRA with Betterment that I put $100 in, and we put $600 in our emergency fund in our savings account at our bank. (I looked for info about Betterment around this sub and found some mixed feelings, but I know literally nothing about investing money and find it *incredibly* overwhelming and it gives me a lot of anxiety so I wanted something managed by someone other than me). I want to keep building our emergency fund and sticking money in the IRA and the kids' college funds, but we also have about $55k in debt combined. The vast majority of it is student loans, but there is about $4k in child support arrears, about $1k in credit card debt I plan to pay off first because we are being charged high interest rates on it, and about $6k in random collections, some of which will be falling off our credit in 1-2 years. Our credit scores are both in the low 600's and that's definitely something we would like to work on- but they are up from the low 500's a year and a half ago!

What I'm looking for is some advice on how much of our extra $3kish a month should be going into each of our various savings accounts and how much should be going toward our debts. We both have income based repayment plans on our student loans that we got before we got married in September and prior to him getting the new job, so right now they are low, and we definitely want to be putting in more than the minimum. The credit cards are our first priority of course, as well as building up our emergency fund. We would also like to start saving for a down payment to buy our first home in 2-3 years after we do some work on our credit. Prior to us moving in together I was a single mom for 4 years and could barely afford basic necessities, so I am not used to having money to invest/save/take care of debt and I would appreciate any guidance!

TL:DR; hubby and I have $3kish a month after expenses, have $55k in debt, and very little savings split between an IRA/emergency fund/529's for 3 kids and hopefully a down payment on a home in 2-3 years, what percentage of that $3k should we put where?",finance
personalfinance,Repaying US federal student loans while living permanently abroad and earning a non-USD salary is a HUGE burden. I think I've found a solution but it seems somewhat outlandish. Can someone advise?,"I took out around $40k in student loans to do a degree in a foreign country. When I finished I ended up staying put and live here permanently. I now have a decent job but when you convert my monthly loan repayment amount to the currency of my salary, my payment amount is a really untenable percentage of my earnings and I don't know what I can do about it. To be clear, the issue is that the currency I earn in is very often very weak against the USD.

I once did a bunch of calculations about how much I earn when converted to USD and called up FedLoan. When we talked through the amounts, the agent said I would indeed qualify for a big reduction in monthly payment amount. I was relieved until he told me I needed to submit my US tax return as proof of the amounts I'd given him for it to be changed. I felt a massive wave of anxiety wash over me and just ended the conversation.

So I just tried to keep paying. I wasn't always successful, meaning I've missed payments and so on. I went through a period of unemployment and depression for a little while wherein I didn't make payments and now that I have a job and am clawing my way back, I really want to figure this out.

I've been doing some research and realized that I actually might be able to make this work by submitting my zero-earnings US tax returns to negotiate a repayment adjustment. I will just file as the US tax laws require that I do, declaring my foreign income and then adjusting it down to zero USD because I earn under $99K USD per year (this is what you're required to do if you are a US citizen). Then when I go to renegotiate payments with FedLoan, showing my no-way-of-doubting-it, legit tax return will say I have no income and my required payment will be dropped to $0. 

As a bit of perspective: I actually saw this written up as a perk of joining the Peace Corps on the official PeaceCorps website. They said that during your two-year stint, your official US income is $0, so your taxes reflect that and you qualify for $0 monthly payments on your federal student loans. This is just to give some perspective that this is at least relatively legitimate.

I've googled this briefly and found people on other forums that reference this $0 USD income tax filing as a sort of scheme to not pay anything back at all, assuming that the debt will be forgiven in 25 years. This seems like a tremendously sketchy thing to do, especially considering that 25 years is a long time for the government to not catch on and change the laws, likely screwing you over even more in the long run. 

To be painfully clear, that's NOT what I want to do. I'd rather just make payments according to what I can afford (in accordance with whatever the current currency conversion is - paying aggressively if it ever tips in my favor, and paying what I can while it's very much not in my favor) until the loan is gone. 

But will this work? Will FedLoan see payments coming in on a loan that has a $0 monthly required payment and wonder where the money is coming from? It all seems pretty outlandish, but I really feel between a rock and a hard place. If I want to renegotiate, I have to show my US tax return, but if I show my US tax return, I'll get bumped to $0/month. If I don't renegotiate, I just plain can't afford to make payments and will slip further down this hole. 

And no, I'm not moving back to the US - it's not an option.

Does anyone have any experience with this? I would really appreciate some help. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,$1400 for Tax Prep Services?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

A few months ago, I started looking around for a CPA to do my taxes this year. I have a job that requires me to travel, and I get W-2s for every state  I work in, so it's a hassle every year to file in a million states. I also got married and my wife worked multiple jobs this year and is a student, so I figured it was finally time to just pay someone else to do my taxes for me. 

When I looked for a CPA, I checked with the Better Business Bureau, state CPA association. The guy I ended up going with was also a CFP and seemed like a nice enough guy. We met - I asked lots of questions, including how do you charge (per hour, per return, etc) and how much do you charge? He told me he charges $200/hr but that he has a tax preparer who does most of the work and she is only $60/hr. He said that an average state and federal return costs about $200. I paid that much with TurboTax last year, so it sounded like a great deal. 

Skip forward a few months to when I actually got my tax forms. I had everything very neatly filed with tabs for everything so that they could quickly and easily find anything they needed. I also completed a detailed questionnaire that gave them all my relevant life information. 

Two weeks later, they sent me an email saying my federal return was $8k and that I owed in a couple states, but I was looking to get about $7k back. That sounded great. But they also attached an invoice for $1400, which seems very high. It was itemized to show $1000 for federal and home state and then $150 for to additional states and $100 for another state. At $60/hr, that means his tax preparer worked 20 hours on the returns (and he reviewed in an hour, presumably)--does that sound right? 

Are these prices normal? I live in a small town in the Midwest if that helps. If not, what do I do? I signed an engagement letter that says I agreed to pay based on an hourly rate. Obviously I can pay it with my refund, but I think that may be what he's counting on--that he can overcharge me because I'm getting so much back. 

Any information or advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Proper way to balance excess income for loans versus investments?,"Hey everyone,

Curious how people decide upon what fraction of their excess income goes towards loans or investments.

Trying to plan for ten or twenty years down the road for paying off student loans, car loan, and mortgage. I love crunching numbers, so I've made an Excel sheet to solve for the optimal distribution of excess payments to loan vs investments. Is this an appropriate method when using the amortization schedules for each loan?  What do other people use for this situation? I just hate ""throwing away money"" to interest on the loans if I could pay it down faster, but, because of wonderful compounding gains on investments, in my case it's beneficial to put a majority of the excess income to investments rather than the mortgage.  This is true even when I put the yearly ROI at or below the interest rate on the mortgage. 

As an extra question, what's a safe assumption for annual ROI for a conservative-to-moderate risk Vanguard mutual fund portfolio? 3-5%?

personalfinance,Want to pull the trigger on buying a house. Are we ready?,"My SO and I are getting married soon and want to buy a house soon after.  Not looking for anything too fancy, but we do want a little more room to grow than we have in our current place, a little yard for our dog, and a more convenient location to our jobs.  With interest rates being so low and being in a stable financial position (I think), we figure now is a good time to get in the market and start building equity.  We are going to be staying in this house for at least 5 years, probably more like 10.  From everything I've read, it seems like we're ready but we're still a little nervous!  You guys are the experts, so are we ready?

The numbers:

Combined income: $127,000/year + $8,000 bonus

401k: $32,000 (currently contributing 5% for full employer match)

Roth IRA 1: $6,500 (contributing monthly to max out for 2017)

Roth IRA 2: $17,000 (also maxing out for 2017)

So currently we are contributing 15% toward retirement if you include the employer match, but we would like to try to max out the 401k after we buy and no longer have to be pouring money into cash savings.  There is also a pension but we don't really factor that in.

Cash savings: $42,000 (currently saving $1,500/mo)

Car loan 1: $6,000 remaining, 2% interest.  $160/mo payment.

Car loan 2: $10,000 remaining, 2% interest.  $240/mo payment.

No other debt.

Our take-home is about $7000/mo, and our expenses ( including rent) add up to around $4000/mo.  Currently spend $1450/mo on rent.  We would like to spend no more than $225,000 on the house.  We are thinking we would rather do a 30-year mortgage and focus on investing, but still considering a 15-year instead.

What do you think?  We'd like to be able to buy in the next few months, as our lease is up in June.",finance
personalfinance,Should I push to get my degree in 1 year or wait and finish in two?,"First, the background:

I am 25 years old.  I have been doing college on and off for the better part of the last 7 years.  I have one private student loan of $26032.84 at 6.79% and another private of $10437.77 at 8.24%.  I also just got about $10k in federal student loans, about $4.5k subsidized and $5.5k unsubsidized both around 4.5% for this past semester.  All of the loans are in deferment until I am no longer in school.  I am also eligible for work study.

My expenses are $125/month car insurance but my car is paid off, $650/month rent and utilities, ~$100/month in gas, and about $300/month in food.

My current job is paying $12.50/hour and scheduling me about 34 hours/week right now, though that will go up to 40/week in a week.  I'm in Florida so there's no state income tax.

I have $2600 in an emergency fund and I have my accounts set to add $50 from my paycheck every other week to it.  I also have another $2600 in my checking and about $1900 in another couple savings accounts that I'd really rather not touch unless it is an absolute emergency.

My school approves a little more than $10k/semester for financial aid in the form of grants, scholarships and loans.  I qualify for Pell grants and my EFC is 4477 so I get a little more than $600/semester from that and around $10k/year from federal student loans.

Currently I am 15 classes away from my bachelor's degree in Political Science with a minor in Management.  I also have an Associate's in Social Work.  My school is odd (for me at least) in that there is no set charge for a ""full time"" student.  Full time is at least 12 credits, but the school charges per credit no matter the amount, where the last school I went to charged one amount for 15 credits or more and anything more than 15 were essentially free.  The cost for me per credit hour is $203.94/credit hour.

Now for the actual situation.

Because of the way the classes line up, I have the ability to take one class this summer, seven this fall, and seven this spring and graduate with my bachelor's.  I would have to cut down to a part time job, likely a work study one if I can get one, and I would probably have to take out more loans than just the federal ones.  But I think that economically, it is the right move.  I would be in more debt sooner, but I would have my degree quicker and be able to join the full workforce where I will be able to make significantly more money than I do now and I would be able to work a wider variety of jobs since I wouldn't have to say ""oh, but I can't work these days or times because I have school"".  But I am having trouble actually figuring out the math myself.

Besides finishing in two more semesters, I also have the potential of pushing it to three, graduating after fall 2018, and being accepted to an accelerated master's program so that by fall 2019 I'd have a bachelor's and an MPA.  This would lead to me only needing to take 4-5 classes per semester and get two degrees in 2.5 years from now, but I don't know if I would be able to keep a full time job because of how the classes are scheduled.  Or I could just take the full two years and not go for my MPA, continue working full time, and not need to take extra student loans besides the federal ones.

But I don't know which to do.

Also note:  Regardless as to whether I get my MPA or not, I plan on going to law school after I pay down some/all of this debt.

-----

TL;DR:

Should I take two years to do 15 classes and work full time, take 1.5 years to do 15 classes and potentially work full time and probably be able to do an accelerated MPA program to give me a master's in 2.5 years, or should I take 1 year for 15 classes, work part time, and get in the workforce sooner?",finance

personalfinance,Thanks for the motivation to pay off my debt!,"Wanted to take a moment to thank everyone in here for the motivation to get serious about paying off my debts and making my way toward a debt free life! I'm 27, and finished school with about 17K in student loans. Not a lot by today's standards, but coming out of school with a 35K annual salary, it felt insurmountable. For several years I was barely making the minimum payments, and struggling to make ends meet around that. 

After visiting this sub routinely, I was inspired by many others in similar situations to get serious about getting rid of my debt and making my way toward debt free living. Also a podcast called ""The Minimalists"" was another great inspiration if anyone is looking for something to get them going that can be binge-listened during their commute. 

[Here's a snapshot] (http://i.imgur.com/yuhSY5D.jpg) of one of my 4 loans which began at about 5K. This is a great one to show the progress because in the beginning you can see the meager payments I was making before I realized how much I was losing to interest by prolonging this loan. Things really kicked into high gear when I did the math and I decided to cash out some company stocks I'd been buying through a 15% discount employee stock purchase plan for the past year. I'd also been contributing 5% of my income to those purchases, and realized that while I was getting a very reasonable rate of return on that money (between the discount and the stock price increasing) I was losing slightly more to interest, so I stopped those contributions, cashed out the stocks which were available (must hold for 1 year) and dumped all of that money into one of my four loans. 

From there I got serious with my budget, downloading the ""EveryDollar"" app and logging every single purchase to see where my money was going. My GF is already debt free, but is 100% on board for saving for our future and living frugally in the meantime, so that's a huge help. 

I'm now only 2 months into this serious push, and have already knocked out my smallest (2.3K) and highest interest rate (6.8%) loan by putting my entire tax refund into it. That left me with only my other 3 loans each at 5K and 6.55% interest. One of those three is the one you see in the picture, so it's down to only 2 loans and $10,654.72 total. Both these loans have the same interest rate, so I'm going to make minimum payments on both but aggressively pay down one of them. I can contribute roughly 1K or more per month to these loans, so I will be debt free in less than one year's time and I couldn't be more excited about it. 

Thanks again for the motivation, and if you're in my shoes, keep it up, you can make it happen too!",finance
personalfinance,Small Business questions?,"Hello everybody,

So, in conjunction with a post I wrote a few weeks back about budgeting, one of the main criticisms was that I needed more income; in an effort to fix this I've been looking into side-gigs. 

One of the more interesting side gigs I've found has been narrating jobs for audiobooks-- the industry has been growing rapidly and the demand for this kind of thing is just surreal. I have the proper equipment already to make this work and know I can produce quality audio to facilitate this enterprise.

I've signed up for a few companies, the most notable being ACX (the publishing company behind Audible). When I get home from work I'll be setting up a work-shop inside my house, building/sound-proofing my work-space and also creating a portfolio of work for samples. This was my plan for today, but I hit a snag I didn't exactly expect while signing up for ACX. They're wanting me to provide a Federal Tax ID (I know in some cases you can provide your SS number), but It got me wondering: is there a benefit into filing a sole LLC in this case with my state (Kentucky)? Or is another type of business filing more beneficial in this case?

Needless to say I'm excited for this potential venture, but I want to make sure I'm not missing critical information that will end up screwing me down the line. I'll be researching this topic throughout the day while I'm at work to familiarize myself with what I can expect, but personal experience/advice from the wiser on this thread could go a long way to saving my proverbial bacon.

**TL:DR** - I'm going to try to be an audiobook narrator; should I file for a business license with my state (Kentucky)? What pit-falls can I expect by being a contractor?",finance

personalfinance,Is 20% really the optimal down payment on a home?,"Now, I know the r/personalfinance general standard is a 20% down payment. However, is that really the financially optimal choice for prospective home owners?

Consider the following scenario. Family X spends $1,600/mo in rent (a modest 2 br apartment in my area) and saves $1,000/mo towards a down payment on a home (assume a healthy emergency fund but $0 in savings for a down payment). It would take this family 5 years to save for a 20% down payment on a $300K home (this would be for a modest 2-3 br townhouse in my area). By the time they have $60K saved up, they have paid $96,000 in rent (assuming their rental costs haven't gone up, which is highly unlikely).

Now consider Family Y. Same rent and savings situation. However, they only save for a 10% down payment. That means they've only paid $48,000 in rent by the time they buy. Additionally, let's say Family Y really hates PMI, so it continues to spend the extra $1,000/mo. it was saving for the down payment for another 30 months on top of their normal mortgage payment.

Now, let's look at their mortgages. By the time Family X has saved up enough for the 20% down payment, Family Y has been paying their mortgage for 2.5 years. At that point, Family X's loan balance will be approximately $240,000 with no interest paid. Family Y will have a loan balance of $229,984 (given a 4.5% interest rate) with a total paid interest of $26,465 to date.

On net, Family Y is ahead of X financially by $24,193.50 (Paid interest - difference in equity - 2.5 years of rental payments + 0.981% annual property tax rate = difference between X and Y financial standing). Obviously, that number doesn't include PMI, but there's no way Family Y spends more than $3K in PMI before they hit the 20% equity threshold, still leaving them significantly ahead of Family X. 

I know I've been overly simplistic in my calculations, but I think I've been pretty conservative. I also haven't factored in rising rental costs, which have consistently gone up 2-3% every year in my area. So, all else equal, wouldn't it make more financial sense to save for a 10% down payment over 20%? What is the optimal down payment? (I just pulled 10% out of  a hat as an example.) What am I missing here?",finance

personalfinance,217k in Debt - Have been making minimum payments since november - Debating on Snowball vs avalanche method.,"Hello all I was looking for some repayment advice and I will try to be brief and not inundate you with needless information. I am currently in repayment on some federal school loans. I am currently in the hole for 217k but have been making steady payments of $2,500 monthly and on automatic payments since I was making just enough to cover the loans.

I am making very aggressive payments for the time being (10 year plan). I plan to continue to pay about $4,500 to $5,000 monthly for the next 2-3 years ($2,500 monthly + $2,500 extra principal payment). I don't have any expenses for any foreseeable future other than a 60 dollar cell phone bill. My car is paid off, and insurance for the year all paid in full. I live, eat and sleep at home and my work pays for my gas, so zero cost to me there. Credit card bill is paid in full every month, if I splurge hard then balance is about $800 a month. I'm projected to make 130k a year, however it can possibly drop because in the winter months I am at least a guaranteed 24 hours a week (per our union contract). Weekly take home is about $1,600 to $1,800 a week post tax on a 40h workweek. Current emergency fund is about ~$20,000.

I am debating between doing an avalanche method or snowball method, or maybe a hybrid?
I currently have 7 open loans open. The principal amount ranges from 43k to 29k and interest from 5.1% to 6.5%. 
[ http://imgur.com/40jh8Tz ]
I am currently tempted to pay tackle the 11k loan @ 6.5% for a snowball approach.
However is it mathematically more sensible and advantageous to pay the 26k @ 6.5% first?

Also is it more advantageous to pay the paying the 42k @ 5.1% versus 26k @ 6.5% versus? My reasoning is that the larger principal on the 42k despite it being a lower interest rate actually accumulates faster.

I am just not sure if there is enough benefit associated with it since I imagine the end interest rate is going to be skewed heavily to be closer to the 5.96% and 6.55%

personalfinance,Pension savings in the US for Europeans living in the US before moving back to Europe.,"Hi, 

The backstory as short as possible: Me and my SO moved to the US from Southern Europe ~1 year ago. She was born in the US, and as a result is an American citizen. We're both in our late 20s. We are both working full-time, and we're currently making ~$35-40k after taxes each. In 6-7 years she will probably make around $250k and I will make around $100-250k. While it is hard to plan for the future, it currently looks like we will stay in the US approximately 10 years, and then move back to Europe. 

In our home country we have relatively generous social welfare programs and pension systems (think France)  but as we are now working in the US we don't get ""pension points"", and we therefore need to save for retirement. Her employer does not match any pension contributions until she graduates (in 5 years). 

To summarize our/her financial situation:

* Not married, likely to get married in the 1-2 years.
* Not looking at buying real estate in the next 5 years, possibly thereafter.
* We have no outstanding debt (student debts paid down, bought car cash etc.)
* She will make around $250k yearly in 7 years, currently makes around $35k after taxes
* She has around $40k invested in a high-interest savings account in her home country
* She has roughly $20k in a ~0% interest rate savings account in the US
* Her employers offers 403(b) without matching.
* She can/will save $3-10k yearly


I'll add my situation too, to give a complete picture:

* I'm likely to make $100-250k a year in five years
* I have ~$30k USD invested in a high-interest savings account, that can only be used for real estate purchases, in my home country.
* I have around $10k in a 0% savings account in the US.
* I make around $40k USD after taxes. My employer offers no matching or 401k plans, but I can also invest in a 403(b).
* Only $15k of my income is from the US, the rest is a government stipend I receive from home.
* I will save around $3-10k yearly.

Now, the ""complications"" are that 1) She's an American citizen while I'm not and 2) that we plan to move back to Europe in the future. We plan to meet with an financial advisor in the near future, but I would like to get your input on recommendations and legalities before I meet with him/her. I am willing to take higher risk than her. 

What I am most confused about is the whole tax-deductible/pre-tax/tax-defered and so on thing going on in the US and finally whether we can withdraw money in a 403(b) or Roth IRA later without any penalty to move them to Europe or when we retire. Finally, do we/she/I invest in the 403(b), Roth IRA or just buy a stock index fund (or other options!). I think we would both like to invest in the US as a hedge against our country going to shit in the future.

Thanks for any input and advice. The whole legal/institutional framework is quite different and confusing to me.

personalfinance,Unauthorized Credit Card Payments + RPAYE Mishaps + Identity Theft,"So I was late getting my PAYE info in, not remembering it was something I had to do annually.  Last month, I got billed $2.8k for the month for my student loan payment.  When I called FedLoan, they informed me that I needed to be put on IBR.  I filled out the paperwork and they began the IBR process.

They recommended I call the bank and tell them it was an unauthorized transaction (which worked and I got the money refunded) and that they would cancel the payment and put me on forbarence.  They did.  Meanwhile, my IBR was NOT set to the lowest payment type and I noticed it was set for $829.00/month when the studentloan.gov (using my exact loans) projected that number to be around $525.00.

I called back and they informed me that I selected the wrong repayment plan (looking back, I didn't I said I wanted to pay the least I could per month).  So I resubmitted the paperwork requesting (for sure this time) that I be placed on the lowest possible payment plan.

Apparently, resubmitting the paperwork immediately took me off forebarance and I was, again, hit with another $2.8k payment this month (thanks to r/PF I have a good emergency fund saved up so no harm there).  When I talked to a lady, she said the 2.8k was still pending and she could cancel it (it was never cancelled).  I also said that my payment still showed the $800 odd dollars that didn't reflect a RPAYE payment.  She said she would place my case in 'review' that the payment could actually be lower.

**TL;DR Thus Far - There is still a $2.8k payment I need to have cancelled or unauthorized and curious if any reason to suspect foul play or something given some of the shady stuff these loan companies have been attempting to do.  I would check your FedLoan payment is actually the lowest it can be.**

So my profession was hit with a nation wide information leak/hack and all of our identities were stolen.  There was a huge ring of fraudulent credit cards being opened, gift cards, whatever... you name it.  These seem to be ongoing issues that have not been resolved as nobody has claimed responsibility for the hack (not sure how an entire professions' information can be stolen, but it was).

I had never had to call and refute a charge on my credit card before this year.  I was overcharged at a bar and called and said I got charged for 5 drinks when I only got 2 (this was true).  I don't know the outcome of that.  Last month, they requested that I call and say the payment that was made was unauthorized.  I got the payment back, but now they are asking me to do it again.

**TLDR:  If someone opens fraudulent credit cards and stuff in my name, does it look shady now that I will have said there were unauthorized payments made 3 times in the same year?  Is there any chance that the bank won't believe that my credit identity was actually stolen if I've claimed all these unauthorized payments?**",finance

personalfinance,Does it make more sense to increase our 401(k) contribution or pay down debt?,"Does it make more sense to increase our 401(k) contributions beyond what our employers match, pay down our debt, or increase our savings/emergency fund?

- Mortgage - ~$86K balance (2.69%)
- Home Equity LOC - ~$24K balance (3.99%)
- Student Loan - ~$25K balance (5.125%)

We max out our IRAs every year and have ~$30K in a savings account.

We are currently contributing up to the employer match in each of our 401(k)s.

personalfinance,"Tax punishment for married young adults, 2017 edition. Is the Roth IRA backdoor an option?","Looks like it's been a year since the [last time this came up](https://np.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3a6h94/the_student_loan_problem_for_employees_working_in/). 

The short version is this, there are tax penalties for being married and filing taxes separately that are particularly punishing to Millennials:

* Banned from claiming the student loan interest deduction
* Banned from participating Roth IRA (without paying a penalty)

However, there is also a penalty for filing jointly: higher monthly payments on income-driven federal student loan repayment plans. 

This was really disappointing to learn this as I've been following the basic guides from this sub and was excited to start a Roth IRA to help save for a down payment for a home when we finish paying off our loans in 5 years. 

I earn slightly more and am overpaying my loans on a standard plan to finish at a target date. My wife is working towards public service loan forgiveness on the IBR plan. Filing jointly, her payments would increase by $600 / year (on the REPAYE plan). 

I've read about the Roth IRA back door as an option high earners use to participate in Roth retirement savings - does anyone have experience with this as an option for separate married filers?",finance

I have $36k total in loans. $21k from Company A, $15k from Company B. I have 8 separate loans from Company A with an average interest rate of 4.1%. With Company B, I have 2 loans both at 9.6% interest rate. Is there any way of closing out the Company B loans without having to consolidate?

I'm graduating from university this June and I accepted a position with a large, well-established company in my state. My compensation is as follows:

**Salary:** $89,000

**Equity:** $3,000 vesting over five years

**Bonus:** Up to 20% performance based bonus.

**Benefits:** Full Medical, Dental, 3 weeks paid vacation, etc.

I'll be renting a home with four other people and I don't expect my rent and utilities to exceed $900. Obviously, I plan to max my IRA contributions each month and whatnot, but I'm not really sure how to handle my debt...

I have just over $105k in student debt. Roughly $25k from Stafford loans and just about $80k from Parent Plus. Each set of loans has a variety of interest rates, ranging from as much as 7.21% APR on ~$23k to just 3.76% on ~$5k. Unfortunately, I'll also be adding about $5000 more when my last tuition payment is due in April. 

What's more, I need a car for commuting to work when I start in September. I've got just over $13k in cash that I planned to use as capital for a car as well as living basic expenses until I start my job. 

I have a decent grasp on investing, but I'm not exactly a Wall Street Veteran. I've been able to earn roughly the market rate (S&amp;P) through a few vangaurd ETFs as well as a couple ""just for fun"" stock picks. 

In addition, my parents have offered to make the minimum payment on my Parent Plus (the one for $80k) loan for one year. 

So my question for you esteemed folks is; how quickly do I pay down my debt? Do I make minimum payments, invest what I would have spent on a larger payment and make some money on the interest delta, or some sort of hybrid approach? What route yields the highest NPV for me?

Side note: I'm relatively frugal, but cars are my passion...and my shameful weakness Talking myself out of a nice car has been relatively difficult.",finance

401k: $185,000
401k contributions: $36,000/year

First, let me say that we are aggressively paying down our consumer debt and expect to be debt free (except for student loans) within a year. Also, we have a 15 year old and a one year old.

My wife and I are 34 and 31, respectively, and are both public interest attorneys with a bunch of student loan debt. All of our loans are federal loans and we are currently on income-based repayment. My wife's law school pays her loans because she does public interest work so the loan payment above is just mine. 

We have been working towards the 10 year public interest loan forgiveness program. I have four more years and my wife has seven more. Because we are counting on our loans being forgiven, we have been making the minimum payments and instead shoveling money into retirement. We've managed to save almost 200k in just five years. By the time our loans are forgiven (seven years for my wife) we should have almost 700k in the bank. 

We know that the common wisdom is to aggressively pay off student loans but that does not seem like the best way to maximize our financial position. Even if the public interest forgiveness disappeared (which is highly unlikely that it would affect borrowers retroactively) and we had to pay for 20 years, we will have paid $288,000 (just over half what we owe) and will have saved over $2.5 million for retirement. So are we crazy for not prioritizing paying off our student loans?",finance
personalfinance,I'd like to get help to fix my credit please.,"Hi guys,

Obviously using a throwaway account since I am absolutely embarrassed and mortified at my past behavior that put me in the situation I am today. I just wanted to see what I need to do accordingly so I don't mess my credit up again in the future, with your help if you would be so kind in pointing the direction for me. 

I'm currently 26 yo, and I admit I made a huge mistake. I'm still attending school for my bachelor and this fall will be my last semester. I want to start fresh as soon as I'm done with school and not be bombarded with more financial woes than I already have now. Back in 2012, I had a couple of CC's (Chase, Capital one, AMEX, Discover, prosper) and I think my total limit was upwards of 20k. I was careful in the beginning when it comes to managing my CC's, but due to a job loss (I'm hearing impaired so keeping a stable job is really not easy for me), and combined with more family problems that ended up in me being kicked out all of sudden, leaving me jobless, homeless and no money. I was also still paying my school tuition so I had to rely on my CC's a lot and I ended up maxing out all of them. 

Fast forward to today, a lot of my credit cards balances are in the possession of different debt collectors and I've been kind of ignoring them. My credit score is 520 and I am also deathly afraid of getting arrested and going to jail if I keep ignoring them and I don't know what to do anymore. 

My family have agreed to let me back in the house while I finish school, and to move out by next year. I currently work part time making little money (800/mo), have 3k coming in from tax refund, and I may have other jobs lined up for me. I also discovered that last fall I was able to get federal student loans (2% interest) and I'm seriously thinking of taking out student loans so I can pay all my CC debts that are spread out with different debt collectors so that way I only have to focus on paying one thing and not several things. I'm also lucky that Discover didn't close my CC or reduce my limit either so I still have 6k limit with them, and current balance is 5k. 
I am also in NYC.

This is my rock bottom, and I have decided I need to grow up, own my mistakes and get help. All of your help, input, and advice are more than appreciated. Thank you so much.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off home early - Interest Rate in Home vs Investment Returns,"So is it me, or is the “mortgage rate” grossly conflated with “interest rate”?  To me, interest rate reflects how much extra I pay after I have paid back a loan.  Let’s say my home loan is $300k, and my interest rate is 3%.  To stupid non-financial thinking me, that implies something like I’ll pay 3% on top of the $300k.  Obviously, that’s not true, since we know its compounded monthly.  I’ll end up paying 455,331.6 in that scenario.    However, when people talk about paying off their homes, I feel they compare the 3% interest rate TO STOCK MARKET RETURNS and say something like, “Well I can average 7% returns, so why would I pay 3% early?”  Is it me, or are those two things completely different??  Just google average stock market return and you'll see what I mean. The stock market / index fund / investment returns are annual right??  I just feel like that mortgage rate gets hidden as far as how bad it is, when people talk about how they can use that money and invest it elsewhere.  Am I right, or am I missing something??  Am I right about how the historical stock market returns of 7 or so are NOT the same mathematical concept as the interest rate on a mortgage?",finance
personalfinance,Refi to pay off school loans?,"We have a house that has a good amount of equity available (about $300k).  We also have some school loans that total about $98k.  The school loans have a 6.8% interest rate.  I understand that because they are a federal loan there are protections that I get from that loan (deferment, etc.).

Now straight math tells me that 4.X% (current home loan interest rates) is less than 6.8%.  For this situation, let us forget about the extra benefits of having the government backed school loan.  Current home loan rate is 3.875%.

I was talking with someone who told me that you are only allowed to take a certain amount of equity cash out from a refi and spend it on something before you are no longer allowed to claim the mortgage interest as a deduction on your taxes.  However he could not explain the math to me and tell me just how much I would actually be allowed to take out and still make the mortgage interest deduction.  

Can anyone point me in the right direction or tell me if my friend is correct in his assessment?  Is it worth it to refi and pull the money out to pay off the school loan?  

I'm leaning toward yes if we get to keep the mortgage interest deduction as it saves us money overall.  If anything catastophic happened and we used up our emergency fund before getting back up I would sell.  Since I am figuring we would still have the equity we are coming out ahead (don't want to get into housing bubble semantics here) if we had to sell.  Right way to look at it?",finance

investing,Southern Ontario housing bubble and Interest Rates,"To those who are not familiar, in the Toronto area, but also the majority of Southern Ontario (from your friends up in Canada), the housing market has had an extreme shift. In a matter of a year (January 2016 to 2017) houses have gone up in price an average of 25%(give or take). In every month after this past January, prices have increased steadily compared to the previous year (I believe Feb2016-2017 increased about 28%), and although it is only March, seeing how things are, I still believe the market is strong and increasing. 

Although many will have their own opinions on the issue, one of the undisputed facts (that I can definitively say is valid since I have seen factual documents from the Real Estate Board), is that there is a shortage of houses, combined with an increased demand for houses (rather than a subsequent demand). By this, I mean that not only is the demand increasing because of the shortage, but on average, more people are looking to buy houses. 

Further, interests rates are very low (around 2%), and the Canadian dollar is very low as well (which may prompt foreign buyers??). However, foreign buyers don not make up the majority of buyers in the market (despite what a Foreign Buyers Tax implies). Realistically, foreign buyers make up approximately 5% of the transactions in Ontario anyway, however that is besides my point. 

My main question, is that if interest rates are increased arbitrarily (to 5%, 10%, or a more normal number) how may that affect the housing market? Would it be corrected to more realistic or previously seen home prices? Go below that? Or stay the same because of demand? An important fact to consider is that houses that are really only worth 750k, are going for between 1-1.5 million dollars, so does the low interest rate really make it more affordable if houses are going for way more than the asking price?

Also, this is a very extreme example of a bull market, however in a bull market where prices are increasing upwards of 20% a year (on the low end), how sustainable can that be? Because this is only the first couple of months of seeing this, could it last a few years, where houses in 2020 would be worth over 200%(as an example) compared to 2016? 

I know this may not be the correct place to ask this, but I know there are many intellectuals on this subreddit who may have some more insight or knowledge pertaining to this issue. I appreciate all thoughtful and considerate replies.",finance

Of course, I also spend variable amounts of money every month on gas and food. 

I got a Discover It card in September of 2016. I've been using it for smaller expenses and have been making all of my payments on time. I currently have $180 in debt on the credit card. This is my only debt as well. 

I also have $1,000 in cash saved up. 

What's the next logical step for me? Should I be doing something to take advantage of my initially high credit score? Or am I just overthinking this too much and this credit score doesn't really mean anything?

Also, the current interest rate on my credit card is 24%. It's extremely high, but I figure that it's quote normal for someone my age to have an interest rate that high. Since I have a good credit history now, is there a way I can get Discover to lower the interest rate on my card?",finance

personalfinance,My Life in Money – 5 Years of Spending Data Visualized and Analyzed,"All,

&amp;nbsp;

Periodically, my wife and I sit down and review our budget and spending. We’ve kept very comprehensive records in Quicken since July of 2012. During that time, we’ve gone through several major life changes (moved, rented an apartment, bought a house, and had 2 kids). I thought it would be fun (I know, I’m a nerd) to export every recorded transaction (almost 3,300) since that time and analyze them. This post contains a summary of that analysis. I hope you find it useful and informative!

&amp;nbsp;

**Introduction and Assumptions**


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This is a scary post to write – I’m listing out the good, the bad, and the stupid choices we’ve made over the past few years. Ultimately, I decided to write it because it was informative to me and I hope some will find value in it as well – how often do you truly get to see someone else’s detailed spending analyzed? Please keep in mind that I’m not trying to say anyone should mirror our decisions.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; One thing this exercise showed me is that it is very difficult to understand and classify spending. Even with very good records, there is still lots of room for interpretation (is a down payment on a house spending? [I decided no]) While I haven’t hidden anything, some numbers have been rounded in the interest of some degree of anonymity. The changes are very small and don’t impact the analysis in any meaningful way.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Please keep in mind that this is simply a reflection of our lives and values as seen through the lens of our spending habits – it is what works for us. It may not work for you; however, I do believe that if you read this post carefully, you will come away with some things to think about concerning your own finances.


Some specific assumptions that may be of interest:

* This post only covers expenses. While income is an important part of personal finance, our situation is fairly unique and likely not worth analyzing. My wife stays at home with our children and I am pursuing a graduate degree. Thus, our income is relatively low and extremely variable. This was an intentional choice on our part – we lived as very frugal DINKs for several years after college so that we could pursue this path without going into debt. Realistically, we have operated at a fairly substantial net loss every year for the past several years. Thankfully, I’m approaching graduation and have already secured a great job that will more than provide for us and allow us to rebuild our savings quickly.

* This post doesn’t count investments as expenses. In general, we fund Roth IRA’s to the maximum extent permitted by our earned income for the year and fund our children’s 529 plans based on Vanguard’s [cost of college estimator]( https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/college/tools) and saving enough to cover 100% of 4 years at a public university. Parents on both sides of the family cover approximately half of this cost and we contribute the other half from money that we set aside before starting down this path.

* We don’t have car payments. We both drive the same pre-2000 model cars that we were given in high school/early college. As a result of the low value of these cars, we only carry liability and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage but not comprehensive or collision coverage. We’ve built our emergency fund assuming that we may need to quickly replace at least one vehicle (i.e. enough for at least 1 new car or 2 nice used cars).

* I mentioned that I am pursuing a graduate degree. Most of the direct expenses associated with this are covered in full through a scholarship program. In general, I exclude the uncovered expenses from analysis but I include them in some of the detailed analyses/tables.

&amp;nbsp;

**The TL;DR – A Condensed Look**


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [Here](http://imgur.com/HCXXKbg) is a graphical depiction of our average monthly spending over the past 5 years.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; We spend about $3,800 a month. About $1,125 (30%) of this is housing (mortgage + repairs/other expenses), $650 (17%) is gifts/charity (see more on this below), $625 (15%) is medical expenses, $400 (11%) is utilities (TV, internet, electricity, gas, and water), $300 (8%) is food, $250 (6%) is car related, and $450 (14%) is everything else.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; My gut tells me most people likely spend more on housing than we do, especially if they buy (we’re in a new 1,800 sqft house in a fairly low cost of living area), much less on gifts/charity, less on medical expenses, less on utilities, more on food, and more on cars.

&amp;nbsp;

**Biggest Expenses by Category**


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; One thing I found interesting was to look at the biggest non-recurring expenses by category. I arbitrarily pulled the two largest non-recurring expenses by major category and researched them further. Here they are (rounded):

Other | $425 | Uhaul
Other | $250 | House decorations (probably should be reclassified)
Baby | $225 | Crib
Baby | $150 | Car Seat

&amp;nbsp;

**Detailed Spending Categories**


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; While the initial graph is nice, I also found a more detailed view of our average monthly spending, including on education (non-reimbursed graduate school expenses), to be interesting. There are too many categories to make a neat pie graph, but here it is in table form:

Category | Monthly Amount | Percentage | Comments
--------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------

Groceries | $236 | 6% | Mostly purchased from Wal-Mart/Sam’s
Education | $213 | 5% | Expenses not reimbursed by school
Luxuries | $185 | 5% | Mostly large, “one-time” purchases

Utilities (Trash) | $10 | &lt;1% | 1x/week, no recycle
Personal Care | $4 | &lt;1% | Wife cuts my hair

&amp;nbsp;

**On Specific Categories**


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In this section, I briefly discuss some of the things that I think are most interesting about our budget.

*Housing* - a wise man once said, “Rent represents the most you will spend on your house; a mortgage represents the least.” Our house is fairly new (built in 2010) and so we have avoided most major repairs. Our only problem has been with our AC – we’ve spent $800 in diagnostics and repairs since we purchased our house in 2013. Our mortgage payment goes up by about 2% a year based on escrowed taxes and insurance.

*Charity* - we personally believe in donating 10-20% of our pre-tax income to charity every year. What counts as income for this calculation is difficult to determine and beyond the scope of this post. In general, about half of our giving goes to our church and the other half to worthy organizations around the world. One of our favorite traditions is to “sponsor a child” born on the same day as each of our children.

*Medical* - We purchase health insurance through the marketplace. Plans have increased in cost substantially over the past several years. Between a chronic illness for my wife requiring expensive medication and the birth of two children, our medical expenses are high. One thing we do to cut costs in this area is to aggressively negotiate every medical bill we receive. We can usually obtain a discount of 25-30% (above and beyond the amount insurance pays for and adjusts). If you aren’t negotiating hospital bills, etc…you are probably leaving money on the table!

*Auto* - As I mentioned previously, both our cars are old, paid off, pieces of sh*t. One thing I see all the time is people justifying buying a new car based on the price of repairs. While we have certainly been lucky, we’ve only spent about $2,300 for two cars over about 5 years (this is only repairs, not normal maintenance like oil changes and tires). Basically, this means that each of our cars needs something fixed about every other year (although when it rains, it pours – mine has racked up 2 repairs totaling about $750 so far this year!).

One nice benefit to having old cars is that our insurance is about $60 a month for both cars (liability + uninsured motorist only; policy limits ~250k).

*Groceries* - If you are still reading, you must find this at least somewhat interesting so I hope you will indulge a brief soapbox from me. **People spend too much on food!**. Our $250/month spending buys tons of raw ingredients from Wal-Mart (the horror!) and we eat delicious home-cooked meals every week. Seriously, I see so many people with ridiculous grocery bills – learn to cook and it can really pay off (hat tip to my wife on this one).

*Luxuries* - This is a lazy category for big purchases. Treadmill, digital camera, iPad…we like some toys. If we needed to cut, this would be target number 1. One word of caution – we can be penny-wise and pound-foolish. Pay full price for a $50 medical bill? No Way! Drop $2,000 on a treadmill – come on, really? No way did we need anything near as nice as what we got. $3,500 in furniture – sure, we got great stuff (La-z-Boy), but we went overboard. Our biggest financial “mistakes” over the past several years are in this category. I don’t want to be too hard on us though – at some point, you just decide something is worth it and buy it and I personally believe we can afford to have a little more fun than we do.

*Phone* - I get an employer discount and regular promotional rates. LPT – make a list of your recurring expenses (especially phone, tv, internet, etc… - anything where you might get a promotional offer). Once a week or so, on your drive to work (safely) call a different provider and negotiate a break. Try for a recurring discount, but settle for a one-time credit as well.

*Vacation* - We usually drive, but occasionally fly. With small kids, international travel is out of the picture for now.

*Utilities* - Bonus LPT here – monitor your useage month to month and month versus year ago. If you see a spike, find out why. We threw away a couple hundred bucks in electricity on a bad AC system before we figured this out – the early warning signs were in the data.

*Dining* - Everyone knows a classic budget killer is going out to eat. We do a date night once or twice a month and I occasionally have lunch with friends. Just decide what is right for you and know that it adds up quickly.

*Baby* - This was lower than I expected. Our big one-time expenses have been a crib ($250), baby monitor and cameras ($200), car seats ($150 and $125), and breastfeeding expenses [pump, bottles, bags, etc…] ($250). We’ve spent about $800 on lifetime diapers (2.5 year old and 6 month old, so $22 per baby-month). Target periodically does a great deal on Parent’s Choice diapers (gift card back with a bulk purchase) so we just stock up when it is available. Our average cost per diaper is about $0.14.

&amp;nbsp;

**Payment Method**


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Our spending is split with about 60% of all expenses coming from our checking account and 40% coming from our credit card. I thought we used a credit card for everything but most major bills (mortgage, etc…) come from our checking account. Similarly, this split is influenced by the fact that we generally don’t use credit cards for charitable giving because we don’t want the receiving organization to have to pay the 2-3% processing fee just so we can get 1% cash back.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lifestyle Inflation**


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; One thing that interested me was whether or not we inflated our lifestyle. Keeping only full years of data (2013-2016), I calculated our [total spending by month](http://imgur.com/gU5FZeQ). Can you tell when Christmas is? This past December was especially high – health care premiums went up more than 30%, hospital bills for kid number 2 were settled, and general Christmas giving was in full force. We also pay 6 months of auto insurance at a time (yeah discounts!) which adds volatility to the graph. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Anyway, this trend is a little muddled so I calculated the percentage increase by year and included inflation based on the CPI for comparison:

2014 versus 2013: 1.5% increase (1.62% CPI)
2015 versus 2014: 2.3% increase (0.12% CPI)
2016 versus 2015: 10.9% increase (2.62% CPI)

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I don’t yet fully know what happened in 2016. Some if it is discussed above. We did also consciously (as in, sat down and discussed in advance) decide to live a little more loosely last year. Health insurance kicked us in the teeth a little bit. Charitable giving was up even for us.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion**


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I would be remiss if I didn’t point out that we are only where we are today because we have been extremely lucky and blessed. I fully believe that success requires luck, hard work, and skill. Both our parents saved the full cost of an undergraduate degree for us so we’ve never had a dollar of student loans. I was able to save all of their gift, though, since I earned (largely via National Merit) a full ride plus generous living expenses for undergraduate work and actually ended up with a master’s in four years (thank you AP) on the college’s dime. We got great jobs at a time when the economy was crashing and stuffed significant savings into retirement and other investments when markets were tanking. There is no question that we’ve been dealt some unfair advantages in life. That said, we’ve ground a lot out of those advantages to get us where we are today. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Anyway, I hope you found this interesting and informative. More than anything, I hope it inspires you to look at your spending habits (and develop a budget if you don’t have one). If there is one data point in here that motivates someone to go “huh, I bet we can cut down on X” then I will consider this post a success.

personalfinance,Paying off my US student loan from Canada with a bad exchange rate- what's my best option?,"I have a bit of a unique situation when it comes to paying off my student loan.

However, My fiancé is in med school and has access to a large line of credit with a 2% interest rate. Our original plan was to use the line of credit to pay off my student loans all at once in order to combine our loans and lower the interest rate, then continue making payments to the line of credit to pay it off as quickly as possible and minimize accrued interest. 

However, the exchange rate between USD and CAD right now is terrible. If I were to pay off my loans using Canadian dollars, my $60,000 loan would become $80,000 overnight. 

My question is, would this be worth it in the long run to save interest? Or should I just be paying as much as I can month to month until the exchange evens out? Or pay minimum payments as long as possible until the exchange evens out enough to make it worthwhile?

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice on strategy it would be greatly appreciated- thanks!",finance

However, my wife just started a better paying position, and we now we will make more than we originally calculated and are above the allowed AGI.

We went to Vanguard to withdraw the contributions, but the $960.00 we have put into the Roth ""uninvested"" has made us $0.44 in profit. How do I best remove this now?

The problem is, I dont think $960 is enough to really invest in for original investment contribution, and dont want to sit on a Vanguard account for life for such a small amount of money; therefore, preferably I'd like to just refund it. I just dont want to have problems come next years taxes. . .

investing,Can someone explain to me in 5th Grade terms the zero-interest rate situation?,"[This chart](http://www.macrotrends.net/1433/historical-libor-rates-chart) shows the LIBOR rates dating back to the mid-1980's. It is seemingly obvious that the antidote used to combat recessions has been to lower interest rates, which encourages borrowing and spending. 

Now the option of lowering interest rates isn't as cut and dry - we are near zero percent. To my understanding, I don't understand how we could go any lower. What's your take on this situation? 

Furthermore, we aren't really sure how much money has been pumped into the economy but we can rest assured that it's been a shitload - at least 12 trillion and that's likely conservative. 

Printing money is used to combat the deflationary spiral. This is where my clarity wanes. If we can't lower interest rates anymore, and have already printed a ton of money into existence, what do we have left in terms of policy to defend against recession and or depression? Print more money, but doesn't that end with inflation? But that explanation intuitively seems too basic.

What is the Fed's strategy right now? It looks like they have given us a schedule for rate hikes, in hope that that schedule will allow the market to ""plan accordingly"". But clearly in the past (at least the past 40 years) rate hikes have led to downturns in a very clear cause and effect manner.

I take home 928.24 a week 
I pay $137 in union dues a month

I take home 400.00 a month from another job. 

In a four paycheck month that adds to $3975.96

Adds to $3335.00
Leaving with on 'on paper' surplus of $640.96. 
Although it seems There's not that much left usually between someone's birthday, an item for the house, occasional restaurant, vehicle gas. 

My wife brings home $400 a week and is responsible for groceries, her vehicle gas which is about $200 a month alone, cable bill, electric, home gas, water, Netflix and her student loan 264.00. 

I can not give exact bill amounts but she winds up ahead by a few hundred dollars each month but then dog grooming and any other little thing pop up. 

She has 19,000.00 in student loans at about 6% I believe. (She paid $1500.00 in interest last year)

My plan now was to pay my 4000 credit card off with the tax return. After July when my store credit cards are paid that will free up 476.00 a month to pay off her 3000.00 credit card. Then use the remaining 3500 to redo one of our bathrooms.

personalfinance,Buying a car when you have bad credit,"Over the past few years my credit score has plummeted due to a variety of reasons, but for now the most important thing to note is that I am now in a position to begin a long overdue repair and clean-up on my credit score.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, I am also in the position that I need to purchase a car, as in not a month or two months from now, but ASAP. I have a few things to consider. The area I live in requires at minimum, and AWD in order to leave my home in the mornings to get to work during the winter.

&amp;nbsp;

Right now the options I've considered are this:

&amp;nbsp;

I can purchase a high interest vehicle in the $10,000 - $12,000 range, keep the vehicle and re-finance in 6 - 12 months once I improve my credit score. Or:

&amp;nbsp;

I could purchase a beater, throw-away type car and use it until October or November and try to get financing on a better vehicle then. That will give me a little more time to work on my credit.

&amp;nbsp;

Either way, I'm going to take some losses, but I'm wondering which is worse. Will it be difficult to refinance? Will it be worth it? If I buy a beater, I could end up sinking even more money into repairs and additionally still need to make a major vehicle purchase in the fall.

**&amp;nbsp;**

So I guess what I'm looking for is some guidance about the possibilities of refinancing a vehicle. Assuming that I pay all my bills on time for the next six to seven months, in addition to following up on collection debts, how much could I expect to see my credit score improve? Would it be enough to merit a better initial auto loan rate or would I be better off taking the hit of a high interest rate and trying to refinance 12 - 18 months from now?",finance

Would you recommend putting everything extra toward the student loans to knock off the highest interest rate, paying the regular amount on the loans and investing for the future, or is there a mix that would lead me to eliminating my debts sooner so that I can enjoy more of my income sooner while building a solid foundation for retirement?

Recently, I made the decision to kick my 401k back up.  It was all the way down to 1% and now i've pushed it back to 10%.  It's reducing my taxable income and forcing me to save.  Yes, the interest I'm making on it is nothing compared to what I'm paying on my debt load but I just can't keep pushing it off if I am not paying down the debt.

Ramsey says pay the debt off and THEN crank up the 401k but at 47 years old and not much in savings at all I just don't see another way.  I wanted to openly ask if this is even something that anyone has ever heard of.  I will keep paying down my debt and will take me 5+ years to do so, probably longer, but the ""extra"" money was just getting pissed away. At least this way I know that I'm saving 10% of my income.

personalfinance,Rolling over positive equity in vehicle,"Hello, I've got a question that I haven't seen asked here (or can't get the search to find it at least).  I bought a used vehicle 3 years ago for a really good price, and with almost 2 years left on the loan, the vehicle is worth KBB trade-in ""fair"" value (it's probably excellent, but I always go with fair),  24k, private party is 26k- and I owe 16k, financed at 1.9% interest rate.  I have the opportunity to upgrade to a newer used vehicle (go from 2012 to 2016) at a really great price, around 5k under KBB value for the newer vehicle, with the same interest rate.  The downside is that I would be starting a 5 year loan all over again, the plus side is that this would save me from the ~$1.5k worth of things my car will need by the end of this year, and also with rolling over the equity into the new loan, my payments would remain the same and I would come out a little more ahead in equity 3 years from now.  

I know that cars are the worst investment, but is there a downside to rolling over equity into another car as this is such a good deal?  I have a friend who flips cars and has taken his initial 500 dollar investment and grown it into almost a $20k vehicle with no further investment made other than the initial 500.  I'm not looking to do this, but I look at this as an opportunity to increase equity while making the same monthly payments I'm making now, plus also reducing my risk because of upcoming high annual service costs.

personalfinance,Attempted Refinance Experience with Chase,"Let me preface this by saying I am a finance laymen so my attempt at refinancing was quite the learning experience.

I'm currently in year 5 of a 30 year fixed mortgage of a $230,000 loan at 4.5% with Chase. I've been considering refinancing for a while and recently had been getting many advertisements about saving money by refinancing. Thinking that I've missed my best window of opportunity (maybe early last year?), and having just received another advertisement, this time from Chase my current loan holder, I thought 'what the heck, let's call them and see if they really can save me money, they should know right? Rates are only going up for the foreseeable future so this might be my last decent chance.'

After talking to a Chase refinance banker and hearing that I could save $200/month, I figured I'd go forward with the process. I received all of the documents and then looked over the loan estimate. Some of the savings mentioned on the phone appeared to be coming from a change in my escrow which didn't make sense to me. The savings in terms of principle plus interest came to only $56/month, a far cry from $200.

Figuring that I must be misunderstanding, I searched for some refinance calculators and ended up using [the one at Zillow.](https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/refinance-calculator/) Plugging in my numbers I again came up with a savings of $56/month but also came to the realization that all of that savings will go down the drain in the extra 5 years I would have to pay off a new loan and then some, costing $45,000.

I tried emailing the Chase refi guy a few times but all of his responses were basically, 'where are we at on signing the documents?' and never really addressed my concerns. After a lot of phone tag, I was finally able to talk to the Chase guy again. He gave me a spiel about how 'okay it was less savings than we figured but over the life of the loan you'll still save $50,000.' Not understanding his calculations one bit, I told him the numbers I was looking at and how I arrived at them. He was a bit taken back and said he needed to run the numbers and then call me back. 5 minutes later he calls back and says he had his manager do the calculations and that it did look like the refi would cost me $45,000 over the life of the loan.

Honestly, he was a nice guy and I don't *think* he was trying to deceive me but it's very disconcerting that a 'refinance banker' would be so inept at simple calculations that are a part of his everyday job. Also, I probably should have known better than to think I could save much money given my current loan interest rate and where general interest rates are currently at.

tl;dr - Bankers are not always as competent as you may think. Always, always run the numbers yourself before making any financial moves.",finance
personalfinance,(CAN) Looking to help protect my grandparents fortune,"My grandparents have worked their entire lives and now are in possession of multiple millions, they recently have liquidated all stocks and are holding all assets as cash, because of speculation of a new capital gains tax. It is my personal belief that we are on the verge of something phenomenally devastating in the world economy and I am scared that with the new federal 'Bail In' strategy that Justin Trudeau put through that there wealth will evaporate in the event of a crash.

personalfinance,Questions on 529 Account &amp; Student Loans,"Reposting this with a more specific title this time...

Okay, so here's the deal:  


I started off in 2015 with **~$25k** in student loan debt--around $5k in one private loan to my university (at **5.00%**) and **$20k** in four separate federal loans (averaging **3.85%**)--which I've whittled down to **$17k**. I also owed my parents **$41k** in an interest-free loan for having paid out-of-pocket for my undergrad degree, which I've whittled down to **$31k**.  


I've got a 529 account open that started in 2015 with a balance of **$101k** that I have withdrawn **$20k** from to help pay back all loans (current balance is **$81k** for those of you who hate math). However, I'm on the hook for penalties (taxes on the earnings made by the account since it was opened--for simplicity's sake, let's say the sum is around 50% of the total account) if I withdraw from the account for non-qualified education expenses, which include loans.  


The 529 is currently sitting in cash (my father was afraid to lose too much money for my education during &amp; after the Financial Crisis, so he withdrew all of the funds into cash in 2011). I plan on eventually going to grad school in some form--possibly law school, but could potentially go a different route. For this reason, my father has encouraged me to keep the money in the 529 (and devote it towards a higher degree), forgoing the current tax penalties.  


A new variable has emerged recently, namely the emergence of this bill, which would allow for withdrawals of 529 funds for loan payments: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/529 . 


Three questions:  

* Should I listen to my father and not withdraw any more money from the account? I'm fascinated by the potential to pay off ALL of the outstanding debt in one fell swoop, but also worry about the tax penalties that effectively could wipe away &gt;$5k of hard-earned money.  

* Should I reinvest the cash sitting in the 529 account? It's a risky move since I'd be going back to school within the next 3 years, and if the market moves too much, I'd rather sit with $81k than only have $50k to pay for grad school... Risk tolerance here is obviously a major factor.  

* Should I see how this bill shapes out before making any more withdrawals?

personalfinance,"New to credit cards, is a fixed rate card best for my situation and what should I plan for in the future?","I am a 20 year old, finishing up my degree with a part time job that pays very well (22k a year) and will be getting converted to full time around the end of May. I currently have 1 credit card through discover with a high interest rate (18.49%) that has been open for a year but I haven't used it at all and have just been using my debit card for purchases. Along with my current card, I have a small amount of subsidized student loans (3k) and a car payment of 150$ a month.


My credit score is very good for my short credit history and I am financially independent but I would like to continue to improve it by starting to responsibly use a credit card. I know this sub is big on never keeping a balance month to month and I plan on paying my balance in full every billing period but I would like to have a good card in case I have an emergency and need to take on a balance if it is more than my emergency fund could cover.

personalfinance,Leveraging my portfolio to pay for an MBA. How many bonds should I buy and what bonds would be best?,"I have about $150,000 in a taxable portfolio from an insurance settlement and I'm hoping to leverage those funds to pay for my MBA, which will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $125,000. I plan to continue working while I attend classes part time. Currently, I make about $50,000 and save about 30% of my take-home, which I could also use to pay tuition. 

Knowing that my first tuition bill is about 18 months away, how should I allocate my taxable portfolio to prepare? Should I allocate all my assets into bonds for capital preservation? Or maintain a 80/20 balance hoping that the stock market won't tank? 

With interest rates on the rise, I'm also concerned about negative returns in a bond fund. I'm leaning toward a short-term bond fund to mitigating the interest rate risk, but wondering if there's a way to invest in individual bonds that will ""guarantee"" 2% or 3% return over my short time horizon.

personalfinance,shared responsibility payment,"Throwaway for various reasons.

Hi all,
I'm finally getting around to doing my taxes for 2016, but digging through all my paperwork, I found a bunch of letters from the IRS that I really had not paid that much attention to.  I had a vague idea of what each letter was about so I didn't put much thought into it.  Until today.  To make a long story short, my tax guy messed up in my original 2015 Federal taxes and had my status as single when I was really married.  He e-filed before giving me a copy and once I caught that mistake he filed an amended return.  My tax liability for the amended return was less than the original return so that was cool.  But in the mean time, the IRS had begun sending me letters for the balance on the original amount, about 900 dollars more or less.  I must mention that I paid the amount owed on my amended return at all once as opposed to the amount on my original return.   Basically, I called them an explained the situation and they said to get on a payment plan just to stop the letters and that everything would be resolved once they had processed the amended return.  So I did. 
The letters stopped but then all of a sudden we received 2 letters, one addressed to me and one to my wife.  These letters each said that we had a refund due so we were stoked, but right after that we get 2 more letters saying that the shared responsibility penalty balance was deducted from the refund.  We still come out on top by 200 dollars.  But my question is, or at least my understand is that the shared responsibility payment is included in the total amount due on the federal income tax.  Is this correct, or is the amount owed on my federal income tax separate from the shared responsibility payment?  Because if it is I'm going to contact them and explain they should not have deducted it from my refund.  Any thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,I have a plan to pay off my debts. Just wondering if a balance transfer between my existing cards is a good idea.,"I have just under $5,500 in debt in five credit cards and a personal loan. I got a raise, got YNAB for free, and pulled my head out of my ass recently so I'm on track with my finances for the first time in a long time. I have $1000 in savings currently so I'm going to move onto debt repayment.

When taxes come in, I'll be using a giant portion of that to be paying off some of the above mentioned debt. I did some research and looked up some calculators and decided to use the avalanche method (over the snowball method, it's only going to save me about $20 in interest). I don't know exactly how much from taxes but we'll say $2,000 for shits and giggles. So now I've got $3,500 to pay off. Between the avalanche method and an additional ~$400 per month (husband's new job, yay) those debts should be paid off relatively quickly.

On to my specific question. These are the important cards to the question in descending order of interest rate. Card A has an $88 balance with 26.99%. Card B has a $435 balance with 25.49%. Card C (This is actually a loan but we'll call it a card for simplicity purposes) has a $1,527 balance with 17.75%. Card D has an available balance of about $500 with 4%.

When I get my taxes the first card to be paid is Card A using the Avalanche method. On the same train, the next card *would* be Card B. Should I transfer the balance of Card B onto Card D and then pay Card C with the taxes? Or should I pay Card A and B with the taxes and then transfer some of Card C to Card D? Should I transfer anything at all to that lower interest rate card?

personalfinance,Debt makes us feel hopeless. It's not so bad but we can't help but feel lost. Where to start? Tips and advice needed.,"Hi Redditors! This is my first post here so I apologize in advance. 

Here is the situation...my fiancé and I are in debt, like everyone else in this world. 

We live in Canada and this is our financial situation:

Combined monthly income: 4820$ CAD. 

We pay 1460$ for our mortgage (new house that we purchased in May 2016. 

Our bills total: 2820.5$, roughly. It includes everything (mortgage, insurance, groceries, utilities, transportation, gas, etc).
The only thing that I didn't include in it is the debt that is making it all hard to manage. 

We have a debt from a private creditor to which we pay 415$ a month. We have already made 4 payments, have 8 more (a full year of payments) 

We also have a combined credit card debt of 7000$. 

Writing it out like that does not seem too bad. I have made spreadsheets trying to figure out the best way to tackle this. I am 28 and he is 31. I feel like we are both so juvenile, even though we own a house and seem to have our shit together. We have erratic schedules (shift work, we leave in the morning/afternoon and get home late at around 10pm-11pm. We eat out a lot. I know we are being total morons. We kind of feel hopeless. I know our debt is really not in that terrible of a situation but we can't help but feel stuck. 

We have recently come up with a new strategy. We want to open a line of credit to cover the private debt. Reduce payments on that one and interest and build a better credit history. If we reduce payments, we can finally tackle the CC debt. We also still have balance owed on our closing costs (from the house purchase back in May, the interest rate is 1% per month). Do you think that this line of credit is a good idea? We both want to eventually use that as a down payment on real estate, and maybe purchase a new car. 

I do realize that this doesn't look at bad as some other posts here. We just want to reassurance and tips on HOW to tackle this mess. Right now, we just feel hopeless and lost and don't know where to start.

Thank you for your help! It is very much appreciated.",finance
financialindependence,"Sharing my numbers, goals, milestones, and advice","I wanted to share a few of my numbers, goals and priorities. Both because it's helpful for me to organize my goals and plans, and because the posts and comments on this sub have helped me out and I thought I'd chip in my 2 cents.

Basic stats: 31M, married, wife the same age. My annual income (software engineer, large company) around 125k + 20k bonus + 5k stock + 4.5% 401k match + ESPP magic of 1.5% salary or more. Wife's salary around 105k with a 2% 401k match at a non-profit. No kids yet, just a dog.

I started working the summer I was 16, for a nickel above federal minimum wage at the time, I think it was around $5.15 / hr. This was a miserable and yet incredibly enlightening experience. I realized I could make it on my own with hard work but I sure didn't want to be stuck there. I went to college, worked part-time and summers through school at only slightly better pay and less-miserable conditions. Wife and I were extremely fortunate to have had families who paid most of college (along with some scholarships and benefits), and we graduated with no debt.

Real income started coming in after I graduated college with an engineering degree in 2007, starting salary was $65k. My wife and I lived basically as we had while in school, renting a cheap place, maxing out the 401ks and Roths, and saving a small amount of taxable income too. Here's my [SSA reported earnings](https://imgur.com/ltryvQH) (pretty sure I had some W2 income in 2005, not sure why it's missing). Wife's salary has been just a little bit less than mine over the years as she has worked at non-profits and spent two more years in school.

It's been just shy of ten years since we graduated and started working and saving. Here's Mint's (ragged) picture of our [net worth](https://imgur.com/YfCkYUb) as far back as Mint knows about. Their older data is incomplete, the early years are missing several accounts that we had, and there is a discontinuity around our house purchase last year as Mint can't be made to understand the date we closed on our house and how that corresponds to the dip in cash.

Right now we're still maxing 401ks, maxing my HSA, and average maybe $2000 or so of taxable savings per month. I'll be getting my first bonus check from my current job this year, and plan to save basically all of it, plus all my stock options and ESPP. If everything goes smoothly I hope we can save well over $75k this year. I have a [goal set in Mint](https://imgur.com/ARIgsUD) to get to $1M in cash and investments, and if the market doesn't take a dive and our savings stay on track, I hope to get there by early 2018. Our major expenses are dog-care ($600/month), mortgage ($3300/month incl. taxes and insurance), and some travel.

Our net worth breakdown:
Assets:

 * $104k in cash. I plan to move maybe half into the market slowly this year.
 * $823k in investments. Only $135k in a taxable brokerage account, the rest is spread across IRAs and 401ks.
 * Paid around $800k for our condo last summer -- very high COL area but I have some confidence property values will hold up well here even if there is another big downturn. Mint uses Zillow for its property estimate, which has a more conservative $735k estimate. Oh well.

Liabilities:

 * $4700 currently on the credit cards (paid in full every month, that is just the current balances outstanding). Balance is high at the moment as we've just booked flights and lodgings for our summer vacation.
 * $590k owed on the mortgage, out of the $600k initial. We bought a condo last summer, with a 30-year mortgage, 10-year fixed rate around 2.9%. I plan to pay the minimum monthly for the next 10 years while our rate is cheap, and if the bank jacks up rates on us at that point I hope to have enough saved and accessible by then to pay off in full.

I mentioned already my wife and I were helped out significantly by having undergrad paid for and graduating debt free. I received an inheritance of around $200k a few years ago which also explains our growth. I say this to be transparent about where our money has come from and not write some [inflated baloney](https://archive.fo/uj7qI).

With those caveats and explanations, here are some lessons I've learned along the way that I'd like to share.

1. Prioritize your physical health **first**. Yes my first advice is actually to spend money -- investing in yourself and your health. Even if you are young and without major problems, go to your yearly physicals and dentist appointments. Nobody likes going to the doctor, but not going ends up being much worse.
 - I am in decent health, but I would gladly pay every dollar in all my retirement accounts to have my few health problems solved **for good** and be guaranteed a long, healthy, active life. In my case, that's not possible. Doctors can only do so much. Some of your health is decided by luck and genetics. But control the part that you can control -- lucky for all of us, it's usually a pretty large part. Eat your fresh fruits and vegetables, exercise, and don't eat out all the time -- not primarily because eating out is expensive, but because your health cannot be bought at any price, and making food yourself will simply be better for you.

2. Prioritize your mental health, happiness, and sanity second. Having a 90% savings rate will do nothing for you if you are depressed and suicidal. If you don't live long enough to enjoy your early retirement, all those years and decades of hard work were a waste. I'd much rather see someone making the bare minimum 401k contributions, with a job he enjoys, good friends, family support, loving spouse, than see an isolated and depressed wage-slave, spending all his time at a job he hates in a depressing environment, just to max out savings.
 - In fact, I see the entire idea of ""financial independence"" as a small part of a larger picture: determining what your priorities are in life, what really makes you happy now and will make you happy long-term, and then consciously investing your time, energy, and money to those pursuits. And cutting back on everything else. [Build the life you want, then save for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/58j8pc/build_the_life_you_want_then_save_for_it/)

3. I can't tell you the number of posts I see on r/personalfinance where the biggest obstacle boils down to ""I paid way too much for a new car I can't really afford and now I'm in big trouble"". What's worse, the people that post are the ones smart enough to realize something is wrong and reach out for help, I worry about the rest.
 - I live in a New England city where a big snowfall will regularly bury us for a week or two at a stretch in the winter. It is mind-boggling the number of cars I see here, **weeks** after a snowstorm, still parked on the street completely buried by snow -- the owners have more cars than they need, so what the hell, just leave the extra cars abandoned on the street (for ""free"" of course), buried in the snow. Car insurance for me and my wife here costs, for **one car**, north of $1k/year and we both have spotless driving records. Plus motor vehicle excise tax, registration, emissions test, plates, AAA, etc. And those are just the fixed costs, without putting any miles on the car! I am simply astounded by these abandoned cars hanging out for weeks.

4. Buy a damn bicycle and start somewhere. The number of excuses I hear about why one can't bike is just insane. Work is too far, it's too cold, too wet, too dangerous, I'm out of shape, I don't have a bike, I don't really know how to bike, bikes get stolen, I'll get sweaty, and on and on. Look. Go to your local bike shop, or Craigslist, or hell even Walmart. Spend $150-$200 on a used or (crappy) new bike. Get a helmet and maybe a lock. And just try going somewhere on a nice cool, sunny day. Go to a coffee shop, park, bookstore, post office, whatever. You lock up basically anywhere. No coins or credit card for the meter, no circling for parking. Time how long it took you. If it's somewhere close, and you live in a city, it probably wasn't much slower than driving and dealing with parking, maybe even faster. And remember how infuriating it is to be stuck in a car in a traffic jam? That will never happen to you on a bike.
 - Commuting to work every day by bike may not be for you. Maybe you can do it on nice days in the spring and fall. Maybe you can do a few errands here and there. Maybe just for fun rides on the weekend. Read [the true cost of commuting](https://lifehacker.com/5855550/the-true-cost-of-commuting-you-could-buy-a-house-priced-15900-more-for-each-mile-you-move-closer-to-work) by the great Mr. Money Moustache if you want financial motivation. I wonder if I have MMM beat [with my bike commuting stats](https://imgur.com/Hgb9h3v) ? But just **try** riding a bike a few times and see how you like it. If you hate it, fine, it's not for you.

5. Spend some time getting VERY familiar with your work benefits. It is easy to miss out on free money. A few examples from my own experience:
  * If you have an employer match, be careful about front-loading your 401k contributions, even just a little bit, e.g. meeting the 401k contribution limit by November in the year. Depending on how it is set up, the match may only kick in, say, up to a 5% match of each pay period. So if you front-load and are maxed out by November, you would have only gotten a 5% match for 11 months, not 12 months.
  * If you have an employer HSA and your employer is generous enough to have incentive programs to reward you with money for exercise, preventative care, health counseling, etc. get on top of those and max them out. It's free money!
  * The workplace ESPP plans I've had access to are also free money (often a 15% guaranteed ROI after 6 months if company stock is flat or goes down, with the potential for much more if the company stock goes up). You are crazy if you don't contribute the full amount here.
  * Be on the lookout for other fringe employee benefits. We recently found out my wife's work offers reimbursement up to $20/month for bicycle commuting expenses. Ka-ching.
  * Understanding the details of your vacation policy (PTO) is critical. How often do they accrue? Do you have other days (""floating holidays"") and how are they different? What is your cap on the max. number of days accrued? Do they roll-over year to year? Do they get paid out when you leave the company? Time is money, these days are precious, don't waste any of them.

6. On the same lines, the easiest credit card sign-ups and bank sign-ups are no-brainers, great money for a minimal time investment. You don't have to go overboard like the hardcore folks at r/churning , but just signing up and canceling one or two cards per year can net you an easy $200-$500 bonus each time. Even better, the credit card bonuses are [generally treated as discounts on purchases, not income](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110614/are-credit-card-rewards-considered-taxable-income-irs.asp), so not treated as taxable income by the IRS.

7. Make a to-do list of financial fixes, bill cuts, home improvements, and work on them regularly. My quick list is:
 - rollover wife's old 401k to an IRA
 - set up a backdoor Roth for me and my wife this year
 - do an easy credit card sign-up bonus
 - take advantage of a state program to pay for insulation in our house

8. Think about what makes you happy and do more of it. Stop for a moment and ponder -- what are the top three things that you love doing, that when you are old and grey you will look back fondly on?
 - I bet that ""compulsively checking Facebook"" wasn't on your list. Or ""sitting in traffic on the way to work"". Financial Independence is all about taking control of your life. But you don't need some magic amount of money saved to do this. Being financially independent is more of a spectrum than a binary. Just having a small emergency fund saved will give you confidence at work, give you flexibility to interview for other jobs, allow you to sleep better at night, invest in yourself, etc.
9. And after taking care of yourself and your immediate family, think about your other close friends and more extended family (well, the ones you love, at least). Just as our families have sacrificed for us, I see my extended family members who have needed help over the years and have tried to help out quite a bit, financially and otherwise. This is actually what I look forward to the most as our nest egg slowly fills in. I don't want to be a Scrooge sticking to a leanfire budget for 40+ years of retirement with no wiggle room. I aspire to be able to help friends, family, and charities I care about.",finance
personalfinance,Consolidating my student loans,"Currently I have 5 different student loans. 4 of them federal loans, the other being though a local state bank. I found out my local bank will do student loan consolidation.

These trends are largely unchanged, but are now set against a very different political backdrop. While the impact of Donald Trump’s election as US president remains unclear, the [improving economy](https://www.thecapitalgroup.com/content/dam/cgc/tenants/apac/documents/articles/ii-tale-of-two-us-economies-201703.pdf) should be supportive of US equities in 2017.

**One economy, two inflation levels**

Robust US consumer spending continues, with indicators showing encouraging data for areas such as retail, housing and auto sales. However, this sits alongside a relatively lacklustre industrial sector, driven by two factors:

1. Weak export growth because of sluggish non-US economic activity and a strong US dollar.
2. The collapse of the US energy sector, which followed the sharp decline in energy prices.

This split economy subsequently led to different levels of inflation in services and goods. As shown in the first chart below, service prices (which are largely determined by domestic economic conditions) have been rising around 3%, while goods prices (which are more a function of global economic conditions) have been flat or falling.

**What this means for the Fed**

The bifurcated nature of the US economy presented the US Federal Reserve (Fed) with a challenge: how to account for the fact that one half was growing at a rate better than expected while the other was showing the opposite trend. In response, the Fed chose to raise interest rates in December, while its rate-setters forecast further rises in 2017, contingent upon positive incoming economic data. We anticipate, however, that if additional rate rises do take place in 2017, these will be small and the ‘lower for longer’ scenario will remain intact. 

**Strengthening macroeconomic conditions**

In a positive development, the two headwinds facing the industrial sector in 2016 have abated. Energy prices have rebounded, bolstered by the agreement between OPEC and other oil-producing nations to cut oil production. At the same time, the US dollar has weakened since the beginning of the year. This should lead to the industrial sector posting stronger growth rates in 2017, and in turn allow overall US economic growth to reaccelerate to a rate of 2%-2.5%, which we saw after the recession ended in mid-2009.

**The Trump factor and policy uncertainty**

The big change for the US has been in the political arena. President Trump’s bold proposed policies have already affected markets in anticipation of their implementation, but much remains uncertain.

If Trump’s fiscal policies were to be fully implemented, we could see stimulus reaching a level of around 3% of GDP, which may be problematic in the longer term. US unemployment is now below 5%, which is what most economists consider to be the economy’s natural rate. As the unemployment rate has moved further below 5%, wage growth has accelerated in a typical way. In past cycles, wage growth has accelerated every time the unemployment rate has fallen below 4%. If the economy does 3 indeed reach the 2%-2.5% growth rate, and there is a further 1%-1.5% of additional stimulus in 2017, the unemployment rate would likely continue to fall further, triggering a further acceleration in wage growth. This would result in a stronger economy in 2017 as consumers benefit from wage growth, but it may also cause the Fed to respond more aggressively than what the markets have currently priced in, by raising interest rates higher and faster.

Higher US interest rates would likely lead to higher bond yields, albeit within limits. Despite rising since the election, real yields have remained very low, at just above zero. This seems inconsistent with an expected economic growth rate of 2%-2.5% plus additional stimulus. These low yields are likely a by-product of policies implemented by other central banks around the world. Quantitative easing, by which central banks create money to purchase bonds, has directed vast volumes of money to the US Treasury market, driving bond prices higher and yields lower. While the US may have ceased its bond-buying programme, other markets, including the EU, have continued theirs. So while we can expect higher US Treasury yields, there will probably be a limit to how high they go, making them unlikely to pose a risk to the economic activity of 2017.

**The costs of economic stimulus**

Before the presidential election, the Congressional Budget Office had forecast that the federal debt-to-GDP ratio would increase over the next decade, reaching around 80% by 20251. However, if Trump’s proposals were fully implemented, that ratio would exceed 100% during that period2, reaching the same levels as in countries affected by the European debt crisis countries. If the growth in US debt continues along this trajectory, concerns about debt sustainability could increase over the next decade. This, coupled with a less favourable supply-and-demand balance within the Treasury market, could ultimately put upward pressure on yields. However, these are potential areas of concern that will have an impact beyond 2017.

The other key area of concern for the US economy is Trump’s policies on trade. There are currently trillions of dollars of goods that flow into and out of the US economy on an annual basis. Should significant tariffs on imports be levied, US consumers would lose purchasing power, while other countries could implement tariffs in retaliation. The result would be much higher prices for US consumers and so reduced consumer spending, as well as dampened export growth. Finally, there are well-entrenched global supply chains that rely on the relatively free movement of goods between countries. To disrupt those supply chains would no doubt have a negative impact on economic activity. Again, however, none of these outcomes are likely to play out in 2017, but rather in 2019 or 2020.

**Realistic expectations**

There are significant obstacles that President Trump would have to face should he push for his full proposed stimulus and policies. Firstly, many of the policies would require congressional approval, which is not guaranteed. Even if they were approved, it would then take time to implement them. For example, a large infrastructure spending package would take a significant amount of time to execute as projects have to be identified and resources mobilised. The same goes for trade policies.

**A supportive backdrop for US equities remains despite uncertainties**

The US equity market currently appears fully valued, with the price-to-earnings ratio at a level that has rarely been exceeded. As a result, we believe a reasonable expectation is for total return over the next 12 to 18 months to be driven by a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield.

Fortunately, with an economy that is improving, an industrial sector that is recovering and the possibility of corporate tax cuts, the outlook for US earnings is positive. In our view, it is also reasonable to expect solid earnings growth over the next 12 to 18 months and, if you factor in dividend yield on top of that, there is the potential for positive equity market returns as we go through 2017 and into 2018.",finance

btc,Strawpoll VOTE: BitcoinEC vs Core vs BU,"http://www.strawpoll.me/12583844

Its become clear in the past few weeks, that while I do agree that the overall sentiment of BU in order to increase blocksize by letting miners decide is the best option to proceed, the BU team seems to be pretty and inexperienced and/or understaffed.  Who knows their ability to manage Bitcoin into the future well.  They may be right on this one issue, but they could very well just be a 1 trick pony and not able to facilitate Bitcoin development in the future.

Core undoubtedly has the far superior development team that is far more experienced, even if I disagree with their plan for scaling, I think implementing a plan that alienates this entire group would be a grave mistake also for Bitcoin future.

[BitcoinEC](https://bitcoinec.info/) seems to be a new idea, basically take current Bitcoin version from Core: SegWit (malleability fix/quadratic hashing fix) + adding EC, the Emergent Consensus portion of BU that allows miners to control and signal what the blocksize would be.  This would allow LN and other second layer solutions while also solving the scaling issues for the foreseeable future.

While I do like BU ""gist,"" Core clearly has a far superior and more experienced development team.

Please vote in the poll to show your current sentiment for scaling debate.",cryptocurrency

Monthly expenses - $2150 (over estimated adjustment to student loan payments with pay increase to be safe)

Monthly Surplus - $1550

Savings - $1000

I'm worried that although I have a decent surplus each month, I will not be able to get a loan because my credit is awful. I will be getting a credit card and using that to purchase things which i will pay off once my monthly statement comes in to help repair my credit. I also will probably throw at least 800-1000 at the car loan a month to get it off the books. Looking at 10k to 15k price range.

worldpolitics,Understanding conservative and liberal forces,"The purpose of this post is to define Liberal Republicanism by explaining the forces of Conservatism and Liberalism.

Limited government doesn't mean a small government or government that doesn't interfere. Although the definition of ""limited"" on Google says ""small"" or ""restricted in size"", Limited Government means a government that is limited by laws. If the laws of the United States give the Federal government jurisdiction on every matter in every location on earth, then our government is still limited.

Republicanism is by definition conservative. In a republic, government leaders exercise powers based on the rule of law. The rule of law is based on precedents, which means that future decisions on law are made by using previous laws as a source. Relying on old laws to create new laws conserves the status quo and existing traditions.

The United States is a Republican Democracy. This innovation in government created an area for Liberal forces to counter balance the Conservative forces ingrained in a Republic. The US Republican Democracy, often referred to as a Representative Democracy, empowers all US citizens to vote and have a voice in the discussion of creating laws. Allowing new ideas that challenge the status-quo gives breath to Liberalism. While Liberalism is often associated with being open minded and willing to discard tradition, ultimately, Liberalism is the belief of favoring maximum individual liberty in political and social reform. A non-democratic Republic ruled by the elite isn't much different than a Monarchy.

The Founding Fathers were so intelligent that they created a form of government -- based on a constitution -- that was more intelligent than them. For example, the United State's original set of laws allowed slavery and treated women as second class citizens. However, The Liberal forces enabled by the will of the people defeated the conservative forces fighting to maintain existing law.

If the above expression is clear, then one needs to think about the differences between a Libertarian Republican, a Liberal Republican, and a Liberal Democrat before reaching an understanding of one's own political preference.

As a Liberal Republican, I strongly believe in the forces of Liberalism, but I place great weight on precedents and traditions that are reached by the scientific method and backed through data.",technology

In 2016, I had quite a bit of activity due to selling a bunch of stocks for a house downpayment, but nothing exotic or complicated. Last month, I wanted to get my taxes done early, and got my tax forms mostly done, except of course for waiting for the 1099 from this one particular brokerage. I logged in every damn day for about 3 weeks, waiting until they finally uploaded my 1099 on the last day of February. Once it was finally there, I plugged in those numbers and filed my federal and state taxes a few days later. End of story, or so I thought.


Today, infuriatingly, I got an email from the brokerage, saying that they had a 1099 corrected form to send me. Sure enough, I compared the two, and there is a $13 discrepancy, sadly not in my favor. Apparently, the first time around, they overcalculated the cost basis on the original form. The kicker of this all is that it was all for stock that I bought using their website (not transferred from another brokerage), and all within the last few years, i.e. they had to keep track of and report the cost basis on it, so they should have had the information in their system from the very start.

While I was in VT I did a little work for the college I was at. I made about $125 in total (which I have listed on a W-2 that the college sent me).

personalfinance,Reporting healthcare coverage on federal income taxes [Question] [Taxes],"I know the IRS released a statement back in February stating that returns will no longer be rejected if the status of your healthcare coverage that year was not reported. 

Should those who were not covered for more than 2 months just simply not report their lack of coverage, or should they go ahead and still report it (thus facing a fine)? 

Also, if someone does not report their lack of coverage, how much would that increase their chance of an audit? This is for someone who made just over $21,000 for 2016.",finance
personalfinance,"Should I take $20k of my 401K, and pay a chunk of my $55k of student debt at 7%?","Hey everyone. First of all, thanks for the countless teachings along the years. Now it's time for me to ask for your wisdom...

**Context:** I'm a professional in my 30s making about $150k/year gross in San Francisco, worked abroad most of my life. Thus, my American 401k has accumulated funds only for a couple of years: I only have $20k on it ($18k last year, increased by $2k only on market returns). I also have $55k of student debt at 7%. I have an emergency fund of about $5k. 

**Budget:** Net salary ~$90k/year (~$7.5k/month after tax), but also pay hefty Bay Area $2k rent/month, support my parents with $1k/month, pay student loan $1k/month, and pay living expenses $2k/month (this includes all travel). This leaves $1k/month ""free"" (the remaining $0.5k/month I only get on tax refund), which I've used to build the emergency fund, help other family members. No properties.
 
**Question:** **Should I withdraw all $20k on my 401k (this is *all* of my 401k), pay the early withdrawal penalty, and pay a chunk of my $55k student debt at 7%?** How should I think about comparing just leaving my 401k alone vs withdrawing and paying? (just compare the return/interest rates?)

Thanks for any insights everyone. Much much appreciated.

personalfinance,What can I do to improve my personal financial situation in the long run?,"About me:

- Grew up fairly poor. Parents have always rented and live paycheck to paycheck.
- I'm in college getting a degree in music education, looking for jobs soon (finding a job is looking good, despite what people say about teaching jobs. Not a big concern of mine).
- By the time I graduate, I will have approximately $60k in loans. I'm not sure where to find the exact number, if anyone does please let me know. They are all either federal loans or Parent Plus.
- I do not have credit, and cannot get a credit card. Planning on getting a secured card soon to work on that.
- I have virtually no savings as of right now.

Basically, I'm wondering how to handle all of this. What's the best way to pay off my specific loans? How should I deal with my credit situation? What things should I look out for when I get my first teaching jobs in terms of finances/retirement/saving, etc? I don't want to end up like my parents.

My previous life has been a mess with getting into debt and trouble with the law. Within these past 2 years I have turned my life around. My credit has been going up, I've stayed out of trouble, all my bills are paid. Life is great except these student loans are obviously not going to just disapear. Now I'm in need of recommendations on what to do. Here's my situation.

I have 3 unsubsidized loans with a principal of $11,356 with a 6.80% interest rate has the interest at $3,654. 

I have 3 subsidized loans with a principal of $9,400 and interest has accumulated to $2,050. These 3 loans all have different interest rates being: 3.4%, 4.5%, and 5.6%

In total I have a principal of $20,756 and interest being $5,704. Which equates to $26,460.

I realize this is probably minor debt compared to some people. I would however like to take care of this and know all my options before I make the call to speak to someone.

I do have approximately a $4,500 tax return coming that they will take to apply to this loan.

I make about 30-35,000 a year. Usually only have a few hundred bucks to spare at the end of the month after all my bills and what not. I will have about $400+ more a month at the end of the year when some loans are paid off.

personalfinance,Questions on Paying off a Mountain of Student Loan Debt,"Hello! I have a large student loan debt ($170K public, $55K private), and after a few years making minimum payments, my wife and I have finally found stable work and are making around $100K annually together. I am looking to consolidate to lower my interest rates (6.75% fixed for public, 8.75% for $17K of private, roughly 3% for the remaining private).

So here are my questions:

1. Should I consolidate my public loans with a private lender for fixed interest rates around 6%? (I'm thinking I would stick with fixed for these, since they will not be paid off any time soon.) I do not work in eligible public service and our income isn't low enough to qualify for most benefits. The only reason I can see against consolidation is in the unlikely case something really bad (market crashes and I lose my job) or really good (the government somehow forgives student loans) happens. I would like to know your thoughts on if consolidation is a good idea.

2. For the private loans, what is a good strategy for fixed vs. variable loans? I should have the option to take some percentage as hybrid and some as variable, but I'm not sure of the pros and cons.

3. Is it worthwhile to hire a financial advisor? Searching ""student loan financial advisor"" comes up with some, and we know someone at an Edward Jones. I'm aware of tools like unbury.me, and I'm well along the application process for consolidating myself; I would just like help with the intangible aspects of planning how to pay off debt. So I'd appreciate any opinions on the wisdom of hiring advisors.

Update for Customers With Bitcoin Stored on Coinbase
We wanted to provide customers notice of how a possible hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol into Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited will affect Coinbase accounts.

The only version of Bitcoin supported on the Coinbase platform today is Bitcoin Core, currently represented by the symbol BTC.

We may provide support for Bitcoin Unlimited in the future depending on market conditions and stability of the protocol, but we cannot guarantee whether or when such support may be available. Customers who wish to access both blockchains at the time of the hard fork should withdraw their BTC from Coinbase since we cannot guarantee what will happen during the hard fork or when this access may be available.

If one chain receives an overwhelming majority of support from miners, users, and exchanges, we reserve the right to alter the names of chains or discontinue support for certain chains in the future.

Ensuring the safety of customer funds is our top priority. In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol, it is likely that Coinbase will temporarily suspend the deposit and withdrawal of bitcoin from the platform pending our assessment of the technical risks posed by any fork, such as the possibility of replay attacks, network instability, or other factors. Customers should take note that they will not be able to withdraw bitcoin from or deposit bitcoin to Coinbase for a period of up to 24 hours or more following the fork. In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol, Coinbase may suspend the ability to buy or sell on our platform during this time.

Coinbase looks forward to working with other exchanges and development teams to ensure the smooth execution of future hard forks with as little disruption as possible. Customers should continue to monitor our support pages and Twitter account for updates regarding our support for digital currencies on the platform.


Update for Customers With Bitcoin Stored on Coinbase was originally published in The Coinbase Blog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.

Coinbase IRS Update
Today the IRS filed a motion in federal court to compel Coinbase to produce customer personal records pursuant to the government’s “John Doe” summons. This filing, which we have anticipated for several weeks, is part of the ordinary process by which the government enforces a John Doe summons against a recipient. As we stated to our customers in November, Coinbase remains concerned with the indiscriminate and over broad scope of the government’s summons and we have produced no records under the summons.

Our legal team is in the process of reviewing the IRS’s motion. We will continue to work with the IRS to assess the government’s willingness to fundamentally reconsider the focus and scope of the summons. If it does not, we anticipate filing opposition papers in court in coming months. We will continue to keep our customers updated as to status.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The most dangerous cryptocurrency in the world™,"Hello everyone,

We are excited to announce that we have a new cryptocurrency that we will be releasing soon. This new currency is called ConCoin.

ConCoin is the first cryptocurrency to be introduced and used within the United States prison system. We began work on ConCoin back in 2014.

Over the past 3 years, we have collected thousands of letters from inmates across the U.S. about who wanted to know more about cryptocurrency, as well as how well it works for them. We keep in constant communication with them as a way of gaining valuable insight and feedback so we can improve how ConCoin works.

We have offered the inmates who register for ConCoin 50 tokens that will be exchanged for coins (Premine) when we officially launch. We also have a referral program that offers 50 additional tokens for referrals to use ConCoin. During this pilot period, inmates have already been activity trading the tokens and reaching out to us to transfer them from inmate to inmate.  This was something we did not plan for but found a way to do it for them. Somehow the inmate have created some kind of value for this system before it was officially launched.

In addition to keeping close contact with our inmate pilot users, we have also been in contact via phone and through letters with a few wardens and their staff across the country who praise the idea of ConCoin and believe that this cryptocurrency and the way we plan on introducing it to the prison system has merit. The prison that has shown the most interest is San Quentin State Prison.

Currently, we are working on a beta system that involves the installation of a computer system inside of a prison. This system will enable inmates to transfer the coins as well as to see the current prices.  We have been talking to 3 prisons about this system.


ConCoin is already in 9 of the top 10 prisons in the U.S.:

– Rikers Island

– Louisiana State Penitentiary

– Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary

– Folsom State Prison

– Attica Correctional Facility

– San Quentin State Prison

– Sing Sing State Prison

– United States Penitentiary Marion

– Pelican Bay State Prison

ConCoin has become quite popular, with both classified and non-classified groups of inmates. The percentage inmate groups with the most ConCoins as of January 2017:

1. Non Classified 72.2%

2. Aryan Brotherhood 7.4%

3. Mexican Mafia 7.2%

4. Black Guerrilla Family 6.9%

5. Mara Salvatrucha MS-13 6.3%

This digital currency enables inmates across the country to transfer ConCoins between themselves within the prison walls as well as to other inmates throughout the United States prison system--all in just a matter of minutes.

Not only will ConCoin be of great benefit to inmates, it will also be of great benefit to those who manage and run prisons. For the first time ever, both the state Department of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons will be able to see the trail of money which passes through their prisons via blockchain technology.

When we officially launch ConCoin, there will be a total of 6,851,000 ConCoins made available to correctional facilities. This amount represents the correctional population in the United States at the end of 2014 – the year ConCoin was founded. By working with prisons across the nation, we plan to set up exclusive rights to ensure that ConCoin is the only allowed digital currency in prisons, making for a currency that’s not only strong in value, but also long-lasting and enduring.

personalfinance,Credit score dropped significantly after credit card paid off?,"Hello PF!

I'm in the process of paying off credit cards for my fiance and I. He has two outstanding cards with very high interest rates. I was able to completely pay off one of the cards (yay!).

I'm not so worried about the credit score, I'm more curious as to why this would happen. I'm more worried about the debt than the score.

The balance was $750ish. Over two months, I was able to pay this off completely. His utilization rate went from 121% in October 2016 to 48% March 2017. I thought this would be great for this score! But his score in October 2016 was 501 and now has dropped to 471. 30 points!

I'm putting my Netflix as a recurring charge on his card and will be paying this off monthly (tracking with the help of YNAB). This should help keep the card open and with a balance each month.

Why would this happen? Like I said, it's more curiosity than anything else. I'd rather be debt free with a low credit score than all this debt at this point.",finance

personalfinance,Receiving bonus/gift from work in upcoming paycheck; is there a way to prevent massive withholding?,"I am in the military and will be selling 39.5 days of leave at my upcoming extension which takes effect in July.

personalfinance,Difference in credit scores &amp; how to raise them (long),"My husband and I are trying to raise our credit scores. We got married young (21 and 20) and neither of us had any experience managing money. He went through college on a full scholarship and I went on my Dad's GI bill. 

We have a lot of debt relative to our income. Student loans, car loan (0%), and a personal loan we used to consolidate our credit card debt. We were late with payments all the time for about two years. This is not the case anymore! Getting the personal loan to pay off the credit cards was a huge wake up call. Because we got a better interest rate we pay the same amount we were paying on the cards every month, but now they will be paid off fully in five years instead of the 20+ making minimum payments. The interest rate on personal loan is 10.19%, but we were paying penalty rates of 23.99% on the credit cards. 

We are managing our money a lot better now and haven't had a late payment in months- huge progress for us. We are about to have a substantially higher income for 6 months while he is on military orders and are planning on paying off our car (~$4,000, 0%) and his student loan (~$5,000, 2.99%). This will lower our monthly bills by $540 so we can double our payment on the personal loan. I know the personal loan is much higher interest, but we wouldn't be able to pay it off in the time we'll have, so our monthly bills would remain unchanged.

I checked our credit scores this morning. My FICO score is 696 and my husband's FICO score is 623. We were excited because our scores are coming up. This made sense to me because we have no evictions or collections on our scores, only late payments, and we've been improving that recently. However, when I checked our credit scores with our bank, my vantage score is 596 and my husband's vantage is also 596. 

Why are the two scores so different? Which one would be considered by apartments? We will need to apply for an apartment in another state while he's on orders. When he finishes those, we'd like to be in a better position to buy a small house. Which score would be considered for a mortgage? We'd be using the VA loan.",finance

I'm very interested in seeing the Fourth Amendment properly applied to data. I think there is a good argument that people have contract-based property rights in much of the data they share and generate online, and that data is a ""paper"" or ""effect"" for constitutional/Fourth Amendment purposes. That's not intuitive for a lot of people or courts, but there are even harder Fourth Amendment problems to grapple with, such as protection in the context of facial recognition and persistent public surveillance via drones, dirigibles, and satellites.

I'm a big Bitcoin/cryptocurrency fan. It's a fascinating and powerful technology with delightful potential for world-changing improvements in economic development and liberty. Those who follow this field know that the Bitcoin community is wracked by internal dissension these days. The thesis I have to offer (for what it's worth) is that Bitcoin needs a great deal more ""social capital."" That means academic study, general awareness and knowledge, regulatory forbearance, technical development, and political skills among Bitcoin leadership. At scale, personal skills are political skills. The Bitcoin world badly lacks them.

Another priority of mine is REAL ID, the U.S. national ID program, which I've been working to defeat for the last decade or so. You may have seen signs at airports about ID requirements or heard about debates in your state legislature. That's the federal government working to corral you into a national ID system that has few security benefits and high privacy- and dollar-costs. We should really get away from centralized, government-provided identity systems and start using systems that are just as effective at getting things done (including providing what security identification can) without threatening our power and liberties.

A final note/nit: While this is r/politics, I think of myself as more of a policy person. I'm interested in getting good policies enacted no matter who is in office. So I don't have a lot to say about the political horse races. I'm against pretty much all the politicians.

personalfinance,Canceling/Cashing out IRA to pay off student loans,"I have recently been extremely motivated to shift my way of viewing my spending and want to put as much of my income as I can to pay off my student loans as quickly as I can. While thinking about this, I read a comment about someone stopping there 401k payments and putting that towards paying off loans instead. This got me thinking about my own IRA (a measly amount as I've only been working and out of college for a little over a year) and whether it would be best to stop adding to it and instead put that money towards my loans. Additionally, would it be best to cash out the IRA and pay that towards the loans? One question I can anticipate is about company match of the IRA. I am going to be moving companies very soon so that will no longer be a factor in this.

A few loan details:
$28,000 Private loans at 5.9%
$40,000 Federal loans at ~4.5%

I guess the obvious thought is that this amount would in the end 'save' me more money as I am saving myself from the interest payments that are sunk costs if I don't eliminate them ASAP.

personalfinance,Medical school loan repayment with spouse with higher income,"Hey all, so I am in the last few months of medical school and will be starting residency in July. With a fiancee finishing her NP program and in a similar amount of debt, I have some questions as to the plan that is best for us.

&amp;nbsp;

Some information:
I have roughly $91,000 in government unsubsidized student loans. I will be making about $55,000/year for the next four years.
My fiancee has about $80,000 in government unsubsidized student loans, and will be making $80,000/year.
Our loan interest rates average out to about 6%.
There is a high chance that I go into private practice after residency. 

&amp;nbsp;

My understanding is that with income based repayment methods such as PAYE and REPAYE, if we file taxes MFJ our combined income is used to determine our monthly payments, which would make them very high and we would pay more cumulatively. On the other hand if we file taxes MFS we will not receive the tax breaks that we otherwise would (which to be honest I don't know how much these tax breaks are for).

Is my understanding correct? Are either of these plans even worth it if I don't quality for PSLF? What is the best repayment strategy for us? Any other advice? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Car Refinance Questions - What Option is Best?,"I am a part-time working community college student paying for my car. It is a 2009 mustang with just over 60,000 miles on it. Through the company that I bought the car from, my monthly payment is around $315 for 5 years. The interest is crazily high, over 8%. I've been making that payment for about 6 months now. My parents are state employees, so I visited the credit union and learned about a few options I have as far as refinancing the car with them instead. I still owe around $1300 more on the car vs. the max amount they can offer me, therefore to qualify for either option, I would first need to pay the $1300 out of my savings (which I can comfortably do). 

The first option is a 5 year loan at an interest rate of 4.75% and a monthly payment of $263, and a total payoff of $15,700. I would be back tracking the 6 months I've paid $315, but it would be a much lower payment at a much more agreeable interest rate. 
The second option is a 6 year loan at an interest rate of 4.75% and a monthly payment of $224, and a total payoff of $16,070. This would take me back a year and 6 months, back to a full 6 years of payments. 

Both options sound much nicer simply because of the interest rate nearly being cut in half and because of the more manageable monthly payments. Having a lower monthly payment will allow me to seek future plans such as apartment rent when I move on to university. 
I've thought about the pros and cons of each option, but I was just wondering if anyone with more experience might have an opinion on either option and which would be best.

MachineLearning,[D] An idea to parallelize BackProp (BP),"### **First of all, who am I?**

You're an imaginary interviewer. Ask away!

### **I'm having a déjà vu. Didn't you already post this stuff yesterday?**

Yes, but I realized I did a bad job at explaining and introducing my idea.

### **Why sharing an idea instead of trying it out first and seeing if it works?**

I don't get paid to do research in ML, nor to do ML. Actually, I don't get paid to do anything at all.

This means that everything I do is purely for fun, and now I don't feel like boring myself to death implementing this thing in Theano. I prefer to watch [Silver's course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0) about RL.

Also, I don't have the resources to conduct proper tests.

### **Why should anyone do your homework for you?**

I prefer to think of it as the draft of a project that anyone can contribute to.

In the near future I might implement this thing and do some tests.

### **Why parallelize BackProp?**

For efficiency reasons, mainly. In classic BP only one layer can do any computation at any time because:

1. it needs data from the previous layer in the forward pass
2. it needs data from the next layer in the backward pass

### **But isn't BP inherently sequential?**

Yes, but maybe we can relax it to make it amenable to parallelization.

### **What kind of relaxation are we talking about?**

We delay the updates to the net.

### **Can you give a real life example?**

Imagine you learn by taking exams and reviewing the grades and corrections provided by your teacher.

In classic BP you:

1. take exam E1
2. receive corrections for exam E1
3. take exam E2
4. receive corrections for exam E2
5. ...

In Relaxed BP (RBP) you:

1. take exam E1
2. take exam E2
3. take exam E3
4. receive corrections for E1
5. take exam E4
6. receive corrections for E2
7. take exam E5
8. receive corrections for E3
9. ...

### **How much faster would it be?**

Theoretically, it should be N times faster, where N is the number of layers in the net.

### **So all nodes/layers do computations at the same time?**

Exactly. Each node does a step of forward pass and a step of backward pass.

### **Can we use classic libraries such as Theano?**

Yes:

1. Each layer/node has its own shared variables.

At each step of training:

2. A new sample/example is fed to the first node from the left.
3. All samples move to the right by one node.
4. When a sample moves to the right it gets transformed by the node it goes through (**Forward pass**).
5. New gradient information is fed to the last node from the right.
6. Each piece of gradient information moves to the left and gets transformed by the node it goes through (**Backward pass**).

### **If it takes time for a single sample to go through a net which is continuously updated, how can the sample see a consistent net?**

The weights of the layers are not of the same age (age = number of updates).

Have a look at this picture:

     X-&gt;
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W5    W4    W3    W2    W1
        
1. X is the sample which enters the net from the left.
2. Wi are the weights.
3. If Wi is below Lj then it belongs to layer j.
4. The i in Wi is the age of W.
5. The initial net has weights W1.
6. When a weight Wi is updated it becomes W(i+1).

At each time step, X goes one step to the right and each weight is updated:

     X
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W5    W4    W3    W2    W1

           X
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W6    W5    W4    W3    W2

                 X
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W7    W6    W5    W4    W3

                       X
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W8    W7    W6    W5    W4

                             X
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W9    W8    W7    W6    W5

X goes always through layers of age 5 and, therefore, sees a consistent net of age 5.

### **What about the other samples?**

No problem:

     X5    X4    X3    X2    X1
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W5    W4    W3    W2    W1

     X6    X5    X4    X3    X2
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W6    W5    W4    W3    W2

     X7    X6    X5    X4    X3
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W7    W6    W5    W4    W3

     X8    X7    X6    X5    X4
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W8    W7    W6    W5    W4

     X9    X8    X7    X6    X5
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W9    W8    W7    W6    W5

In this case, sample i sees only a net of age i.

### **But how can older weights be on the left if the updates in the backward pass start from the right?**

The updates are delayed until they reach the first node:

        --------&gt;--------&gt;----------+
                                    |
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5  |
        ^                           v
        |                           |
        +-------&lt;--------&lt;----------+
        
### **And what about the labels? Wouldn't samples and labels get mixed up?**

Not if things are properly synchronized:

     X9    X8    X7    X6    X5     &lt;-- Y5  Y6  Y7  Y8  Y9 ... 
        L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
        W9    W8    W7    W6    W5

As you can see, Xi always ""meet"" Yi and, thus, we can compute the right gradient starting from the right node.
        
### **How can we propagate the error back if the net got updated in the meantime?**

We need to memorize some of the previous nets.

### **How many?**

Basically, if the net has N layers, we need to memorize 2N - 1 copies of weights (+ some additional information) to the layers.

### **But then the computing time will go up by 2N times!?**

No, each operation is still O(1). We keep a queue of 2N - 1 elements, but we only access 2 elements per node at each time, just like in the classic BP.

### **I'm not convinced. Could you show me a picture?**

Here you go:

    X5    X4    X3    X2    X1    &lt;-- Y1   Y2   Y3 ...
       L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
       W1    W2    W3    W4   (W5)
       W2    W3    W4    W5    W6
       W3    W4    W5   (W6)   W7
       W4    W5    W6    W7    W8
       W5    W6   (W7)   W8    W9
       W6    W7    W8    W9    W10
       W7   (W8)   W9    W10   W11
       W8    W9    W10   W11   W12
      (W9)   W10   W11   W12   W13

We have 5 layers and each layer maintains 2*5 - 1 = 9 elements.

The Wi in parentheses are currently active and determine the age of the corresponding layer.

So, in the forward pass:

1. X5 sees W9
2. X4 sees W8
3. X3 sees W7
4. X2 sees W6
5. X1 sees W5

The Wi are not just weights.

To be precise:

1. all the Wi *above* the Wi between parentheses must also contain the input to the layer, whereas
2. all the Wi *below* must contain the gradient of the loss wrt the output.

### **This sort of makes sense, but how do we do the updates in parallel?**

Let's have another look at the picture above:

    X5    X4    X3    X2    X1    &lt;-- Y1   Y2   Y3 ...
       L1    L2    L3    L4    L5
       W1    W2    W3    W4   (W5)
       W2    W3    W4    W5    W6
       W3    W4    W5   (W6)   W7
       W4    W5    W6    W7    W8
       W5    W6   (W7)   W8    W9
       W6    W7    W8    W9    W10
       W7   (W8)   W9    W10   W11
       W8    W9    W10   W11   W12
      (W9)   W10   W11   W12   W13

This is the hard part to understand:

1. X1 and Y1 ""meet"" and L5 can compute gradient information relative to (X1, Y1).
2. L5 is currently at age 5 (because W5 is in parentheses).
3. L5 computes its own W14 from X1, Y1 and its own W5.
4. In general, Wi is always used to compute W(i+2N-1), where N is the number of layers.
5. More specifically, Wi is always used to compute W(i+9) in this example.

6. W13 of L5 has been computed, at the previous step, from W4 (which was then dropped).
8. W4 of L4 belongs to an old net (the current net is of age 6 from the point of view of L4).
9. W4 of L4 can and must also remember its old input.
10. L4 computes its own W13 by using W13 from L5 (for gradient info) and its own W4 (for input and weights).

11. The same way, L3 computes its own W12 from its own W3 and W12 of L4.

I'm 90% sure.

### **How can we boostrap this... *thing*?**

We should be able to use zeros and repeated weights (or something like that):

btc,"Adjustable-blocksize-cap (ABC) clients give miners exactly zero additional power. BU, Classic, and other ABC clients are really just an argument in code form, shattering the illusion that devs are part of the governance structure.","Spot the difference between how stakeholders can coordinate to fork to 2MB in a Core world vs. in an adjustable-blocksize-cap (ABC) client world: 

- Core: miners and nodes coordinate to mod their Core code to increase the cap to 2MB

- ABC clients: miners and nodes coordinate to adjust their client settings to increase the cap to 2MB

Where is any extra power handed to miners? Where is any power taken away from nodes? How is the situation with ABC clients any different than under Core? We can point only to the difference in convenience, and even that was bound to be erased sooner or later by an enterprising developer (and now by several development teams). 

What does it tell you that Core and its supporters are up in arms about a change that *merely makes something more convenient for users* and couldn't be prevented from happening anyway? Attacking the adjustable blocksize feature in BU and Classic as ""dangerous"" is a kind of trap, as it is an implicit admission that Bitcoin was being protected only by a small barrier of inconvenience, and a completely temporary one at that. If this was such a ""danger"" or such a vector for an ""attack,"" how come we never heard about it before? 

And even if we accept the remarkable premise that somehow this small inconvenience was the chewing gum and bailing wire holding the network together, it already would imply that letting stakeholders make their own choices is dangerous and that the only way to keep Bitcoin working is to spoonfed stances on controversial consensus settings to all user. 

Even if we accept the improbable premise that inconvenience is the great bastion holding Bitcoin together *and* the paternalistic premise that stakeholders need to be fed consensus using a spoon of inconvenience, we still must ask, who shall do the spoonfeeding?

Core accepts these two amazing premises and further declares that Core alone shall be allowed to do the spoonfeeding. Or rather, if you really want to you can be spoonfed by other implementation clients like libbitcoin and btcd as long as they are all feeding you the same stances on controversial consensus settings as Core does. 

Core and many of its supporters consider anyone trying to feed you anything else an outright attack on Bitcoin itself (examples: XT feeding you BIP101, the old Classic feeding you 2MB). More remarkable still, these people also consider anyone *refusing to spoonfed you anything* as an attack (examples: BU, new Classic, and other ABC clients). 

This all of course implies the only non-attack is to vest all control and authority in the Core developers, specifically a few committers and the maintainer of a single repository. This mindset that considers everything else an ""attack"" is implicitly a centralized governance model, not specifically because *Core* is centralized but because all dev teams are. 

The kind of adversarial thinking bitcoiners are familiar with easily demonstrates that any single dev team is ripe for co-option. The only protection against one team holding the community over a barrel on controversial matters is to have many mature competing teams, and better still would be if none of these teams try to bake their own coders' stances on controversies into the code offerings by hiding the control panel for those settings away from the user. 

Such practices manage to be both childish and paternalistic, while lacking any material and sustainable effect of saving supposedly hapless stakeholders from making the wrong decision on controversial matters. 

It is high time the community see central planning and abuse of power for what it is, and reject both: 

- Throw off central planning by removing petty ""inconvenience walls"" (such as baked-in, dev-recommended blocksize caps) that interfere with stakeholders coordinating choices amongst themselves on controversial matters, without forcing those who disagree with the dev teams recommendations to switch dev teams

- Make such abuse of power impossible by encouraging many competing implementations to grow and blossom",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is there a way to negotiate a lower interest rate on my student loans?,"Hi /r/personalfinance

I'm a 27 y/o with 40k in student loan debt at 5.25% interest rate. I've made payments on time, and usually over the minimum as I'm fortunate enough to be living below my means with a comfortable salary. I have a sufficient safety saving and am maxing out my Roth IRA contributions each year, in addition to throwing some (a small amount) of money at higher-risk investments in the interest of growth/learning about investing.

I'm presently making 1k/mo payment on the loans.  I'm planning on applying to graduate school, so I may not be able to maintain those payments starting fall 2018 and will be incurring more debt. Credit scores are ~750

Is there a way to contact the holder of my loan and request a lower interest rate?",finance
technology,"FYI: On the FCC, it's always the Democrats who fight to preserve net neutrality and to stop increases in media ownership concentration. It's always Republicans who fight the Democrats on these issues, working in favor of giant corporations and against the best interests of the public.","For those who aren't aware, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) works as follows: There are 5 Commissioners. These 5 people basically, on their own, determine the regulations that dictate how our media system works, including things like how many media companies own the American media, as well as whether or not we will preserve net neutrality. Whenever the FCC votes on new regulations, the majority vote wins.

Each new president essentially gets to determine who will take 3 of those positions, which means that each new president virtually has all of the power to decide the regulations that decide how our media system works for several years thereafter. In effect, if the President is a Republican then the Republicans on the FCC decide our media regulations. If a Democrat is the President, the Democrats on the FCC decide our media regulations.

Over the past 30 or so years, it has always been the Commissioners appointed by Democrats who have fought to do things like stop increases in media ownership concentration and preserve net neutrality. And it has always been the Republicans who have fought against Democrats on these issues.

Right now, the only FCC Commissioner who is truly committed to standing up to save Net Neutrality is the Democrat. There are currently 2 vacancies on the FCC, waiting for appointments, so for the time being there are two Republican Commissioners and one Democrat. Once the appointments go through, there will be 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats. But as long as the Republicans have the presidency, the Republicans will hold power in the FCC.

Just thought you'd all like to know.

personalfinance,What are good metrics for comparing online savings accounts? What did you look for when choosing one?,"~~I tried searching through PF for a discussion on this, but couldn't find anything. If this has been asked before and I just couldn't find it, I apologize.~~

I've been looking for a place to park my Emergency Fund/savings. I've settled on an online bank of some sort, and I'm comparing between [Ally](https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/), [Goldman Sachs](https://www.gsbank.com/savings-products/online-savings.html), [Barclays](https://www.banking.barclaysus.com/online-savings.html), and [Synchrony](https://www.synchronybank.com/banking/products/high-yield-saving/#).

Right now, I've got $4000 I can put in right away, and I estimate that I'll regularly be depositing ~$100/month for a while. (More than that, actually, but right now I can't count on a consistent income, so I'm being very conservative with my income.) I live with my parents, so I don't expect that any emergency would be severe enough that I need access to my money immediately, so a day or three delay in being able to access my funds is acceptable. That said, I may end up needing to use it soon for dental work, and while I hope to work something out with my dentist and my insurance company, right now I'm planning for the possibility that my savings will be nearly depleted to pay for it.

The only points of comparison I can think of off the top of my head are the interest rate, accessibility, and any fees (and/or minimum balances) for opening/maintaining the account. But I feel there are probably a lot of other things I should be considering, lest I be hit with a nasty surprise later on.

Any suggestions on other things I should look at? If you have an online savings account, what made you choose that one, or what made you reject another one?",finance

Questions - 
Is shopping for personal loan similar to the home mortgage for the most part?
Would it help to have my personal loan with the same Mortgage company where I have my home loan?
What are my chances of getting the personal loan approved knowing that I have a very recent loan on my name for home?

personalfinance,Should I sell my stock to pay cash to house or take out a mortgage?,"My wife and I are planning to buy a house in the next few months. We are moving back to our home state and expecting a baby in September. We are pre-approved/qualified for a mortgage of up to $580,000 with an approximate interest rate of 4%.based on my income alone. My wife will be changing jobs for the move, so we have decided to put the mortgage in my name alone. We are anticipating to spend about $450,000 on a house.


I have about $600,000 in stocks from when my start-up company was acquired. We are unsure if we should sell the stocks and pay cash for the house or take out a mortgage. Logically, if my investments could yield a higher return than the rate of the mortgage--it would make sense to leave the majority of the money in the market. However, no one can guarantee the return rate of the stocks. There is the also the advantage of living without debt.


Additional Info

-Wife and I both invest in our company retirement plans and have about $50,000 in retirement savings

-Outstanding debt is $25,000 of wife student loans which will be paid off in the next few months

-My annual income is approximately $120,000 and my wife makes about $35,000 a year (working part time)

personalfinance,Amended return: What should I be expecting?,"Posted in the tax thread but no response for a couple days.

In 2016 (and for several years prior) I was a work-from-home employee with some money coming from an overseas company, which did not provide US tax forms to employees. I filed my taxes using TurboTax about a week ago. The software showed that my wife and I would owe about $1,100 federally and about $320 to the state. Because money is a little tight right now, we did not send payment yet, intending to put checks in the mail closer to the deadline in April.

After filing electronically and receiving emails that both state and IRS had received my returns, I looked back at previous tax years and realized my accountant last year had deducted work-from-home expenses against my untaxed income (buying a computer, desk, home office space, etc.) to lower my taxable income. When TurboTax had asked me to upgrade to the higher paid level to use the self-employment part of taxes, I had stupidly skipped it. I went back into TurboTax and entered my expenses for 2016 on an amended return. 

When completed, the amended return shows that the IRS owes me a refund of $1,350 and the state owes me a refund of $310. (I know I need to print this and mail it separately, and I'm doing so very soon.)

* 1. Should I expect a net federal refund of $250 ($1,350 - $1,100 = $250) or of $1,350?
* 2. Same question for state. Am I owed a net state refund of $310 or do I actually owe the state $10?
* 3. Because amended returns take a long time to process, is the IRS going to bill me interest and penalties against the $1,100 it originally thinks I owe, or will my amended return sent before the filing deadline get me out of that?",finance

personalfinance,Getting around wage garnishment,"So I was watching a video on youtube the other day and the person in the video mentioned that it is possible to get around a wage garnishment by having all of your money in each paycheck taken out and sent to the IRS as taxes. Then at the end of the year you would receive your year's earnings (minus what you actually owed in taxes) back as a tax refund, and a tax refund cannot be intercepted in transit. As long as you don't deposit the money into a bank account (because then they can take it from there) you effectively bypassed the wage garnishment. He went on to say that after several years of doing this, eventually they would stop renewing the garnishment and paying the fees while not collecting anything.

Of course this means you would have to live without having earned your salary for that year, but this struck me as odd and I had never heard this before. Is this actually a legit tactic?

Edit: I should mention this was in relation to credit card debt only.

**EDIT: UPON ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS INDEED LEGITIMATE. **

""If you're expecting a tax refund but have concerns about creditors garnishing it, you may be worrying too much. Federal law allows only state and federal government agencies (not individual or private creditors) to take your refund as payment toward a debt. However, once you deposit the refund into your bank account, these rules no longer apply. Depending on the laws of your state, private creditors may have access to those funds."" Source: https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Taxes-101/Who-Can-Garnish-an-Income-Tax-Refund-/INF19738.html

-And- 

""Thus, if you owe money on a credit card and your wages are garnished, it doesn’t automatically mean your federal refund status funds will disappear. That debt is for you to pay. Unless your credit card company specifically requests the money from your refund status, it is up to you to pay off what you owe.

Even in that special case, the IRS would likely just ignore the order. They are not under any obligation to pay a private creditor funds from any taxpayer’s federal refund status. When that money goes into your bank account, however, that may be a different story."" Source: https://www.irs.com/articles/wage-garnishment-tax-refund",finance

personalfinance,"Made about $35k from w-2 job, make about $180 from selling on etsy, claiming a loss of ~$4k on schedule C, do you think I will be audited?","I live in California. I had obamacare for 2016, and underestimated how much I would make so I got hit with the $720 ""penalty"" if you will. So, here is my breakdown as follows. 

--From my w-2 job I made around $35,200

--Planning on putting about $1,000 into a traditional ira for the tax break

--I sold about $175 on etsy selling jewelry and photo prints. I switched over to just selling photo prints though during the year. Of the $175 only about $33 was from the photo side. 

--marketing costs around $50 in etsy ads for the year

--about $190 in website hosting fees for the year for the photography side

-- $3556 in misc expenses (I bought a new-used better camera and lenses than what I had been using previously.) Nothing cost over $2500. I ordered it all on Amazon so I have records. 

I have it set to take the camera equipment as a full deduction instead of depreciation over the next five years. 

My schedule C will be a loss of $3673

So with all this I will owe $105 in federal taxes and get back $100 from the state. 

Do you think I would get audited over this? Could they classify my photography as a hobby and not a potential business?",finance
personalfinance,Owe former college money,"Hello,

Just wanted to ask for advice about my current situation. I have no help from parents (mom was abusive, left home after graduated hs, dad not involved).

 I am 18 and briefly attended college for a week before withdrawing fall 2016 semester (was 17 at time if that matters). All my tuition was covered by federal aid, but I owe the school $2400 because I didnt earn the aid that was given to me by the govt.

Things are rough financially for me right now, I am just starting to work full time and I have not been able to pay anything I owe since when I withdrew. I would like to put what I have left away so I can start building a savings account.

My former college will not let me enroll in a payment plan because the money I owe isn't a loan, so they want $2400 upfront. I could just make payments of $100 monthly but that won't guarentee that they won't put the debt into collections. Their website stated that after over one semester passes from the due date (which will happen once fall 2017 rolls around/this one ends) they will report the debt to collections.

I also recently got approved for a credit card ($300 limit, capital one) which is good because I want to start building a credit score for myself. I am very responsible financially, never late on any of my other bills (rent, utilities, etc.) and am just trying to get my life started here. I do live with my boyfriend, and we split expenses. My new job will make things easier and I should have a little more money, but it would take me months to be able to get $2400 It would surely devastate my credit if the $2400 went to collections, and I am looking to avoid having that happen. 

With that, what would be advisable? There is little reaching out to the financial aid office will do for me. I have tried with them already. I could try to get a personal loan and pay it off ASAP, but other than that I don't foresee many other options. I need good credit because in a few months I want to move forward with my application for the TSA which will pay me a lot more than what I am making now, which means I can pay off the potential personal loan faster, but the reason why I am waiting is because they do a credit check. If my credit has nothing on it but a $2400 debt in collections, I lose that opportunity and will continue to be stuck in the hole I am in now.

Thank you for all of those who reply! I truly appreciate it.

tldr: Owe college $2400 to pay back aid (not a loan), cant pay that upfront unless I take out a personal loan. Young and dont want it being reported to collections and ruining credit.",finance
investing,"Are U.S. bonds (Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and redeemable before maturity?","I've learned from my book that, only U.S. Savings bonds (with maturity of 30 years) are un-marketable to other people and also face forfeiting of three months of interest if redeemed in less than 5 years. So my understanding from this information is that for at least Savings bonds, the government does buy back those. So...

1. I guess there's a second-hand market existing somewhere that make transactions of bonds (T-Bills, T-Notes, and T-Bonds)?

2. What if a person wants the Treasury to buy back its bonds (T-Bills, T-Notes, and T-Bonds) that haven't reached the date of maturity INSTEAD OF selling at that second-hand bond market? Is it even possible?

3. What happens if an investor wants it redeemed after 5 years but less than 30 years? Say like... 25 years. Would penalty be same ""losing 3 months of interest rate""?

I have two so far, one that I got in 2015 which has an interest rate of 27% (It's the card for the store I work at, I don't leave a balance and it gives me discounts and whatnot), and another one that I got about three or four months ago with a 24% interest rate. I mostly got that one because it ended up giving me a nice boost to my score with the higher total limit. However now my new bank is offering me one with 1.5% cash back across the board with other specific things in different ranges (2% gas, 10% on restaurants for 6 months, etc.) and only a 14% rate. Would it be wise to take this one and use it primarily over the other two?

Forex,Short EUR long CZK,"Hi guys, have been thinking about a position in the above due to the following reasons. Any comments would be great. 

Pegged at 27 EURCZK to boost inflation since 2013. It hit the 2% target in Dec '16, then recorded figures of 2.2%, 2.4% and 2.5% in Q1 '17. 

The current peg is also causing the CNB to sell bucket loads of T-Bills (rising exponentially - 16b worth in '16 and 20b in Jan/Feb '17 already) which is becoming unsustainable at 60% of GDP. 

IRs are 0.05% so there's not much they can do from a Monetary Policy perspective to weaken the currency, and with Europe still looking a little shakey from a political perspective it doesn't seem likely that CZK will weaken naturally. 

The central bank claimed not to be looking at removing the peg until Q2, however with the rate of inflation rising so quickly it doesn't seem out of the question to see it a little earlier. 

The next CNB meeting is on 30th March. 

Thoughts welcome.",finance

Great job, two cars paid off, maxed out IRA and 401k.
Own our first home with 80k left on the loan...

Alright, we save on avg 2,500$ per month. This is after our retirment accounts and all bills. Oddly, enough in an odd spot.. Not sure if we should pay off our house. Which is not our long term house. Other option is to start a taxable investment account.

Our home loan is 4.5% interest rate, not great. Not terrible. Could easily have our house paid for in a few years, if I buckled it down. Just not sure if that is our best option. We do hope to have children in the near future, which obviously changes things. Why we already based everything off of my income only already.

personalfinance,Thoughts on paying off car,"I have no debts outside of a car loan and I have been trying to pay  down as fast as possible.

Car loan original balance = $20,387 opened in 2014

Car loan remaining balance = $6,014

Interest rate = 7.69%

Savings = $5,000

Annual Salary = $70,200

I posted previously on this forum about my budget and paying down my car debt.  It was suggested that I take the 20% I was putting in savings every month and pay that towards the car to pay it faster.  The logic was that it would be difficult to get 7.69% returns if my money was elsewhere.

I am coming close to paying it off.  My question is, should I take $3,500-4,000 out of my savings and pay a lump sum and pay it off next month?  This would leave $1,000-$1,500 in my savings and free up an additional $1,611 in cash flow.  I currently get paid bi-weekly and put $555 and $353 from savings.  Second half of month I pay $350 and $353 from savings.

Is my logic sound to use a lump sum to pay it down and pay it off next month then dump the remaining $1611 into my savings account for 3-4 months to replenish it.

Keep in mind I am also in the process of getting approved for a mortgage and buying a house in the next 6 months with the assistance from family.  I am slightly worried my credit score will dive temporarily once I pay off the auto loan.  I have seen people post a similar experience in the past.

personalfinance,Solar panel tax credit question,"My husband and I are thinking of installing solar panels at our house this year, and would claim the tax credit next year when we file. We went through everything with a provider last night, and are curious about one thing related to the federal tax credit. This is probably a stupid question, but we want to be 100% clear on this point because it's a major selling point for the system (and we want to adjust our withholdings accordingly if necessary, see below).

The language on the IRS publication says ""If your credit is more than the tax you owe, you can carry forward the unused portion of this credit to next year’s tax return."" We're confused about how this plays out in practice - if we withhold the proper amount of taxes throughout the year and are not due a refund when we file prior to entering this credit, will this credit make us get a refund as long as the total tax that we owe for 2017 (our total tax liability) is greater than the amount of the credit? Or, will the credit only apply towards taxes that we owe when we submit our refund? 

For example, say our federal tax liability (prior to entering the credit when we file our taxes) is $20,000 and we withhold exactly $20,000 throughout the year. Then, when we file our taxes, we get this credit for $6000 for installing solar panels (edited to add: total system cost is $20,000, and the credit is for 30% of the system cost). Would we get a refund of $6000? Or would we have to apply this $6000 to future years (which we could do by lowering our withholdings for the next year)?",finance

personalfinance,"I've been ""getting a promotion"" for 3 months now, trying to figure out the balance between being patient and being disgruntled.","Bit of backstory:

I was hired last May as a full-time temp, promoted last September to full-time employee. That promotion came with a raise, about $50/week more, whatever that rounds out to. Since last November, I've been in vague talks about the avenues of promotion within this company, because management has told me they see me as an asset, and in January I sat down with my boss to discuss my wanting to be promoted. 

Right now I do the work of two people, the receptionist/office role with the workload of a team support member, the split of the day is about 40/60 workload-wise. The problem I'm in, and what I've been vocal to management about, is that my position is unsustainable. It's basically the catch-all for everything in the office that everyone above me can't get done: literal team support in that I get tasks from every team member, but there is no real ceiling to how much work could be given to me, especially because of how short-staffed/behind this office is, yada yada yada. 

In January it was ""weeks"" before they were hiring a receptionist to replace me and promote me to full-time team support, in February it was ""soon"", and now in March, after another meeting about it where I again expressed my concerns about wanting the promotion, but not wanting to be put into another position that is just the same unsustainable role, got a similar talk of how they view me as an important asset, my growth at the company is more important than others, yada yada yada. It seems, if only from these talks, that they are open to promoting me to a position above team support that would be more aligned with managing office workflows to improve overall workload efficiency.

I have a feeling that they're stalling until my yearly review to give me the raise and the promotion, which to me is ridiculous, as I feel I should be being paid more already. One problem is there are no other team support or receptionists in our branch, so I have no barometer on what my pay should be, but from everything I hear our branch is much faster paced than the rest of ours across the country. On a final note, I *do* feel that my boss is open to discussion, but this whole process has made me feel kind of gross about this ""negotiating"", if you will, and my fear is that when they do come to me with an offer, it's still going to be underwhelming on several fronts.

#Macroeconomics: 

**Beginner** 

Any current intro to macro textbook.  It's best to stick to a university level intro book here because most of those won't try to push any sort of agenda.

**Intermediate**

Read up on money and banking. The standard textbook is Fredric Miskin (again get the latest edition). I thought the book was dry as dust (sorry Rick!) but it does go through the basics. If you are a serious investor you need to inoculate yourself against all the fairy tales from Austrians/bitcoiners/gold bugs/FED-haters generally that are floating around on the internet.

Another really great book is David Moss ""Macroeconomics."" It's a very concise book that he uses at Harvard b-school to give an overview to MBAs. It's actually more basic than a textbook like Blanchard, but it's so short and well-organized that it will give you the big picture AFTER you been immersed in the details.

Ed Leamer's ""Macroeconomic Patterns and Stories"" cannot be recommended enough for investors. He is a serious econometrician, but here he emphasizes the importance of ""Pictures, Words, and Numbers: In that order."" The book is all about forecasting the business cycle and gets you thinking about wrestling with the data. His examples are mostly US based (a large fairly closed economy) so you'll need to keep that in mind when you consider small open economies (like say the Netherlands).

Read Carlin and Soskice ""Macroeonomics"" - again the latest edition. So why another macro book? It doesn't hurt to look at things from a (slightly) different perspective. The explanation of the New Keynesian 3-equation model in the book is among the best. Go find the syllabus used at Oxford for their undergrad macro course to get some supplemental materials and essay topics.

**ADVANCED**

Read all the reports and releases that come from the main central banks (Fed, ECB, BoJ, BoE). This is indispensable for being a macro investor. Don't rely only on the summarized, filtered version from the news. You want to get inside the head of Yellen, Draghi, Kuroda, and Carney and the rest of the people on the monetary policy committees. How are they interpreting the news, what mental and formal models are they using, where do they disagree? Modern central banking has moved toward policy transparency so investors need to be well-calibrated to what is being said and follow their lead in many cases.

Get a book on economic indicators. There a few standard ones somewhat skewed to the US audience. Goldman Sachs at least in the past, puts out guides to macro releases. Don't worry if you can't get your hands on these, just go to the relevant government agency website and there will be more details than you could ever want. Of course, it will take experience to understand how markets react to the different macro announcements.

Get up to speed on market-based indicators. These will tend to be the most up-to-date, forward looking indicators since they are based on traded financial instruments. An example is Fed funds futures from which you can extract the market's expectation of a rate change. There are lots of traded instruments that will give you insight into what the market thinks is going on for interest rates, inflation, etc. Options on equity indices will also give you information. If you need some background, get Hull's excellent introductory book on options.

Read the article on money creation from the Bank of England. Resident mod (and I hear also a very good cook in real life) /u/MasterCookSwag

often provides this link in this sub when battling the above mentioned goldbugs, bit coiners and other loonies. You'll find that it is additive even after you've read Mishkin.

Read the book ""Economic Policy"" by Bénassy-Quéré, Coeuré, Jacquet, and Pisani-Ferry. This book is written by a group of academics/policymakers and ties policymaking to economic theory. It's not very technical, but covers a lot of ground and is very applied. It will help you understand what people at central banks and finance ministries are thinking about.

Finally, lest you think you know it all at this point, check out Uribe and Schmitt-Grohe's forthcoming book ""Open Economy Macroeconomics,"" a draft manuscript of which is available for free here. The website also has lectures slides, computer code, and data so that you can really learn the material. Unfortunately, unless you are technically (i.e. mathematically) well-trained just reading the previous books in this list will not prepare you for this book since serious macro requires a lot more than curve-shifting. (Curve shifting is enough to be a very good investor, but if you want to know what the experts are talking about, you need to go beyond. But go in with your eyes open and read Romer's recent essay on the state of affairs.)

If necessary (for example to understand the Uribe book), take a step back and learn some of the technical foundations. Read David Romer's ""Advanced Macroeconomics"" and work through the superb programming exercises at Tom Sargent and John Stachurski's online course at Quantitative Economics, which can be done in Python or Julia. If you need to take another step back, read Stachurski's recent book ""A Primer in Econometric Theory"" for a gentle introduction to probability and estimation.

personalfinance,Rolling over 401k into my Roth or setup traditional IRA?,"Last year I changed FT jobs and kept my old job as a very part time weekend gig.  The location I worked at PT is now closing down and I was laid off.  Now my 401k ($1700 at vanguard in target date mutual fund) is ready to be rolled over. 

I have a Roth IRA at vanguard with some stocks/etfs and one high expense mutual funds I am planning on moving into a lower cost Vanguard index fund.  My wife and I are in the &lt;75900 federal income tax bracket and have no state income tax.  This amount will likely wipe out next year's tax refund but I likely wouldn't have to pay.    

I am wondering what people think about rolling this 1700 over into my Roth.  Is it worth consolidating into this account and getting more money to work with in my Roth?  Or should I set up a traditional IRA?  We are in the (hopefully) lowest tax bracket we would be in our lives.  We are contributing to retirement at my current employer 8% with 8% match, my wife's retirement at her employer 6% with 6% match, and to my Roth and my wife's Roth on a monthly basis (not maxed out.)

personalfinance,"U.S. Federal student loan defaulting, what happens?","I am fully aware student loans don't follow the same rules as other loans (bankruptcy, settling, ect.) There are still some questions I have that I've never found clear answers for.

What really happens if you default on them?  I'd imagine annoying phone calls and bad credit, but is that everything? (Answered: Collections, tax returns seized, bad credit)

If you die and have no spouse and no children, what happens to the debt? (Answered: Not true, but debt collection can collect from your estate.)

Is there a way to shield a future spouse from the bad credit?  Do I just not get married if I don't want to destroy their financial life?

I've heard people are getting their social security checks garnished for student debt.  I'm guessing that will not be an issue for me in the future (20's). (Answered: Shouldn't be relying on Social Security for retirement anyway)


Situation because people will want specifics:  I am in my late 20's, and my degrees turned out to not be useful (first degree, psychology, is useless, second degree, culinary, was ended due to a serious back and leg injury, in grad school for masters in counseling federal loans capped out, booting me from the program)  I'm currently living with, and sharing finances with, my SO of many years.  with combined income we can make rent, pay bills, and have solved all of our debt but my student loans.  I can make my student loan payments with financial assistance because I would be only counting my income.  If get married my loan payments pop back up to where I can't make the payments and still have a roof over my head. 


**Edit**: These answers have been great, and thank you to everyone in the discussion.  If you could favor me with further advice;  I'm noticing my financial life is about as ruined as it is going to get (save the the, I dunno, like $500 a year they'd get from taking my tax returns).

personalfinance,How should I go on about tackling interest rate that will be coming up soon?,"Hello /r/personalfinance, I've been a lurker here for a while and I was wondering if you guys could help me out with my current situation.

Personal Background:
21 years old 3rd year student in the United States enrolled at a private university 4-year program aiming for finance in career and ironically I am about to face big personal financial problem.

Family Background:
Middle class family with a house not on rent, but we are currently paying mortgage.

Due to family financial situation, I have begun incurring significant amount of credit card debt as I've been studying here at a university located in an urban area where prices of goods are high/expensive. My family DOES have ability to pay it off, just not now due to medical costs that were incurred by both parents at a hopsital.

I have about ~$9,000 in credit card debt that is split between four out of 8 cards, which are mostly about to go into regular APR rate starting in the Summer/May-ish. I have total of $77,000 Credit Line available which have made my credit score not suffer as much. I should also note that card debt amount will not exceed $10,000 mark. It's been fluctuating between $8,500 and $9,500.

* Card 1: $800/$2,500 Discover
* Card 2: $1,600/$6,000 American Express
* Card 3: $4,000/$10,000 Chase
* Card 4: $3,000/$9,000 Chase

I should also note that I have about $600 in Betterment IRA account that I've started few months back. However, with the early withdrawal penalty, I don't think it's good idea to take them out.


I am earning money through work and other side sources of income, but my income varies per month. It could be anywhere from $1700 to $2500, which is expected to increase slowly over time. My rent is $800 plus utilities.

On my credit karma account I have 721 for Transunion and 747 from Equifax, which is expected to increase as I have someone helping me with my credit score. Transunion's score is also expect to see a jump as I've submitted a complaint to get some details corrected, which will significantly lower down on my report's credit utilization rate.

I've been trying to apply for 0% Intro APR card to keep the debt in no-interest mode as I get them down by working at a financial firm. However, it's been getting rejected as I have too many cards that were opened up within 12 months or so. 

What should I do? I just want to either 1. lower the APR that I will be struck with or 2. obtain a card where I can balance transfer it as I pay down the debt avoiding all interest fees. I am not too concerned about paying down my debt right now, I just want to take care of the incoming interest rate raid.

And yes, despite my young age, I have significant amount of credit limit as I was on my mother's cards for approximately 2 years, boosting my credit score significantly.

Edit: I've heard some cases where some credit card companies are willing to extend the 0% Promo Intro APR rate, is this true? How common is this?",finance

I just tried calling BoA to negotiate the interest rate but it didn't go anywhere.  A few questions:

1) If I find a credit card with a lower interest rate, would it make sense to transfer the balance over and switch?

2) When is the best time to negotiate a interest rate decrease?  When you have balance on the card or have no balance on the card?

personalfinance,Should we pay off our student loans ASAP?,"Here is our situation:

Two young married professionals who just started in their fields. 


- ~$72,000 take home after all is said and done (taxes, insurance, 401k, etc.) 


- ~$72,000 in combined student debt (all federal loans ranging from 2-6% interest.)

- $35,000 in our savings account. 

- Monthly expenses run ~$1,700

We *HATE* our student debt hanging over us and have decided to become debt free as fast as possible. We are used to living like broke college students and have no problem continuing to do so for the near future. By our estimations we could clear out this debt without touching our savings in about a year and a half. Our question is, is there any reason not to? I know that we could invest it in the market and *make* money but, perhaps due to ignorance, we like the idea of not owing money more than making it for now. Does this make sense?

personalfinance,Adjusting Fed withholdings to boost 401k contributions,"I am a person of the camp that prefers to not overpay taxes each paycheck in order to get refunds, so I claim a higher number to offset and end up with &lt;$500 return which I love. But I was thinking if it would be a smart move to: 

1. Boost my 401k contributions from 3% to 6% (employer matches 50% up to this %). 

2. Adjust my withholding to offset the 3% hit on my paycheck.

My logic is that 401k is pre tax anyway so the offset by changing my W-4 wouldnt put me in jeopardy of a higher tax bill, while at the same time getting the maximum amount from my employer + annual growth. Am I wrong in thinking this solution would result in max 401k contribution, same (maybe lower tax liability), and little to no change on my net income?

personalfinance,Does it make sense to pay off my student loan in a lump payment?,"Hi PF! I've historically been extremely bad with money and saving.  At 24 I had about $500 in the bank, $32,000 in student loans, and about $10,000 in credit card debt and was making ~$30,000 per year, spending $1150 on rent (56% of my take home pay).  

It was really not sustainable and I was going into deeper debt as I couldn't keep up with payments, insurance, tuition, and a lifestyle that exceeded my income.  A friend recommended Mr Money Mustache and related blogs and after reading them for a while eventually something clicked.

Fast forward today I am 28.  I have a new job paying $56,000, I'm still only paying $1150 on rent, I have a ~$15,000 emergency fund, I have eliminated all credit card debt, and sold my car (commute by bike) so no insurance or maintenance costs.

I still have ~$27,000 in student loans to pay off with a ~$300 per month minimum payment.  I'm on track to save ~$17,000 this year.  At the end of the year I could pull the remainder from my emergency fund and pay off my entire loan at the end of the year and be debt free for the first time in my life.

However, I see a lot of advice on the forum to just make minimum payments and invest instead.  However, I'm not sure what the interest threshold would be to consider weighing that as an option (as well as the mental freedom of being debt-free).

The interest rate on my loan is floating and is prime + 2.7%. In the last 5 years in Canada the prime rate has fluctuated from 2.7% to 3% so at most the interest on the loan over the next few years is about 5.7%.  Does it make sense for me to pay this off or should I be taking that money and investing it elsewhere?

$27,000 student loan at 5.7%.
$15,000 in savings.

personalfinance,Is it ever recommended to take out a personal loan to pay off credit card debt?,"Some relevant background info?

I am 27 years old sales rep who makes around 80-85k/year. (Past 2 years)

I put 10% of every paycheck into my 401k and $200/mo in mutual funds

I have 19k left on student loans at a 4% interest rate. ($333 month, payoff is 2022)

I have 15k left on my car at a 2.8% interested rate. ($500/mo payment)

I have about 15k in investments not including 401k.

I have 7k in my savings account for emergency funds (on hold until debt is paid)

My credit karma scores have me at 711 TU and 730 equifax.

2 months ago I had 12.5k in credit card debt, which is now down to 9k. Which will drop to about 7.5k after this month and with quarterly bonuses, 6-5k at the end of April. (Guesstimate based on commissions, but very close)

With my job and personal spending, I never kept the two expenses separate and was careless with spending. 2 months ago, my SO and I had a talk that made me more aware of my spending habits. With that being said, I have only been buying what I need opposed to what I want. This has helped me significantly drop my CC debt, roughly 3.5k in 2 months. (Calculated on undebt.it)

Basically I am asking this and writing this because even though my debt is going down, I feel as if it's going so slowly with 4-5 different payments every month.

When checking credit karma, I was looking at personal loans for around 10k at a 10% interested rate. Roughly $330/mo on a 36 month loan, but there's no way I wouldn't try and pay it off much earlier than 36/mo. (But is that ideal or asking for rates at 24-months. Interest on 36/mo is roughly 1,600 according to CK)

Kinda looking for advice if I should just keep track of my spending habits and keep paying or consolidate all my CC debt for an easier payment?

personalfinance,Is this balance transfer worth it?,"I think I might end up doing this but I wanted to see if anyone had anything else to warn me about regarding this move.

I have Credit Card A which has a lower-interest rate than normal for the next four months (19%) After those 4 months, it'll go back up to 23%. The amount on there currently is 2850, and I've been trying to throw $100 at it every month to drastically reduce the minimum payment. 

Now, I just saw that another card I have is offering a balance transfer of about 5.75% and I have about 5,200 on it and am paying about $80 on it. Is there ANY WAY POSSIBLE that combining the two cards, so I'd have 8,000 on one card, would result in a minimum payment of more than $180? It'd be nice to have one less card to think about paying. 

Is there anything like an online calculator that I can play with to see the different scenarios?

personalfinance,Confused about gifted home equity and buying a home I am currently renting.,"I can't really find anything online explaining the  basics of this, let alone the situation I found myself in.

I live in Florida. My spouse and I attempted to purchase a home in 2010, but had to walk away from negotiations when the realtor was acting in bad faith (she kept modifying the contract without our consent; when I refused to sign off on her changes, she told me we could sign or walk away; I walked away).

Since then, my parents purchased a home as we were strapped for cash after failing at buying a home. For a variety of reasons on both sides (some personal, some financial), we are all looking to put the house in our name, rather than my parent's names.

I'm going to pause here to caveat that I understand a purchase (I want a thing, I pay you money or I don't get the thing) and a loan (I want a thing, I borrow money with interest and pay that back over time), but equity and appreciating assets completely confuse me, and I can't find a good breakdown of how it works anywhere.

So here's the situation. My parents do not have a lot of cash on hand, nor do I(as my rent payments keep going up due to paying property tax for what is effectively a rental property). What they have built up is equity, and their plan goes something like this:

Each of my parents gifts me 14k equity in the house. The federal tax limit on providing a gift to your child is around that. This means my mother and father are gifting me 28k total.

They are doing the same thing to my spouse, gifting him 28k total. All told, we have 56k in equity. 

After we get pre-approved for a mortgage, we use that equity as down payment on the house, as well as covering some miscellaneous closing costs.

Here's where it falls apart for me. I don't understand how they can gift me value in the house, and then I turn around and use it to buy that same thing. I get how an equity loan works, but something about this seems either impossible or illegal, like money is appearing out of nowhere.

Here are my questions I guess:

1) Is anything like this possible?
2) If not, what are my options for buying this house aside from the regular home buying process, if any?
3) If it is possible, how does the equity work in this situation? Do I just tell my lender that we are using equity...?
4) How does the gift affect my income tax liability, federally (no state in Florida)?

Another weird wrinkle: my parents bought it on the cheap at around 70k. They are saying it will be easier to do if they bump the price up to 130 - 150k. This makes the total price after down payment equal to their total mortgage cost. Is this true? 

My whole goal is owning the house and (hopefully) paying less than my rent cost (900). The mortgage calculators I used stated if it was 150k, my monthly payment (with property tax) would be something like 1200, MUCH higher than I can afford... At 70k, it came out to ~600 monthly.

I'm sorry if all of these questions are obvious to a lot of you. I just don't like feeling like the wool is getting pulled over my eyes, and I'd like more opinions on what I'm getting into. I want to go see an accountant, but I'm not even sure if that's the right person to see. Maybe a property attorney? I had a bad experience with a licensed realtor already and am hesitant to go down that road again so soon.

Thank you for you time.",finance
personalfinance,Teacher qualified for Below Market Rate Condo; Should I buy?,"**Background**

The city requires a 10% down payment which I have more than enough saved up. As a teacher, I am making about $70K annually and has no major debts (car loans, student loans, etc.). I also have excellent credits score, 790. The unit is in great location, just 1 mile from my work, and close to major highway.

As a first time home buyer, this is a very intimidating and confusing process. I don't want to make any bad financial decisions that I will later regret so I hope you could help answering these questions I have on mind.

*Is this a good deal for a condo in the Bay Area? Should I expect a huge drop in price soon
*Which lender(s) should I go with? Should I go with my realtor's recommended lender (Golden Bay Mortgage Group)? I've never heard of them before.
*What is the interest rate I should expect getting?
*What can I expect paying monthly for my mortgage? (I used an online mortgage calculator and it's about $2000...)

personalfinance,Question about (non-federal) student loans,"Hi! This is my first post here and I'm not terribly educated on loans so sorry in advance for any ignorance/stupidity!

I graduated undergrad debt-free, which I'm incredibly thankful for. 6 months after graduating, I started taking my med school pre-reqs which required me to take out loans. I had taken out about ~25K and was a little over halfway finished with my pre-reqs at a public university when I found out my mom had stage IV cancer, so I took a semester off to take care of her (surgery/chemo/radiation). During my time off, I decided to pursue nursing instead since I was about to be 26 and had at least 2 more years before I could even APPLY to med school. This ended up being a good decision because shortly thereafter I found out I had reached 160 total hours of undergrad classes and was no longer able to receive federal aid (despite the fact that I only used financial aid for ~25 out of the 160 credit hours). I took my nursing pre-reqs at community college and paid for it myself. I was working part-time and living at home, but still had ~$800 in expenses every month, so I saved as much as I could (including birthday/Christmas money) and saved about $3,000 in 1.5 years. 

I just got accepted to nursing school, which will be about 26K total. I'm going to have to take out a personal student loan, but I'm trying to determine the best way to go about this.

Although, I don't know if it's a good idea to take on a $45k debt to pay off the original loans and consolidate before we buy the house. I know when buying a home, they say to not take out any additional debt or have anyone check your credit score during this process.

I'm a server, so my income isn't always the same, but I generally make around $400 a week. I don't want to pay more than 150$ a month on car payments if I can help it. 

So my questions are : should I look into financing a vehicle? Would I have really high interest rates based on my credit and age? Would it be better to buy outright until I get my credit up? What should I do?

I don't have a lot of extra money a month, but I want a dependable vehicle that I don't need to worry about. What is the best way to be financially stable yet get a good car? I'm sorry if this is a silly post or against the rules, I just don't want to screw myself over financially because I'm so ignorant in this area of life. Please let me know what you think, I'll greatly appreciate it!",finance
personalfinance,"College student with savings, roth IRA and no debt (yet), what's the best way to manage investing and loans while I get my 1 year master's degree?","I am about to finish my undergraduate degree and this summer I will begin a 1 year master's program that will finish next May. The plan is to get a real job after that.

I am in a pretty good position financially because I am an engineer and participated in a co-op program for a couple semesters at school so I have some money saved. I also had lots of scholarships for school and my parents saved enough to cover the rest so I have not yet had to take out any loans for undergrad and will graduate debt free. Here's about what my money situation will be when I graduate:

Savings/Checking: about $24,000 Roth IRA: about $7,800 401K: about $250 (last company I worked at set up my 401K after 90 days of me working there, but by then my semester of co-op was almost up so there's not too much in there)

The yearly tuition for my program was estimated at $52,000, but they gave me a 10% fellowship so I'm only responsible for $46,800. I will also have a TA position in the fall and spring that should cover my rent and maybe some other expenses. I have not yet received a financial aid package but was told that as a graduate student I would be eligible for a Federal Direct Unsubsidized loan in the amount of $20,500.00.

So I guess at I have a couple of questions. Should I figure out how much I need to live for six months, and then use the rest to pay for grad school and then take out loans to cover the rest? Or should I max out my Roth IRA for last year (only contributed 750) and this year and take out the full amount in loans? And on a side note, what should I do with the 401K that doesn't have much in it? It's a Vanguard account and I feel like I should move it elsewhere so they don't keep taking fees out but I'm not sure.

personalfinance,Need advice on how to forge ahead,"I'm turning 31 in a week and a half, and am not happy with where I'm at. Living with my much older sister and her husband in basically their storage room for the past four years due to some troubling times that happened four years ago (laid off, rent hike, roommate situation imploded, boyfriend issues, etc.). I was finishing school at that time, and then I took a lower paying job just to survive, but ended up using credit cards a lot because of my boyfriend not working and feeling like I needed to spend money to keep him (learned that lesson). I've gotten my life pretty much turned around as far as the job situation goes. I'm making more than I ever have in my life after three raises in a year ($19 an hour, and feel pretty secure but ya never know), but everytime something good happens financially, something comes along to knock me down. Example: I was finally starting to pay down some debts, when I somehow herniated a disc in my back. While my insurance covered a good portion of the surgery and medical costs, I ended up putting a large amount on a new credit card so that I could keep the payments lower (which I know means I'll end up paying interest eventually on it, but I was desperate since I was out of work for a few weeks and needed to keep costs low). Another example: While I was struggling at the start of the four year stretch, my car was having issues. I didn't have the money out of pocket to fix anything, so had to put it on an ""emergency"" credit card, and then when I was finally above water on money, had to get a new car because I need a stable car to drive to and from work (I live about an hour away from my job, and public transit isn't the most viable of options). 

I always told myself I wouldn't get bogged down in credit card debt, but it looks like I have. I've never missed a payment, my credit score is fair, but has dropped recently. I just am tired of my situation, and I know that if I can really start making headway on my expenses, then I can try to move out. 

Credit Card Debt:  $12,522.49 split between four credit cards with interests rate varying between 16.49% and 21.74%. Some of the balance is also on 0% for a while (anywhere from six months to a year). To give you some idea though, I had six credit cards, and I've paid and closed two. 

Student Loans: I have about $51K in student loans, but as of this year, am on a 20 year income driven repayment plan, and this year I'm only paying $140 a month. I'm three months ahead on those payments (I basically budget so that I know I have that money allocated for that payment, even if it isn't out of my account yet). 

Car Loan: $17966.14 and have five years left on a seven year loan. Pay $360 a month, interest rate is around 4%, and I'm about a month and a half ahead on payments (pay every two weeks, so eventually I get around two-three months ahead on payments so i'm paying less interest on it). I've toyed with selling the car and getting a used car, but the car isn't worth the amount I owe (obviously), and so I'd still have a good amount of debt on it. 

Unavoidable expenses: $120 per month for a doctor bill for another year, $139 per month for a storage unit for my stuff [like I said, I live in basically a storage closet so most of my stuff has been in storage for four years], around $80 in gas a month [public transit would be more than this], $101 a month for cell phone [which I've negotiated down from $150], and I pay my sister $330 a month in rent/car insurance. She doesn't charge me much in rent because of the situation and mainly it's for the difference in utilities from before I moved in to now. 

With my new salary, I make about $2000 a month. I spend about $50 a month on Entertainment... because I don't go out much so it's like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Britbox, and Microsoft Office 365. The $50 allows me a little extra in case I want to buy something on my phone or a book on Kindle or something. My budget has $200 a month for groceries, but lately it's been like $400 a month, which I know is part of the issue, but I've been recently diagnosed with some health issues, and so I'm trying to eat better, which unfortunately sometimes requires more money. 

I've been toying with the idea of taking out a personal loan to consolidate the credit card debt into one payment but I know that can also be bad. So basically I'm looking for any advice anyone can offer.",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"My wife and I are upper 20s/lower 30s with one child.

3 years ago we purchased a house for 129k, the interest rate is fixed at 4.49 we still owe ~112k toward the principle. 

I have been working toward my dream job where I will earn more money but it has been tight financially. Currently we are within a few hundred of breaking even each month. I currently make under 30k, and my wife makes about the same. We try to keep 10k in the bank for emergencies and we have been floating around that number for months. We have no debts besides the house. This is not the reason for my post, just giving some context.

I received a call from my mortgage lender the other day. It seems my house value has gone up to about 154k. They are offering me a refinance. It will start the 30 years over again, the new rate will be fixed at 4.375, and I will get ~13,800 cash back at closing. my current rate (escrow included) is ~870 and the new rate would be ~917. 

My wife and I have already spoken and we would not do anything with the cash out money till I am earning more, it would just give us more cushion, than as I earn more money it would allow for home/life improvements (ie a deck or pregnancy) without having to build up finances as long.

We were in the habit of paying extra each month to the principle, but recently that hasn't been an option. I know that the first few years are the heaviest for interest payments and I see how my lender would benefit from this, but I also see how this could give us some breathing room till I am making more in case something unexpected comes along (car breaks, pregnancy). What do you think?

Sans a disaster of some sort, or a failure in tax reform, I see no reason it shouldn't get back to its bullish run again. Compared to most competitors in the same sector, the eps and RSI is better looking and with more Fed hikes in the future they should be making decent gainz.

personalfinance,Tax Return with Roth IRA,"I contributed 5,500 to my Roth IRA (Fidelity) in December 2016. Then in January 2017, I deposited 5,500 to a different Roth IRA (Wealthfront), and I also transferred 5,500 from the Fidelity account over to the Roth IRA, so I then have 11,000 in my Roth IRA with Wealthfront.

Today, I was on the wealthfront website and they told me that in 2017, I have transferred 0$ into my Roth IRA, so I'm allowed to transfer 5,500. So I initiated a transfer for 5,500 that's currently pending.

Now I'm confused and have 2 questions... 

1. I thought the annual limit for a ROTH IRA contribution was 5,500. How come I was able to contribute 16500? 

2. on Turbo tax, before entering my ROTH IRA contribution, my federal refund at the top is 997$. After entering 16,500 for my Roth IRA contribution, it drops down to 337$. Why does this happen? I thought Roth IRA didn't affect my tax return at all because i'm putting in my post tax dollars into it.

2. Take (Research Assistantship Income - Federal Income Tax Withheld on my W2) as my max contribution.

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation (Fixed vs. Variable),"Hi, everyone and thanks for reading!

I'm strongly considering consolidating my student loan debt for a few reasons. 1) reduce interest rates 2) reduce monthly payment 3) having all of my loans though one institution to simplify payments and providing a clear understanding of when they will be paid off. 

I currently owe ~60,000 and am paying roughly 850$ a month to 3 institutions. Most of the loans are 6.55%, and my largest loan of ~17,000$ has 7.66. The rates for 10 year repayment I've been quoted at for consolidation are 6.24% fixed and 5.04% (8.95% max) variable. For those curious I'm considering SoFi. The consolidation would save me ~1,500$ over the lifetime of the loans, which isn't much but the upsides are very appealing. So my two questions:

1) is this an awful idea?
2) is the variable interest rate worth the potential risk?",finance

personalfinance,How much of my savings should I use for a down payment to build a retirement home?,"I live and work in an expensive west coast city where I will never be able to afford to buy a house. I am very lucky to have a rent-controlled apartment, and I had parents who taught me to live by the same principles as /r/personalfinance's, which has helped me save a good bit of money.   

I have family who live outside a fairly touristy east-coast city. I spend at least a couple weeks a year there, and it seems like the most viable place for me to retire in 15 years or so. A couple years ago, I bought land very close to my family and have been working with an architect to design a modest(ish) but very cool vacation/retirement home, and have lined up a builder.   

The plans we've come up with are significantly more expensive than I initially imagined wanting to pay, but at this point I'm not inclined to scrap the design work, spend another year coming up with plans, and build something that isn't what I really want with a mortgage likely at a higher interest rate. I'm fairly certain I'll be able to recoup a lot of the cost with vacation rental, but I don't want to have to rely on that to make the mortgage payments. (If the whole project seems like a terrible idea, I'm open to hearing that.) I'm going to need to buy a house at some point--renting in an expensive city won't stay viable for the rest of my life.  

My real question is whether to   
A: finance most of the cost and hold onto my savings, meaning I'd have a bigger monthly payment, requiring a big cut into what I save each month, but having bigger reserves, which would hopefully be growing at a rate better than my mortgage interest rate.  
or B: make a big down payment so I have a smaller monthly payment, meaning I'd be paying less interest and the monthly mortgage payment would be less of a burden, but I'd have less cushion to fall back on if something went wrong.  

Here are my numbers:  

Monthly income and major expenses  
403b retirement contributions: 1500 + 550 match  
take home pay 4925  
rent and bills 1000  
medium-term savings 1080  
contributions to three 529 plans for relatives 780  
(leaving ~2000 for food, drink, transportation, and fun)  

Assets  
Retirement accounts 410,000  
529 plans 60,000  
""Cash"" 210,000--available for down payment  
Land 38,000--which counts toward down payment  

Construction will cost around 360,000. I'm qualified to borrow up to 420,000 which they say would mean a monthly payment (including taxes and insurance) of 2020. If I spend most of my cash on the down payment, I could bring the monthly payment down to maybe 1100.   

With my rent, the larger amount means housing would be ~40% of my after tax income. I'd have to significantly cut my savings rate, but I'd have an extra 200 grand already saved and hopefully growing.   

The smaller monthly payment would be much more manageable--I probably could just about cover it being more frugal without reducing my monthly savings--which I'd really need to rebuild.  

Obviously the answer is somewhere in the middle. I need to leave enough cash to be an emergency fund, and I want to make enough of a down payment to avoid PMI. But I'd really like some other people's takes on which end of the down payment spectrum is wisest.",finance
Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Diaries: Tales from the Great Hardfork War of 2017,"The generals kept on yelling hashpower, we need hashpower!  In the end it wasn't about damn hash rate or even about who had more nodal legionaries.  Valuation and branding are what won us the war...  

A war that started when the usurper Unlimitus decided to forsake consensus and declare holy hardfork to seize the throne of Cryptonia from Corenius the First.

Once the split started there was not going back.  The two coins almost immediately diverged in value.  The market oracles at Bitfinex had given us favorable omens, with core tokens up 4x against the tokens of our Unlimitus foes.  As predicted the miner mercenaries of Unlimitus, quickly saw the coin of the Usurper drop to 1/4 the strength of Corenius.

We all bled and lost in the battles that followed.  Both core and unlimited would drop in price, but unlimited fell further and faster. Once they were behind in valuation against core, the incentives all started to push the miners back to mining core, back to Corenius.  This in turn caused unlimitus coins to fall further and faster against the unstoppable core, the cycle fed upon itself.  The two coins could never live in harmony, each was a direct threat to the other,  both trying to claim the throne of our Great Cryptonia!

But branding, aye branding was our secret weapon.  Generals of the major Exchanges had already said they would treat Unlimitus as an altcoin usurper should he move against Corenius.  Most of the common folk who owned bitcoin didn't really understand or care about the technical details, all they'll knew is BTC is bitcoin, and BTU is badcoin.  

After two weeks of bloodshed, when the coin of Unlimitus was trading at less than 20% of a Corenius coin, and with miners abandoning Unlimitus en masse, and bugs in the poorly developed unlimitian code being sporadically exposed... at some point, the institutional investor wizards and whale naval units started to dump the Unlimitus coin they had owned, either converting it back into Corenius or straight into fiat.

The civil war ended in a matter of weeks, and with the once and future Bitcoin secure, peace and harmony returned to the land of Cryptonia.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Can other factors outweigh the downsides of taking out a large mortgage? (Finance gurus: Should we buy this house?),"Wife and I (27,28) are looking at purchasing our first home in a very competitive area (Seattle). We are financially stable, but in order to get the home we are looking for, we need to take out a rather large mortgage. Wondering if things like low interest rate, school districts, quality of the home, etc. make it reasonable to do so. Here are some particulars:

Us:

* 28/27, Masters/Bachelors degrees
* ~$160k combined income now (don't want to count on that much indefinitely)
* No debt (2 cars fully paid, zero credit card debt, zero student loans)
* $120k in liquid savings, plus $60k in retirement

Mortgage:

* $525k loan + $75k downpayment ($600k total)
* 3.25% interest rate on 30-year fixed after buying 2 points (yeah Navy Fed!)
* No PMI despite less than 20% down (woohoo VA loan!)
* Approx $3,000/month including taxes &amp; insurance

Other Factors:

* Great public school district and we refuse to spend money to send our kids to private school (saving money down the road)
* Light Rail is opening stations nearby in 3-5 years, giving super quick access to downtown Seattle, but zoning in this neighborhood won't change (should improve or at least stabilize property value)
* House is older (1950), but has been totally renovated top-to bottom. Renovated, NOT flipped - so new pipes, insulation, roof, windows, moisture-sealed siding, hardwoods, as well as all the nice new fixtures inside. (The renovator is also transparent and wants to come fix any issues we find). Hoping this will dramatically reduce our unanticipated costs in the next 10 years.
* Despite many other areas in the US, Seattle's economy is booming. Should make finding work easier if either of us loses our jobs.


So what do you all think? Especially curious to hear from anyone who has done something similar or is familiar with the Seattle area.",finance
personalfinance,"State tax doubt - based in CA, worked only 20 days in NYC: Why is TurboTax telling me that ALL my prepaid CA state tax will be refunded, and that I must pay NYC state tax on ALL my income?","Hello dear /r/personalfinance community. Seeking your guidance once more on an obscure issue on state taxes, at least to me.

**Context:** based in SF, worked 20 days in NYC. Turbotax says that $5k in state taxes I've prepaid to CA will be completely refunded. BUT that I must pay taxes on NYC on virtually **ALL** my income...even if I worked a small fraction of the year there.

**Question:** this seems so weird..is this correct? Shouldn't I pay state taxes fractioned between CA and NYC, based on the number of days worked on each?

Random fact: My W2 shows W2 box 1 filled for federal and CA state tax 9i.e. it shows aggregate gross income, BUT the NY state tax section shows W2 box 1 is blank...that means TurboTax cannot e-file, which has become a pain in the butt since NYC insists I must e-file....

personalfinance,"Student loans, graduate school, working full-time - do I even bother with 401k?","Hi PF!

I've been going through my debt more seriously the past year and I wanted your advice on how I can deal with my staggering amount of personal debt which will increase further as I finish my Masters this year.

Current situation
I work and go to school.
I have a car that works great that I just finished paying off with my last tax return.
Personal bank account has $10,000 in case of emergency.

Currently have just under $40,000 in student loans ($20,000 are from undergraduate) 
Interest rates range from 3% to 6.8%

Will take on 24,700 more this year before graduating
My workplace will allow me to expense 3,500/yr so i will receive 3,500 back this year and another 3,500 should I choose to take my last course in spring 2018 semester

Current salary is (54,000)/yr.
Recurring expenses monthly include apartment (985$), groceries (300$~), phone (30$), car insurance (70$), gas (60$), internet (40$). 

In the past I used to take advantage of the company I worked for employee stock plan which let you set aside a set amount of cash from your paycheck which would be invested in company stock at the end of the year at a 15% discount and could be sold immediately. Stock performance for this company is generally strong and rose 24 points this year.

I also have the option of investing into a 401k with matching up to 6% of my salary. I did this in the past as well but have since stopped to pay better focus to my current outstanding debt.

I have since paid off my car loan, and made significant payments off my current student loan interest. My main questions involve creating a plan to paying off the additional student loans/interest, and whether I should still consider the 401k match and/or ESPP. 

I also know that I should be getting a roommate to help cover rent expense, and will most likely be moving in with my girlfriend later this year. 

edit: Would it help if I posted a table of my current loans? Not sure how to do that - don't use reddit too much.
Also I have a credit score &gt;800 based on Experian so maybe refinancing is possible option as well?",finance
personalfinance,Grad School Finances Advice,"So, as the title implies, I'm 27, and I have just been accepted into 2 year graduate program starting in the Fall. I have about $18.9k in my IRA (2/3 in a regular, 1/3 in a Roth) and $15k in an employer sponsored 401k. I also have about 30k in savings. I am unmarried and have no debt. 

I think I can keep all of my living expenses to about $1250-$1600 a month; I do own an older car that needs a lot of maintenance. I also have some credit card reward points I've been amassing in anticipating for graduate school (I'd like to go on one European trip during this time).

Tuition, books, and health insurance is expected to cost about $27k a year. I can take a federal loan maximum of $41k for the 2 years, while interest is accrued during my time in school (I believe the rate is 6.8%). I plan on, at a minimum, paying off the interest to avoid the interest being added to my principal owed amount (what would happen if I deferred paying interest during school)

My boss plans on keeping me part time next year, and I think I can make about $24k- $30k a year (depending on the number of hours I can handle around my graduate course load). This might be even more if I get a good internship for the summer.

So my question is: how much should I be keeping in an emergency fund and how much should I be using to just pay off school costs/ use for living costs?

Should I bother contributing to an IRA this for the 2016 tax year? If so, regular to get a higher tax return or a Roth? The maximum amount?

Thank you in advance for your advice and for reading this long post! All of your advice is appreciated!

financialindependence,How much of my savings should I use for a down payment to build a retirement home?,"I live and work in an expensive west coast city where I will never be able to afford to buy a house. I am very lucky to have a rent-controlled apartment, and I had parents who taught me to live by the same principles as /r/personalfinance's, which has helped me save a good bit of money and the possibility of retiring in my late 50s. 

I have family who live outside a fairly touristy east-coast city. I spend at least a couple weeks a year there, and it seems like the most viable place for me to retire in 15 years or so. A couple years ago, I bought land very close to my family and have been working with an architect to design a modest(ish) but very cool vacation/retirement home, and have lined up a builder.   

The plans we've come up with are significantly more expensive than I initially imagined wanting to pay, but at this point I'm not inclined to scrap the design work, spend another year coming up with plans, and build something that isn't what I really want with a mortgage likely at a higher interest rate. I'm fairly certain I'll be able to recoup a lot of the cost with vacation rental--ideally the house would basically pay for itself and provide some income to my family who would be looking after it--and it's designed so that I could live on the lower level and continue to rent out the upper level after I retire (or vice versa). But I don't want to have to rely on the rental income to make the mortgage payments. I'm going to need to buy a house at some point--renting in an expensive city won't stay viable for the rest of my life.  

My real question is whether to   
A: finance most of the cost and hold onto my savings, meaning I'd have a bigger monthly payment, requiring a big cut into what I save each month, but having bigger reserves, which would hopefully be growing at a rate better than my mortgage interest rate.  
or B: make a big down payment so I have a smaller monthly payment, meaning I'd be paying less interest and the monthly mortgage payment would be less of a burden, but I'd have less cushion to fall back on if something went wrong.  

Here are my numbers:  

Monthly income and major expenses  
403b retirement contributions: 1500 + 550 match  
take home pay 4925  
rent and bills 1000  
medium-term savings 1080  
contributions to three 529 plans for relatives 780  
(leaving ~2000 for food, drink, transportation, and fun)  

Assets  
Retirement accounts 410,000  
529 plans 60,000  
""Cash"" 210,000--available for down payment  
Land 38,000--which counts toward down payment  

Construction will cost around 360,000. I'm qualified to borrow up to 420,000 which they say would mean a monthly payment (including taxes and insurance) of 2020. If I spend most of my cash on the down payment, I could bring the monthly payment down to maybe 1100.   

Option A, with my rent and the larger payment means housing would be ~40% of my after tax income. I'd have to divert a significant portion of my monthly savings into this investment, but I'd have an extra 200 grand already saved and hopefully growing.   

The smaller monthly payment would be much more manageable--I probably could just about cover it being more frugal without reducing my monthly savings--which I'd really need to rebuild.  

Obviously the answer is somewhere in the middle. I need to leave enough cash for an emergency fund, and I want to make enough of a down payment to avoid PMI. But I'd really like some other people's takes on which end of the down payment spectrum is wisest.",finance

Short sale or foreclosure seems to be my only options as I couldn't pay realtor or closing costs to sell. 

I have yet to contact any lenders to review my options but I'm not naive enough to know my credit and finances will be thoroughly fucked.

I had no savings for a downpayment on a new car and my credit, was not great due to some student loan payment issues I had initially when exiting college.

I purchased a car from one of those ""everyone gets approved"" places. They sold me on the monthly payment, what can I afford... I was able to afford up to $450.. so they sold me a car $447 per month, I was a bit naive at the time lets just say that. I have since come to my senses and realized how outrageous the 17% interest rate is and value of the car vs. money left to pay on the loan is. I have paid to date $19,000 and my current payoff quote is $11,750. The car was never worth over 30K. MSRP was around 19K when I purchased that car. 

The KBB value of the car is only at 5K today. Would I have any luck playing hardball with Capital One? I am now in a place in my life financially to say to them, ""I can pay you 5-6K to pay off the loan balance, otherwise I will stop making payments and let you take the car.""

financialindependence,Financially independent by 45 - what are the best strategies to get there?,"I just turned 30 and (finally!) decided to start saving for retirement. As part of my deep-dive into the world of personal finance I discovered the concept of financial independence, and I could kick myself for not realizing that saving sooner would have spared me from years of mindless drudgery at a day job. But what's done is done, and now I'm focusing on ways I can cut the length of my working career as much as possible.

Basic overview of me: 

* single (and intend to stay that way, so there's no dual income potential to factor into my future)
* no kids
* earn 52k a year
* have been saving $200 from every paycheck (just putting in emergency fund) but will now also put an additional $1k monthly towards retirement
* $2500 in Roth IRA (just opened) and around $1300 in emergency fund (had 3k, but decided paying off my credit card was a higher priority)
* own a house (pay mortgage by renting spare bedrooms)
* ~52k in student loans (lowest interest rate is 3%, highest is 4%)
* ~14k in car loan (.09% interest)

I realize my current situation isn't conducive to achieving FI at my target year, but hell, I might as well give it a shot. Some ways of increasing income I'm considered are:

* Changing jobs. The fact is I'm earning ~$10k-20k below what my experience level calls for, but as I discovered on my last job hunting bout, though my quality of work is up to par the fact that I've never had a job title commesurate to my experience is a mark against me that ended up being the deciding factor in my not being hired when applying for roles at my desired level. This job gives me the fancy title I need, plus knowledge of/experience in things complementary to my career that I think will reflect well on my resume. I plan to stay in my current role for at least another year, then re-evaluate both where I'm at and where the company (a startup) is at to decide if it's worth staying.

* Starting a side hustle. I'm still trying to think of what I want to do exactly. Something related to my career is the obvious choice, but the thing is I don't actually like what I do for a living (graphic design) anymore. I kind of dread the thought of putting in a full eight hours at my day job and coming home to four more hours of the same kind of work, but if I can't think of anything better it's what I'll have to do.

I have been leaning on the information in this [Nerd Wallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/the-best-ira-account-providers/) article to facilitate my decision. However, I do not understand some parts of the comparison. At the bottom of the article it summarizes its comparison. For instance, for TD Ameritrade it lists under Highlights: ""Commission-free: 100 ETFs, nearly 4,000 funds"" and under Commissions: ""$6.95 per trade"". What does that mean? If it is commission-free, why is there a price under commissions? What does the commission actually mean? How frequently does the average person make trades and incur the fee?


3) Once I open the Roth IRA, aside from contributing money from each pay check, what else should I be doing?

personalfinance,Devt Vs Investing at my age?,"Im 27, married with two step kids, and finishing up a BA degree. My wife is 32. Our current debt including my wife's student debt is roughly 70k when I graduate it'll probably be about 65k. We'll be getting around ten thousand soon and dumping it on debt. To be blatantly honest with myself and you, I was stupid in my early and mid 20's. I racked up some credit card debt, that's where the inflow if cash is going. And could have saved probably 20k by doing my coursework differently. Realistically when I graduate I'll likely be making 3000-4000 a month based off of people Ive talked to that worked at the companies and in the positions I'll be applying to. Combined income would be 5000-6000 a month. We can live on my wife's income and I can dump nearly all mine onto debts. Or, we can live off her income, and I can dump some of mine onto debts, and the remaining into investments. We'll be living poor but we already are so what's new? Soon in the next several months after summer I'll have our emergency fund finally set up. Which will be extremely relieving. We have no retirement as my wife doesn't get that perk at her job. And all our money goes to simply living. I keep close track of our cash flow. My question is, being our age, is it smarter to aggressively invest while semi-aggressively paying off debt, or forget the investing and kick that debt off. Then aggressively invest. My loans are mostly federal with a small interest rate. This is something I've been debating for quite some time. And I'll be graduated soon and will need a better plan to stick to.

I plan on being in school for 5 years. I want to know if it's better to cut the loan down to what I actually need, which would be about $4550 per year or to leave it so that whatever I don't use the first year goes to the second, then second to third , so on until the 4th where I'd reject whatever loans I'd have left over.

btc,Censor this at your peril,"&gt;I think the US government did the right thing of shutting or trying to shut (Bitcoin) down and I think effectively…it has done that.  -Joseph Stiglitz, 08/16

At least a few of you see what is going on.  It's a shame you don't discuss it more fully, in the open.  The theft of my ranch was merely the beginning.  The US establishment is in an all-out, undeclared war with Bitcoin.

The appearance of US Special Forces rappelling into the Bitcoin Bowl in December of 2014 was no happenstance.  The Operation Jade Helm ""exercise"" which began a few months later was targeted at Bitcoin users.

Military helicopters over Brooklyn just weeks after the inauguration of ""Trump Pence"" was, again, not an exercise.  The death of Rockefeller followed soon after.  The reasoning: defend the Federal Reserve in the name of a trumped-up ""nationalism"".  Perverse, yet unsurprising.  Just more of the same military Keynesianism that prompted Bitcoins creation in the first place.

And this is what some prominent Bitcoiners now label a ""good day.""  Bitcoin as a settlement layer for tyrants.  Sad.

Many important Bitcoin keys have likely already been compromised.  Quietly, of course.  All that is missing now is the legal justification for their theft.  Despite what you may think, these people do actually attempt to maintain the appearance of following the law, even if they have to change it after the fact.

This justification would be provided by the implicit ""anyone can spend"" property built-in to the decision to deploy SegWit as a soft-fork.  As soon as it goes live, the dumps begin.

Look at the Hong Kong agreement (02/16).  These steps have all been planned out.  This is the path that has been predetermined for Bitcoin to follow in order to exist (they can't prevent *that*) yet not grow out of their control or threaten the established order.  The actors responsible are not only in plain view, but already moving on to the next targets.

It will be heralded as a resolution to the Bitcoin ""civil war,"" a means for Bitcoin to scale, and a revolutionary new payment method usable by anyone and ready to disrupt the banks.  Pragmatic hold-outs are finally convinced to buy-in.  They take the leap.  And then, BAM!  The price inexplicably falls.  Whatever the contrived reason -- a technical oversight, more infighting -- doesn't matter.  New users bail, at a loss.  Their hopes crushed.  Their fears confirmed.  Bitcoin is permanently stained.

Three months later, the fix is developed, the hard fork released.  The ""anyone-can-spend"" property, removed.  But by then, it's too late.

How will you feel if you see large amounts of some early-adopter's coins (perhaps even Satoshi's) being transferred into an ""anyone-can-spend"" address, and then simply stolen?

Anyone who goes along with this should expect his property to go the same route.

These aren't just conspiracy theories.  There *are* theories that go along with this, of course.  But this isn't them.  This is a warning.

I've sunk close to $8K in the 3 years I have owned it, and now I probably need a new PCM/ECU. To add to that, its a convertible and someone cut a hole in my top about 1 1/2 years ago. I have patched it, but it still leaks. This causes condensation to build up inside my car, and rubber and plastic is slowly disintegrating. The cost to fix the top is $1600. My timing belt service is in about 15,000 miles, which is about a year of driving for me. I won't be able to register my car when its due (October) because of the check engine light though. It breaks down pretty consistently, and when this happens I spend $30 round trip taking ubers to work. And to top it all off, theres dents on the door, scratches in the paint, the seats are torn up, it just isn't worth more than $2000 on a good day. 

I've tossed the idea of both financing and buying outright, as well as other options like a motorcycle.  I can get a great interest rate because of my good credit, and my parents would be wiling to cosign if I need additional help. However, the thought of financing scares me. Life changes so suddenly that i don't want to be upside down on a car loan. Plus having to carry full coverage would be my insurance rates basically double. Buying outright I could afford, but I'm anxious about buying another junk car (my car was maintained well, my mother gifted it to me and was great about following the maintenance on time) and depleting all my savings. The car's that wouldn;t deplete my savings ($1-2k) all need work. They leak oil, have 200K miles, need suspension work, etc. I've looked at a couple that were just beat to hell, and several people refused to let me take them to my mechanic to have an inspection. Another idea i have toyed with is buying a small car like a miata. I would enjoy driving it and it would be reliable at I price I can afford, but losing out on all space would suck. As far as a bike is concerned, I am just afraid of becoming a statistic. It's so dangerous. 

I currently have ~6.5k in liquid cash. My budget is as follows

Rent: $350 a month

Renter's insurance: $13 a month

Internet: $40 a month

Auto gas and oil: $80 a month (I'm thinking about raising this to $100 a month though. My gas mileage has tanked in my vehicle from ~25mpg to 19)

Car Insurance: $258 every 6 months for basic everything

Maintenance/repairs: $200 a month

Groceries: $250 a month. Going to be dropping down to $225

Eating out: $50 a month. Going to be dropping down to $40.

Entertainment: $50 a month

Boxing membership: $40 a month (I havent gone in a few months though, but really want to get back into it)

Miscellaneous: $150 a month. Going to be dropping down to $100. I'm including no edible groceries in this, as well as just miscellaneous expenses. 

Therapy: $70 a month. Going to be raising this to $100. I see my therapist once and week and psych twice a month. my co insurance is $500 though, and once I hit that everything is free. 

Washer and dryer: $30. Dropping to $25 a month by conserving on towels and washing blankets and pillows less.

So at my updated budget, and not including my $200 maintenance for my current car (I haven't been spending any money on maintenance for a couple months, I'm just over sinking money into it) I spend $1126 a month. I make around ~1800 a month after taxes, so $674 take home. As I said earlier, I have $6.5K in the bank, and I'm hoping I could get $1500 for my car, but I have no idea what I would actually get given the needed repairs.

financialindependence,How solar panels turned out to be a great purchase in my quest for FI,"In early 2016 I purchased a house with only 10% down, yes you read that right. I broke one of the conventional rules that fiscally sound home buyers live by.  There's a good reason for this rule because, without 20% percent down you, the homeowner is required to pay PMI or private mortgage insurance.
  
As a consequence of only paying 10% down, I was stuck with an extra $123.44 a month in mortgage insurance premiums.  My goal was to get rid of that MPI as soon as possible, the alternative, wait 7 years and 8 months for my Loan to Value to reach 78% based on the original amortization schedule.  Paying a grand total of $11,356.48 in PMI premiums over that time.  Ouch!!  Understandably my goal was to get rid of it as soon as possible.
  
You may be wondering how Solar Panels fit into this, well in addition to the obvious benefits, you can use them as a **tool** to increase the equity in your home and drop Mortgage Insurance faster, I'll get into that more in a bit.

If you find yourself in the situation I was with my PMI, the way out is to pay down enough on your loan to where you have an 80% Loan to Value.  Then you need to notify the mortgage company and request that your Mortgage Insurance Premium be dropped.

Here's the deal, the mortgage company is not your friend in this effort.  The bank doesn't want you to stop paying for insurance, the insurance guarantees they'll get paid.  It's in their best interest that you keep it as long as possible.

When you put in a request to drop your PMI you'll get some information in the mail basically saying that you will need to pay for an appraisal and then if the value is high enough (80% LTV or 20% Equity in the home) they agree to drop your mortgage insurance.

There is nothing more demoralizing than paying $450 dollars for an appraisal, just to have your home appraise 7% lower than the original value of the loan (quite convenient for the mortgage company). Suddenly finding yourself out $450 dollars and thousands of dollars away from dropping those pesky Mortgage Insurance Premiums.  Believe me, I found myself in this exact situation back in 2013.

Learning from past experience, my strategy to drop Mortgage Insurance Premiums was three-fold.

* Aggressively pay off principal 
* Look for ways to increase home value
* After 9-12 months have my real estate agent run comps for me to gauge whether I had enough equity in the home to feel comfortable enough to pay for an appraisal as part of my request to drop PMI.

In short, I needed as much wiggle room as possible.  I didn't want to pay for another fruitless appraisal.

Let's talk about Solar Panels, four months after our home purchase in 2016 I was looking at buying solar panels as a way to increase the value of our home.  To get an idea of how much this can benefit you when dropping mortgage insurance, let's say you had a home worth 350k and then you buy solar panels which boost the value of the home by 15k.  That's an easy low-risk way to increase the equity in your home by over 4% using an investment that more than pays for itself in the long run.

I found a solar company that offered free LED light bulbs for the whole house as a perk for purchasing through them.  I ended up settling on a small 2.97 kW system for $13,514 dollars installed and got a 12-year loan at 1.99% for it.  Though I could have purchased a much larger system.

The idea was to get a system big enough to keep me from the more expensive electricity tiers and to maximize my state's solar tax credit. Utah offers a tax credit of 25% of the purchase price up to $2000 max.  When you couple that with the federal tax credit. (30% through 2019) The total cost of the system ends up at only $7,460.  Take into account the LED light bulbs and the reduced monthly electricity costs and this is a killer deal. 

**Use your solar credits to build even more equity**, check this scenario out.  Let say you buy solar panels towards the end of the year, within a few months you submit your tax return and receive the solar tax credit.  Put that $6,000+ down on your mortgage giving you another big equity boost. **In this way Solars panels are  essentially working as a two-way equity boost.**  Helping to Increase the value of your home and lowering your mortgage amount at the same time!

As luck would have it I received a letter in the mail during the solar panel purchasing process advertising a true no cost refinance at 3.5%, at the time my interest rate was 3.75%.  There was no downside to pursuing the no cost refinance, best case scenario, I would be able to lower my interest rate and drop my mortgage insurance premiums!  Worst case, my house wouldn't appraise for enough to drop the mortgage insurance but I would still be able to drop my interest rate.  I needed to jump on the opportunity as soon as possible to lock in the 3.5% percent because mortgage rates change often.  I locked in the rate and got the refinance started.  At the time I was just hoping that my solar panels would be installed by the time the appraisal was done for the refinancing, and fortunately, the solar panel installation beat out the refinance by about a week.  

Thanks to the **solar panels** and housing market gains over the previous 6 months since we purchased the house, our appraisal came in with more than enough value giving us the equity we needed to drop our mortgage insurance premium.

With a lower interest rate, and not having to pay insurance; the refinance saved us $179.34 a month on our mortgage payment!

I bought a house with 10% down and within 8 months dropped the Private Mortgage Insurance. Was luck involved?  Yes, to an extent. I was fortunate to have favorable market conditions and interest rates.  The no cost refinance gave me an opportunity to drop my mortgage insurance with no risk.  If I had to pay for the appraisal myself I would have been leerier and would have waited another 6 months or so to pay off more principal before feeling comfortable enough to move forward.

Why am I telling you this?  Is it just to brag?  No, It's because I believe that my experience can be beneficial in helping those who currently have mortgage insurance, or for those who may be looking to purchase a home in the future.

Maybe you find the perfect house, a great investment but you can't quite afford to put 20% down.  Remember you have these options available to you, PMI is not something that has to stick around forever and break the bank.

**4 tips to dump your Private Mortgage Insurance**  

1. **No Cost Refinance**  
Mortgage rates are constantly fluctuating and there will always be banks fighting for your business.  Seek out opportunities for no cost refinances, that will save you money on the appraisal and could even lower your interest rate!  If that doesn't work out be prepared to pay for an appraisal once your have enough equity.  The appraisal will quickly pay for itself once you're free from PMI.  
2.  **Solar Panels**  
Utilize solar panels as a way to increase equity in your home, the fact the monthly payment on a solar loan can often be entirely offset by savings in electricity costs make it a very safe, low-risk investment.
3.  **Solar Tax Credits**  
Find out if your state offers any solar tax credits in addition to the 30% federal credit.  use your solar tax credit to pay off additional principal further boosting your equity, putting you on the fast track to MPI freedom.
4.  **Attack that loan balance**  
Have an attack dog attitude, don't allow yourself to get complacent with the status quo, take charge of your financial future, make a plan and stick to it!

**Be aware of these 6 things**

1.  **Not all appraisers are familiar with solar panels**
Solar Panels are pretty new and some appraisers are not too familiar with them, or how much value they bring to the house.  When our house was appraised the appraiser company called to ask to gather information about our solar panels, he verified that we, in fact, owned them.  *(I would never rent instead of buy, but Apparently renting Solar Panels is a thing)*  And also asked about the size and cost of the system.  I suspect there will be a good deal of variance on how much value an appraiser believes your solar system brings to the home. So you may want to call 2 or 3 local appraisal companies to get an idea, but the bottom line is that they do add value to your home.  
2.  **Buying before you can do 20% down is not for everyone**
I am in no way endorsing buying a home with less than 20% down, that is the safest way to go.  If you do buy a home with less than 20% down make sure that you are able to save enough every month to pay your mortgage principal down to that 20% mark within a reasonable time frame.  (12-18 Months was my expectation) Remember the possibility that housing prices could drop, causing you to keep PMI much longer than you planned.  So make sure going into the home purchase that you accept the possibility of keeping it for the long term while knowing that you will do everything under your control to get rid of it.  Make sure that you have 3-6 months worth of living expenses.  Completely depleting your savings in order to make a bigger downpayment is not worth the risk.
3.  **Solar panels are not all created equal**
Make sure you are investing in quality, high-grade silicon solar panels. Quality Solar panels should have at least a 30-year life expectancy and at least a 20-25 year warranty.
4.  **It's possible to have too much solar credit**
To take full advantage of the federal solar tax credits you need to have paid at least the full credit amount in taxes over the year.  I have heard that you can collect these credits over two years if you didn't pay enough taxes to claim the full credit.  See a tax professional if needed.
5.  **Plan**
When I refinanced I had a significant amount of money tied up in an escrow account at the old bank.  It took over a month to get the check in the mail.  The new bankrolled about a year of escrow costs into the new loan.  If I had wanted to keep my loan amount the same with the new bank I would have needed to tell them ahead of time and paid for the escrow costs out of pocket while waiting for the previous escrow reimbursement check to come.
6.  **Other Options**
Know that there are loans out there that come with no PMI, the trade off is that they come with a higher interest rate.  For me, as someone who intends to get rid of PMI as soon as possible, I'll take the lower interest every time.",finance
personalfinance,"25yo. Have a plan. Looking for tips/suggestions/recommendations, etc.","A little background.  I've been working for about 18 months now. I started quickly after graduating college.  When I graduated, I didn't really have any savings, just a couple thousand.  But I had about $80k in loans.  Now I've been working and saving and I think I've formulated a plan moving forward.  I would like your inputs, suggestions, comments, tips, etc.  Thanks for everything!  

* Income:  ~76k/year (before overtime).  ~13k/month gross (after OT).  
* Savings:  EFund: ~3k. Checking: ~21k.

* Expenses: Food: ~120/month. Cell Phone: 120/month. Car Insurance: 980/year (paid in full).  
* Misc Expenses: I don't spend much. So maybe ~100/month (average).  

* I have an annuity with Northwestern Mutual.

* Pay off student loans. Projections have them paid off by July/August 2017.  
* Open an IRA. I'm looking at Vanguard. Also looking at a backdoor Roth.    
* Open a brokerage? (taxable?) account.  
* Purchase my father's home from him. There's a plan for that with the lawyers to avoid gift taxes, etc.

* Buy another property to make into a rental property. Perhaps a condo.  

**My Questions for You**  
* The plan. Is there anything I'm missing? I want to get set up right for retirement. I'm trying to cover all my bases.  
* What is the general consensus regarding annuities? I'm not sure about them. I've stopped contributing to it at the moment.  
* Is a rental property feasible, a good idea, a dud?  

For 25 I feel like I am doing well. I am getting ready to make moves towards that IRA, and I just wanted to get a little feedback before I dive in. I know I need an IRA, just want to make sure I'm in order first. The other thoughts I have all the time are regarding my checking account.

Long time lurker here, mainly due to the fact that I'm so terrible with money but so interested in people who are good with it. Go figure. 

I'm a 20 year old student in London and I recently lost my weekend job as a warehouse worker. That job typically earned me no more than £50 a week during term time, and about £230 a week during Christmas/Easter etc. This wasn't actually enough to make rent - the last month before my next loan came in I'd always have to borrow, but the earning helped reduce that by a lot.

Not only have I lost my job, but I've also fallen out relatively badly with my parents, and am not receiving any financial support despite the fact I sort of ended up at University because of them, but that's another story. 

I don't want to sound whiney, I was just wondering if anyone had any pointers for someone paying around £550+ a month in rent who is out of a job and can't seem to find reliable work. It's tough, and I know I'm rambling at this point but my university hours are long and I often get home late in the evening, restricting me to desperately handing my CV in at any pubs/bars/restaurants in my surrounding area, and nothing's coming up. I do the odd weekend shift doing labour, but this is really unreliable and to be honest, I'm fed up of feeling like I can't justify having dinner some days. 

Thanks for reading, and any advice at all, whether it be regarding employment or budgeting (although I don't think this is my issue, more like I just can't support myself earning next to nothing), would be more than appreciated.

Have a great day.",finance

personalfinance,(US/CAN) How do I claim Canadian EI on my U.S. taxes?,"Hi all,


I moved from Canada to the U.S. in early October, and when I filed for EI (Basically Canada's unemployment), they found me eligible for full regular benefits based on my reasons for moving abroad and NAFTA. My EI payments are $537/week, and the Government of Canada is taking off $134/week for federal tax (Works out to approx. $301 USD post tax/week) until I find a job, or until November, whichever comes first.


As this is technically income, I do have to file this on my U.S. taxes, right? Would I receive a tax-break from the U.S. on this income seeing as it's already being taxed 25% on the Canadian side?


Thank you!

personalfinance,"Unusual question about federal taxes, health insurance coverage, and needed paperwork and forms","I am a 42 year old guy in the US. This is the first year I am using an accountant to file my taxes. 

I drove for Uber part time in 2016 and was just going to break even if I filed with TurboTax (as I have done for the last 15+ years) I have a family friend who is an accountant and he talked me into letting him do them for me.

My problem/question is about ACA health coverage.  The first 6 months of 2016 I had health insurance through my full time job.  It was pretty expensive for average coverage, so I was already in the process of getting a plan through a private company (USHealth Group) when I quit that job. My current full-time job doesn't offer insurance but my new plan kicked in immediately and I was never without coverage for 2016.

I never received a 1095 from my new plan. I contacted a friend who works for the company and was told **""We don't do (1095's). Bc we're a private insurance coverage.  We don't meet minimum ACA requirements Bc we don't cover wellness visits, maternity, and birth control""**

As a single guy, none of that was even discussed because it didn't apply to me. My accountant says that without a 1095 for the second half of 2016 I am looking at a $400 fine! 

I don't really understand because I did have full-coverage insurance the entire year. It wasn't cheap either and at no point was it ever discussed that it wasn't ACA compliant.  I did some research and I don't understand how my plan isn't ACA compliant? 

**Q. What happens if I buy insurance but it doesn’t meet the ACA’s minimum essential coverage standards?**

*A. With the exception of short-term health insurance and other non-ACA-regulated plans (travel insurance, accident supplements, medical discount plans, workers’ comp coverage, etc.), all individual health insurance policies sold since January 1, 2014 have been compliant with the ACA’s regulations, and are considered minimum essential coverage.

The ACA requires that most Americans maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty. Minimum essential coverage just means health insurance that is considered good enough to meet the ACA’s individual mandate; people who have minimum essential coverage are not subject to the ACA’s penalty for being uninsured.

Minimum essential coverage includes all new major medical health plans sold since 2014 – all of which are fully compliant with the ACA, including plans purchased outside the exchange.

https://www.healthinsurance.org/faqs/what-happens-if-i-buy-insurance-but-it-doesnt-meet-acas-minimum-essential-benefits-standards/*

Here's my real question...

Is there a form or a way to show the IRS I DID have coverage all year so I don't get fined? Even if I didn't get a 1095 form? I am open to any suggestions and advice. Also, if there's any other info you might need, just let me know and I'll help any way I can.",finance

I bought my home in a 100 year flood zone.  It is owner financed to avoid the $330 a MONTH flood insurance that would have been required by any lender.  My seller warned me about the flood insurance before I made an offer and we came up with an alternative.

My Aunt, who lives down the road, put her house up for sale, but was not aware of the insurance issue because she inherited the house.  She used a realtor thet was not versed in the issue because he was family and wasn't going to charge her a commission.  

I tried to warn them that the only buyers that would want her property would be people who had the full cash price or if it was owner financed, but they didn't listen.

So someone offers them the asking price which they jump on because it's been 6 months with no bites.  The person asks if she can rent the house until her other one sells.  They say 'sure'.  Then after moving in with her three dogs she finds out that she has to carry flood insurance at the price of $445 a MONTH when she finances the house through a bank. 

Who knows what will happen now.  This could have been avoided with a little information and research.  That's why I'm posting this.  The flood insurance is effected by a federal surcharge, so this is not a state to state or insurance company issue.",finance

It speaks of 4% returns not being possible in a population growth of 1% with a productivity growth sub-2% and a growing number of retirees (baby boomers) who have a lot of underfunded entitlements coming their way.


Basically, it's predicting (not a date, but a certainty) a complete crash in asset based wealth, including small cap stocks and index funds, with a huge swath of the population being affected by it.

-Female
-22 YO
-Graduating from a private college
-PA resident
-FICO Score 743
-No credit card debt/car payments
-anticipated monthly allowance towards ALL loan payments $1000-1500

I am graduating as a secondary social studies teacher and will qualify for loan forgiveness after 10 years of my Federal Loans through the Federal Loan Forgiveness Plan.

 -Federal Loans
Approximately $27,900 YTD in Stafford Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans.

I am doing an ICR repayment plan over 25 years. My projected starting income (if I can find a job in the state) is $36,000 starting wage. With the ICR plan at this income my federal payments would range from $200-275 a month if I am approved (which shouldn't be a problem). I won't have to pay these for the full 25 years as anything after 10 years of consecutive payments is forgiven (so long as I am working as a teacher I should say). 

What I have a question about is with consolidating and refinancing my Private Loans. This is the confusing part for me and my college has not been very helpful in helping me understand my options. 

I have two Parent Plus Loans at 
$5468.63 YTD with a 6.84% interest rate 
$6106.08 YTD with a 6.31% interest rate

I can keep them under the Federal government on a graduated payment plan starting at $76 and finishing over 10 years at $227 a month for a total of $16,976. 

It is not an option for me to not pay them.

My federal monthly loan payments would come to a range of $276-502 during the 10 years if I keep the Parent Plus loans consolidated under the Feds.

My current savings is $6,600. I am currently unemployed but upon graduation in May plan on obtaining any job until I can be hired as a teacher.

Currently I do not pay rent.
I spend about $150 a month on gas and groceries.

When I graduate I will pick up my car insurance, phone bill, and other small bills expecting to pay around $150.

My point of posting this is I have two main questions:

Under this sub's guidelines it lists that Parent Plus loans are NOT in the name of the student-I know this- but if I would be able to consolidate them privately for a lower interest rate than currently offered should I? Or should I leave it under the Federal Government's oversight and at their interest rate?

My second question is for consolidating my PRIVATE loans. This is where the heft of my loans are. I have three loans
-Sallie Mae $6,342.83 YTD with a 3.875% interest rate
-PNC $27,345.33 YTD with a 7.89% fixed interest rate
-PNC $28,910.75 YTD with a 8.99% fixed interest rate

I have been researching and plan on consolidating my loans at a lower interest rate (7.89 and 8.99 is outrageous) but I am concerned about finding the best possible choice. I'm responsible, very good at budgeting, and don't mind living frugally. 

I plan on putting every penny towards my loans and want to pay them off as soon as possible but need to have them at a manageable monthly payment. I want to keep them to under 20 years if possible 10-15 years. If I have more money left at the end of each month than my loan payments are I would like to be able to pay ahead and not have a penalty for doing so.

So to recap:

-Should I have my Plus loans left under the Government or consolidate them with a private loan service?
-Suggestions for low interest consolidation companies for private loans?
-Are there better options than the private consolidation companies I have found?
-Is it even possible with my projected income to pay off all my private and federal loans in under 15 years?

personalfinance,(US)To the community- Thanks for putting me on the right path,"Hello PF Community,

I’m writing this as a general thank you for the financial advice and savings tactics that I’ve gained by lurking around on the sub.

A little over a year ago my now wife and I were treading water with our finances. I had always kept to a tight budget for myself (Never carried a credit card balance, paid extra on student loan principals, good saving habits, the whole nine yards) but we kept getting knocked around with surprises from her past. Late payments killing her credit, big credit card payments each month, loans coming out of forbearance, a tax lien from before we started dating…every month we were getting hit with something new and no matter how hard I squeezed our budget I couldn’t turn the page from Survive to Thrive. Add in that I took a new job that temporarily paid me less than I had been making and things didn’t always look that great- we’re both almost 30 and were getting married, so if we wanted to turn our lives around and have a future it we needed to do a complete review and overhaul of the way we treated our day-to-day lives. Worst of all…we were just on different pages on how to handle money. So after a lot of discussion I took control of both budgets and together we started the slow climb towards prosperity.

The first thing we did was attack her credit card debt. I have great credit (785-810 depending on reporting bureau) and she…doesn’t…so we went to the local credit union that we bank through and applied for a cosigned loan to cover the cost of her CC balance (roughly 5K). This eliminated all the high interest cards (between 17-23% on all of them), got us around 5% instead and effectively cut our monthly payment in half. We paid the minimum plus a little extra each month and paid off the rest using wedding money just a few days ago. Suddenly we have an extra $150 per month just from the loan.

Next we needed a plan to eliminate our student loans. All told they amount to about $112K, with $87K being hers and the federally held ones were in forbearance for god knows how long so we’re only paying interest on those right now. Using Excel’s handy loan amortization scheduling template I input all of our loans as they were currently constituted and figured out how long it would take to completely eliminate them. The answer was 22 years and, not unsurprisingly, we both though this was wholly unacceptable. So we decided to take a hybrid snowball approach to things. Remember the $150 we freed up by killing off the CC debt? Starting next month, I’ll still be budgeting it in but $75 will go to the smallest student loan, $50 will go to our newly created 529 plan for our future children, and $25 will go back into our pockets to save or put away to build on projects we’d like to do. 

When I take the balances of all the former payments and apply the formula of 50% towards existing loans/25% towards college/25% back to us to our situation it cuts our repayment down to nine years. 13 years saved, a small nest egg for college being built, and money back in my pocket just by thinking a little. I’m sure it’s not the definition of passive income but it feels like it- I’m making more money and improving my life without having to get another job. I also own a UPromise credit card that gives me 1% back on all purchases. That gets converted into cash which is directly applied to the interest on my loans. On a monthly basis anywhere between 15-25% of my student loan interest is taken care in this manner. We put the federal loans in to IBR and made sure she qualified for PSLF so now it’s just a waiting game until 2026.

I’m still a compulsively budgeter and keep a keen eye on where we are each paycheck, but thanks to a little planning our emergency fund is growing and we finally feel like there’s a little breathing room now. 

We just closed on our first home and there are plans for kids in the next year or so and none of it would be possible without the tips and tricks I learned from this sub. We have a long way to go but it we wouldn’t be anywhere without this community- So from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU to all the internet strangers who helped me turn our lives around!",finance

I plan on being in school for 5 years. I want to know if it's better to cut the loan down to what I actually need, which would be about $4550 per year or to leave it so that whatever I don't use the first year goes to the second, then second to third , so on until the 4th where I'd reject whatever loans I'd have left over.

personalfinance,Refinance student loans at 10yr or 15 yrs to be able to purchase better home?,"Hello, 
I recently started working after grad school, 28F, no kids, not married, and my debt is roughly $88K at avg of 7.27% interest. I am paying $1,033 monthly right now. My income fortunately allows me to be able to make this large debt repayment. 

I am refinancing my student loans and I was quoted by SoFi to get a 10 year plan at 5.75% (Fixed rate) interest which is $965.90 per month. I was also quoted a 15 year payment at 6.125% (Fixed rate) interest at $748.50 per month. The reason I am debating whether to get the 15year plan is because I will be able to save up for a 250K home and keep the budget I want, otherwise if I pick the 10year plan I have to find a home that's at $200k-$220k to keep the budget I want, which is harder to find in the city. 

On the budget side I can do the 10year plan and cut my budget by $200 but I don't like cutting it too close and I still want to keep my vacation fund. The things I can try to figure out to reduce from my budget are below, I know some of this may seem high but I was overestimating (or maybe I am underestimating?) for example for entertainment if I go out every weekend:

Food:               $453.25 per month

Entertainment: $238.55 per month

Clothing/Books/Misc:          $190.84 per month

Groceries:        $100 per month

Vacation Fund:  $238.55 per month


I know that I would try to pay off the student loans faster than the 15 year mark so for months that I can then I will pay over and months that I can't then I will just be paying the minimum $748.50 so would this offset the increased interest rate on the 15year loan since I would be trying to pay the debt faster?
Is it worth it to go the 15year SoFi plan or the 10year??
I would also be investing that money on a more expensive house so maybe there is a cost benefit that I can't calculate in my head which would make it worth it for when I sell in a few years?

personalfinance,"[Debt] Does a debt fall off your credit report from first delinquency, or from first reported to a credit bureau?","Hello, 

 I have a debt from a school I went to a long time ago (about 5 years ago). I ended up calling the school and they will be sending me a bill through the debt collector, but I was curious if there was any way I could be fighting this. I wasn't informed of a debt though because even though I moved, I had my mail forwarded. I had never received a call or letter in the mail about anything revolving around this bill. Fast forward, the debt is now being shown on my credit report for more than the initial amount, and from last year, instead of from the initial time it was considered delinquent. The debt collector says they will not settle the amount as the client requests them not to. 

I would have gladly worked out a payment plan with the school (this isnt a federal loan, it was a bill through the school) however the school says they cannot do anything since it was already passed on to the debt collector. In addition, I feel like they're lying about sending letters because they would have been forwarded to me. 

I will be sending a letter to dispute this, but being young I have very little experience in these sorts of matters. Is there anything else I am missing? Is there something I am doing wrong? Any and all help will be greatly appreciated, thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,True cost of a home purchase?,"Looking for some good data on the true cost of a home purchase. I am just talking about the purchase, and the subsequent monthly payment. 

If I buy a $350,000 house and put $70,000 down, at a 4% interest rate (all just example numbers) I would have a P&amp;I of $1,337 per month and obviously the $70k down.

However, I hear a lot about the other costs in the purchase like closing costs. So my question is, should I really save $70k for 20% down or would I really need to save like $77k (22%) for the closing costs? I hear about 2-3% for closing costs but I don't know if that's actually needed right away, I hear I can just have it added on the end of the loan. But the in that case would I get PMI because I don't have &gt;80% equity?

For the record, I am not asking about PITI, although the calculator I used comes out to $1605 for this purchase (HOA, no PMI, insurance, and taxes (low property tax state)).

I am not asking about the true cost of home ownership, like maintenance etc.

My loans are through two different providers, one of which is only 25K with low interest rates, the other is 65K with interest rates ranging from 9-10.5%!!!

The above method has been working but my high interest rates are killing me! Literally in just the month of March, almost $500 in interest has accrued (ridiculous!!).

personalfinance,Trouble understanding my student loan refinancing options,"Currently, I have a $37,800 private loan with a 8.750% interest rate. I pay the minimum $566 per month. I have about seven years left before I pay off the loan.

So, it seems that over the life of the old loan, I'd be paying 12x7x566= $47,544, which is less than what I would be paying for the refinanced loan, i.e. 12x15x318 = $57,240.

I am a month from graduating with about $20k in loans. Not too unbearable, but still I wouldn't mind trying to lower that as best I can. Couple things I've seen/heard about that I'm curious about: 

Background info: 
Just started working at a non-profit credit union. 
Graduating a state college in New York
Loans through MyFedLoan, 3 Stafford Subsidized, 3 Stafford Unsubsidized

First thing I'm curious about: https://www.hesc.ny.gov/repay-your-loans/repayment-options-assistance/loan-forgiveness-cancellation-and-discharge/nys-get-on-your-feet-loan-forgiveness-program.html
Heard about it before, plan on applying for it the day I graduate if there's no catch or strings. 

Second thing: I see on the MyFedLoan site a button saying ""Do you work in Public Service? You may qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program."" That button takes me here: https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/special-programs/pslf

I scroll down and see that eligible employers include gov't organizations, Peace Corps, not-for-profit tax exempts, and private not-for-profits. I believe a credit union fits one of the last 2. It also says you have to have a qualifying loan types, which my Sub and Unsub do qualify for. But it then goes on to say you have to make 120 qualifying payments... so does that mean i have to do 10 years of monthly payments before the rest gets paid off? or do i get reimbursed those amounts once i make the 120th payment? or do i just have to have a payment plan with 120 scheduled payments and those are the ones taken care of? 

I plan on asking more at my credit union about what they know about regarding loan forgiveness programs, maybe they know more. But in the meantime, any info would be greatly appreciated. Thank you Reddit!",finance
personalfinance,Is this the right time for me to buy a home?,"Hi PF, yay for my first post in here!  My wife and I have been mulling this over for the last few months but I'd be interested in some opinions from other folks who are more experienced in home buying or who have planned better than we have.  We've been renting for the last decade and, want to buy our first actual home (Maryland, work in DC).

I make around $80k/yr, and my expenses amount to roughly 85% to 90% of my monthly post-tax income.  This is after covering all of the bills, groceries, gas, and other needs of the house.  It doesn't leave a lot to work with, so saving up for a down payment on a home has been a very slow process, with only ~6k in the bank for it so far.  My wife is at home with the little ones and is not in the general workforce.

I have a $700/month car payment (16.5%) due to a poorly rushed choice to buy a new car 2 years ago when I had a 540 credit average after having 2 used cars die on me in quick succession.  I usually over-pay on the loan every month and have never missed a payment.  This plus a few other efforts on my part have brought me up to a 720+ average.  Hooray!  The buyout on the auto loan is under 25k now, which is less than the original purchase price... I think that means I have equity in the car now?

I've already spoken to a few Realtors in my region and (of course) they're all eager to work with me and hook me up with their lender, promising lots of different loan programs that can work around my limited savings, but I haven't started down that path yet as I don't want a bunch of credit inquiries hitting my stats if this just isn't a smart move yet.  **So I'm looking for some advice :)**

* *What would be the better option?  Refinance the car, save another 200-300 a month towards that down payment and just plan on trying to buy a home in another year?  Trade in the car (2015 Tacoma) for a different vehicle (new or used) with a good interest rate and lower payment?  Or, given the unknowns with what loan rates will look like in 1 or 2 years, would we be better off to attempt to buy the house now?  Maybe try to refinance the car at the same time?*

Full story that isn't 100% necessary to read:

Hi there. I'm wanting to buy a house for the first time and I'm trying to figure out how the loan process works.

I make $105k/year base with a 10% yearly bonus. This said, I also make an additional ~70k/year from RSU vests.

In July, I will be receiving my first vest, which will be $70k gross, and I'll be receiving around $5.6k/month from stock vests after that. At that point, I'll have somewhere around $50k from the stock vest, $10k from my Roth IRA (which I'm of the belief that I can withdraw penalty-free) , as well as a few other sources. I also have a 401k sitting at around $40k which I could possibly take out a loan against for another $20k. I believe I can get around $80k toward a down payment by July.

My gross income from only my salary is $8750/month, but this doesn't tell the whole story, as my gross income that includes all income sources (but not investments) is around $190k/year.

I've heard that there are some calculations that things like RSU vests and bonuses cannot be factored into.

I'd like to get a loan so that I can lock in at a low interest rate. I'd also like to avoid any kind of loan that would lock me into paying mortgage insurance for the entire length of it or one that would force me to refinance and possibly lose my low interest rate. (PMI or MIP? I don't understand these too well, but I know I'll hit 20% principle very quickly, especially considering the fact that I plan to renovate by hand).

What do you think the maximum I'd be approved for is? What's the maximum I'm legally allowed to be approved for and what amounts would I be likely to be approved for?

My credit score is around 745, for reference and my student loans are relatively low and I don't have a car loan.

To try and sum it up (I'm not great with terminology) after the new federal regulations Edward Jones is changing how they invest, I think. I opened an account with them 2 years ago with about $70,000 and paid 4.75% fee upfront plus every time I put more money in, A share investments. With the fee up front I now only pay yearly maintenance which is $40 with all my accounts. I have a Roth and Traditional IRA.

Now they want me to transfer all my funds to this new program that will only charge 1.3%ish in commission a year with no cost of moving funds around as needed vs my original A shares. 

I guess my question is, is this a good move, are there things I should be cautious about? Talking to my rep he highly recommends it and believes the money I lost in A share fees will be made up faster in this system.

personalfinance,State of MD wants to tax me on a car I paid taxes on. Any options?,"I moved to MD from PA in December, but I actually established residency in MD earlier in late October. This was because I work in healthcare and needed to get the ball rolling in terms of professional licensure, Federal DEA licensure, etc, in time for me to actually be able to start working in the hospital on time.

Once I moved here, I tried to get my car registered, but I had request the lien holder to transfer the title to the state of MD first. After that, I had to get my car to pass inspection. It failed the first time, had to get some repairs, then it passed. Well come to my surprise, I learn that if I didn't get the car registered within 60-days of establishing residency, I have to pay a 6% excise tax on the NADA value of the car + fees - roughly $1,000. This is on top of the 6% tax I've already paid to PA. Car valued at $14,xxx per NADA.

The nice person at the Tag &amp; Title place doesn't know if there's a way around this. I'm hoping someone has some other ideas. Some considerations:

- Although I moved to MD in December, my lease in PA actually didn't end until the end of this month. Can I use this as grounds of saying my primary residence was in PA? 
- I'm not particularly beholden to a car. Would it be better for me to try to sell the car, then buy another car, than it would be to pay taxes again? (might be a stretch, not worth doing the whole car shopping thing)
-At the very least, is this tax deductible?

personalfinance,The Case for Saving Less for Retirement/ The Value of Debt.,"Came across this article on Bloomberg about a financial advisor who states that paying down debt is actually not the best financial decision someone can make. Obviously this depends on the interest rate to some degree, as paying down debt can be a way to earn ""gaurunteed returned"" (read: forgone additional costs), but the points brought up about liquidity sort of changed my mind on the subject. 

Essentially, to him, it seems better to have $50k in cash and $50k in debt than just $0 total. Wanted to here PF's thoughts on this since this sub seems to be very anti-debt in most circumstances.

personalfinance,Don't know whether to close an unused credit card and get a personal loan or try and pay down three cards,"Due to some life events and poor budgeting, I've managed to rack up 9K in credit card debt across 2 cards.  The first has $5,000 and a $7,500 limit and 23.49% interest rate while the second has $4,000 from an $18,000 limit (interest 19.74%).  I was looking into getting a $10,000 personal loan to pay off the current debt and any trailing interest as well as to pay just one place a month.  However, while researching that I discovered that some times it is better to open another credit card, transfer the balance at 0 cost and 0 interest.  I decided to do that, opened a Chase Slate card and applied to have my 2 balances transferred.  The issue came up when only approved a $4,000 credit limit.  

At this point it seems like I'm faced with 2 options.  The first is to transfer my 4K balance to the chase card and pay that down at zero interest but still have to pay off my 5k with interest.  The main issue with this plan is that then I will be using a big chunk of my available credit, accruing interest at a higher rate on my current card and I will still be paying 2 places. The second would be to apply for the personal loan, pay off my balances and then close the (unused) chase card.  Obviously the issue with this plan is the potential fees associated with the loan and the hit to my credit of closing a card (current credit is about 715).  

I'm leaning towards seeing if I can get the loan mostly because I want one payment.  However, I hoped someone here would be able to let me know how stupid this plan is.  Thanks!

investing,How to do Due Diligence on a RIA/Adviser,"Preamble: I wrote this a long time ago for /r/PF but got no response to it.  Every now and then someone here will find themselves suddenly with a large windfall and no idea how to handle it.  Hopefully this is of help to at least a few of you.


""There's a sucker born every minute"" - probably someone wanting to get rich quick.  And while a sucker continues to be born every single minute, there will be someone posing as an ""adviser"" waiting to slowly drain you of your cash.  After yet another front page post of someone being sweet-talked into ridiculously loaded funds and unnecessary insurance products, I've decided to create a post to let people know how to research an adviser.  

If you are currently with an adviser and concerned that something is amiss, or you are currently in talks with an adviser and unsure you should let them handle your money you will need these two websites:

* [FINRA's BrokerCheck](http://brokercheck.finra.org/)
* [SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure Investment Adviser Search](http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/Search/iapd_Search.aspx)

FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) is not a government regulatory agency, but rather a non-profit [self-regulatory organization](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sro.asp) dedicated to promoting the safety of investors.  How they do this is through requiring anyone who wants to give investment advice or sell securities to pass exams that demonstrate knowledge.  Two of the more prominent of these exams are the Series 7 and the Series 65.  The Series 7 exam allows one to trade securities and the Series 65 allows one act as an investment adviser and give advice to clients.

Now, why this is important in the RIA space is because it determines how your adviser is allowed to act.  

The SEC is the government body in charge regulating the securities industry, and more importantly, those who work in the industry.  From their website, this is what the IAPD does: 

&gt;The Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) database provides instant access to registration documents filed by more than 25,000 SEC- or state-registered investment advisers. IAPD provides access to Form ADV filings made by investment adviser firms that register electronically using the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD). IAPD also provides access to registration information filed with the states by investment adviser representatives (certain individuals that are employed by an investment adviser).

Which means that legally, anyone holding themselves in the public as a registered investment adviser must file a public disclosure.  There are exemptions to when someone must register as a registered investment adviser, however, those exemptions are very specific.

The most important thing of note on the IAPD is the firm form [ADV](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/advform.asp).  The ADV is split into two parts.

Part 1A of the ADV lists the following:

* General business contact information and principal office (certain firms may have grown and can afford multiple offices) (Item 1)

* How the firm classifies itself (large advisory firm, small advisory firm, pension consultant, advisory with main office outside of the US (Item 2)

* Individual states the firm is authorized to trade or sell securities in (Item 2)

* How many employees the firm has and how many are allowed to give investment advice, licensed to sell insurance, or registered with a state to sell securities (Item 5)

* How the advisers are compensated (Item 5)

* What type of services the firm provides (Item 5)

* If the firm is involved with other business activities and if the firm sells products (If yes, go to Section 6.3B of Schedule D) (Item 6)

* If the firm is has any potential professional/financial industry conflicts of interest (Item 7)

* If the firm has any client conflict of interest (Item 8)

* If the firm or any affiliate has been convicted of a felony, misdemeanor, been in trouble with the SEC or Commodity Futures Trading Commission, any other federal or state regulatory agency, any self-regulatory organization (such as FINRA, or even the New York Stock Exchange), or if the firm/any affiliate has been in trouble for investment-related activity. (Item 11)

Part 2 of the ADV is the ""Firm Brochure"".  Every single firm is required to hand this out and I highly recommend you ask your advisor for theirs.  The brochure will list how the firm charges for compensation, the types of clients they do business with, and the code of ethics of the firm.

Schedule A lists the owners of the firm
Schedule B lists any indirect owners
Schedule D (yes, D, not C) is the general ""extra info"" schedule.  Usually, if an adviser has checked some box ""yes"" where you think it should have been checked ""no"" there will probably be an explanation in Schedule D.  For example, if you see that a firm checks yes in the section asking if they ""sell products or provide other services"", Schedule D may state that the firm offers a fee for tax preparation.

Now, with all of that said, let's go into IAPD and BrokerCheck to search for a firm in my hometown.

[On the IAPD search page](http://imgur.com/dZ4lV8H) you can search by individual or by firm.  However, if you have nothing in mind, you can just do a general search in an area code, like I am doing.  Once you hit search, you'll be presented with a list of every firm in that radius who registers as an investment adviser or brokerage with the SEC or the state it resides in.  [At the bottom you can see there were 53 hits for a 5 miles radius in the 23320 area code](http://imgur.com/WycfFnx).  I'm going to focus on Lincoln Financial Advisors Corporation.  This firm offers brokerage services as well as investment advice.  Both of the blue links are clickable and in fact, clicking on the brokerage link will take you to FINRA's BrokerCheck website, since that is the organization in charge of regulating brokers.  For now, we'll click on Investment Adviser Firm.  That will bring you [here](http://imgur.com/e5AM4fy).  The first thing that should stand out is if this firm is registered with the SEC or not.  If it is not registered with the SEC, then that isn't immediately a cause for concern.  If a firm manages less that $100 million and is housed in a state that doesn't require registration, then the firm is not required to register with the SEC.

Click on the blue SEC and then you'll be into the form ADV.  Scroll down a bit and on the left you'll see all the [items, brochure, and schedule links](http://imgur.com/hyjZ4by).  From here you can explore anything.  

* From Item 1 I can see that the principle office is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and not Chesapeake, Virginia.  

* In Item 5 I see that the company employs 1480 people, so it looks like I'm dealing with a large company, and not a small local shop. I can also see that the firm charges compensation by percentage of assets under management, hourly charges, fixed fees, and commissions.  They are involved with numerous activities, so it's possible they do tax filing services or sell insurance.  Right below I can see that it provides educational seminars for a fee.

 * In Item 6 I can see that it is also involved in the broker-dealer business and insurance business

* In item 8 I can see that the firm checked yes to
&gt; do you or any other related person recommend purchase or sale of securities to advisory clients for which you or any related person has any other sales interest (other than the receipt of sales commissions as a broker or registered representative of a broker-dealer)?

and

&gt; do you or any other related person recommend purchase of securities to advisory clients for which you or any related person serves as underwriter, general or managing partner, or purchaser representative?

Which means that they recommend securities that someone related to their practice has a vested interest in and that they recommend securities that have their own vested interest in.


[Here's a real fun page from their Item 11](http://imgur.com/a/QNYlg).

Let's go into BrokerCheck to see how or what their regulatory offenses.  [BrokerCheck has a similar working search feature](http://imgur.com/HNK3xqU).  So I'm going to go search 23320 for the firm.   After searching the firm and scrolling down a little, you'll see [this](http://imgur.com/DpAeqpB).  This shows you what the firm again registers as, what those terms mean, the main office, and if it has disclosures (which we already knew about from the IAPD).  We can click on ""detailed report"" and have a report created for us.  This report will tell us

* the extent of the firm's disclosures

* if it is currently suspended with any regulators

* who it registers under

* The details of any allegation the firm has been through [for example](http://imgur.com/ScCHbq8)


The details of everything I just went through can also be done with an individual!


From all of this, I personally wouldn't invest with Lincoln Financial Advisors, mainly because I enjoy the feel of a smaller office and a company that was started in the area I live.  Also, I don't live in my hometown and I work in the industry.

Hopefully this was of some help to you.  One day I'll go back and make everything a little easier to read and more concise.",finance

personalfinance,Looking to purchase a home in the Seattle Area and having no luck due to bidding wars. Should we buy a new home at a higher price?,"My spouse and I (26 and 30) both live and work in the Seattle area and have been looking for homes for over a year. Home prices in this area have been soaring and every house we have been on has gone for at least 15% more than asking price. As an example, we just put a bid on a property listed at 424k, our bid was 490k, the house ended up going for 540k. 

We are currently renting at $1600/mo in a 900 sq ft apartment. My OTE (on target earnings) are 120k, she is a teacher at a public school and makes 50k a year. On any given year I could make more or less then 120k - as an example, last year I made 155k, this year I'm probably going to be around 120 - 130k.  

We are now looking almost 40 minutes outside of Seattle. We originally were hoping to have a mortgage of 350 - 450k with a 5% downpayment. We have about 75k in savings, and about 85k in retirement funds. There is no student loan debt, and one car payment with 10k left on it.

We have found a home that is new construction, however, its out of the price range we were hoping for originally but would not require a bidding war. The total for the house is 511k, however, we are assuming there will be some ""upgrades"" we'll want in the house, but we believe we can keep those to about 20k. We thought the payment with taxes/PMI, mortgage, etc.. would be around 3200/mo and although that was high, we felt we could handle it. However, we just found out it would be closer to $3600/mo. 

We aren't quite sure what to do. The payment seems very high and although we could put more down, I'd rather keep cash on hand. Part of me thinks we should jump on this opportunity as Seattle is one of the fastest growing cities in the country and its high-wage jobs that are coming in. It feels less like a bubble and more of a supply/demand issue. Interest rates are still very low for a mortgage - around 4.25% here, and if we wait and try to save more, I'm concerned rates will go up and housing prices will. On the other hand, 3600/mo seems very high and if it turns out this is a bubble, then waiting a bit seems to be the smarter option.

There is no immediate (within 6 months at least) plans to spend the money and I am not necessarily closing on a home/apartment. Just in the planning stages for now.

Am I stupid for not investing the money while I sort out my living situation? My thought process was to keep the money readily available in the event that I decide to purchase and was worried with the new Trump presidency and all-time market highs that it would be a risky short-term decision to invest.

Also, is it better to allocate a higher percentage of money towards the down-payment to reduce the overall mortgage impact or to allocate a percentage of that money towards investment/retirement? Figure it's a battle of interest rate vs returns, but not sure which is better.

Monthly expenses: 3100 including fun personal spending budgeted in

We had a wedding in September after buying a house in August and did some things around the house over the winter so it's been expensive. The biggest change is that both my wife and I are in union protected pensioned jobs that might not pay a lot (special ed teacher and social worker) but are extremely stable. Our pensions automatically take 9% of our paycheck pre-tax. 

Our debts:

Car 2- 9200 remaining @ 0% 233/mo
Student Loan 1- 31k @ varying between 3-6% 191/mo and public loans 
Student Loan 2- 8k @ 8.75% private loan 100/mo

1) Should we continue to focus on paying off car 1 and Student Loan 2? Which is better first?
2) is it worth it to try to tackle at a faster rate the 31k of federal loans knowing 17.5k will be forgiven in 5 years?
3) since we both have pensions and stable jobs, should we focus on maxing our Vanguard IRA or open another retirement account?

So for a simple example for me to wrap my head around this concept; I buy a $10k bond, priced at $99.901613 per $100 for $9,990, in 30 years I will get $10k when the bond matures, right? Well on [this page](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/annceresult.htm) interest rates vary, but for the sake of this example lets say my hypothetical bond has an interest rate of 3%.

As for our current situation; combined income is $130k (fiance expecting $5-10k raise this year), I contribute 6% 401k with my company matching 8.5%, fiancé contributes 3% with 1.5% company match, we both maxed out Roth IRAs in 2016 and I have $4k in for 2017. We each have $10k emergency funds. Our only other funds are $17k in stocks (ETFs mostly) that I have been purchasing once my IRA is maxed. We live together paying $1600 in rent a month for a 2bed, 1bath older apartment. We are planning on staying in the area and have pretty stable jobs in a great job market. Currently we are saving $2.5k/mo with no debts (paid cash for cars, fiancé recently paid off student loans). Credit scores are both 780+.

We want to buy a $350-380k townhouse but would only be able to put 10% down by this fall if we cashed out our $15k in Roth IRA’s (no penalty for home purchase). My company contributes $12k to closing/down payment for FTHB which would more than cover closing costs. This would put our payments around $2,300 all in with $180/mo PMI, assuming a 4.15% interest rate (we could get a lower % currently but don’t know if the will rise in the next 6 months). That is 22% DTI which seems more than reasonable to us and we would still have our $20k emergency fund and $35k in 401k. Is cashing out our IRA’s to put only 10% down reasonable? Are we better off waiting 18 months until we have the full 20% down payment without cashing out IRAs, but most likely get a higher interest rate?

I contacted the school to see what information they could give me, but they just told me that I would need to pay my outstanding balance with the state, and that I could probably take out a private loan to cover the 6k balance. 


The bad part is, I don't even know what institution I would go to to take out a loan like that. I feel lost. I know there's a way out of this, but I'm having a lot of trouble figuring it out. Any help, or advice would be a godsend.

personalfinance,Snowball vs. Avalanche - how should you value cash flow flexibility?,"As has been discussed at length here, the avalanche method is financially optimal, but there are two main advantages to the snowball method:

1. The psychological boost from paying off individual debts in full as quickly as possible
2. The cash flow flexibility (due to lower minimum payment obligations overall)

&amp;nbsp;

Let's leave #1 alone since the psychological benefit varies dramatically from person to person. You do you.

Number 2 is a bit more interesting to me. It feels like something we can quantify. Let's try!

&amp;nbsp;

#How much am I willing to pay for peace of mind?

Our e-funds grant us peace of mind, let's use those to estimate!

&amp;nbsp;

*Assumptions:*

* $30,000 e-fund (6 months x $5,000 / month in expenses)
* 1% return on e-fund
* 6% discount rate (opportunity cost of not using the $30k to pay the loan below)

&amp;nbsp;

**Outcome #1: I am willing to pay $6,400 NPV (1% return for 5 years, discounted back by 3%) for $30,000 worth of peace of mind for 5 years**

&amp;nbsp;

**Outcome #2: I am willing to pay $4,000 NPV (1% return for 3 years, discounted back by 3%) for $30,000 worth of peace of mind for 3 years**

&amp;nbsp;

#Applying this figure to a hypothetical situation

&amp;nbsp;

*Assumptions:*

* $5,200 to pay down either loan A or loan B
* Loan A: $5,200 balance, 5% interest rate, $100 / month minimum payment, 5 years left
* Loan B: $25,000 balance, 6% interest rate, $280 / month minimum payment, 10 years left

&amp;nbsp;

Paying down Loan A would save you ~$615 in interest (NPV) over the course of those 5 years. 

&amp;nbsp;

It also gives you the opportunity to pay $100 / month towards the 6% loan, which saves an additional ~$850 in interest (NPV) over those 5 years.

&amp;nbsp;

It would ALSO give you $5,200 worth of peace of mind for 5 years. Using Outcome #1 of the e-fund calculation above, we know that each $ of peace of mind for 5 years is worth $0.215 in NPV ($6,400 / $30,000). In this case, the peace of mind benefit is worth ~$1,120 ($5,200 x $0.215).

&amp;nbsp;

**Paying down Loan A is worth $2,585 NPV ($615 + $850 + $1,120)**

&amp;nbsp;

Paying down Loan B by would save you ~$1,600 NPV in interest over that same 5 year period.

&amp;nbsp;

However, it also shortens the length of the loan by ~3 years. Using Outcome #2 of the e-fund calculation above, we know that each $ of peace of mind for 3 years is worth $0.135 in NPV ($4,000 / $30,000). In this case, the peace of mind benefit is worth ~$1,080 ($8,000 (what the loan balance would be normally with 3 years left) x $0.135).

&amp;nbsp;

BUT WAIT this $1,080 in peace of mind value will not be realized for another 7 YEARS - we need to discount it back (@ 3% inflation) to its present value = $880

&amp;nbsp;

**Paying down Loan B is worth $2,480 NPV ($1,600 + $880)**

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

#BOTTOM LINE: putting the $5,200 towards loan A (5% interest) is more valuable ($2,585 NPV) than putting it towards loan B (6% interest, $2,480 NPV) when considering the cost of peace of mind

&amp;nbsp;

#SNOWBALL FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&amp;nbsp;

*Notes:*

* The e-fund amount dramatically impacts the ""how much am I willing to pay for peace of mind?"" calculation - the higher the e-fund, the higher the value
* I rounded a lot
* I'm sure I made many mistakes and welcome your feedback!

&amp;nbsp;

*Edit:*

* Updating to a 6% discount rate since that is the true opportunity cost of having an e-fund in this scenario",finance
personalfinance,"Bank never made payment, charged me fees for not making it, and still removed the amount of the charge? Has ballooned to ~700$. Please advise.","I really don't know what to do. 
This feels terrible, I just wanted to know if I can fight it.

I took out an 1000$ loan against my car, and had a 500$ personal loan as well, with THE MOST AMAZING BANK IN THE WORLD:
Palmetto Citizens Federal Credit Union. 
I lost my job and my life basically blew up. 
I moved to Asheville to live with a friend, and rebuild. 
I was making some progress, and had just barely gotten to the point where I could make a minimum payment on the debt. PCFCU was incredibly tolerant and understanding of my troubles, and we worked out a plan to pay 75$ per week (I was being paid weekly at the time).
In order to transfer these funds, I went to Asheville Savings Bank and opened an account. I signed the ""opt out of 'overdraft protection'"" document, and was thus under the impression that it was not possible to have my account go negative as a result. 
It was my understanding that charges would be declined if the funds were not available.
The payments were set to come out on Fridays, as I got paid on Thursdays and always deposited/cashed the check that day.
The very first week a payment was supposed to come out, meaning a week after I opened the account, I got pretty ill Wednesday night and couldn`t go in on Thursday or Friday.

Monday, I went to work, and on my lunch break drove over to ASB with my check. I was informed that my account was ~200$ in the negative. PCFCU had attempted to get the 75$, and when that failed, had attempted to do so again on Monday. Without my paycheck, the account only had ~3$ in it. So they declined, of course. Here is where I lose my shit and any understanding of this situation. ASB arrived at that amount (about -200$) by:
1. Charging my account two (2) ""declined transaction"" charges, at 35$ a piece. 
2. Charging my account two (2) 75$ amounts.

The ""charging"" on #2 is misleading, in that I have confirmed with PCFCU that ASB never sent 75$ or 150$ or ANY funds to them.

I must admit, in the middle of the work day and still not feeling too well, I had what can be best described as a terse encounter with the teller. I demanded my account be closed immediately, to prevent what I viewed as further theft from occurring. She responded the account ""could not be closed with a negative balance."" I did not know what to do, and had to get back to work. I called the WONDERFUL people at PCFCU and they killed the payment plan and said we'd revisit the matter when I got into a better place, financially. They really are amazing.

My life took a turn for the worse, and I experienced a period of homelessness that has only recently ended. The elapsed time between then and now is about 2 years.

I went to a local bank here in Georgia where I now live, and learned that ASB had filed a claim or whatever in the CHEX(?) system that would prevent me from opening any bank account until it was settled. The amount was for 647.53$.
Just to recap how they got to that amount, verified by both ASB and PCFCU:
Two 75$ amounts that never got paid to anyone, literally just line-items for -75.00$. PFCFU never recieved those funds. 
490$ in fees for having a negative balance, apparently two of which were for declining the -75$ attempted charges.

Last communication with ASB was today:
""You owe that money, period, we aren`t going to negotiate or settle""
Last communication with PFCFU was today:
""Hey Chris, thanks for the call. I remember you from a few years ago, how is your Mom? Oh, that's good. No, we never received any funds from ASB. Look, just let us know when you get things going and we'll work something out, ok? ""

So: 
1. In general, on ASB, what the fuck? Like, how did they violate the ""opt-out"" document? How can they charge me for the 75$ if THEY DID NOT PAY IT?
2. How can I dispute that amount? To avoid the hassle and just move on I offered them 400$ and that was declined. This was before I was aware that they had not even ever paid the 150$, so now I feel even giving them anything is not correct.
3. Maybe I should just give up and not have a bank account. File for bankruptcy? Just suck it up and pay them? The last bit is the one I am REALLY struggling with, because I would rather pay PFCFU back for the ACTUAL money they gave me, as opposed to being bullied by ASB into paying them ~700$ for the service of declining two charges.

Thanks, in advance. My aunt is helping me to fix these problems and it just makes me sick accepting her help at all: I'm managing those feelings of anxiety and self-loathing, but the idea that that help would be going to ASB for nothing is just too much to bear. I just broke down earlier when I got off the phone with them.

personalfinance,Using HELOC as checking-account - is it advisable?,"Has anyone here used a HELOC as a checking account? If so was it a good thing for you? The basic idea is to have all of your paychecks auto-deposited into the HELOC, paying down the balance, and then withdraw from the HELOC when you need funds. There are two sub-approaches: (1) REPLACE your mortgage with a HELOC (so the HELOC goes into first lien position). (2) ""chunking"" strategy where you have the HELOC in 2nd lien position, and use it to pay down the mortgage in chunks -- in between chunks you are paying off the HELOC. 

I'm looking at getting some education with the ""Replace Your Mortgage"" guys, but not sure if I should go that route.

personalfinance,Am I living outside my means?,"I'm 26 years old and finally finished my undergrad last December (it took me 6 years...)
I landed a full-time job last August and had a roommate until this February, so my expenses were about half what they are now for 6 months. Back in August, I set a goal for myself to take advantage of having a roommate for a few more months and pay off my only private student loan (which I just achieved this month.) 

Now that I've been without a roommate for a few months and my paychecks have settled out to what I think I can safely assume they will be for a while, I'm trying to look at my options and decide what the best thing to do right now would be. In June, my Federal student loans will enter repayment and I've looked at all of the repayment options. Their minimum monthly payments range from $28 - $450 per month and I'd like to pay them off as quickly as reasonably possible, but I know I can't afford to pay as much as I'd like.

I bought my car in cash back in 2008, so I don't have a car payment. I also live only 3 miles from my job, so I spend very little on gas. It's an older car (old enough to vote this year, actually) so it does rack up the occasional maintenance expense. Right now it desperately needs all new tires and my vehicle registration is due for renewal this month ($85.) 

I keep a Google spreadsheet of all of my bills, but I've gone a little spend happy these last three months (mostly I bought a washer and dryer that set my savings back $1100 alone) so now I'm concerned that I've actually dug myself a hole that I might not be able to afford.

**On paper:**

* Rent - $910
* Gas bill - between $15 and $85 depending on the season (heater is gas; I'm from Texas so 75% of the year it's &lt;$20.)
* Electricity - Nov-May: $20-$40, Jun-Oct: $60-$100 
* Internet - $63
* Phone - $78
* Renter's Insurance - $17
* Car Insurance - $60
* Groceries - budgeted at $120 and I usually hit or stay under for this
* Entertainment - budgeted at $75 (some months are over, some under)
* **Total Monthly Expenses: $1,415**
* My monthly salary: $1780
* Current savings: $2300 (I had no furniture when my roommate left, so I spent a fair chunk of what I had on a beautiful craigslist couch, a washer and dryer, and a dining room table.)

I feel like my monthly expenses are extremely reasonable and I'm not really a shopper (minus the last 3 months of big purchases that I was just too excited to be patient for.) 

My main expense is obviously my rent. I know I'm breaking the ratio for income:rent expense, but I've looked into moving and I don't have the cash to afford the deposits that would come with a move (I have a border collie and a cat and most places in my area are weight restricted, meaning my 45lb dog is too heavy to even be considered, or they charge additional pet rent for each pet on top of the pet deposits, on top of the application fee, on top of the main deposit, and you can see how this quickly adds up to $2500 just to move initially.) The rental options in my area aren't much cheaper than what I pay now, so I don't think it would be worth the expense to leave my current place. My boyfriend will also be moving in with me at some point in the next several months. Right now he lives an hour away, so he's waiting on a job transfer which has moved incredibly slow :( Once he moves in, we'll both be paying the bills and some of our other expenses will go down (he spends a lot driving and we eat out more often than we normally would since we sometimes meet halfway between our home towns.)

My worry is that I'm cutting it so close each month and I won't be able to build my savings back up. Since I drive an older car, I do have occasional emergency maintenance expenses. One or two emergency occurrences would wipe my savings account out completely. I also don't have the cash sitting around to cover my insurance deductibles and I really like to keep my savings closer to $5k. Now that my private loan is paid off, I considered finally getting a credit card so that I would have that as an alternative to dipping into my almost non-existent savings, but I feel like I'm behind the curve in that realm and I don't even know where to begin. I'm also pretty afraid of credit cards because I don't want to end up with something I never use but still have to pay a monthly/yearly fee for.

**TL:DR** Does anyone have any recommendations for me? Should I try to find a way to lower my monthly expenses so that I can focus on paying down my remaining student loans more aggressively; should I just pay the minimum on them for now and focus on building my savings back up? Should I bother with the credit card idea at all?

I had to stop going to college due to bad grades after about 99 credits. I was living on my own and working full time took away from school.

Should the hard fork happen, the minority chain would have a very harsh life. It is extremely unlikely that it will be able to survive.  

It would require an enormous set of efforts for solving all the problems that it would face. Supposing that the hard fork happens reaching 75% of mining power, the minority chain would get only the remaining 25%, and they would find one block every 40 minutes. The transaction backlog would grow out of control and users, exchange, traders will not be able to confirm their operations. Remaining stubborn miners will earn so little that they would be pushed to move on the bigger branch, and it will happen, making the situation on the minority branch worse. After the retarget will happen, when the mining difficulty will adjust, the shorter branch would be easily vulnerable to a 51% attack that would damage it to death. Keeping the minority chain alive is NOT worth it.  

Even because after the hard fork, Bitcoin would be exactly the same as before, with the only difference that it could be able to produce ALSO slightly bigger blocks. Even if a pool would set EB to 10 MB (the new blocksize limit), it doesn't mean that we would find ourselves with 10 MB blocks, because there are not enough transactions to fill them up. And spam transactions would still be discouraged because it would need A LOT of those to fill 10 MB of space, and they would not come for free: miners would not include free transactions to make fat blocks because they would risk that another miner might make their new block an orphan mining a smaller block. Therefore big blocks miners would include only transactions that are capable of paying for the increased loss probability.  

Bitcoin AFTER the hard fork will me exactly like now, without long TX suspended in a giant queue for hours if not days, with cheaper TX fees.  

At this point it would be simple to fix TX malleability implementing Segwit (that it is not a scaling option) in a proper way (not like a dirty patch currently proposed as a soft fork by Core) or Flex-trans through another hard-fork, that this time will be accepted by anyone because it would bring no disadvantages and would happen quickly and without bad consequences.  
Now everything would be ready to turn on the 2nd layer off chain solutions (like the Lightning Network), that will provide a pressure to keep the blocksize down to what it is necessary. At the same time, the possibility to produce blocks greater than 1 MB would still help these new technologies because it would be cheap and easy to open and close paymet channels, using the necessary space.  

All this mess made to keep blocks small is pure nonsense. All those claims that bitcoin will be split in two it's just psychological terrorism, yes it could happen, but with huge efforts and no advantages, it would happen only because some people are stubborn, not because of the market.  

Don't let a company of few persons choose what and how things will be done with Bitcoin (centralized governance). Blockstram hired many core devs, who once were in favor to the block size increase and suddenly changed their mind (google for that if you don't believe), and it is trying to deeply modify the original Bitcoin concept.  

Unlimited, Classic, EC, XT are 4 different implementations and they all have the same vision (decentralized governance). This is the choice that will keep bitcoin free and that would keep it closer to the original guidelines described in the whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto. Those claims about big blocks meaning ""centralization"" are pulled out from the ass, it is not proved and it is not provable, and it is abused to spread uncertainity and fear. Indeed it is the exactly opposite: choosing Core means trusting few people (who heavily apply censorship and deception, and it has already been proved).  

Be relaxed. If the hard fork will come, it will be very positive, it would place an end, forever, to this political debate lasting more than two years that is currently damaging everyone.  

Last note: it is true that Bitcoin Unlimited has been attacked because of a few bugs in its code. Bugs that didn't cause any big damage (nobody lost money, the bugs just caused the program to quit). If Unlimited will be adopted by the mass, there will be more and more developers that will work on the code, helping to make ti safer and safer. Bug can be fixed, wrong governance would make permanent damages. And if you don't like Unlimited or you don't trust it, there are other options (Classic, EC and soon XT).

personalfinance,H&amp;R promises the max return but TurboTax found $200+ in state refund,"I prepared my taxes at two sites, TurboTax and H&amp;R Block. TurboTax out of habit, kept trying to access the 'freedom' versio where I could file state and fed for free.  Didn't work, so I went and found H&amp;R which would do both filings for free.

personalfinance,Should I switch from 403b to IRA?,"Normally I would read up these sort of things myself but this month I'm on a surgery rotation getting 4-5 hours of sleep a night so I'm hoping to get some advice.

Story is a couple of years ago I worked in a non-profit hospital and set up a 403b with them. I never really thought much about it since it was a part time job and only saved up about $500 or so while working there.

Recently I received an email stating this:

---

Currently, the Plan’s costs for administrative services are paid through offsets associated with some or all of the Plan’s investment options. Using offsets to pay the Plan’s administrative costs is a common approach. Additional administrative fees are not deducted from your account, and these amounts are not reflected on your quarterly account statement.

Effective January 1, 2017, _____ has directed Fidelity to deduct a plan administrative fee of $13.25 from your account on a quarterly basis ($53 annually). Beginning with your 3/31/17 quarterly statement, the plan administrative fee will be shown as a separate line item labeled “recordkeeping fee”. In addition, you will see this fee appear under the “Transaction History” section of your account on Fidelity NetBenefits®.

---

I have no idea what this means. Does it mean they will charge me a $13.25 fee for my paltry $500? As a student I'm not working right now so I have no income living on student loans. 

Should I take this amount and put it into a traditional IRA? Can I take the money out? Can I put it somewhere else for now until I have more time to research and figure out what to do?

The interest rate on my student loans is like 6.8 percent. Heck, I'm wondering if I should just take the money out and use it for rent. I understand there would be a penalty and fees for that too.

personalfinance,"How much taxes should I be paying on 110,000?","Hey there r/personalfinance,

I'm in a bit of a pickle and unsure how to approach my taxes this season. I worked full-time for a part of the year, and as an independent contractor for the rest. I misjudged how much I would be making as a contractor and only paid $9,000 in estimated taxes over the course of the year. As I'm inputting the numbers to TurboTax, the amount it tells me I owe is.. worrisome. 

Scenario:

* 39,000 taxed income | 8,000 federal income tax withheld
+ 71,000 non taxed
- 9,000 estimated taxes paid


What is a rough estimate of how much money I owe in federal and state (MA) taxes? I'm mostly looking for confirmation that I've just done messed up and will need to pony up this much for taxes, or I'm just an idiot and should hire an account.

personalfinance,Student loans in an environment with rising rates?,"I'm looking at a graduate program that has a total cost of attendance of 75k for the year, and the gap between my savings and the cost is about 25k.

I'm not terribly worried as I plan to do a few little beer money jobs like tutoring that might knock that 25k down a 1k or 2k, but how should one tackle student debt in an environment with rising rates?

I plan on maybe taking a federal loan of 25k or so, and then refinancing after the six month period is up  with nonpayment to refi with sofi.  Or I could refi with sofi after it had entered repayment.

I do intend to try and pay off the loan in quicker than 10 years, but I may just pay the minimum and do more retirement savings in lieu of higher loan repayment.

So in theory if I do this program I should leave it with 75k ish income and 25k in debt, but I do fear the rates rising were I to do a variable rate refinance or whatever.  I have willing cosigners, but I do wonder about the best way to tackle this.  It is very easy to be nonchalant until it ends up really eating into your finances over the next decade.

stocks,Tesla Inc. equity opinions,"What are some price targets and why? 

I think a better buy point would be about $220.  

When considering working capital, enterprise value, current P/E and P/S multiples, 5 year graphical analysis, 200 day moving average, the ever increasing debt burden without the ability to bring in enough net income to pay the interest rates, the recent news that the Model 3 will not only skip a testing stage but will also be released without AWD or a HUD, the Jaguar I-pace and several other high end EV's are quickly coming to market, UAW issues with working conditions and employee pay, and recent estimates that the Model 3 will be more likely a 40k-60k vehicle with options and Musk's continuously divided attention- I can't necessarily find the numbers and (reasonable) growth values to derive a fair market price above $280 until 500,000 units are both being produced and sold on a consistent basis in several countries with stable or positive MS and MX sales growth.  I really feel like current market value of 43+B is far too generous for the company in its current state as it assumes nothing will go wrong between now and 2019 when current goals are expected to be accomplished.  

My biggest concern is that two years ago analysts expected Tesla to be producing yearly EPS greater than $5.00 per share by now and the stock was valued at that forward rate but now that we're here looking at actual EPS in 2016 and 2017 we see that the company is drastically behind where it was anticipated to be and yet the price is still equivalent to two years ago when those high expectations were priced in.  

Even the added revenues in the hundred-millions from Tesla powerwall/shingles doesn't provide enough to end growth to manage the growing liabilities the company faces, and will continue to face in the near future as well.  

I like the company's vision and I think it has the ability to grow into the current market cap but I also believe that as of today and this entire year the stock is worth $220 or somewhere in the low $200s near this target.

I'm 28 and not sure what to do. 

My accountant gave me a book and said to call him in a few months or if I had any questions. I don't think he is out to swindle me in any way.

I do have a smaller emergency fund in the bank of about 2k which could cover any minor emergencies but without the insurance fund I would be fucked if something really went wrong. I can't take on any more revolving monthly debt so unless I could pay it out of pocket I would be screwed. I've always been ""poor"" and lived paycheck to paycheck.

Quick question, but first here are the facts:

On the other hand i've got an account with around 2.7k debt with 21% APR that DOESN'T report at all.

My question is should i do a balance transfer (promo 5% APR for the first year) to my now 6k limit CC or keep them separate so that my credit score stays up (740ish)?

- I have 3 months emergency savings.
- I have about 100-300 to contribute to this debt a month depending on other expenses.
- The only other debt i have is student loans.

personalfinance,When to start investing for retirement?,"This is more of a general planning question than specific to my scenario. The general agreed upon advice here is to pay down any debt over 4% interest, as the return is guaranteed 4% on your money, while investments can vary. With the federal government increasing interest rates, soon we will see mortgages interest rate over 4%. 

Does this general rule of thumb apply to mortgages? If you buy a house and you take out a 30 year mortgage that has a, lets say, 4.5% interest rate. Is it then advisable to just never invest into retirement while you pay down your mortgage? 

Or is it a sort of balance where you max out IRA/401k's and pay down extra into your mortgage so you're killing two birds with one stone? 

It just seems like if you buy a house, with a reasonable income, you're going to be in debt for a large portion of your life, with interest rates over 4%. Do you never invest in retirement? Obviously ignoring the fact that paying off your house is an investment in retirement because you lower your COL in retirement because why else pay down your mortgage faster?

This is still a relatively decent school. It ranks average or slightly above average in the nation on many lists. It's the same small size as Transylvania, with just above 1,000 students. However, its ACT score requirements are quite a bit lower than my score and it's just generally outranked by Transylvania. The big catch here is that I would be paying either zero or a very small amount in loans. In fact, the only way I would have to take out loans at all is if tuition went up enough or I wanted to get myself my own apartment and pay for it myself.

Is putting myself in debt worth going to the better school? My loans would be slightly below the national average but not by much. Another thing to keep in mind is that Transylvania has a guaranteed 4-year graduation rate, higher freshman retention, and a better chance of employment and higher salaries.",finance
Bitcoin,At what point can a soft-fork be accepted over Nakamoto consensus?,"It is possible to create a checkpoint that says [block #459510](https://blockchain.info/block/000000000000000000bb067336fcd1bb7fb495889974d867b5e6be08be1edb1d) *must* have the hash ""...edb1d"".

This would be a straightforward soft-fork.  Just like all other BIP34 soft-forks, we can get 95% of the miners to agree to orphan blocks that violate this rule.

In theory, we could do this for *all* blocks (or at least for many of them), but this is clearly a violation of strict Nakamoto consensus.  The probability of a double spend asymptotically approaches 0, but a full node that implements a soft-fork treats it to be exactly 0.  After some socially acceptable threshold, most people will consider this risk just a rounding error, which is why soft-forks work.

So what exactly is this threshold?  At what point after a soft-fork is activated would it be deemed safe to run a full node?  After 6 confirmations?  100?  144?  As a user risks more funds, they typically increase this number.

I'm not actually asking this question to start an argument against soft-forks.  We all must rely on a certain number of confirmations being irreversible in order for the bitcoin economy to even function.  I ask because I was thinking of how to implement a *trustless and decentralized* (not federated) sidechain, but it would depend on periodic soft-forks.  The more frequent they are, the better, but that has the downside of being an annoyance for full nodes to constantly update.

technology,"I am doing research on the bill ""allowing your ISP to sell your information."" Here is what I've found so far.","Posting this in this sub because it is where I have seen the most information regarding this topic. 

I have been hearing a lot about this ""new bill"" and was just as up in arms about it as the next guy on here. However, something seemed off about the news. It didn't make sense to me that anybody would vote for a bill that did such a thing so I decided to find information on it myself. 

**DISCLAIMER: I am NOT an expert on this topic and there may be some oversight in my findings. I'm still doing my research.** I simply thought it was important to share this information sooner rather than later because it sheds valuable light on this sensitive and heated topic at hand and might help to deter the spread of potentially false information. My goal is to inform people who care about technology and the Internet with a new perspective about S.J.Res.34.

After some research I found out that the house and the senate voted on what is called [S.J.Res.34](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/34?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22sjres34%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1). It is a resolution to nullify the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to ""Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services"", which you can read in it's entirety [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/02/2016-28006/protecting-the-privacy-of-customers-of-broadband-and-other-telecommunications-services). As you might expect, government bills aren't exactly the easiest read. Nevertheless, I've grabbed this excerpt directly out of the bill itself for those who are too busy to open a new tab and read for a few minutes:

&gt;The rules require carriers to provide privacy notices that clearly and accurately inform customers; obtain opt-in or opt-out customer approval to use and share sensitive or non-sensitive customer proprietary information, respectively; take reasonable measures to secure customer proprietary information; provide notification to customers, the Commission, and law enforcement in the event of data breaches that could result in harm; not condition provision of service on the surrender of privacy rights; and provide heightened notice and obtain affirmative consent when offering financial incentives in exchange for the right to use a customer's confidential information

In other words, your ISP has to print out a bunch of stuff and go to extra lengths to make sure you know what's going on with your private data and that you have a say in it. Okay, cool. Furthermore, it seems to make some rules in the [Communications Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Act_of_1934) now apply to your ISP. Sweet.

Interestingly enough, it turns out that this rule submitted by the FCC was only published on December 2, 2016 and **has only been active since January 3, 2017.** This means that **whatever the situation was around Christmas time last year is exactly the same as how things will be when S.J.Res.34 is signed by Trump**. In other words, the republicans aren't trying to sell your information to your ISP. They're undoing something that was put into place at the very end of the Obama administration. 

However, removing this bill does not mean that the rules and laws addressed within it go away, per se. From what I have gathered it simply means that, for the most part, your ISP is no longer required to make all of this information as explicitly known to you.

Now I'm not saying that everything is all fine and dandy. I'm just saying that this isn't any new legislation being implemented. In fact, its the opposite of that. So far, this seems like a good bill to me and I don't know why the republicans would nullify it. Either way that's not the point. 

The point is that, based on my findings, things are not so doom and gloom and there is no need to freak out so drastically. This should be used as a learning opportunity to be more skeptical about what you read on the Internet and to be more conscious about the ramifications of your Internet usage. Also write to your government representatives, dammit.

**TL;DR: I did research on the bill the republicans passed that supposedly allowed your ISP to sell your information. My results thus far lead me to believe things have been somewhat over-exaggerated and over-hyped. Don't take [opinion articles](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/opinion/how-the-republicans-sold-your-privacy-to-internet-providers.html) as news.**",technology
personalfinance,Help with choosing mortgage Refi term/payment vs. monthly $$ available for retirement savings,"I honestly don’t know how to make this post shorter and hoping that I can get some feedback from you all

&amp;nbsp;

**Summary:**

&amp;nbsp;
I'm planning on refinancing our home soon in order to drop the PMI. I was looking into going for a 15yr rate which would drop 10yrs off the mortgage and save ~100k in interest without affecting the payment too much.

&amp;nbsp;

But I'm also behind in retirement savings and getting nervous that we’re not going to have enough to retire on.

&amp;nbsp;

**So the ask is… when I refinance our home, do I go for a 30yr, 20yr or 15yr mortgage??? **

&amp;nbsp;


I currently have 25yrs left on the mortgage @ 4.25%. Total payment is $2100/mo with PMI, taxes, insurance.    
So do I want a lower mortgage payment from the 30yr loan so we are able start putting more towards retirement now (currently contributing $0) but then not be able to pay the home off until after retirement?    
Or go for the shorter mortgage term, 15yrs, to free up money down the road and have the home paid for before retirement?

&amp;nbsp;


We’re a family of 6 with 4 very young children, ages 8mo – 5yrs old. I’m 44, wife is 30. My retirement savings is only 150k (+ paying back 23k 401k loan) in a 401k, 5k in Roth.    
My wife has no retirement savings started, no option through her job.    
We’ve made bad financial choices, budgeted poorly (now using YNAB) and the expenses of 4 children that includes twins had us living paycheck to paycheck despite a ~7,200 a month combined take home pay.

&amp;nbsp;
 

Currently my retirement contribution is currently $0 (no employer match but employer contributes yearly). My wife has no retirement savings and no plan through work. We just started to build our e-fund, at 5k now. Putting 15% of my paycheck directly into Ally savings acct, $600/mo until that’s built up and then it can go to something else.

&amp;nbsp;


I want to add that some of our money is currently going into some short term expenses, some credit cards and the money going to our e-fund… at some point all these will become available for use to use towards retirement savings. Let’s estimate in 3 months we free up $1100 a month (short term expenses such as lawyer bill), and 1 year from now we free up another $1,000 a month from finishing paying off credit cards (we’ve paid off 22k out of 42k so far) and 2 years from now another $600 a month from e-fund being completed. 

&amp;nbsp;


That’s $2700 a month that could be used to max out my 401k and max out a Roth for my wife and I. Of course that is all depending on if everything goes as planned and life doesn’t always go the way we plan so hoping for the best that we can meet these goals.

&amp;nbsp;


There’s also money going to a 39k student loan ($320 @ 0% interest) and $500 a month pretax going to 23k 401k loan. These payments at some point in the future will be available to budget but I feel that’s a ways out so I’m not including it.

&amp;nbsp;
 

*Combined take home monthly income:    
 $7,200 ($500 for 401k loan and $600 a month for efund not included in this since it’s coming out of paycheck that we don’t ever see)    

*Expenses:    
$7,000 (this included the $1100 short term expense, $1000 CC payments)

&amp;nbsp;

(I can break down the income, debt, expenses more if needed)

&amp;nbsp;


**New Refi mortgage scenarios:**

Before I list these I’m seriously considering trying to waive escrow if I can pay a 1 time fee (.25% = $725) instead of an interest rate increase. I feel we can budget this or pay it with my stock or bonuses that come multiple times per year. It makes me feel like we’d have more money per month to save/invest. So the numbers below are assuming escrow waived. If it’s not ideal to waive escrow then add ~270 to the P&amp;I below ($2400 year for taxes + $850 homeowners ins). Thoughts on waiving escrow?

&amp;nbsp;


These are online rates, not actual quotes or GFE’s from applying. Remember, I’m planning on dropping the PMI will the refi.    
290k left on mortgage    
home value 380k    
Current lender won’t drop PMI unless home appraises for 390k or we pay down ~30k more.

&amp;nbsp;



*30yr at 3.9% APR. P&amp;I $1380. $300 fees. Compared to current mortgage payment ($2100) this is an extra $720/mo. More money to per month to save/invest but home not paid off until I’m 75

&amp;nbsp;



*20yr at 3.75%. P&amp;I $1720. $0 fees. Compared to current mortgage payment ($2100) this is an extra $380/mo. More money to per month to save/invest but home not paid off until I’m 65

&amp;nbsp;


*15yr at 3.154% APR. P&amp;I $2020. $600 fees. Compared to current mortgage payment ($2100) this is an extra $80/mo. Not much change in payment but the home would be paid off by the time I’m 60 and the kids getting close to graduating high school. Possibly sell and downsize at that time.

&amp;nbsp;
 

So do I go for the longer mortgage term in order to free up $$$ now to put towards retirement but extend home being paid off till most likely after retirement age. Or shorter term to have the home paid off quicker, free up money later in life and save on paying more interest on mortgage?

&amp;nbsp;


And don't forget to factor in the money that will be available in the next 3-24 months from paying off debt",finance

personalfinance,[30m] Recently medically retired from the military. Considering using my GI Bill to go to school and take out college loans to help with living expenses. Is this a good idea?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I recently got out of the military (November) and I'm now working at a dead-end job as a 911 dispatcher.  I'm considering using my Post 9-11 GI bill to pay for my tuition which also provides me with a monthly living expense of $1266 a month in my area.  At my job I currently make $14.53 an hour with no room for improvement (it's a small area).

So, I was considering either 

a.) trying to work full time and go to school full time

b.) working part-time and going to school full time

c.) quitting and going to school full time

With all of these options, I was considering taking out a federally-subsidized loan and paying off my current credit card debt (around 10k between me and my wife) and using it for living expenses while going to school (since my tuition is covered 100%)

My current income:

Military retirement:  $330 (I am supposed to get $848 but my child support is screwed up and coming out of both checks)

Employment income:  $1900/month (after child support ~$1200 a month...lawyer is currently working to resolve child support issues).


Here are my current monthly expenses:

Rent: $900

Child Support: $525

Car Payment: $462

Car Insurance : $125

Health Insurance: $112

Internet: $100

Cell phones: $145

Credit Cards:  ~$10,000 , one in default

Electric:  $150

Water: $45

Groceries/other expenses:  $300

I'm at my financial end.  Due to me losing my job in the military where I made close to $6000 a month, I've been having a lot of problems with the reduced income and my savings has dwindled down to just 400 dollars.

Any advice would be helpful.

Bitcoin,On fraud proofs and the Bystander Effect,"[Fraud proofs](https://gist.github.com/justusranvier/451616fa4697b5f25f60) are a way of increasing the safety of SPV or ""thin"" clients, by having full nodes publish a proof of invalidity of any blocks they have detected to be invalid, which a thin client would then use to disregard those invalid blocks.  Since thin clients avoid downloading the entire blockchain starting with the genesis block, thin clients are vulnerable to being fed a series of falsified blocks with double-spends or spends of nonexistent coin.

The [Bystander Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) is the observation that the more bystanders there are when a person suffers from some negative but visible calamity (heart attack, [murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese), whatever), the less help the victim gets.  The basic analogy to a thin client under attack (and being helped out by a full node by providing a fraud proof) should be obvious.

In short, if there are tons of full nodes, why should any full node bother to additionally compute and transmit a fraud proof? (yes, the cost is low, but it's still non-zero)

Now we can choose to code what a full node would do, which is not the case in the human beings who implement the Bystander Effect.  Now suppose we release a full node client that always transmits fraud proofs.  A rational actor who intends to participate in bitcoin for a short time only may decide that the fraud proof code is additional work and bandwidth that may be more usefully utilized by other tasks (performing transactions, computing hashes, facilitating business need X, whatever).  This rational actor may then decide to remove the fraud proof code and recompile, thereby implementing the Bystander Effect, reasoning that other full nodes exist to perform the fraud proof anyways.

Now the traditional answer is that, at least for long-term rational actors, investing in fraud proof is good since it increases the security of thin clients (which a long-term rational actor might want to usefully transact with), while being very low cost (relative to mining or even transacting).  But the same logic (other long-term rational actors will publish a fraud proof anyway when they detect the invalid block, I myself don't have to do anything, everyone else secures the network for me) applies.  A long-term rational actor might decide that it can get a benefit (which may be important for business concern X) to remove the fraud proof code from its full node code.

Granted, in Real Life(TM) people are altruistic (and lazy, such that removing the fraud proof code is strictly less privileged than keeping the fraud proof code), so perhaps it won't be so bad?

Fraud proofs seem to point towards centralization.  Some entity makes a public commitment that they will provide fraud proofs.  Everyone else comes to depend on that entity always providing fraud proofs.  In a highly competitive market they optimize their clients and remove the fraud proof code (which the aforementioned entity will keep anyway, so why bother keeping the fraud proof code).  The aforementioned entity becomes a *de facto* central point source for fraud proofs, and might then be bribed to not publish some fraud proofs.",cryptocurrency

I was a beneficiary of a relative's estate hence the K-1 (which I *just* received today after being told to wait to file until I received it. I know we're cutting it close.)

""Managing a windfall"" from the sidebar says to contact a CPA to determine how to potentially minimize my tax liability. I'm wondering if that could be expensive overkill in my case. My prior layman google research explained that I'm well under the amount federal tax kicks in for inheritance so I shouldn't expect to owe the feds, but I have no idea if/how much I might owe the state (Colorado) or whether my understanding of the federal tax code is even accurate.

Bitcoin,"RFC 1087 ""Ethics and the Internet"" (1989)","Bitcoin may be understood as an Internet protocol. If so, it may be of interest to look at the procedure that was followed for adopting other Internet protocols as a model for responsible governance.

Doing this, I found [RFC 1087](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1087), titled ""Ethics and the Internet"" and published in 1989.

That RFC stated that several activities are unacceptable. One of them was any activity that ""disrupts the intended use of the Internet"".

It closes with this paragraph:

&gt;The IAB plans to take whatever actions it can, in concert with Federal agencies and other interested parties, to identify and to set up technical and procedural mechanisms to make the Internet more resistant to disruption.  Such security, however, may be extremely expensive and may be counterproductive if it inhibits the free flow of information which makes the Internet so valuable. In the final analysis, the health and well-being of the Internet **is the  responsibility of its users who must, uniformly, guard against abuses which disrupt the system and threaten its long-term viability.** (emphasis added)

In the same way, it is the responsibility of the users to guard against threats of disruption against the Bitcoin network.

There may be different opinions on what exactly that means for the present governance conflict. But everyone should probably agree that any activity intentionally disrupting the Bitcoin network is unethical and unacceptable.

The procedure for adopting Internet standards basically requires showing [two things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard#Internet_Standards). 

&gt;An Internet Standard is characterized by a high degree of technical maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet community. 

Applying these requirements to new proposed Bitcoin rules would mean: Your proposed rule would need to be ""technically mature"" (disqualifying the ""Bitcoin Unlimited"" proposal) and ""generally supported"" (disqualifying it again).

In contrast, you can't get an Internet protocol approved by hash power majority independent of the above requirements. I think that's a good thing for Internet governance. It should be the same for Bitcoin governance.",cryptocurrency

**********  
#Income:  
I am an independent contractor, and my income fluctuates a bit month to month. I normally have a cushion of saved money to float by on for the slower months, but a string of bad luck and bad incident after bad incident led me to be living, essentially, paycheck to paycheck with a growing debt behind me.  
  
On average (based on the last 2.5 years of income, not counting months I *couldn't* work) I pull in $3500-3600. Good months, I pull around $6000, slow months around $2000. These last three months have been slow, however my next two are already almost completely booked and looking much better. However, I fear it is too little, too late.  
  
Going by my average income, say $3500, and my expenses being around $2700 (including CC minimums, and other debt payments) I'm left with around $200/week to live. This doesn't account for the fact that I need to come up with a security deposit in a month's time and have been depleted to $0 in savings.   
  
**********  
I've called my credit cards, and CC#2 gave me an increase of $1000 (reflected in the numbers above)- I had hoped transferring a couple of balances around would save me some interest, and keep me from being spread so thin on the quantity of minimum payments I must make each month. But it doesn't appear I will have enough to accomplish this.  I also negotiated the tax auto-debit down from $200/month to the $50/month listed above.
  
Other accounts to toy around with the idea for Balance Transfers are:  
**CC#5:**  
Balance: $0  
Limit: $6000  
Interest rate: 23.24% (I don't know balance transfer rate)  
  
**CC#6:**  
Balance: $0  
Limit: $2000  
Interest Rate: 22.5% (i don't know balance transfer rate)  
  
**********  
But, the real question is this:  
  
Knowing all these details about my finances, I applied for, and was offered the following loans from lending Club:  
* $14,275 @18.99% (23.54%APR): 36 Payments @ $523.20 = $18,835.2  
* $17,125 @18.99% (23.54%APR): 36 Payments @ $627.65 = $22595.4  
  
The first loan, for 14k, will hit every one of my debts, excepting a negligible amount.  
The second loan, for 17k, will hit every one of my debts in full, and provide me with cash to needed for my move.  
  
I understand fully that I will be paying quite a bit more over time with these options, I'm just wondering if this is a necessary evil at this point to prevent any further damage to what was once a great, and is still, remarkably, somehow still a fairly healthy credit score.  Also, while the Lending Club loan requires me to pay more over time, it serves a few positives in having fewer total payments to make every month (the many minimums and auto debits I must meet are killing me) and it addresses the Tax payment in full, as well as the medical debt, which I currently have no means of re-starting to pay back. 

Is there some option to bounce things around (responsibly, not just moving debt around for the sake of it) so that I can reasonably pay this all off and afford to, I don't know, eat?

personalfinance,[housing] renting out vs. selling,"I bought a condo in Chicago four years ago and I am now looking to move out for more space (I got married and we want to start a family). I am wondering if I should sell it or rent it out. Wanted to get some advice.

A bit of background - It's a condo in fairly large association, so not much work to do to maintain it.

It's probably worth about 400K now. I have 220K left on mortgage.
Not sure how much I can rent it for, perhaps 2600/month. Expenses are condo fees 340, property taxes 440, and maintenance/special assessments potentially.

I calculate a rental yield (rents minus all expenses save mortgage and interest, over property value), assuming some vacancy and some expenses, of about 3.5%. The mortgage rate is 2.8%, so the return on equity is over 4%.

Positives I see
1) It's a highly desirable neighborhood, easy to rent to young professionals, probably decent tenants. Fairly easy to sell to when needed.
2) It has a decent return and diversifies a little my portfolio, avoids putting all my money in the stock market.
3) Allows to keep my very low interest rate mortgage

Negatives
1) The property has negative cash flow if you include the mortgage payment - so I will pay 8K/year or so over the next few years to keep the place, rent it out, and pay back the mortgage (building equity of course to the tune of 18K/year or so). It's a 15 year mortgage so steep repayments.

2) I will move to another neighborhood in Chicago and buy another apartment, so I will have a lot of risk exposure to the city.

3) I am a busy professional, don't want to deal too much with tenants- could use property management of course but seems a little unnecessary for such a simple property.

4) Tax consequences - capital gains when I sell.

5) Timing - now seems a good time for selling, neighborhood is fairly hot.",finance

 * it solves the transaction malleability issue only for off-chain transactions.
* RSK claims that their software allows Bitcoin to handle smart-contracts. But
 * the 2-way peg between BTC and RSK requires trusting a ‘federation’ with multisig keys, which centralizes Bitcoin even more;

personalfinance,"First decent job: How to split income between saving for house, building retirement accounts, and paying off debts","Hi personalfinance. I'm using a throwaway account so my financial information is not associated with my main account.

I'm 35 years old and living in the US. After years of college, graduate school, and post-graduate training I finally landed my first well-paying job. Starting in May my salary will be 125k. This more than doubles my previous income and will hopefully allow us to make some headway on our debts. My wife makes about 30k so our total combined income will be about 155k. We'd like to rent (&lt;$2000/mo.) for at least another year so that we could focus on eliminating debt first. After that we'd like to buy a house but not until we can make a 20% down payment (at least). We don't have any car payments but even with a 50% employer subsidy our family health insurance plan will still cost us about $11000/year. The job provides a 401(k) but does not match contributions. Instead they told me they typically pay out a monthly bonus that averages out to around 10% of my monthly pay. 

We currently have about 42k in debut, about 39k of which is in the form of student loans. The other 3k is from a furniture purchase that's being financed at 0% APR (the student loan interest rates range from 2.4% to about 6%).  We currently have about 18k in savings but are holding on to that for now to cover moving expenses, security deposits, etc. I have a 403(b) with my present employer but it only has about $1200 in it, and my wife has a 401(k) with about $1400 in it. I estimate that after all our expenses, taxes, etc. we should be able to net about 4k - 5k per month. We'd probably need about 90k to put 20% down on the size house we want plus cover closing costs.

One of my main concerns is that we don't have hardly any money saved for retirement. I'm not sure if it's a good strategy to use the company 401(k) if they don't provide any matching. Would an IRA or Roth IRA be a good alternative or addition?

Would it be better to pay off the student loan debt before diverting money into a 401(k) or other retirement accounts, or is it smarter to start putting money in right away so that it builds interest? 

And what about saving for a house? Right now the money is just going into our savings account, but would it make more sense to put into something like a CD until we're ready to use it?",finance

My girlfriend applied to a job at a place called HCI group. Within one conversation online they hired her, and said they will send her a check for $4,000 to buy necessary equipment like software. 

This morning, she received an overnight check from Patelco Credit Union for $4,415.

My dad used to tell me ""If it seems too good to be true, it is"". And this seems like one of those things. Does anyone have any info on HCI Group, Patelco Credit Union, company scams where they send you a cashiers and rush you? 

**Edit** Email she just received:

You're to deposit the check to your account and scan and email the atm deposit slip to me on ( redacted ) once done for confirmation, no need to send the slip to any other email address or email any worker that you got the package even if a note came with the check, have already contacted them they just want to make sure you get it, so you email the slip to my email address only, thanks
NOTE: Make sure it's an atm deposit because atm is 24 hours service and funds availability, you need to order the equipment tomorrow once the full funds are available so that you can receive the Equipment by next tomorrow and get started.

you only need to take your atm card with the check to your bank's atm machine then deposit it into your bank account okay ? you will see the option when you get to the atm

**Edit 2** Just talked to Patelco. A check for $4,415 was never issued from their company. Sending Patelco a picture of the check since they said its a fraud, and then shredding that son of a b. I've read all your comments by the way! We're just figuring out how to respond to a very needy spammer.

**Edit 3** Scammers are angry at our non-responsiveness. They threatened us by saying ""you better cash in that check or their agents will find you"". I promptly told them to fuck off and blocked them. Patelco was very happy we called them, since now they know their company is being used for scams.

**Edit 4** Just wanted to do another quick edit. My girlfriend received this job offer from her schools job network. She goes to a small, expensive private college and she got hit with this fraud through a secure network that needs to be approved by the school first. Always be on the lookout for scam. 

**Edit 5** We did NOT shred the check. We decided against it and are going to report it. 

**Edit 6** Blowing up much further than I expected this too. /u/iac74205 said I could report it to the postal inspectors if it came by USPS. It came by FedEx, is there a postal inspector for that?

**Edit 7** We've contacted the school once to report the scam! My girlfriend is taking a shower and right afterwards shes A: Reporting it to the FBI and B: demanding that the school sends out an email blast to all of the students going there. 

**Edit 8** I said it in a comment below, but I just wanted to thank all of you for all of your advice. I've read every comment and we have a ton on our plate to take care of. The users of /r/personalfinance rock!

**Edit 9** Reported it to the school, this was their message: 

Hi Girlfriend,

Thank you for sending over this information.  We have flagged this employer in Handshake as fraudulent and have removed them as an approved employer as well.  I know that REDACTED, our Office Manager, has already created a warning in the system for them, and I will do the same with the information you have sent to me.  I will also discuss with our Directors about any further steps that need to be taken.

Thank you so much for reporting this!  Please let me know if you have any other concerns.

**Edit 10** Using edits to answer FAQ's now. She did not give any information besides what would be on a resume. Work history, name, etc. She did NOT give bank account details or her SS number.

**Edit 11** Just in case someone wanted to see what the fake check and the letter she was send looks like, [here you go](http://imgur.com/a/lfw0M)

**Edit 12** I just wanted to confirm this, both Patelco and HCI are legitimet companies. We called Patelco and they have their fraud working on it. We didn't call HCI but I've had enough messages saying they've worked from HCI I believe its legit. I think this guy was just using the names to sound legit.

**Gilded edit 14** I was just given gold. As much as I appreciate someone thinking a thread for asking advice is good enough to pay real money too, its unneccessary! If you are really feeling charitable, consider giving to a charity. Personally, I suggest [Doctors Without Borders](https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/onetime.cfm?source=ADD1600U0V53&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;amp;utm_expid=7773760-9.T4pemk1yTFeOymrJr_YtIQ.0&amp;amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) or [PACER](https://pacer.ejoinme.org/MyPages/DonateToTheNationalBullyingPreventionCenter/tabid/229451/Default.aspx) .

- It has been sitting idle collecting about a 1.5% interest rate in a Money market account 
- She has no use for the funds, I would just like it to grow more than it has

My options (from my understanding) 

&amp;nbsp;

- I take a withdrawl of the entire amount (they hold 25% for tax purposes I believe) 
- I convert it into a 401K, no tax liability but the money is now locked in until she retires. OR shes pays tax plus 10% early penalty 
- I convert it into a Roth. I pay taxes on it now, but the money grows tax free
- I can take a loan / temporary withdrawl (I have to see what the interest rate is)

&amp;nbsp;


Question 

&amp;nbsp;

- Are there any alternatives to the options above? 
- Can I roll it over into purchasing a business? I believe certain 401K allow this 
- Is there any way to defer the tax withholding and pay at the end of the year?

btc,Who is Roger K. Ver?,"Roger Ver is a liar. He has been caught so many times, it's almost a joke. And I say ""almost"" because so much is at stake. Time stamps, alone, have exposed Roger knowingly and maliciously lying to a very large public. Why Bitcoin Unlimited supporters continue to defend him is beyond my ability to comprehend. Because once I see a person display that much clear, demonstrable, undeniable immorality, I can never support him again.

That's who Roger Ver is. Say what you like, but time stamps don't lie; so far, I haven't seen a single Bitcoin Unlimited adherent be so foolish as to suggest Reddit and Twitter time stamps have been manipulated. So I feel fortunate that their foolish claims haven't yet taken them that far down the black hole of preposterous conspiracy theories.

Roger has almost no technological acumen, yet he regularly ""explains"" to some of the most talented developers in the world ""how Bitcoin works."" Roger claims to be an ""economist,"" but by what standard? He read Mises? Hayek? Rothbard? Maybe? But even as a self-proclaimed ""voluntaryist,"" his attachment to the Bitcoin Unlimited Articles of Federation align his political and economic views much closer to Karl Marx than to the Austrian School. Bitcoin Unlimited is much more a vehicle for the ""downtrodden proletariat"" than it is a vehicle for free market economics.

Roger is a fraud, a phony, and a charlatan who happened to be in the right place, at the right time. Roger has no special talents, no special skills, and no insight that provides him with the ammunition he requires to maintain the ludicrous claims he makes against anyone who opposes him. As far as I can tell, his only (arguably) redeeming qualities are that he has money and that he's skinny. Go skinny!

Roger continuously reminds all of us that ""he was here first."" Roger was not ""here first,"" and even if he were, that in no way makes him an authority or somehow better prepared than other, more skilled experts at determining Bitcoin's future. It certainly doesn't absolve him of the responsibility (and consequences) he will face by mounting this malicious 51% attack against Bitcoin. 

Roger is exhibiting all the traits of an egomaniacal, power-hungry sociopath. It never ceases to amaze me how people like this manage to build cults around them, yet after seeing centuries of star-struck followers cling to boisterous and charismatic leaders, I can't say I'm surprised to watch it happening in the Bitcoin Unlimited community. Unfortunately, these cult-stars almost always lead their flocks to destruction. Those of us who are immune to Roger's thinly-veiled propagandist repetition desperately hope Bitcoin Unlimited proponents will come to their senses before it's too late.",cryptocurrency

Emergency Fund $10,000 + ~115 hours of PTO(~$5000)
 
~$5000 ahead of my current payments  

Contributing to 401k at 12%


I think I have a pretty good handle on things regarding financials, but after living expenses are paid at the end of the month, things are pretty tight. Interested in switching to PAYE repayment option in order to free some capital for: 

1) Increasing 401k contributions  

2) Saving for downpayment on House (~5 years maybe)

3) Enjoyment of my remaining 20's 


I'm very frugal and don't come from wealth so I am not really persuaded by luxury accommodations. Just looking on some input on the Long term benefits of PAYE over the standard 10yr repayment.  

Using the StudentLoanHero Calculator, Advantages of PAYE include:  

1) Freeing up ~$730 dollars/month

2) Forgiving $130,000 of Debt  

Disadvantages:

1) Paying additional taxes on $130,000 on top normal income during final year of repayment (year 20?)

2) Kinda immoral to have the tax payer foot the bill on the forgiven amount


Do you all think It would be advantageous to switch to PAYE if I am qualified? or should I stick with the standard 10yr option, reduce 401k contributions (until matched), and get it payed early?

personalfinance,BEST USE? Investment vs Debt Relief and the Market,"Let’s take a hypothetical (my life) where you are 28 and have:



Life Goals

Be debt free (not an immediate need)

Own property (more than one, for rental income use, possibly ties into two items below)

Start a business (somewhat ties into the below goal)

Quit steady job and freelance/travel for a few years before settling down in a job/place



Environment (assumptions)

General 1%-2% inflation (any ROI less than this is wasted, any interest rate around this is good)

Market generally provides 4% avg (min) return over longer period

Market seems high, investing now seems like buying at the peak before the dip

Housing market seems inflated, rents also feel high

Savings/CD’s/Certificates/Bonds return horrible rates currently

Monthly funding of the 401k pre-tax, hitting the $18,500/yr max as possible

Good paying job ($100k+) but somewhat unstable, assume worst case yearly wage $50k in future



Good Monies (dolla dolla bill)

$20k in liquid savings - 0-1% ROI

$10k in a robo advisor (Wealthfront/Betterment) - 9% current ROI

$10k in specific stocks (company stock, individual stock purchases, etc) - 15% current ROI

$30k in retirement (401k/Roth/etc) - 5-6% current ROI




Not-So-Good Monies (debt)

$12k student loan refi - 3.8% variable, $250/mo payment

$30k student loan - 0% interest (subsidized), 2% school fees (in school status per community college, costs $600/yr, so 2% per year is cost to maintain 0% interest), $0/mo payment

$2k auto loan - 2% fixed $160/mo payment



Options

Stay the course! (keep dumping into retirement, pay off loans slowly as rates aren’t killer)

Pay off debts! (either pay off some of the higher interest debts or wipe out all debts with sitting money)

Invest more! (take some combination of liquid assets, specific stocks, and robo advisor money and throw into (a) a robo advisor (b) a Vanguard fund (c) property (d) something else money-wise?)

I have a question. So a year ago due to a bunch of issues that went on we racked up $5,000 on a credit card with Capital One and it has an absolute horrible interest rate.

retirement,Recommendations for holdings in Roth,"Hello! I'm 30 years old, and have been working for the same company as an IT Engineer for 10 years. I bought my first house about 5 years ago. I also started my 401k through American Funds at the same time, and have always contributed to get my company max, 3% + 3%. A few years ago I realized this wouldn't be enough to retire on, so I started a Roth through Scottrade and began maxing it, having contributed the full $5500 for 2015 and 2016, and plan on maxing 2017 before the end of the year.

My company 401k is an IRA where I can pick Mutual Funds, but don't have a lot of control beyond that. I'm fairly happy with how it has been progressing. I currently have a three-way split between AMCPX, ABALX and ANEFX. AMCAP (AMCPX) has been the best performer as expected for a US centric fund, but the others have done reasonably well. I converted the C shares to A shares as soon as I was allowed to save nearly 50% on yearly expenses. They have a load fee, but it's not terrible (1.5% currently) and allow for fractional shares. Overall I'm satisfied with this account's performance and will continue with the company match max.

However, I'm not sure what to do with my Roth IRA at this point. I've been doing dividend reinvestment plays through Scottrade's FRIP system since it's commission free. I held UL for around 6 months until this recent pop (The Kraft offer) and sold out for a nice profit, as I see it as overvalued now. I'm holding OHI, LTC and BMY and reinvesting to keep the three balanced. REITS are a little risky in a rising interest rate environment, I know, so I'm now holding about 60% cash.

So my question is this; How should I arrange my Roth at this point? I'm ahead on my current holdings but I'm not against closing them out and investing in something safer for the long term, but should I? What should I invest in at this point? I don't like the idea of trading in a retirement account and won't jeopardize my retirement for a quick buck, so I'd prefer a buy and hold/reinvest strategy.

Should I be keeping to ETFs or Mutual Funds, and which ones? I'm currently watching VTI, VYM, DVY, NOBL, VIG, and a few others, and I'm open to anything. The market is very frothy so I'm hesitant to go all in on a S&amp;P tracking fund.

""

Below is the full text. 



Dear (BLANKED)

Thank you for contacting me regarding S.J. Res. 34, a congressional resolution of disapproval of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) privacy order for telecommunication services. I appreciate your thoughts on this issue and welcome the opportunity to respond.

On March 7, 2017, Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) introduced S.J. Res. 34 to repeal the broadband regulations issued by the FCC in October 2016. This order was implemented to impose restrictions on Internet service providers who, as a result of the 2015 Open Internet Order, were reclassified as a utility service. In approving the 2015 Open Internet Order, the FCC granted itself the authority to impose new rules to regulate the Internet under Title II of the Communications Act.

Prior to the 2015 Open Internet Order, Internet service providers (ISPs) were regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) along with edge providers and the rest of the Internet ecosystem. Once the ISPs were reclassified under the 2015 Open Internet Order, they were placed under the jurisdiction of the FCC. During the open comment period on these rules, the FTC, along with many comments from the industry, requested that the FCC mirror the framework of the rules used by the FTC to govern the rest of the Internet ecosystem. The final version of the FCC’s rules were much more burdensome and imposed prescriptive data restrictions on ISPs.

I believe in protecting Americans’ fundamental right to privacy. For example, in 2015, I voted in favor of the USA Freedom Act, which replaced the outdated method of bulk data collection with a more targeted approach that enhances our national security and maintains the privacy of American citizens. I believe that piece of legislation protected Americans within the parameter of the law while safeguarding their privacy. Additionally, I opposed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, which focused on facilitating cyber threat information sharing among private entities and encouraged sharing of information with the government, because I did not believe it had sufficient privacy protections in place, and had the potential to violate the civil liberties and personal privacy rights of Americans.

S.J.Res. 34 does not change the privacy protections that Americans currently possess. This resolution prevents the onerous regulations promulgated by the FCC from going into effect. Thus, this resolution allows the FCC the opportunity to change privacy rules to mirror those that govern the rest of the Internet community so long as they are not substantially similar to the current rules. This is important to allow innovation, competition, and economic growth to continue.

Privacy is a fundamental right of all Americans, and I evaluate every piece of legislation to ensure that Americans’ privacy is not infringed upon. S.J.Res. 34 does not impact the current privacy protections that Americans enjoy, but rather prevents burdensome federal regulations from taking effect that I believe undermine economic growth and job opportunities for Alaskans and Americans. This is why on March 23, 2017, I voted in favor of S.J.Res. 34, which passed the Senate by a vote of 50-48. S.J.Res. 34 has been sent to the House of Representatives, where it awaits consideration.

Thank you again for reaching out to me. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me or my staff. My office can be reached at 202-224-3004, or online at www.sullivan.senate.gov.

financialindependence,Build your own path to success,"Some of the greatest advice I ever received as a young adult was as follows:  
&gt; Whenever you decide to not do something, instead of saying, ""I don't have time to..."" say, ""I am not making it a priority to...""  

So something like ""I don't have time to cook dinner"" becomes ""I am not making it a priority to cook dinner.""  

The main purpose of this serves to show you what you value in terms of importance in your life, but I also find it is a helpful reminder that you are in control of your life. If you woke up and wanted to go to the Grand Canyon tomorrow, you could do so. There are a lot of priorities/excuses you could use to not do it (I have kids, I have to go to work, etc) but none of those can actually stop you from waking up and making your way towards the Grand Canyon. Maybe you have enough money and you can fly, maybe you can only drive, maybe you have to walk or hitchhike. Obviously there are some restrictions like being in prison or not having a passport or whatever, but you get the idea. You have the power to control your life. You choose to go to your job, you choose to eat what you eat, you choose to save your money. I believe a majority of the people in /r/fi grasp this concept as the whole purpose of financial independence is taking control of our finances to push up retirement/freedom by multiple years or even decades. That being said, lately I have noticed a lot of animosity towards the success of others backed up by poor excuses that I usually only see from /r/pf members or in the yahoo finance comment sections.  

* *He only is successful because his parents let him live at home for 2 years until he found a job*  

* *If I could have had scholarships and a part-time job I could have done that too*  

* *Not everyone can just magically start a side-hustle making 100K/yr*  

* *Where does the 50K he starts with come from? I'm betting his parents gave it to him. Another typical spoon-fed 2X year old who doesn't understand real life*  

The list goes on and frankly it's a little disappointing to see in this sub because I think we're better than that. The entire point of /r/fi is recognizing that we CAN make a difference in our lives. We study IRAs, 401Ks, backdoor loopholes, tax advantaged accounts, investment strategies, etc so that we can beat the system. We work harder than our coworkers studying these things and I bet if any of them came to you and called you lucky to have money saved you would be offended because you simply took advantage of your situation and you made sacrifices along the way that they never will know about. You built your own path to financial success while they spent all their money on a new Audi S8 and a huge house they can barely afford.  

At the age of 12 years old I found a business game online where the winners at the end of each week could win cash prizes. I had always loved the idea of making money so I sat down and studied the game and worked harder than anyone else in the game and after a couple of years I made a couple of grand that I used to buy myself an XBOX 360 and some other fun toys.  

When I was 15 I was playing a Facebook game called ""Warbook"" and was able to work my way into the top 100 players or so where my kingdom was making exponentially more gold than a majority of players. I recognized the opportunity and sent an email off the the game maker to see if he would allow me to sell gold. He didn't care and I made over 2 grand in 2 weeks before everyone else in the game caught on and flooded the market to where I just didn't care to proceed.  

As a junior in high school I Googled ""Top 10 paying jobs"" and chose to study Computer science out of that.  

After college I was working my IT job and decided I wanted to earn more so I looked into potential side hustle opportunities. I researched/attempted flipping items on Ebay, re-selling wholesale/repackaged items on Amazon, building mobile apps, website creation jobs, etc. Eventually after failing to get multiple side hustles off the ground (a lot of times due to lack of interest after much research or effort), I found something I liked in streaming video games on Twitch. I found enjoyment and saw potential and so I sat down and began working hard on building an environment/layout/stream that viewers would enjoy. It took a little bit to really get off the ground but I've been able to find success and it's a profitable side-hustle for me now.  

As some of you may know from my [Build the life you want, then save for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/58j8pc/build_the_life_you_want_then_save_for_it/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=financialindependence) post, I made many sacrifices along the way to make my Twitch stream successful and those drove me to learn about creating a successful life outside of financial success too.

Regardless, now that I have found some Twitch success do you know what I hear every day from other people trying to make streaming work?

* *You just got lucky to get into streaming 2 years ago. Nobody unknown can make it big anymore*  

* *I just don't have time to stream like you do*  

* *You probably just knew some big streamers and got their viewers to come to your channel. I wish I had connections*  

The list goes on. And yet every day I see new streamers starting up who work hard and grow their streams into something bigger. Just like every day I look around this sub and see people posting who have taken control of their lives and the opportunities they were presented and made the most of them. Some of them were able to figure it out easier than others, some of them started with a boost, some of them failed less than others, but none of them quit because they saw someone else succeed. None of them said, ""He was just lucky, I could never be that successful."" Instead of comparing paths they looked at their own situation and figured out what they could do.  

It's like looking at Madonna and being upset that she is successful because she has an amazing voice. ""Well if I was born with that voice I'd be successful. She doesn't even know how lucky she got."" Her path to success is not the only path and it's not your path either. Do you think Bill Gates would have never amounted to anything if his parents didn't send him to private school? Do you think Elon Musk would ever settle for a 9-5 job at an accounting firm?  I like to think not. I imagine they are people who were going to find a path to success no matter what situation they were put in. They didn't let any excuses get in the way and they made their own priorities. Just like the members of /r/fi don't accept the notion that you have to work until you're 65 or can only save 5-10% of your income max.  

Maybe you can't start a consulting gig making 100K/yr. Maybe your parents didn't let you live with them while you were looking for a job. Maybe you don't have the voice of an angel. So what? Try streaming on Twitch. Try reselling items from Goodwill. Try something brand new! Gary Dahl sold pet rocks to become a millionaire in a year. Rather than finding jealousy from this, find motivation. Let's celebrate those around us and create a positive environment where we can support our goals and realities. Life isn't always fair and we don't all start at the same place, but if you are sitting somewhere reading this right now you probably have started ahead of a lot of people in this world and should be grateful for that. Don't throw that away because you're too busy making excuses or worrying about your neighbors. You control your life, you choose your actions every day, and you build your own path to success.",finance
personalfinance,Need help coming up with options to pay off a private student loan that is accruing interest,"Hello /r/personalfinance, there is a TLDR at the bottom since they may get a tad wordy. Also I won't name the financial institutions directly so this post won't get taken down.

My wife wanted to go back to school, and I fully support her. Of course this is going to be a bit expensive, so she will need some student loans. Typically I would go through my current financial institution, but they don't offer student loans. Luckily they have some recommendations on who to go through (they have contracts and get some of the business). My wife has been going to school for 1.5 years now, and has about 30k in loans now (part of it was due to paying out of state tuition for ASU because Starbucks was supposed to pay for it, but her hours got reduced), so we went through them.

The loan has a high interest rate, 10%, but my wife was told we don't have to worry until she graduates. Turns out that really wasn't the case and the loan has been accruing interest even though my wife is in school (a different university now to avoid out of state tuition). Sadly the paper work says interest will be applied right away, but don't have to start making payments until she graduates. I know we weren't told that (wife and I will be reading paper work carefully from now on), but I'm not sure what we can do about that, so lets figure out ways to pay this beast off.

I have enough in my 401K to pay off that high interest loan, but I want that to be a last resort option because I don't know the full consequences of doing this. I also don't have anything to put up as collateral for a 30k loan. Are there any other ways to tackle this debt so I am not getting hit by that ridiculous 10% interest rate while my wife is in school?

Also as a quick note I will be moving my products somewhere else because my current financial institution's recommendation totally reamed my wife and I. Have to make it known I'm serious with my wallet.

TLDR: Wife has a 30k private student loan, but the loan is accruing interest (10%) while she is still a student. What are some options to tackle this debt aside from taking a loan from my 401K? Also what are the consequences of taking a loan out against my 401K if I have to take this route?",finance

&gt; Adam Back &amp; Greg Maxwell are experts in mathematics and engineering, but not in markets and economics. They should not be in charge of ""central planning"" for things like ""max blocksize"". They're desperately attempting to prevent the market from deciding on this. But it *will*, despite their efforts.

**AXA-owned Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell u/nullc doesn't understand how fiat works**

&gt; Gregory Maxwell /u/nullc has evidently never heard of terms like ""the 1%"", ""TPTB"", ""oligarchy"", or ""plutocracy"", revealing a childlike naïveté when he says: ""‘Majority sets the rules regardless of what some minority thinks’ is the governing principle behind the fiats of major democracies.""

**AXA-owned Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell u/nullc is toxic to Bitcoin**

&gt; People are starting to realize how toxic Gregory Maxwell is to Bitcoin, saying there are plenty of other coders who could do crypto and networking, and ""he drives away more talent than he can attract."" Plus, he has a 10-year record of damaging open-source projects, going back to Wikipedia in 2006.

So here we have Greg this week, desperately engaging in his usual little ""semantics"" games - claiming that AXA isn't technically a bank - when the real point is that:

**AXA is clearly one of the most powerful fiat finance firms in the world.**

Maybe when he's talking about the hairball of C++ spaghetti code that him and his fellow devs at Core/Blockstream are slowing turning their version of Bitcoin's codebase into... in _that_ arcane (and increasingly irrelevant :) area maybe he still can dazzle some people with his usual meaningless technically correct but essentially erroneous bullshit. 

But when it comes to finance and economics, Greg is in way over his head - and in those areas, he can't bullshit anyone. In fact, pretty much everything Greg ever says about finance or economics or banks is simply wrong.

He thinks he's proved some point by claiming that AXA isn't technically a bank.

But AXA is far worse than a mere ""bank"" or a mere ""French multinational insurance company"".

**AXA is one of the top-five ""companies that control the world"" - and now (some people think) AXA is in charge of paying for Bitcoin ""development"".**

A recent infographic published in the German Magazine ""Die Zeit"" showed that AXA is indeed the second-most-connected finance company in the world - right at the rotten ""core"" of the ""fantasy fiat"" financial system that runs our world today.

&gt; Who owns the world? (1) Barclays, (2) **AXA**, (3) State Street Bank. (Infographic in German - but you can understand it without knowing much German: ""Wem gehört die Welt?"" = ""Who owns the world?"") AXA is the #2 company with the most economic power/connections in the world. And AXA owns Blockstream.

The link to the PDF at Die Zeit in the above OP is gone now - but there's other copies online:

Plus there's lots of other research and articles at sites like the financial magazine Forbes, or the scientific publishing site plos.org, with articles which say the same thing  - all the tables and graphs show that:

**AXA is consistently among the top five ""companies that control everything""**

**AXA is right at the rotten ""core"" of the world financial system. Their last CEO was even the head of the friggin' Bilderberg Group.**

&gt; Blockstream is now controlled by the Bilderberg Group - seriously! AXA Strategic Ventures, co-lead investor for Blockstream's $55 million financing round, is the investment arm of French insurance giant AXA Group - whose CEO Henri de Castries has been *chairman* of the Bilderberg Group since 2012.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/47zfzt/blockstream_is_now_controlled_by_the_bilderberg/

---

**So, let's get a few things straight here.**

""AXA"" might not be a household name to many people.

And Greg was ""technically right"" when he denied that AXA is a ""bank"" (which is basically the only kind of ""right"" that Greg ever is these days: ""technically"" :-) 

But AXA _is_ one of the most powerful finance companies in the world.

AXA was started as a French insurance company.

And now it's a French _multinational_ insurance company.

But if you study up a bit on AXA, you'll see that they're not just any old ""insurance"" company. 

AXA has their fingers in just about everything around the world - including a certain team of toxic Bitcoin devs who are radically trying to change Bitcoin:

- [Core/Blockstream devs refuse to ever hard fork - instead trying to take away our right to vote, with their sneaky soft forks.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=author%3Aydtm+fork&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) (I'm starting to think that a more descriptive terminology instead of ""hard fork / soft fork"" might be ""overt fork / covert fork"".)

- Now Core/Blockstream are obsessed with shoving [the unwanted, basically useless, very dangerous SegWit spaghetti-code soft fork](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=author%3Aydtm+segwit&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) down everyone's throat - [the most irresponsible and radical change proposed in Bitcoin's history](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5rdl1j/segwit_encumbers_bitcoin_with_irreversible/), which would needlessly introduce a totally novel class of threat vector with its ""anyone-can-spend"" hack (only ""necessary"" if you do SegWit as a _soft_ ie _covert_ fork) - so that Core/Blockstream can permanently cement themselves as the ""incumbent"" and hijack Bitcoin's development.
 
And ever since AXA started throwing tens of millions of dollars in filthy fantasy fiat at a certain toxic dev named Gregory Maxwell, CTO of Blockstream, suddenly he started saying that we can't have nice things like the gradually increasing _blocksizes_ (and gradually increasing Bitcoin _prices_ - which [fortunately tend to increase proportional to the _square_ of the blocksize because of Metcalfe's law](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=author%3Aydtm+price+volume&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) :-) which were some of the main reasons most of us invested in Bitcoin in the first place.

**My, my, my - how some people have changed!**

&gt; Greg Maxwell used to have intelligent, nuanced opinions about ""max blocksize"", until he started getting paid by AXA, whose CEO is head of the Bilderberg Group - the legacy financial elite which Bitcoin aims to disintermediate. Greg always refuses to address this massive conflict of interest. Why?

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4mlo0z/greg_maxwell_used_to_have_intelligent_nuanced/

---

&gt; Previously, Greg Maxwell u/nullc (CTO of Blockstream), Adam Back u/adam3us (CEO of Blockstream), and u/theymos (owner of r\bitcoin) all said that bigger blocks would be fine. Now they prefer to risk splitting the community &amp; the network, instead of upgrading to bigger blocks. What happened to them?

&gt; ""Even a year ago I said I though we could probably survive 2MB"" - /u/nullc 

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43mond/even_a_year_ago_i_said_i_though_we_could_probably/

Core/Blockstream supporters like to tiptoe around the facts a lot - hoping we won't pay attention to the fact that they're getting paid by a company like AXA, or hoping we'll get confused if Greg says that AXA isn't a bank but rather an insurance firm.

But the facts are the facts, whether AXA is an insurance giant or a bank:

- AXA would be exposed as bankrupt in a world dominated by a ""counterparty-free"" asset class like Bitcoin.

- AXA pays Greg's salary - and Greg is one of the major forces who has been actively attempting to block Bitcoin's on-chain scaling - and there's no way getting around the fact that **artificially small blocksizes do lead to artificially low prices.**

**AXA kinda reminds me of AIG**

If anyone here was paying attention when the cracks first started showing in the world fiat finance system around 2008, you may recall the name of another mega-insurance company, that was also one of the most connected finance companies in the world: AIG.

---

&gt; **Falling Giant: A Case Study Of AIG**

&gt; What was once the unthinkable occurred on September 16, 2008. On that date, the federal government gave the American International Group - better known as AIG (NYSE:AIG) - a bailout of $85 billion. In exchange, the U.S. government received nearly 80% of the firm's equity. For decades, AIG was the world's biggest insurer, a company known around the world for providing protection for individuals, companies and others. But in September, the company would have gone under if it were not for government assistance.

http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/american-investment-group-aig-bailout.asp

**Why the Fed saved AIG and not Lehman**

&gt; Bernanke did say he believed an AIG failure would be ""catastrophic,"" and that the heavy use of derivatives made the AIG problem potentially more explosive.

&gt; An AIG failure, thanks to the firm's size and its vast web of trading partners, ""would have triggered an intensification of the general run on international banking institutions,"" Bernanke said.

http://fortune.com/2010/09/02/why-the-fed-saved-aig-and-not-lehman/

---

Just like AIG, AXA is a ""systemically important"" finance company - one of the biggest insurance companies in the world.

And (like all major banks _and_ insurance firms), AXA is drowning in worthless debt and bets (derivatives).

Most of AXA's balance sheet would go up in a puff of smoke if they actually did ""mark-to-market"" (ie, if they actually factored in the _probability_ of the counterparties of their debts and bets actually coming through and paying AXA the full amount it says on the pretty little spreadsheets on everyone's computer screens).

In other words: Like most giant banks and insurers, AXA has mainly debt and bets. They rely on counterparties to pay them - maybe, someday, if the whole system doesn't go tits-up by then.

In other words: Like most giant banks and insurers, AXA does _not_ hold the ""private keys"" to their so-called wealth :-)

So, like most giant multinational banks and insurers who spend all their time playing with debts and bets, AXA has been teetering on the edge of the abyss since 2008 - held together by chewing gum and paper clips and the miracle of Quantitative Easing - and also by all the clever _accounting tricks_ that instantly become possible when money can go from being a gleam in a banker's eye to a pixel on a screen with just a few keystrokes - that wonderful world of ""fantasy fiat"" where central bankers ninja-mine billions of dollars in worthless paper and pixels into existence every month - and then for some reason every other month they have to hold a special ""emergency central bankers meeting"" to deal with the latest financial crisis du jour which ""nobody could have seen coming"".

AIG back in 2008 - much like AXA today - was another ""systemically important"" worldwide mega-insurance giant - with most of its net worth merely a pure fantasy on a spreadsheet and in a four-color annual report - glossing over the ugly reality that it's all based on toxic debts and derivatives which will never ever be paid off.

~~Mega-banks~~ Mega-insurers like AXA are addicted to the never-ending ""fantasy fiat"" being injected into the casino of musical chairs involving bets upon bets upon bets upon bets upon bets - counterparty against counterparty against counterparty against counterparty - going 'round and 'round on the big beautiful carroussel where everyone is waiting on the next guy to pay up - and meanwhile everyone's cooking their books and sweeping their losses ""under the rug"", offshore or onto the taxpayers or into special-purpose vehicles - while the central banks keep printing up a trillion more here and a trillion more there in worthless debt-backed paper and pixels - while entire nations slowly sink into the toxic financial sludge of ever-increasing upayable debt and lower productivity and higher inflation, dragging down everyone's economies, enslaving everyone to increasing worktime and decreasing paychecks and unaffordable healthcare and education, corrupting our institutions and our leaders, distorting our investment and ""capital allocation"" decisions, inflating housing and healthcare and education beyond everyone's reach - and sending people off to die in endless wars to prop up the deadly failing [Saudi-American oil-for-arms Petrodollar ninja-mined currency cartel](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5q6kjo/the_owners_of_blockstream_are_spending_76_million/). 

In 2008, when the multinational insurance company AIG (along with their fellow gambling buddies at the multinational investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehmans) almost went down the drain due to all their toxic gambling debts, they also almost took the rest of the world with them.

And that's when the ""core"" dev team working for the ~~miners~~ central banks (the Fed, ECB, BoE, BoJ - who all report to the ""central bank of central banks"" BIS in Basel) - started cranking up their ~~mining rigs~~ printing presses and keyboards and pixels to the max, unilaterally manipulating the ""issuance schedule"" of their shitcoins and flooding the world with tens of trillions in their worthless phoney fiat to save their sorry asses after all their toxic debts and bad bets.

AXA is at the very rotten ""core"" of this system - like AIG, a ""systemically important"" (ie, ""too big to fail"") mega-gigantic multinational insurance company - a fantasy fiat finance firm quietly sitting at the rotten core of our current corrupt financial system, basically impacting everything and everybody on this planet.

The ""masters of the universe"" from AXA are the people who go to Davos every year wining and dining on lobster and champagne - part of that elite circle that prints up endless money which they hand out to their friends while they continue to enslave everyone else - and then of course they always turn around and tell us we can't have nice things like roads and schools and healthcare because ""austerity"". (But somehow we always _can_ have plenty of wars and prisons and climate change and terrorism because [for some weird reason our ""leaders"" seem to love creating disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine).)

The smart people at AXA are probably all having nightmares - and the smart people at all the other companies in that circle of ""too-big-to-fail"" ""fantasy fiat finance firms"" are probably also having nightmares - about the following very possible scenario:

**If Bitcoin succeeds, debt-and-derivatives-dependent financial ""giants"" like AXA will probably be exposed as having been bankrupt this entire time.**

All their debts and bets will be exposed as not being worth the paper and pixels they were printed on - and at that point, in a cryptocurrency world, the only real money in the world will be ""counterparty-free"" assets ie cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin - where all you need to hold is your own private keys - and you're not dependent on the _next_ deadbeat debt-ridden fiat slave down the line coughing up to pay you.

Some of those people at AXA and the rest of that mafia are probably quietly buying - sad that they missed out when Bitcoin was only $10 or $100 - but happy they can still get it for $1000 while [Blockstream continues to suppress the price](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5obe2m/this_traders_price_volume_graph_model_predicted/) - and who knows, what the hell, they might as well throw some of that juicy ""banker's bonus"" into Bitcoin now just in case it really does go to $1 million a coin someday - [which it could _easily_ do with just 32MB blocks, and _no_ modifications to the code](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5uljaf/bitcoin_original_reinstate_satoshis_original_32mb/) (ie, no SegWit, no BU, no nuthin', just a slowly growing blocksize supporting a price growing roughly proportional to the _square_ of the blocksize - like Bitcoin always actually _did_ before the economically illiterate devs at Blockstream imposed their centrally planned blocksize on our previously decentralized system).

Meanwhile, other people at AXA and other major finance firms might be taking a different tack: happy to see all the disinfo and discord being sown among the Bitcoin community like they've been doing since they were founded in late 2014 - buying out all the devs, dumbing down the community to the point where now even [the CTO of Blockstream Greg Mawxell gets the whitepaper totally backwards](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5zxl2l/mining_is_how_you_vote_for_rule_changes_gregs/).

**Maybe Core/Blockstream's failure-to-scale is a _feature_ not a _bug_ - for companies like AXA.**

After all, AXA - like most of the major banks in the Europe and the US - are now basically totally dependent on debt and derivatives to pretend they're not already _bankrupt_.

Maybe Blockstream's dead-end road-map (written up by none other than Greg Maxwell), which has been slowly strangling Bitcoin for over two years now - and which could ultimately destroy Bitcoin via [the poison pill of Core/Blockstream's SegWit trojan horse](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5vbofp/initially_i_liked_segwit_but_then_i_learned/) - maybe all this never-ending history of obstrution and foot-dragging and lying and failure from Blockstream is actually a _feature_ and not a _bug_, as far as AXA and their banking buddies are concerned.

&gt; The insurance company with the biggest exposure to the 1.2 quadrillion dollar (ie, 1200 TRILLION dollar) derivatives casino is AXA. Yeah, *that* AXA, the company whose CEO is head of the Bilderberg Group, and whose ""venture capital"" arm bought out Bitcoin development by ""investing"" in Blockstream.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4k1r7v/the_insurance_company_with_the_biggest_exposure/

---

&gt; If Bitcoin becomes a major currency, then tens of trillions of dollars on the ""legacy ledger of fantasy fiat"" will evaporate, destroying AXA, whose CEO is head of the Bilderbergers. This is the real reason why AXA bought Blockstream: to artificially suppress Bitcoin volume and price with 1MB blocks. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4r2pw5/if_bitcoin_becomes_a_major_currency_then_tens_of/

---

AXA has even invented some kind of [""climate catastrophe"" derivative](http://www.artemis.bm/blog/2015/02/17/axa-backed-climatesecure-parametric-weather-risk-startup-launches/) - a bet where if the global warming destroys an entire region of the world, the ""winner"" gets paid.

Of course, derivatives would be something attractive to an insurance company - since basically most of their business is about making and taking bets.

So who knows - maybe AXA is ""betting against"" Bitcoin - and their little investment in the loser devs at Core/Blockstream is part of their strategy for ""winning"" that bet.

---

&gt; This trader's price &amp; volume graph / model predicted that we should be over $10,000 USD/BTC by now. The model broke in late 2014 - when AXA-funded Blockstream was founded, and started spreading propaganda and crippleware, centrally imposing artificially tiny blocksize to suppress the volume &amp; price.

&gt; Bitcoin *can* go to 10,000 USD with 4 MB blocks, so it *will* go to 10,000 USD with 4 MB blocks. All the censorship &amp; shilling on r\bitcoin &amp; fantasy fiat from AXA can't stop that.

&gt; AXA/Blockstream are suppressing Bitcoin price at 1000 bits = 1 USD. If 1 bit = 1 USD, then Bitcoin's market cap would be 15 trillion USD - close to the 82 trillion USD of ""money"" in the world. With Bitcoin Unlimited, we can get to 1 bit = 1 USD on-chain with 32MB blocksize (""Million-Dollar Bitcoin"")

Anyways, people are noticing that it's a little... odd... the way Greg Maxwell seems to go to such lengths, in order to cover up the fact that **bigger blocks have always correlated to higher price.** 

He seems to get very... uncomfortable... when people start pointing out that:

**It sure looks like AXA is paying Greg Maxwell to suppress the Bitcoin price.**

&gt; Greg Maxwell has now publicly confessed that he is engaging in deliberate market manipulation to artificially suppress Bitcoin adoption and price. He could be doing this so that he and his associates can continue to accumulate while the price is still low (1 BTC = $570, ie 1 USD can buy 1750 ""bits"")

&gt; Why did Blockstream CTO u/nullc Greg Maxwell risk being exposed as a fraud, by lying about basic math?

Why is *this* lie so precious to him?

**I don't know how a so-called Bitcoin dev can sleep at night knowing he's getting paid by fucking AXA - a company that would probably go bankrupt if Bitcoin becomes a major world currency.**

Greg must have to go through some pretty complicated mental gymastics to justify in his mind what everyone else can see: he is a fucking sellout to one of the biggest fiat finance firms in the world - he's getting paid by (and defending) a company which would probably go bankrupt if Bitcoin ever achieved multi-trillion dollar market cap.

Greg is literally getting paid by the second-most-connected ""systemically important"" (ie, ""too big to fail"") finance firm in the world - which will probably go bankrupt if Bitcoin were ever to assume its rightful place as a major currency with total market cap measured in the tens of trillions of dollars, destroying most of the toxic sludge of debt and derivatives keeping a ~~bank~~ financial giant like AXA afloat.

And it may at first sound batshit crazy (until [You Do The Math](https://np.reddit.com/user/ydtm?sort=top)), but Bitcoin actually really _could_ go to one-million-dollars-a-coin in the next 8 years or so - without SegWit or BU or anything else - simply by continuing with Satoshi's original 32MB built-in blocksize limit and continuing to let miners keep blocks as _small_ as possible to satisfy demand while avoiding orphans - a power which they've had this whole friggin' time and which they've been managing very well thank you. 

&gt; Bitcoin Original: Reinstate Satoshi's original 32MB max blocksize. If actual blocks grow 54% per year (and price grows 1.54^2 = 2.37x per year - Metcalfe's Law), then in 8 years we'd have 32MB blocks, 100 txns/sec, 1 BTC = 1 million USD - 100% on-chain P2P cash, without SegWit/Lightning or Unlimited

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5uljaf/bitcoin_original_reinstate_satoshis_original_32mb/

Meanwhile Greg continues to work for Blockstream which is getting tens of millions of dollars from a company which would go bankrupt if Bitcoin were to actually scale on-chain to 32MB blocks and 1 million dollars per coin without all of Greg's meddling.

So Greg continues to get paid by AXA, spreading his ignorance about economics and his lies about Bitcoin on these forums.

In the end, who knows what Greg's motivations are, or AXA's motivations are.

But one thing we do know is this:

**Satoshi didn't put Greg Maxwell or AXA in charge of deciding the blocksize.**

The tricky part to understand about ""one CPU, one vote"" is that it does _not_ mean there is some ""pre-existing set of rules"" which the miners somehow ""enforce"" (despite all the times when you hear some Core idiot using words like ""consensus layer"" or ""enforcing _the_ rules"").

The tricky part about really understanding Bitcoin is this:

**Hashpower doesn't just _enforce_ the rules - hashpower _makes_ the rules.**

And if you think about it, this makes sense. 

It's the only way Bitcoin actually _could_ be _decentralized_.

It's kinda subtle - and it might be hard for someone to understand if they've been a [slave](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5zievg/as_benjamin_frankline_once_said_given_a_choice/) to centralized authorities their whole life - but when we say that Bitcoin is ""decentralized"" then what it means is:

**We _all_ make the rules.**

Because if _hashpower_ doesn't make the rules - then you'd be right back where you started from, with some idiot like Greg Maxwell ""making the rules"" - or some corrupt too-big-to-fail ~~bank~~ debt-and-derivative-backed ""fantasy fiat financial firm"" like AXA making the rules - by buying out a dev team and telling us that _that_ dev team ""makes the rules"".

But fortunately, Greg's opinions and ignorance and lies _don't matter anymore._

Miners are waking up to the fact that they've _always_ controlled the blocksize - and they always _will_ control the blocksize - and there isn't a single goddamn thing Greg Maxwell or Blockstream or AXA can do to stop them from changing it - whether the miners end up using BU or Classic or BitcoinEC or they patch the code themselves.

&gt; The debate is not ""SHOULD THE BLOCKSIZE BE 1MB VERSUS 1.7MB?"". The debate is: ""WHO SHOULD DECIDE THE BLOCKSIZE?"" (1) Should an obsolete temporary anti-spam hack freeze blocks at 1MB? (2) Should a centralized dev team soft-fork the blocksize to 1.7MB? (3) OR SHOULD THE MARKET DECIDE THE BLOCKSIZE?

&gt; Core/Blockstream are now in the Kübler-Ross ""Bargaining"" phase - talking about ""compromise"". Sorry, but markets don't do ""compromise"". Markets do COMPETITION. Markets do winner-takes-all.

&gt; **Clearing up Some Widespread Confusions about BU**

&gt; Core deliberately provides software with a blocksize policy pre-baked in. 

&gt; The ONLY thing BU-style software changes is that baking in. It refuses to bundle controversial blocksize policy in with the rest of the code it is offering. It unties the blocksize settings from the dev teams, so that you don't have to shop for both as a packaged unit. 

&gt; The idea is that you can now have Core software security without having to submit to Core blocksize policy. 

&gt; Running Core is like buying a Sony TV that only lets you watch Fox, because the other channels are locked away and you have to know how to solder a circuit board to see them. To change the channel, you as a layman would have to switch to a different TV made by some other manufacturer, who you may not think makes as reliable of TVs. 

&gt; This is because Sony believes people should only ever watch Fox ""because there are dangerous channels out there"" or ""because since everyone needs to watch the same channel, it is our job to decide what that channel is."" 

&gt; So the community is stuck with either watching Fox on their nice, reliable Sony TVs, or switching to all watching ABC on some more questionable TVs made by some new maker (like, in 2015 the XT team was the new maker and BIP101 was ABC).

&gt; BU (and now Classic and BitcoinEC) shatters that whole bizarre paradigm. BU is a TV that lets you tune to any channel you want, at your own risk. 

&gt; The community is free to converge on any channel it wants to, and since everyone in this analogy wants to watch the same channel they will coordinate to find one.

---

&gt; **Adjustable blocksize cap (ABC) is dangerous? The blocksize cap has always been user-adjustable. Core just has a really shitty inferface for it.**

&gt; What does it tell you that Core and its supporters are up in arms about a change that _merely makes something more convenient for users_ and couldn't be prevented from happening anyway? Attacking the adjustable blocksize feature in BU and Classic as ""dangerous"" is a kind of trap, as it is an implicit admission that Bitcoin was being protected only by a small barrier of inconvenience, and a completely temporary one at that. If this was such a ""danger"" or such a vector for an ""attack,"" how come we never heard about it before? 

&gt; Even if we accept the improbable premise that inconvenience is the great bastion holding Bitcoin together and the paternalistic premise that stakeholders need to be fed consensus using a spoon of inconvenience, we still must ask, who shall do the spoonfeeding?

&gt; Core accepts these two amazing premises and further declares that Core alone shall be allowed to do the spoonfeeding.

personalfinance,"Beginning graduate school with cash reserves, to take a loan or not?","Hello there,

I am going to start grad school in the Spring and would like some advice pertaining to my financial situation.  I have never taken out a student loan in the past and have no current debt.

I have saved near $65,000 over the past four years and have this amount of cash on hand.

My graduate program is 3 years long and will cost near $12,000 a year, not including living expenses or reductions from a TA position that I may apply for.

I qualify for an un-subsidized government loan of $20,500.  The current interest rate is 5.31% and my understanding is that as a grad student, interest will accrue while I am in school, but payments do not need to be made until 6 months after I finish school. 

My worry, is that in the interest calculation it takes into consideration the amount of time since your last payment and I am not sure how that is factored in with the mention that I don't actually need to make a payment until 6 months after I leave school.  What I mean to say is, will I just accrue a giant amount of interest on the loan over the three years of studying?

How should I play this?  I could pay for my education with cash on had, but it would almost certainly deplete my entire savings over the course of the three years due to having to live off of the savings as well.  Or, do I take out a direct loan of $20,000 as an attempt to invest the cash somewhere else?

My program does end with a pretty solid work-placement, but the question is, I suppose, whether to end my education broke with no debt, or with money in the bank and some debt.

Any advice helps.  Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,"20 year old trying to plan out grad school, wondering if loans will be manageable","Hi,

I'm currently 20, a sophomore in undergrad. I currently have about $8000 in federal subsidized loans, and $7000 in my bank account. I will not be taking out any more loans until graduate school. My parents will be providing me with $500 a month starting in may, until i graduate college in two years, so about $12,000 in total. 

Between undergraduate and graduate school, I plan on taking a gap year working full time as an EMT or physical therapist and making about $20-$30k. My parents will be providing me with $500 a month while i work. 


Graduate school (for physician assistant) will be 2-3 years, and tuition will cost between $70k-$120k total, depending on where I get in. My parents will be giving me about $1000 a month while I am in graduate school. 

I'm not sure what I will make straight out of graduate school, but for my area, I expect around $80k a year.

personalfinance,Moved to a new state and underestimated the cost of living. Now I'm having issues getting by.,"I (27,F) moved into a house with five roommates near DC after being homeless for awhile. I had to move very quickly and pretty much snapped up the first thing I could find in order to not live out of my car anymore. The high taxes coming out of my paycheck in this state caught me by surprise, and I ended up underestimating what I could afford. I realize now I also got snookered, because I pay $975/m in rent for ""shared"" amenities that I never get to use. Generally everyone is uncomfortable living together. It's crowded; there are wars over who can occupy the kitchen and laundry room. The biggest expense issue I'm having is the food. I spend what feels like a shit-ton of money on carry-out. I can get away with buying a few groceries, but I don't have access to the kitchen because of over-crowding issues and territory issues with the fridge.

Currently, I'm trying to figure out how to make things more affordable. Getting out of my lease would be great, and I have brought it up with the landlord. But every time I try to talk to her, she ignores my emails and texts. I realize that me being uncomfortable in my living space is not my landlord's fault. I signed a contract, and I'm planning on fulfilling that.  

So everything breaks down to this: my monthly income is about $1800-$2000/m after Maryland state and federal taxes. My rent is $975/m including utilities, car payments are $220/m, phone is $100/m, student loans are $60/m, credit card bill is $25/m, and gym membership $12/m. At the very best, with overtime, I have around $600 per month left over for gas, food, co-pays, and anything else I need for the month. Soon I'm going to have to start paying 165/m in health insurance through work. I have a chronic condition, so the ""catastrophe"" plans aren't good for me. 


I just need some advice on how to cut some of my expenses. I've got four months to go on my lease. Is it worth breaking it just to get out of the situation entirely? My landlord will not respond to me and has said that I will be liable for rent whether I choose to leave or not. Also, I am just renting the suite. My leaving would not affect the other roommates. 

I'm stuck and absolutely miserable. I feel like I pay way too much for a place where I can't even use the fridge. The only person I've asked so far about the situation has been my estranged father, a baby-boomer, who promptly told me that I dun f'd up and am a lazy, ignorant millennial. Help?


**TL;DR: After years of being woefully under-educated about finances, I find myself stuck in a living situation after being homeless that is destructive to my life and personal finances. Any suggestions would be appreciated.**",finance

personalfinance,733 credit score gets the WORST interest rate available?,"A month ago, applied for a Visa card from B of A at the Auto Club. Brochure said I'd be offered an interest rate between 15.35% and 24.45% based on my creditworthiness. I've had great credit for years so I was shocked when the answer came back with the 24.45 rate. (For context, just a month earlier I'd been given a Visa card at my local credit union at 10.99 percent! )

I refused the card.

2 weeks later, I received by mail a letter from BofA stating that my card application result was based on the score of 733 that they pulled that day from Experian.

Is it normal and typical for a 733 score to result in the worst rate available? Just six months ago, I know my score was at 750, and at that time I obtained a fixed rate mortgage at 4.75%, and I was told my credit score was excellent. Should 17 points make this dramatic a difference, or did the B of A decision not make good sense?

personalfinance,(CAN) Mortgage refinance at the same time as new (used) vehicle purchase,"Hi all,

SO and I are in the process of refinancing our house to access a better interest rate.  We are also going to be purchasing a new (likely used) vehicle soon as our VW is part of the buyback.  After shopping around for use vehicle interest rates I've found they start around 5.25% which I'm not willing to pay.

Mortage balance is ~300k, property value is ~650k. We're in our 5th year of a 25 year mortgage.

I noticed a few people in this community mentioned financing a car through a HELOC.  Is there a difference between using a HELOC or just rolling it into the mortgage? I understand it would have a significantly higher total cost of borrowing if we financed the car over the new 20 years.  However if we were to increase the monthly payment to be equal to whatever the cost of the car is @ 5.5% and pay it off in 5 years is there any exposure here?

Starting with Salary / where I work.
Used to work at a call center for about a year and a half I had exceeded goals and achievements set, but the work was repetitive and boring and that I saw little to move forward in the company.

Lived with my mom (she had MS) she passed away and I moved with some family needed a job quick and got hired at Mcdonalds ( I know people might think lower or whatever the case is) I wasn't here for the amazing 8.50 that i started at.

I do inventory twice a week and truck order twice a week.

I have taken management classes as far as going to Chicago for Hamburger University (Haha)

personalfinance,Advice about Funding College for my Daughter,"Like lots of people, the rug was pulled out from our family after suffering job losses (both of us two months apart) and a house foreclosure during the recession. As a result of being caught so unprepared, I became an absolute queen when it comes to frugal living. However, the one thing I've never been able to recover from is the loss of my children's college savings and now I'm feeling like a complete failure of a mom and could use some advice.

My oldest child has worked very hard and was accepted into the school of her dreams. Said school is not any more expensive than state school and offered a scholarship for roughly 75% of the tuition cost. It wasn't easy to get accepted because the college is rebuilding and incoming class sizes are small. Great job, right?

Well here's the problem: Even with the scholarships, a tiny bit of grant money, and the max in federal loans, I'm not sure how to go about paying for it. 

It's frustrating because at one time, said child had an educational account that would have at least covered the first two years but life happened and it had to be liquidated so she could literally eat, have shelter, and take important medication for a chronic condition she suffers from. But that is neither here or near now I guess.

It's looking like we still need to come up with approximately another $9,500 a year - not including books (which I already know how to do for cheap). I figured I would have to pay something toward college so I personally have managed to save up $4320 over the course of the year for this reason, so that brings our number down to around $5,180. 

It seems so insignificant in the course of college money I know (hence why I feel like such a failure as a mom), but that equates to over $20,000 in the entirety of the four years she is going to be there. For us the amount is not all that insignificant. Please keep in mind, I have two other children who will definitely be entering college based on their great grades - one in the next two years and another as soon as the middle graduates. That's what I get for emphasizing school so much I guess!

While our financial situation has improved significantly over the last 4 years since hitting bottom, we have only worked our way up to roughly $50,000 a year (a fraction of what we use to make) for a family of five. Despite this, we have been able to save enough to buy another smaller home outright (they were pretty bargain basement priced in our area when everyone was loosing them) and fixed it up literally using my husband's skill and reclaimed supplies. I have also been frugal enough to start an emergency fund over the last four years which is currently about $21,000. Fortunately, our retirement accounts survived the apocalypse and we still contribute to them regularly. However because of past mistakes and obviously history, I'm downright terrified and hesitant to risk our security by dipping into savings in order to try to pay for this. With our income, any string of unfortunate events (broken furnace, heath issues, so forth) could really hurt us without it. I'm absolutely not refinancing my house.

I went to talk with the financial aid officer today hoping to try to figure out options. Despite being a known liberal trend-setting college, they are actually pretty old school. She can't apply to live off campus until her junior year despite only living 30 minutes away so that ideal situation is out even though that would have just about covered it. Also, payment for terms are due on a specific date and they don't have payment plans like other schools. I inquired about state grants and believe it or not - we make too much to qualify. Seriously, something like $20 over the EFC. Go figure!

Financial Aid did suggest we take out a parent-plus loan though but I'm even more hesitate about doing that for various reasons! My first problem is I still have about $11,000 left in my own student loans to pay for. The second is I'm not sure about credit since the foreclosure is still on our records. I've managed to get mine to 650 and my husband's up to 670 at the moment but I'm not sure how much more it will move by fall with that still on there. Also, I'm leery on taking on any debt period, with our current income, the two other kids, and all.

The daughter in question is more than willing to help of course. She already has secured a summer job as a camp consoler but we figured she could only possibly save about another $1000-1500. She is currently trying to get a second job waitressing a couple nights a week as well. The plan is she will also be working part-time in the village the college is located come fall, hopefully in an off-campus part-time-job as they tend to pay more than work study. She will be taking her bike to get around campus so she won't have transportation costs but school supplies, hygiene, ideally federal loan interest payments, and so forth will be all her responsibility. She is very talented at art (like literally designated as gifted by the state but don't worry she is going more into animation, programming, and web design - Media Art) and has suggested spending weekends selling work in various area folk art shows. Also, the college requires co-ops every year in the field the student is studying so there might be some extra money in that - although the student will be responsible for paying their living expenses while working there as well so I'm not really counting much on that.

She also has applied to numerous local scholarships (25) - which she has a real shot at getting - but they won't be announcing winners and amounts until the Senior Banquet at the end of May. The deposit for the school is due May 1st so we kind of need this sorted out by then. 

My husband works construction and has taken on additional side work to help pay for this. However, I feel really bad about him doing so as he already works about 50-60 hours throughout the week. I don't really want him doing much of that. I'm searching for a full-time position myself and have an interview next week but have to be very careful because my current part time employment provides full and much needed benefits that are better than most and saves us a lot of money. My husband works for a small business and they are not required by law (nor can they afford) to provide anything. I also heard about an opportunity to clean homes at an elderly apartment building for extra cash so I'm going to find out about that as well.

So here's what I'm currently thinking: Save as much as we can between us three, continue to apply for scholarships while waiting on the results of the others, and then just pay for the rest out of the emergency savings. 

Does anyone else have any other ideals? Is there any other sort of funding that I'm not considering? 

Personally, I only went to community college and might not know all the options out there. I'm willing to listen to any advice and feel so crazy over how much sleep I am loosing over such a few thousand dollars!",finance

economy,"How is money created? Aka, Modern Economic Theory","Lately I've been having a fascination with political systems and theories but there is one aspect I can't wrap my head around; 

**How/where is a nation's money/currency created?**

When I was younger I've read both Das Kapital and The Wealth of Nations. Lately I've been attempting to read about Keynesian Economics, fractional-reserve banking, monetary policies, how central banks use interest rates to control inflation/deflation.

I can't get to the ""core"" of the issue though, I just don't seem to fully understand it. Maybe I need a 5-year economic degree to really understand it but I'm hoping an economical genius here can give me a ""crash course""?

I do understand it in the physical sense; the government has printing machines that makes money. Banks get some of these money and it's distributed to people and corporations.

**What I don't understand is more practical.**

**Example 1:** Say I work at a lumber mill. I do a job, the company pays me. The company gets their money from selling lumber to another company. This company is a mining company, they use the lumber to make supports in their mines. They pay their workers. Their money comes from selling bauxite to a foreign company. This money comes from another country's economy - that company pays workers with money they get either from selling something or from their government. This money again comes from taxes in some way or another.

**Example 2:** I work at an IT support company. I get payed by my company. The company has a contract with the government to support and deliver IT infrastructure. The government agency gets their money from the national budget which is funded by taxes. Those taxes comes from workers which gets their money from their pay which comes from where?

**Is the government (which is the people) essentially just ""leeching"" off itself in an endless circle? What is the ""point of origin"", where does it stop?**

Then there is another huge issue which just confuses me even more: fractional-reserve banking. As far as I understand this is widespread in most westernized countries today. My understanding is that banks can ""reuse"" the same physical cash to give out many loans. Which essentially means they ""create"" digital money without physical currency? Is this just some elaborate ""legitimized"" scam?

**This chain of thought started because I was thinking about Universal Basic Income.**

I was thinking to myself; so how would a country get the money required for a UBI? I guess taxes, but could they not just ""print"" the money? But if you print the money couldn't you just create some utopian nation where every citizen gets a billion dollars/pounds/kroner per year and everyone is rich? Then I was starting to think why this can't work, and hence it led me to my current state of my brain hurting from thinking too much...

Essentially is UBI just taking money from some people or some corporations to give money to all citizens?",finance

personalfinance,Dental bill: primary vs. secondary insurance,"I am a federal employee who has health insurance (FEHB) and additional dental coverage (FEDVIP). FEHB has some, but very little dental coverage. For some reason, all claims are always sent to FEHB as the primary insurance and FEDVIP as secondary.

The total charge was $135. FEHB covers a flat rate of $21 for this type of filling. FEDVIP has an in-network negotiated amount of $65 and paid the remaining $44.

My dentist is claiming that he can only take one write-off and it always comes from the primary insurance. Which means he has charged $135 minus $21 from FEHB and $44 from FEDVIP and results in me owing $70. It seems common in my insurance brochures that FEHB and FEDVIP work together to provide the most benefits, so I am starting to question if my dentist is correct.

For one, what write-off was there from the primary insurance? It seems between the insurance and myself that we will pay the full cost of the filling.

Second, shouldn't my dentist be taking the largest write-off (which could come from either the primary or secondary)? In this case, the secondary insurance write-off would be $70, then FEHB and FEDVIP pay the remaining $65.

Edit: If it matters, I am in the state of PA. Also, I am not too concerned about having to pay $70. It is more of a concern that a larger procedure will lead an unexpected bill b/c my ""secondary"" insurance negotiated rate is not taken as a write-off.",finance

The only problem is I have no idea where to begin looking for good IRA's as I haven't researched them at all. Preferably and if possible, it would be nice if whatever account the money goes into could be transferred into another IRA account, in case I find something better.

personalfinance,Employer not taking out Federal taxes. Says it's because I don't make enough?,"Hello PF peeps! Thanks in advance for helping me figure this out. I honestly just don't have anyone in my life to ask a question like this.

Here's some basic info about me and this situation. I just started a part time job, making $11 an hour and usually working between 14-18 hours per week. I live in Ohio. I am married and have no kids.

When I first filled out my W4 for this job, I claimed 0 and did not ask for anything extra held back. My first couple of paycheck stubs showed that my company was only taking out OASDI, Medicare and OH (state taxes). No Federal or city taxes were withheld. I called our company payroll advisor and she said that she was ""pretty sure"" I simply didn't make enough money for Federal taxes to be withheld. Now, I haven't worked in 10 years, and haven't filled out a W4 in as many years, but can you make too little for the government to tax?

So, I called the IRS. The lady I spoke to was as dumb about this as I am. She told me that I needed to claim a 1 on my W4, but she did say that there is no minimum amount I have to make for taxes to be taken out.

I also called my city tax office and asked them if city taxes should be taken out of my check, and they said yes. They also said there is no minimum I need to make for city taxes to be withheld. The store I work at is in the same county as where I live, if that means anything.

So, I spoke to my store manager about my new found info and he spoke to the payroll lady again, who agreed, saying I needed to claim 1 on my taxes. Great, so I filled out another W4, claiming 1 and asking for an additional $10 to be held from each check.

So, my next paystub arrives, and yes, $10 has been withheld under the title of FED, but nothing else, just that $10. City taxes are also still not being taken out.

I'm at a loss, and I'm about to quit this job because of this stupid tax issue. You guys in PF are so smart, and I feel so silly posting about such a small problem, but I knew you could give me the true bottom line about what I need to do. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Looking to do a balance transfer of a cc that I spent over zealously and racked up a ton of debt.,"I opened a discover cc many years ago.  It's my only personal cc and I racked up a few grand in debt on it.  It's been a few years since I've opened it so I'm getting charged interest per month on the high balance.

personalfinance,Save vs debt paydown,"I know you guys get these types of questions a lot. So, sorry in advance. 

I think my H and I are doing okay financially, we're just having trouble prioritizing our goals and we're trying to do everything at once. 

So, here's our sitch:

-Monthly income: 6500 after taxes, 12% contribution to my 401k (with 3.5% employer match), $250 to H's 4013b, and his required 14% contribution to his pension (with 14% employer match). 

-Monthly expenses (non-debt:): about 5000

-Minimum monthly debt payments:

$134 for Student Loan 1, interest rate 1.9%, about $12,500 left
$192 for Student Loan 2, interest rate 6.8%, about $16,500 left
$166 for Home Improvement loan, interest rate 7.00%, about $6000 left
$299 for car, interest rate 2.8%, about 19k left

We have about $1.5k left over each month to throw at debt or save.

Other background info:

Combined retirement savings about $140,000
E-fund: $10k 

We also usually receive several lump sum payments throughout the year from gifts and/or bonuses, adding up to anywhere between $1500 to $5000. 

Recently, we've talked about aggressively paying off the home improvement loan (with the goal of knocking it out by the end of the year), get our e-fund up to $15k, potentially opening a Roth IRA, and opening up a 529 for our 9-month old daughter (which, according to calculators, we'll need to put $600 in to fully pay for her college in 18 years. Insert panicked-face emoji here). I'm just not sure where to put our focus.

personalfinance,Looking to buy Townhome/Condo - Advice,"My wife and I are looking to purchase a new Condo/Townhouse in our area. They are about $250k - $300k with taxes around $9.5k and HOA of $150. Yearly income is around $108k base salary. $40k saved.

We need to move because we are crammed in a small 2bd apartment and I work from home 80% of the time.

It is not likely we'll stay in this home for the full 30 years.. with work travel and life changes I'd expect to be around this area for at least 5-10 years.
A couple of questions:

* Larger down-payment or smaller down-payment? - My banker suggested a smaller down-payment because they offer a lender paid PMI option where lender will cover PMI but will increase your interest rate by 0.25% .. over the duration of the mortgage (30 year) it is about the same.. but if you end up wanting out in 10 years it pays off because you save around $100 a month by having them cover the PMI.

* Should I put lower down-payment and pay it off aggresively? - right now financially we can pay down $3000 a month which would be an extra $800 (or so). I'd like to have a lower monthly but overpay .. giving me the option to pay the base monthly amount if I need to.

Any thoughts?",finance

By the time I got my act together (aka started adulting), it was about 2012, and figured that since it was already five years in or so, it would be gone soon.

In January, they added two new loan entries for the student loans (now 4 total), except instead of reporting the close date of April 2008, it now says Jan 2017 with comments noting ""payment after charge off/collections; paid profit loss.""

I called the bank and was told they they wrote off a bunch of loans in December, which triggered this alert to my report,  and they had received many calls about this, particularly from others in my situation (pertaining to old loans) and told me to dispute it.

personalfinance,What should I put towards my 401k if I have debts to pay off?,"So my situation is basically, I just got a new job and make around 80k. I haven't saved anything for retirement other than around $600 in an IRA and I'm 25 years old. I have around 26k in student loans and 18k on a car loan, as well as 4k in 0%APR credit card debt. 

My plan was originally to save 20% in my 401k, but I'm wondering if it would be better to scale it back and pay down my loans before going to that amount. I could start with 10 or 15%, and would go to 20% once I have paid off my loans. 

What do y'all think would be the ideal way to handle this situation. The car loan is at around 4% interest, and my student loans are split between 3% and 5% federal loans. The credit card at 4k has no APR for around 10 months, but I would love to pay this off early instead of paying 500 a month, it would make me feel better and I could put that money towards paying off my car.",finance

I just need to take the MCAT, so I would take severance + unemployment until I can get through the application cycle the next few months and then look for another job until school would start during Fall 2018.

My question is what to about my debt and my GFs debt. We are planning to get married, so her debt is my debt. I personally have $17,200 in debt. She has much more with a loan of $16,500 at 9.5% and $48,000 at 4.5% Total debt is around $82k. 

My question is what should I do with my Roth 401k. I have $62,000 in there now, but unfortunately I have a loan against it at $17000. I used this to pay off some of my higher interest debt. I'm sure it was a stupid move, but I was struggling at the time. I figure if I cash out, I'm getting the 20% fed tax and 10% early withdrawal penalty. That would mean I could take out the 62k and get 43k from that. Then I could take that 43k and pay off the 17k loan and then cash out the rest of the 17k and have 38k in cash. I could use that money to pay off my debt and my gfs high interest loans while I go through school. I should have another job sometime late this summer if all goes well. She has an OK job as a nurse but is willing to work overtime to help pay the bills so I can do this.

I know it is probably best to leave the money in my retirement since it will grow, but the idea of not getting that until I'm 60 is hard. Once I'm on a physicians salary, I can save much more aggressively and taking it out now would help the stress of our lives while I am in school.

Any advice is appreciated. Oh, by the way, I am 30. Am I doing the math correct that if I leave $62,000 in retirement and get 7% return for 30 years, I will have turned that money into ~$472,000?",finance

personalfinance,Having trouble finding a solution for my overwhelming debt.,"Hey PF! My husband and I own a company together, and we work from home. I utilize mint, however all it really shows me is that we spend more than we make. I am 23 years old, and my credit is less than 600 (but it's going up). I have never had a late payment, but I have such a high credit card utilization, and over 30 inquiries, so my score isn't great. My husbands credit isn't much better. I have considered a debt consolidation loan, but since about ½ of the credit cards that we have maxed out are not in my name, I don't qualify because I 'do not have enough debt'. (We have a few cards in a friends name, and also a relatives name. I am an authorized user, however the debt is solely mine.)


**On average, we bring in $9,000 a month, before expenses.** (The merchant/business loan mentioned below takes 14% of everything we charge until we pay it off. So of the $9,000 avg, we really get $7,500, and so on)


Our expenses per month are as follows: 


**Rent $1800** (includes all utilities.. Also I want to mention that we have tried to find a cheaper place to rent, or a smaller place, or a place that is further away, but we have not been able to find anything. Most places don't include utilities, so that $1,250 for a 1/1 turns into $1600. We also have a 30 lb rescue dog, and many places won't allow a dog over 20 lbs. We currently have a 2/3 and a large yard, with a land lord that lets us pay rent late, so I don't see us finding a better place to live, for the price we pay. We signed paperwork saying we would be here for at least 5 more months, also.)


**Cell Phone $250** (this is from having a few upgrades over time, we are still making payments on 3 phones)


**Credit cards $700** (I am currently paying the minimums on all of them, however the one with the highest interest rate (36%) is being paid double the minimum, or more if we can spare it. Overall there is about $10,000 in credit card debt.)


**Personal Loans $600** a month (after this month that will drop to $300 for 3 months, then it'll be paid off.)


**Merchant/Business Loan $1600** (we still owe $4,000.)


**Car Payment $300** (we share one car)


**Car Insurance $300**


**Health Insurance $325** (for us, and our baby)


**Business Bills $4000** (Leads, software, internet, phone system)


**That's $9,500**, and I haven't included gas, groceries, or things like laundry detergent/cleaning supplies that are needed just once ever few months. We also owe my parents $5,000, however they haven't asked for that yet, so I would say that's on the back burner for now.

I want to clarify – we have not went 'out' but once in 4 months, which is fine – we realize we can't afford to, but I don't want anyone to think we are spending money on 'fun'. We also haven't had to spend money on diapers, because I received so many from my baby shower, but that will end soon. 

By working from home, we are able to save money on childcare (we have a 4 month old), we are able to cook all of our meals (we do not eat out), and we spend almost nothing on gas. We have considered side jobs, like UBER or PostMates, but the time that it would take away from our business would leave us even further in the negative. 


Ideally, we open an office.... but that requires money. At the very least, we'd like to hire 1-2 more people. A lot of what we spend on the business is the system, bond, and load board. That would NOT increase by hiring more people. It would actually increase profits, after their expenses. I just can't seem to find anyone that wants to work from home and takes to the industry well enough to succeed.

personalfinance,"Company made a mistake on taxes, what are my options?","When I filed my W2 for this company I put in a small extra amount to withhold from each paycheck, but when the company filed it in their system they messed up and ONLY withheld that amount for federal taxes.

I now owe about $10,000 in taxes for this year as a result.

Since the company overpaid me due to this I realize they probably don't owe me anything extra to cover the mistake, but I didn't allocate the extra money to cover this since I didn't expect that I would need it. The company has offered to pay the money up front then withhold a smaller amount from every paycheck for 2 years to cover it but I'm worried if I end up leaving the company they'll withhold my entire final paycheck and ask for the remaining balance up front.

At this point I'm thinking I'm best off paying what I can out of pocket and setting up a payment plan for the rest with the IRS, but I wanted to check here to see if this is my best option. Even with being paid extra, it's incredibly frustrating to have filled out my W2 correctly and have the company mess it up, I would much rather have been paid less and not owed all of this at the end out of nowhere.",finance

personalfinance,"Major upcoming expenses (kitchen Reno, exterior siding, and new car). Need financial advice.","Hello all,

This is my first post on this sub so my apologies in advance if I did not follow the rules. 

Anyway, about me: I am 30 years old making 65K a year at my job. I bought my house 4 years ago (and live with my wife) and have done some big projects. We renovated the bathroom, had furnace/AC installed for central air and some other small projects. All of those had been paid off with my own money. 

Here's my current dilemma: 

1) The exterior siding on my house is falling apart. The previous owner who lived here installed it on his own using the cheapest quality and it wasn't done right. I had a contractor from Lowe's visit this morning to inspect it and he gave me a quote of 15-17K which includes cost of all materials, labor, etc. We absolutely need to have the siding redone because there are issues with mold, insects, and insulation. Lowe's offers financing options such as 24 month interest free, 36 mo at 3.99% interest, 48 mo at 5.99% and 60 mo at 7.99%. No minimum down payment upfront. 

2) We have also had a few contractors take a look at the kitchen. Our fridge is leaking water and appliances such as dishwasher and oven are not working as well. We want to completely gut the kitchen and remodel with new appliances, cabinets, counter tops, etc. The low end estimate was about 12-15K and high end was 30-35K. It just depends on what we want to do and the material that we buy. We do need to renovate at some point but it's not as important as the siding at this time. 

3) My car is old and falling apart. I've had to pay thousands in repairs over the years. I just got new brakes and tires but it has about 150K miles. I'd like to get a new car but my current one is fine as of right now. 

I have 25K in savings and 102K in my retirement account. I am not touching that because of huge penalty for early withdrawal. I do not want to spend my entire savings account because I'd like to have some on hand for emergencies (ex: our hot water tank broke last month and I had to pay 1.2K for it). My wife has 13K in savings. I did talk to my bank (Berkshire) about some financing options and they do offer personal loans but the interest rate is high I'm sure. I don't think I'd quality for home equity since I have not paid 20% of my mortgage yet. 

What is the best way to approach this from a financial perspective? What types of loans are best? Should I finance through a bank or through the contractor (ex: Lowe's)? Hoping to get some advice from those who have experience taking on big projects like these.

Emergency fund:

I have $12.5k in the bank.

4.66% -&gt; 13,087.26

4.29% -&gt; 12,803.38

3.40% -&gt; 3,564.39

Total = 39,387.8

&amp;nbsp;

$20k car loan at 0.9%

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


Usually the IRA seems marginal because 4.66% debt seems substantial, and I’m inclined to smash at the loans. However, 2016 is a low earning year compared to what I’m expecting from here on out. With that in mind, does it make sense to max out Roth IRA? I doubt traditional would make sense, but please let me know if I’m missing something with respect to traditional vs Roth.

It looks like I can max Roth and pay off 6.8% debt with $9428 (5500 + 15% tax on 5500 + 3103). That would make things kinda tight for one month with respect to my emergency fund, but worst case I can pull out of Roth penalty free from what I’ve read.

Does this make sense? Am I thinking about this correctly? Are there any big holes in my thought process?

This was a lot to keep track of and write down, so please let me know if I left out any useful information that would paint a more clear picture of my financial situation.",finance

personalfinance,"The year of the credit rating, my plan to help our score.","Situation: Wife and I have ""fair"" credit rating.  We just closed on a house and I wasn't thrilled with the interest rate.  It wasn't terrible but it could have been better.  My wife couldn't even be put on the mortgage. I regret not putting in the time before buying a house to get our finances in order and improve our credit ratings. I've made a plan to increase our credit rating.

I'd like your input.  My wife and I are pretty young still and (clearly) not great at finances.  Do you think this will help our score?

This is us: We have about 13k in credit card debt, 55k in student loans, and now zero savings because we spent it all on the down payment.  I make about 115k, 145k with bonuses. Wife stays at home with the kids.

The plan: 

Credit Cards: My company is moving us to the middle of nowhere so we're get a generous bonus.  I plan on using that to pay off all of our credit card debt.  I will then close all of our credit cards except one (or I'm debating closing all of them and getting an airline card now that we'll have to fly to see family).  This credit card will be designated for netflix (monthly bill to keep the card active) and any large purchases (appliances, landscaping, etc).  This will be paid off every month and will not carry a balance.  We will have less credit card debt and won't be carrying such a high balance any more. Should be a positive for our score.

Car Loan: I have been riding my bike to work but that will end with the move.  We'll have to buy a second car.  We plan on throwing about 17-19k toward a new car (which we will own for its lifetime) and taking a loan out for the rest (~10k).  I'm hoping a car loan will help the credit score by showing that we can make monthly payments on time.

Mortgage: While our interest rate is higher than I hoped for, the monthly payment will be less then our current rent.  I assume a mortgage (as long as you pay it every month) will help our credit score out.

If we do this I expect our monthly debt payments will decrease, essentially switching out the credit card debt for a smaller car loan.  Our savings we can build back up fairly quickly with our previous budget.

My work is giving another very generous bonus to people who stay out in the middle of nowhere, which I can expect in a year. Maybe I'll pay off the car loan then or a large chunk of the student loans, or both.

From my understanding I should be trying to pay off the loan with the highest interest rate first then focus on the other loans. As I was fortunate enough to receive some scholarships and financial assistance from my parents throughout school my student loans are quite small. Below are my questions and some basic info on my finances.

Questions:

1) Does anyone have advice for how to approach paying the loans below? I could easily pay off the bank link of credit within the first month of graduation as they will want their money soon before they close the student line of credit. Before the 6 month grace period before payments start I could pay the federal student loan in full and not pay any interest. All the advice I have read is to focus on the loan with the highest interest first.


2) Should I create my emergency fund as soon as possible and defer extra payments to my debt in order to do this? My job and living arrangements are stable but I can’t predict the future.


**Position**:
Full time
Benefits after 6 months
2 weeks vacation
$48k/year (CAD) salary 
~22% Deducted for income tax, insurance, ect
~$3120 after deductions

**Savings**:

Savings Account: ~$2000 (Have been dipping into this to live since my summer job ended)

RRSP: $4000 (From previous contributions, could be for a house downpayment)

TFSA: $1000 (From work during high school, tried not to touch it yet, could be the start to my emergency fund)

**Loans:**

Bank Line of Credit: $1000 @ 4%

Provincial Student Loan: $3300 @ 0%, payments ($75/month) start Oct 1, 2017

Federal Student Loan: $4300  @ 2%, payments ($75/month) start Oct 1, 2017

Car Loan: $13,000 @ 7.49%, $211/month 

**Budget: (Monthly)**

Bills: $200 (Hydro, gas, water, internet, cell - based on data)

Food: $390 (~$13/day based on average data)

Transportation: $580 (Insurance, car loan, gas, misc repairs)

Rent: ~$500 (My half of rent assuming $1k/month, worst case)

Personal: ~$85 (Hair cut, misc medicine, toiletries, pets (2 cats))

Entertainment: $50 (Varies depending on the month. Movies, events, ect)

Total: $1805/month

So if my math is correct I have $1300/month to contribute to my student loans / car loan and begin saving for my future. I would like to have $5000 as my emergency fund that ideally I never have to touch. Future goals include buying a home, getting engaged (woo!) and my girlfriend buying a new vehicle within the next 12 months that will be mostly her car but both will contribute to. Saving to buy a house will take highest priority once the loans are paid off, but that could be another post.

Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated :)",finance
personalfinance,Fedloan Servicing Referring My Fiancée to Dept of Treasury,"Hoping someone here can provide some advice.  My fiancée has approx $150k in federal loans (pharmacist) that she has been paying on via IBR for about 2 years in hopes of qualifying for PSLF (works at a non-profit hospital as a resident).  This past October she sent in the necessary paperwork to recertify her income for IBR.  In January, her payment ballooned from $216 to $1,600.  We called them and they said they made an error processing her paperwork so her account automatically reverted to the standard 10-yr repayment.  After we called they were able to correct the error and revise her income based repayment back down, but only beginning in February.  They told us she still owed them $1,600 for January.  Additionally, when you transfer out of IBR, all of the interest on your account capitalizes ($5k in this case).  After arguing with them, they told us to just pay the reduced payment ($216) and then put in a request for review to the Dept of Treasury to sort it all out.  It's been 3 months and we haven't heard from the Dept of Treasury.  Her account is showing that it's 65 days past due and that $1384 is still due.  Her school has frozen her transcripts which she may need for job purposes and Fed Loans is threatening to report her to the credit bureaus even though it's their mistake!  Every time we call they tell us to just keep waiting to hear from the Treasury and that we can go into forbearance in the meantime.  From what I've gathered, our options are to either just pay the $1,384 and then fight for the reversal of the interest that's already been capitalized, or go into forbearance continue to capitalize interest and hope we eventually get contacted by Treasury to sort it all out (but not be out of $1,384 in the meantime).  Has anyone been though something similar?  I'm not sure what the best course of action is.  I've considered filing a complaint through the CFPB but am guessing they will just blame the Dept of Treasury and say it's not their issue anymore.  What would you do?",finance
personalfinance,"[Taxes] Feds taxing net income, State taxing gross","Looking over my Maryland W2 today (hey! ahead of schedule this year!) I saw that the federal tax is based on my net income, while the state is based on the gross. 

My travel and per diem reimbursements are included in my gross pay. Am I really going to have to pay state taxes for getting reimbursed money that I was already taxed on? Or is this an error on my W2? 

Thanks for any advice! You guys/gals are awesome!",finance

stocks,Current market indicators,"I'm starting to think the market is becoming a bit frothy. 

Bond Prices and Equities have been moving in tandem for a while now despite historically being inverse indicators of each other.  If the current trend continues and bonds sell off as Bill Gross has forecasted will happen if rates continue to rise then this bodes poorly for equities.  

S&amp;P market cap/GDP: better know as the buffet valuation indicator- is suggesting the S&amp;P is overpriced compared to almost any other time in history, excluding the .com bubble and the housing crisis

Commodities typically move in tandem with the equity market however as of lately they have diverged noticeably.  Gold is one of the winning commodities during the poor performance and this suggests that equities could correct downward in the near future. 

Trading accounts are heavily margined- more so than prior to 2008- and while some analysts see this as a sign of confidence, I see the massive leverage as a sure sign of complacency.  Such a large margin value could easily create massive sell pressure if equity prices start to drop and margin calls become more frequent. 

US GDP is still under 3% and by recent measure it doesn't look like we're going to accelerate that growth anytime soon.  Corporate earnings are reason to celebrate however. 

Any Trump trade euphoria should be tapered now that it's becoming clear Congress is as useless as ever.  Not to mention the likely mental issues our current president has- be it narcissism or senility I'm not quite sure yet.  In any case, I see his main goal is to spend more which our current debt load just cannot support.  In other words, I see a lame duck in office right now. This is political opinion, but as the reality of the administration's process starts to show I become more confident in my opinion. 

Stocks like SNAP, TSLA, and NFLX are all companies with little to show on the books to justify their insane market valuation and momentum despite P/E, P/S and bottom line results. I'm sure there are other equities trading divorced from fundamentals but these three are especially popular lately.  I see heavily leveraged retail investors putting borrowed money into highly speculative companies, but maybe I'm just overly pessimistic.  

Auto loans, student loans and personal loans are all showing accelerating delinquencies suggesting that we may see another sub-prime lending crisis with an epicenter on ages 25-35: the prime growth drivers in the economy.  These young adults will be so swamped with debt they will struggle to afford a home, yet alone a car and family or continued education.  I personally have family with over 100k in debt and she has yet to begin paying any of it despite being 26 years old.  

This market cycle is approaching the late stages of expansion in my opinion.  I see the labor market stronger than ever, home prices are near record levels again, consumers are borrowing heavily again, and the Federal Reserve is tightening at an accelerated pace.  Very recently one of the voting members stated he is a proponent of 4 hikes in 2017. 

It's becoming harder and harder for me to be optimistic about future returns until some of these observations are remedied.  I don't suggest selling everything tomorrow but I do encourage awareness.  5-10% price discounts are common in a healthy market and in the event sell pressure returns to the market I do suggest taking some profits and looking at defensive plays.",finance
Banking,[Question] Why do the [big banks] in the [US] seem to offer worse terms than local banks?,"It seems that the big banks have account maintenance fees like I've never encountered at local banks. And lower interest rates, too. 

In most areas of the consumer economy, it seems local is usually more expensive. Why does banking seem backwards in this regard?",finance
personalfinance,Sally Mae Help,"Hi Everyone,

I know there has been many sally mae questions but I couldnt locate this situation... My fiance has a Sally mae loan that she owes more on than what she originally took the loan out for although she paid $25 per month throughout school with occasional payments of 100/150 a month. She always makes her payment of $366 per month as per Sally mae but they are changing her interest rate seemingly at will and she cannot afford to pay more. What can we do?",finance
